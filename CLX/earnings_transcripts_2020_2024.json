At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference.\nLisah Burhan: Thanks, Hillary. Welcome everyone and thank you for joining us today. We hope you and your family are safe and well. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, our Chair and CEO; Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO; and Linda Rendle, our President and CEO-Elect. Before we go through our Q4 and full year results, I'd like to turn it over to Benno to say a few words about the leadership changes announced today. Benno?\nBenno Dorer: Thank you, Lisa, and hello everyone. You've likely seen this morning's announcement about my decision to step down from my role as CEO. With our current President, Linda Rendle, being named my successor, effective September 14. I will continue to serve as Executive Chair of the Board. It has been my great privilege to carry forward the legacy of generations of strong Clorox leaders in my pursuit of Good Growth. Growth that is profitable, sustainable and responsible. The idea of Good Growth was created based on the very strong belief, that companies can deliver great results the right way, and that's serving employees, communities and the planet as a whole is as important as serving shareholders, and that's how we generate profit matters. I am proud that as a company, we have always been strategy led and committed to our values, both of which have guided us successfully in making the right choices on behalf of our shareholders and all of our stakeholders. After 15 terrific years at the company, I am particularly grateful for my teams of 8,800 strong, and especially for the current executive team. I have great confidence in them. I also want to thank the Board of Directors for their support of a guy who ventured out of a small town in the German Black forest, 35 years ago to pursue a dream that let me to places and allowed me to do things I could not have possibly imagined. My thanks also go out to everyone in the investment community around the world for your support, helpful perspective and of course, your candor, which I look forward to momentarily. I appreciate all of you, and I particularly appreciate the wonderful friendships that I've been able to make along the way. On September 14, I could not be more pleased to hand over the reins to Linda and I look forward to supporting her and her team. I've worked with Linda for 13 of her 17 years with the company. She is an exceptional leader, with an outstanding track record, the right leader for this great company and I cannot wait for all of you to be able to see what she can do. Linda is joining us today and will participate in Q&A and also say a few words towards the end of the call. Thank you. It's been an honor and a privilege. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Lisah.\nLisah Burhan: Thanks, Benno. I've really enjoyed working with you since I started at Clorox on the Glad business more than 15 years ago. And I look forward to working closely with Linda as well. A few reminders before we go into results. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including statements related to the expected or potential impact of COVID-19. These statements are based on management's current expectation, but may differ from actual results or outcomes. In addition, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section, which identify various factors that could affect such forward-looking statements and the non-GAAP financial information section, including the tables that reconcile non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, both of which are located at the end of today's earnings release, which has also been posted on our website and filed with the SEC. Turning to today's discussion of our results. I'll start by covering our top line commentary as usual, with highlights in each of our segments. Kevin will then address our financial results as well as outlook for the fiscal year 2021. Finally Benno will offer his perspective and we'll close with Q&A. For the total company, Q4 sales increased 22%, reflecting double-digit growth in all four reportable segments. Full year sales were up 8%. I'll now go through our results by segment. As you may have seen in our press release, we have made some changes to our reportable segments with a newly formed Health and Wellness segment replacing our Cleaning segment, and the realignment of several business units. In our health and -- Health and Wellness segment, Q4 sales were up 33% for the quarter and full year sales grew 14%. Cleaning which merges Home Care and Laundry is our largest business unit in the company representing about 30% of total company sales in FY '20. The business had another quarter of double-digit sales growth behind continued elevated demand across the portfolio. While we've been able to add significant capacity, demand still far exceeds supply, leading to continued out of stocks for many products. This coupled with our focus on assortment simplification to increase output and our prioritization of Healthcare facilities is impacting our market share and distribution points especially in tracked channels. We expect to improve our share of assortment over time as we expand production. On a full year basis Cleaning sales also grew by double-digits behind a very strong back half performance. Our data continues to show that the majority of sales increased we've seen since March has been from new users, leading to an unprecedented growth in household penetration for the Clorox brand. We're excited to continue to drive our categories and maintain momentum by increasing our investments in brand building and innovation. However, our most urgent priority remains to continue aggressively expanding our production capacity to meet consumer demand, which we anticipate will remain elevated for some time. These investments support our IGNITE Strategy to strengthen our core and continue to leverage the Health and Wellness megatrend at a time when our brands are more relevant than ever. Our Professional products business, making up about 7% of total company sales in FY '20, also has double-digit sales growth for -- in Q4, supported by strong shipments across all of our disinfecting platforms. Full year sales also grew by double-digits, fueled by an exceptional performance in the back half. As a reminder, the main source of revenue for our professional products comes from providing commercial cleaning and disinfecting solutions to both the health care and janitorial channels. Our broad range of solutions include platform such as the Clorox Total 360 system, which uses an electrostatic technology to deliver disinfectants to large hard-to-reach areas as well as Clorox germicidal bleach, Clorox hydrogen peroxide disinfecting cleaners and Clorox disinfecting wipes. We believe our brands has broader reach beyond the channels we're in today, and that this business will continue to have significant growth opportunities. We're proud that our products can help support public health and we're excited about the recent strategic partnerships we've established with Uber Technologies, United Airlines, AMC Theaters and Cleveland Clinic. Lastly, within the Health and Wellness segment, our Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements business combined RenewLife and Nutranext representing about 4% of the total company sales in FY 20. Sales in our VMS business decreased by double-digits this quarter. There were two main drivers for the decline. First, our Neutranext brands continue to experience a supply disruption related to COVID-19 in a third-party fulfillment center that prevented us from meeting what has been a healthy demand. We're currently transitioning to a new provider and expect the situation to be fully resolved in the fall. Second, Renewlife based ongoing category and competitive challenges. Looking forward, our full brand relaunch remains on track for FY '21, and we're continuing to work on partnering with retailers to reinvigorate the category. Full year sales for the VMS business also declined double-digits due to similar drivers as in Q4. Turning to the Household segment. Q4 sales were up 17%, reflecting growth across all three businesses, and full year sales grew 1%. Glad sales were up by double-digits in Q4, behind strong demands for our products as consumers continue to stay at home. We're also pleased to see share growth in our Glad trash bag segment, driven mainly by strong innovation. We launched a new experiential Glad ForceFlex Trash Bags featuring unique fragrances and colors in Q3 and early reception has been positive. For the full year, Glad sales grew slightly, reflecting sequential improvement throughout the year, ending with a very strong Q4. We're focused on building on this momentum and investing further behind our differentiated platform with more innovation plan for FY '21. Grilling sales grew by double-digits in Q4, fueled by strong consumption both due to increased grilling occasion among existing users as well as new users entering the category. We're also pleased to see share and household penetration growth this quarter, supported by our new Kingsford strategy. Collaboration with our retail partners has been strong and growth this quarter was broad based. Our Q4 performance was especially notable, because it was delivered without aggressive holiday price discounting during the peak Grilling season. The Kingsford pellet innovation continues to build distribution and share, and we're excited to lean in further to invest in long-term profitable category growth. For the full year, we saw solid sales growth as our efforts to turnaround the business started to bear fruit and consumption increased strongly in the back half. Cat Litter sales grew in Q4, driven by innovation and strong online shipments, partially offset by lower consumption in traditional channels following consumer pantry loading that we saw last quarter. For the full year, Litter sales grew behind strong back half performance, partially offset by a more challenging, front half performance as we lap the initial pipeline shipments of Fresh Step Clean Paws. Clean Paws continue to perform very well, with strong growth in its third year after launch and we'll keep investing in this innovation platform in FY '21. We're also encouraged by the strong start of Fresh Step gain original scented litter with the a power for Breeze, which just launched in June. In our Lifestyle segment, sales grew 16% and full year sales grew 10%. Brita sales were up by double-digits in Q4, behind continued elevated consumption of our water filtration systems and filters. This unprecedented level of demand started in Q3 and continued in Q4, resulting in out-of-stocks that impacted our share this quarter. Full year sales also grew by double-digits, reflecting healthy momentum in the first half and heightened consumption in the back half. We're encouraged by the fact that the majority of its recent sales have come from new household, just like what we see -- what we've been seeing in many of our other categories. Our priorities going forward will be to increase supply. Convert these new users to loyal consumers and continue to support our brand with a focus message around Brita's value proposition during this recession. The Food business saw a double-digit sales growth in Q4, mainly behind very strong consumption of Hidden Valley Ranch bottle dressing benefiting from more at-home eating occasions. The brand grew share for the 22nd consecutive quarter and increased household penetration. Full year sales increased behind solid growth in the first half and elevated consumption in the back half. We'll continue to invest to drive brand awareness and trial behind our innovation and capitalize on this momentum as consumers are eating at home over an extended period of time, especially during the recession. Burt's Bees sales were down by double-digits this quarter, as the overall category consumption was negatively impacted by ongoing store closures and stay-at-home measures. Regardless of the decline in Q4, this business had solid sales growth for the full year, reflecting strong growth behind innovation and enhanced leadership in lip balm. In Lip Care, Burt's Bees grew share for the 22nd consecutive quarter and widened its market leadership status as the number one overall lip balm in the US. While we expect the category wide challenges to persist in the short-term, consumer preferences for natural products and more specifically Burt's Bees remain unchanged. And we're confident in the brand's long-term growth trajectory. Our FY '21 plan includes a robust innovation line up, including a new squeezy lip color lines that launched in July and CBD personal care products launching in the fall. Lastly, turning to International. Q4 sales grew 12%, mainly driven by continued elevated demand for our cleaning and disinfecting products as well as essential household products. Sales were also impacted by unfavorable foreign currency headwinds of about 12%, partially offset by the benefits of pricing that was implemented before the onset of the pandemic. For the full year, sales were up 5%, reflecting about 10 points of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Additionally, it's worth noting that profit for International was down this quarter due to costs associated with the product we call improved [ph]. Like other businesses, where there has been increases in household penetration during this period, we'll be focused on converting those new households into loyal consumers. We're also continuing to explore international opportunities and today announced the acquisition of a majority stake in our long-standing joint venture in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In its long 50-year history, this business has offered consumers in the Gulf region, a range of cleaning and disinfecting products. During that time, they have shown not only steady growth, but also strong profitability. Consistent with our IGNITE Strategy goal, this acquisition will help drive long-term profitable growth in our international segment. Now, I'll turn it over to Kevin, who will discuss our Q4 and full year financial performance for FY '20 as well as our outlook for FY '21.\nKevin Jacobsen: Thank you, Lisah. And thank you everyone for joining us today. We hope you and your families are well. I'm proud of a very strong performance in Q4 and our overall results for fiscal year '20. As we continue to navigate the global pandemic, our team has been unwavering in our efforts to maximize supply disinfectants and other essential products needed by Healthcare workers, consumers and our communities. In the fourth quarter, COVID-19 continued to have a significant impact on our results. In addition to double-digit sales growth in all four of our reportable segments, we delivered our seventh consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion and another quarter of strong cash flow, all of which contributed to strong fiscal year '20 performance. As you saw in our press release, we are providing a financial outlook today, because, despite the increased challenge of anticipating how the full year will play out, we believe that in this period of heightened uncertainty, it's important to provide investors with as much transparency and perspective as possible. That said, we anticipate a higher level of variability than what you might normally expect, as the results will be heavily influenced by the depth and the duration of the ongoing health crisis. I'll comment more on our outlook shortly. Turning to our fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter sales were up 22%, driven by 21 points of volume growth and 3 points of favorable price mix, partially offset by 2 points of FX headwinds. Gross margin for the quarter, increased 170 basis points to 46.8% compared to 45.1% for the year ago quarter. Fourth quarter gross margin included the benefits of higher volume as well as 170 basis points from cost savings, and 120 basis points from favorable mix. These factors were partially offset by higher manufacturing and logistics cost which included temporary spending related to increasing our production capacity and expediting transportation of our products. Fourth quarter gross margin also reflected ongoing cost favorability in commodities, more than offset by the impact from foreign currency headwinds. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales came in at 14.1% compared to 13.3% in the year ago quarter. This higher rate primarily reflects increased year-over-year incentive compensation, consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels as a percentage of sales came in at about 11%, about 0.5 point higher than the year ago quarter. We're spending for our US retail business coming in at about 12% of sales for the second consecutive quarter. For additional perspective, we invested $70 million more in the back half of fiscal year '20, compared to the same period in fiscal year '19, reflecting aggressive investments consistent with our ambition to accelerate long-term profitable growth. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate was about 22% compared to about 17% in the year ago quarter, due to lapping tax benefits in the year ago period. Net of all these factors, we delivered diluted net earnings per share of $2.41 versus $1.88 in the year ago quarter, an increase of 28%. Commenting briefly on our fiscal year results, I'm pleased with the progress we made in our core business prior to the impact of COVID-19, plus our teams dedication to respond to unprecedented demand resulting in very strong results for fiscal year '20. We delivered sales growth of 8% and on our organic basis grew sales 10%. Gross margin expansion of 170 basis points versus fiscal year '19, supported by strong volume growth and another year of robust cost savings. These factors enabled us to close out the overall fiscal year delivering diluted EPS of $7.36, an increase of 16%. As you saw in our press release, fiscal year '20 net cash provided by operations was $1.5 billion versus $992 million in fiscal year '19, an increase of 56%. Our accelerating cash flow and strong balance sheet, give us the flexibility to continue investing behind long-term growth opportunities. Now I'll provide more perspective on our outlook. Starting with our key assumptions for fiscal year '21. First, we expect the impact of COVID-19 to be with us for the bulk of fiscal year '21 resulting in our expectation for ongoing elevated global demand for our Cleaning and Disinfecting products, particularly through the first half of our fiscal year, Next, we expect the US and many parts of the world to face an ongoing recession that will reduce consumers' disposable spending and increase the importance of providing superior consumer value. And we plan to aggressively invest behind the momentum we're seeing in our global portfolio, including increasing production capacity to address ongoing elevated demand for our products. Our outlook also assumes minimal disruption through extended supply chain over the course of the fiscal year. And finally, we are assuming about a 40% devaluation of the Argentine peso which is materially less than the potential devaluation if the currency moves to the country's parallel rate. For our fiscal year sales outlook. We expect fiscal year sales to be flat to up low-single-digits, reflecting our expectation for continued elevated demand for the first half of the fiscal year and a deceleration in the back half as we lap the initial spike in demand from COVID-19. As you saw in our press release, we have acquired a majority stake in our Saudi Arabia joint venture, which we anticipate will contribute about 1 point of growth to our fiscal year '21 sales. We expect this to be offset by about 1 point of foreign exchange headwinds primarily in Argentina. On an organic sales basis, our outlook assumes flat to low single-digit growth. For additional perspective on our fiscal year sales expectations, we anticipate strong growth in the front half of the fiscal year, including double-digit increases in Q1, although decelerating from the 19% sales growth we delivered in the back half of fiscal year 20. In the back half of fiscal year 21, while we expect strong performance relative to our pre-pandemic sales levels, we expect sales to decline as we lapped the initial impact from COVID-19 in the year ago period. We expect fiscal year selling and administrative expenses to come in at about 14% of sales as we continue to invest aggressively in long-term growth initiatives. Additionally, we are increasing investments in our brands to address this unprecedented demand for our products from existing and new consumers with plans to increase advertising spending to about 11% of sales, to build loyalty with many new consumers entering our categories for the first time, in addition to continuing to deliver superior consumer value, which is more critical than ever as we navigate the global recession. As I mentioned, we will continue to invest in expanding our production capacity to address our expectation for ongoing elevated demand for our products and support new longer term growth opportunities. In the near term, we will continue to expand our use of third-party manufacturers to increase our production capacity, while this comes at a higher cost we believe is an important action to take while our internal expansion efforts come online. We expect our fiscal year tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 23%, closer to our long-term tax rate assumption. Net of these factors, we expect fiscal year '21 diluted EPS to be down mid-single-digits to up mid-single-digits. Our fiscal year diluted EPS outlook includes an estimated contribution of $0.45 to $0.53 from our increased stake in our Saudi Arabia joint venture, primarily driven by a one-time non-cash gain associated with a fair market value adjustment to our previously held stake in the joint venture. This one-time gain is projected to be recognized in Q1 and on a full year basis offset by our expectations for a high tax rate and foreign currency headwinds for the company. Before I turn it over to Benno, I'd like to reiterate how proud I am of the Clorox team for delivering strong performance in fiscal year '20 and the role we're playing to help fight this global pandemic. Our Disinfecting products continue to support public health and other essential products continue to make a difference in the day-to-day lives of people as they spend more time at home. Consumer interest in our categories has never been higher. And a robust fiscal year sales results, provide a strong foundation for ongoing momentum. We certainly plan to build on that by aggressively investing in our IGNITE Strategy to drive long-term shareholder value. And finally, I also want to say how much I've enjoyed working with Benno over the years. I'm also looking forward to Clorox' next chapter with Linda, who will be a strong CEO for the company. And with that, I'll turn it over to Benno.\nBenno Dorer: Thanks, Kevin. Here are my three key messages for our Q4 and fiscal year '20 results. First, I continue to be proud of our people's leadership and commitment to serving public health and supporting our consumers and communities during this global health crisis. The dedication has led to outstanding Q4 results, contributing to very strong performance in fiscal year '20. I'm pleased we delivered fiscal year 2020 sales growth of 8% reflecting growth in all reportable segments and organic sales were up 24% [ph], our highest organic sales growth on record. We also delivered totally company gross margin expansion reflecting gross margin increases in all four segments for the fiscal year, supported by the strength of our volume results and robust cost savings. And even with significant advertising investments, we were able to expand fiscal year EBIT margin by 110 basis points. And we delivered a 16% increase in diluted earnings per share for fiscal year '20. While our financials for the quarter and full year were very strong, there's one area of ongoing focus for us, keeping up with continued elevated demand. We take very seriously the important role we play in this pandemic [indiscernible] and customers are counting on all our products. Frankly, we thought we would be in a better position by now, but demand in Q4 exceeded our expectations. We're certainly not at all happy with our service levels for our retail customers on many products, as demand for our products exceeded our own expectations in the face of this persistent pandemic. We have a high sense of urgency on this with all hands on deck. We're accessing third-party supply sources and focusing our manufacturing on those products that can be supplied more quickly. And we are ahead of plan on this. Since Q3, we were able to bring on more than 10 new suppliers to help us maximize our output, not just for disinfecting products but for other parts of our portfolio too. For disinfecting products, we're continuing to run our plants 24/7 and we'll be bringing more disinfecting capacity online in the mid-term. With all the levers we're pulling to expand output, I am confident in our ability to do better for our customers and consumers. Before I go on to my next message, I'd like to say again, how much I've valued the commitment of Clorox people and their contributions to our Q4 and fiscal year results. Our team of 8,800 strong continues to step up every day to contribute to our efforts of supporting our consumers, customers and communities. My second message is this. The fundamentals of our business are strong. Given the progress on our core business, which contributed to our overall fiscal year '20 results and gives us momentum for fiscal year '21. I feel good about the fundamentals of our business and the continued progress on our core. In fiscal year '20, incremental sales from innovation exceeded the company's historical average. As you've heard from Lisah, we introduced a number of exciting products in fiscal year '20 and continue to see growth from big innovation platforms. Our relentless focus on delivering superior consumer value through market leading innovation continues to differentiate our products and brands. And I'm proud that in fiscal year '20, the percentage of our US portfolio seen by consumers as delivering superior value has risen to an all-time high, positioning our brands well in this recession. In Q4, we also had more than 90% of our US portfolio at growing or stable household penetration, the strongest results we've achieved to date. I'm also pleased that total company market share in tracked channels grew. And our market shares in the fast e-commerce -- fast growing e-commerce channel continued to grow as well supported by increase in digital advertising. After fiscal year '20, our sales in the e-commerce channel now represents about 12% of total company sales, compared to 8% in fiscal year 2019, and well ahead of our plan. Results like these demonstrate we made the right choice to lean into advertising investments in fiscal year '20 including spending about $70 million more in the back half of the fiscal year, compared to the same period in fiscal year '19. Importantly our progress against business fundamentals is setting us up well for fiscal year '21, and I feel confident about our ability to continue driving long-term momentum. And this leads me to my last message. We remain committed to building on this momentum for our global portfolio through strong investments to further strengthen our competitive position, grow our categories and deliver long-term shareholder value guided by our IGNITE Strategy. Clearly these are extraordinary times. So it's hard to anticipate what will happen even in the near-term future. We continue to believe COVID-19 will have lasting impacts on global consumer behavior and trends including how consumers engage in our categories and with our brands, leading to meaningful long-term growth potential for our company. And as people continue to navigate what looks to be a significant recession, we anticipate that pressures related to unemployment and discretionary spending will spotlight the need to focus on value. We also anticipate they will keep turning to trusted brands to help them and their families stay safe as well as to support the Health and Wellness on day-to-day needs. As Kevin noted, our fiscal year '21 earnings outlook reflects the significant volatility and uncertainty, and also deliberate and aggressive investments behind our global portfolio and longer term growth initiatives. During these uncertain times, we plan to play offense to grow sales in fiscal year '21 off of an elevated fiscal year '20 base. And we plan to continue investing in long-term value creation with a focus on our ambition to accelerate sales growth beyond the fiscal year. Here is what you can expect in fiscal year '21. We will plan to increase advertising to about 11% of sales. We will invest in innovating experiences behind brand purpose, frictionless shopping and sticky product innovation, including our strong innovation pipeline in fiscal year '21. We will increase capital spending to expand production capacity so that together with our customers, we can better meet consumer demand, particularly for disinfecting products, but also, so that we can begin to fully take advantage of the opportunity to support public health out of home. As you've likely seen, we've started collaborating with leading brands like Uber Technologies, United Airlines and AMC Theaters to support their efforts to keep their customers safe. And we recently announced our partnership with Cleveland Clinic, which brings together our respective capabilities and expertise to support public health as we all continue to face COVID-19. As a people centered company, everything we do through our IGNITE Strategy continues to be in service of delivering superior value, because now and longer term we know it's the key to keep winning with consumers. And of course, we'll continue to focus on growing our business the right way, committed to our values with ESG integrated in our business, so that we are also creating value for all of our stakeholders. We're proud that last week's Axios Harris Poll 100, a survey of about 35,000 Americans ranked The Clorox Company number one for corporate reputation in the US based on seven dimensions: trust, vision, growth, products, culture, ethics and citizenship. Now and in the future Clorox will remain focused on Good Growth. Growth that's profitable, responsible and sustainable. And with that let me turn it over to Linda.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks, Benno. And hello to everyone on the call today. First, let me start off by saying just how excited I am to be Clorox' next CEO. After 17 years with the company, what makes me most proud about taking the reins from Benno is that Clorox is truly a special company. We have iconic brands people love and a wonderful values-led team that takes to heart our role in making people's lives better. Second, I'm optimistic about the company's future and look forward to working with the executive team to accelerate growth. This is a pivotal time for the company and there is no better time to be CEO at Clorox. What's become even clearer during this pandemic is that we're a Health and Wellness company at heart. Whether through our disinfecting products that support public health, our Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements that enhance wellness, or other essential products that people count on for their families and homes, I firmly believe that our global portfolio of trusted brands is in a strong position to address the shifting consumer mindsets and behaviors related to health and wellbeing. What's also clear is that we have a big opportunity to build on our momentum from fiscal year '20 for long-term value creation. And we're investing behind this momentum to support our ambition to accelerate profitable growth in fiscal year '21 and beyond. And finally before we begin Q&A, I want to take the opportunity to thank Benno for his just terrific leadership as CEO. Under Benno's guidance, Clorox more than doubled total shareholder return by putting innovation front and center, recognizing it's critical role in differentiating our products and brands to deliver superior consumer value. By investing in digital consumer engagement as a means to interact with people on their terms and through more personal experiences, and by taking ESG to the next level, challenging each of us to demonstrate its value to our business and society. Benno talked earlier about our commitment to Good Growth. Growth, that's profitable, responsible and sustainable. What he didn't say is that he was the one who introduced this. It captures most simply what we're all about. Profitable growth achieved the right way for our consumers, our shareholders and society. I've been very fortunate to work closely with Benno over the years. He has been a great mentor, and I look forward to continuing to partner with him to drive the business when I step into my role as CEO. Operator, you may now open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question does come from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JP Morgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: All right. Thank you. And Linda congratulations on your promotion and Benno, thank you for the great leadership all these years and significant time from your business agenda. So with all investment community over the years. So it's good to see at Clorox [ph], that you likely have more time to dedicate to strategic topics way forward. So I wanted to -- if you can talk about a bit with those agreements and you or Linda with the 10 new production partners on board and also the partnership with the Cleveland Clinic and the business partners like Uber, United and AMC Theaters. So I was hoping you've seen size this opportunity. I understand it's now about 7% of your sales, but I remember being like just about 6% in the prior fiscal year. So if you can give us kind of idea how you can continue to outpace this growth. And if we -- with this debottlenecking capacity? And how we could be thinking of the B2B against the B2C going forward, that will be great. Thank you again, and congrats to both.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks, Andrea. I'll get us started here. So as Benno mentioned earlier, we're very serious about the role that we play in public health. And as we look at our cleaning and disinfecting portfolio, we see opportunity broadly in the US and International across several spaces and I'll outline high level what those are. The first is continuing to delight people with products in the retail space. We know that we are not able to meet the demands and that is priority number one is getting much supply as we possibly can into the retail space to ensure that consumers have products they need during this time. The same is true in our traditional professional business, which you highlighted is about 7% of sales in fiscal year '20 and has been a high single-digit grower for us over a number of years. So working on supply in both of those. With the opportunity that you highlighted is one that we're aggressively pursuing and that is the merger of those two areas. As people re-enter public life, they are looking to be reassured that the spaces they enter are clean and disinfected. And what they would be reassured by as a trusted brands like the brand Clorox, is to ensure that that space is clean. They have that reassurance in their mind. And we're helping businesses do is welcome people back, whether that would be their employees or their guests and by using and partnering with Clorox's protocols and brands. They can offer their guests that reassurance that the space is safe. That's how we're thinking about that broader what we're calling out of home opportunity. We staffed a dedicated team to go after these partnerships and have resulted in things like you highlighted with United Airlines, Cleveland Clinic, AMC Theaters and Uber Technologies. What will be really important for us moving forward though is getting supply. So these are in initial stages of agreements, and what we're looking for is increase supply before we continue to expand the test markets that we have today, but we're seeing very good consumer and business response in the initial days. And if you think about our B2C and B2B in total, I think the thing for us to consider is those lines will continue to blur as we move forward, and that's what we are really well suited to do with all of our technologies and capabilities.\nAndrea Teixeira: No, that's great. And can you also like the capacity growth, I think you exit the last quarter with growing like 20%. I see debottleneck your capacity, how you're tracking now as you exit the quarter?\nLinda Rendle: Yes. Our plan is on pace to increase supply versus what we committed in Q4, but what Benno highlighted is the key, the demand that we're seeing is significantly higher than we had expected in Q4, and we expect that demand to remain elevated as we head into fiscal year '21. Our increase that we were able to deliver on supply did support strong double-digit growth in our Cleaning businesses. But to be clear, we're not satisfied with our service levels right now, and we have the absolute highest urgency to improve. Some of the things we're pleased to see though and will give us confidence as we move into the fiscal year '21 is that our state -- our supply chain remains very stable. So we have had very few COVID related disruptions. We were able to bring on more than 10 new suppliers. The majority of those in disinfecting to help us to support the increase in demand. We had anticipated that some businesses would begin to recover quicker, and we have seen that in the case of bleach where in stock levels at retail are looking much stronger than they had been, despite the fact that we've been prioritizing Healthcare. And the key message for takeaway is we are aggressively investing to expand capacity. We are working across the entire supply chain all the way back into raw materials, up through manufacturing, packaging and conversion. And we expect sequential improvement in fiscal year '21 in meeting that increase in demand.\nAndrea Teixeira: That's great. Thank you again, and best of luck. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson of Citi.\nWendy Nicholson: Hi. Congratulations to both of you, and Benno we will miss you. My question had to do with advertising. I'm a little bit surprised that you're increasing or you're targeting right now sort of 100 basis point increase for fiscal '21, number one, because I assume as your revenues to those partners grow that's actually revenue that you don't need to spend advertising behind. And I know that's kind of a rounding your probably in the great scheme of things. But still that's a big increase. It would be the highest level of ad spending that we've seen in a long time for you. And it's coming at a time where you are having a hard time meeting demand. So I would buy Clorox Life, whether I saw an ad or not. So can you talk a little bit more about the decision to increase ad spending by that magnitude, maybe which businesses you're targeting it to, and whether this is a new level going forward that we should expect or is there something specific in 2021 that that's driving that increase? Thanks.\nBenno Dorer: Yes. Thank you, Wendy. What you should takeaway is that this is an aggressive investment that is into the momentum that we have in the business. It also signals confidence in our strategy. And of course, as always with our company that's done with an eye on the long- term. For us advertising sales promotion is not a quarterly expense, it's a long-term investment in the health of our brands. And while 10% continues to be the level long-term that we're comfortable with, we see a particular opportunity at this time to invest in this pivotal opportunity that we have for our company to accelerate growth. It will go into demand building across all businesses both in the core as well as in innovation. I mentioned earlier, we have a very strong innovation program, in spite of the supply challenges right now, that we have great confidence and we have so much opportunity ahead. So we feel like this is the right thing to. It is an investment in the long-term health of the business. And, if you look at the fundamental business drivers of our business; as I mentioned them in Q4 with rising market shares, with household penetration growing or stable in north of 90% of our US portfolio. With market shares growing in International, with further opportunity to build out our International business to serve more consumers in the face of the pandemic. With consumer value perception being at its all-time high with well north of 50% of our portfolio being seen as superior. All those things are particularly strong indicators of future business momentum. So, against all of that and in particular also with the looming recession, which we think is going to be significant and is perhaps underestimated or somewhat overlooked at this time, in particular here in the US, we think this is simply the right thing to do, and it's certainly part of our recession playbook that we've successfully apply once before about 11 years ago. So, we have great confidence in this choice as part of a long-term growth strategy for our company.\nWendy Nicholson: And specifically, just first half versus second half. so to those comments, specifically, if the economic environment really deteriorates is there a scenario where you would say, wow, these marketing dollars would be better spent in price rollbacks or promotional spending. How much of the ad spending itself are you expecting first half versus second half or kind of no difference?\nBenno Dorer: Typically we don't provide quarterly outlook. But it can certainly vary by quarter depending on, for instance, the timing of innovation launches. So you should expect that variation. Based on what we know today, even though you can never say never, right, in this business. But I cannot see us touch advertising sales promotion because like I said, it's not a tactical expense. It's an investment in long-term growth. So we will remain committed to spending the dollars. And frankly, if the recession gets worse, that's even more of a reason for us to spend in advertising sales promotion, in particular at this time, when people are looking at trusted brands to meet their needs. And as you know, we have many of those trusted brands that people rely on in particular doing a recession.\nWendy Nicholson: Got it. Thank you so much. And again, best of luck.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.\nNik Modi: Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. Benno kudos to you for a remarkable career, and Linda congrats on your appointment. The question I had was on capacity. And I guess Clorox, like most CPG companies is in a really tough spot in terms of how do you make a decision on long-term capacity decisions, when the category growth profile two years out is very uncertain. So I guess, I'm just asking, like how you guys at Clorox with all of your analytics are thinking about longer term category growth and how that's feeding into your decisions on capacity? I'm not just talking about disinfecting, because obviously that's going to remain elevated for a long time, but I'm also talking about charcoal and Hidden Valley Ranch and it's clearly at home food consumption is also elevated at the moment and may continue in the future? Thanks.\nLinda Rendle: Hi, Nik. Thanks for the question. So you're right, we're at a time where it is not a precise science right now to predict what the future is going to whole given what we're facing, but we are putting our analytics hard at work to understand what we think that future will look like. And if you take cleaning and disinfecting for example, we do strongly believe the category will remain elevated for the mid to long-term future and we're building capacity to address that. But how we're taking the approach on this one is to make sure that we build the right mid to long-term that allows us to have flexibility, and whether we in-house or we use co-packers for that production. So right now, as we've said we've added 10 new suppliers to help us with this incremental production and over time, if it's appropriate, we can insource that production, which helps us balance quality and cost, and also gets us to the right ratio from an efficiency perspective. So I feel really confident about our ability to do that and we're making choices that allow us to pivot depending on where this all shakes out.\nNik Modi: And Linda, if I could just follow-up on that. How long do you think it will take for Clorox to catch up with your expected level of demand over the next -- over fiscal '21. I mean is it going to take three quarters to get to where you want to be, or is it two quarters or any perspective around that?\nLinda Rendle: Yes. For a good portion of our businesses, Kingsford, Brita, Glad, Nutranext, for example, we feel like will be normalized by the end of the calendar, where we have a really good supply and demand match. From cleaning and disinfecting perspective, we do expect this to continue to be a ramp-up over the entire fiscal year. And we'll see sequential improvement throughout the fiscal year, but given the fact that cold and flu sits in the middle of the year, and then we expect the pandemic to be with us for the entirety of the year. It will take the full year to get up to the supply levels that we need to be at.\nNik Modi: Great. That was very helpful. And good luck to the both of you.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks, Nik.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Thanks. And Benno and Linda, I want to extend my congratulations to the both of you as well. My question is -- pulls together a couple of elements from Wendy and Nik's question. But tying it into the longer term outlook for the company. So beyond fiscal '21 and really looking beyond, so the current outlook is for 2% to 4% of core sales growth, but as you look at that target the low to mid-point certainly seems to be inadequate given a lot of the dynamics that we've spoken about, increased structural demand in some of these categories, particularly around Cleanliness and Health and Wellness. You're clearly investing a lot of capacity as Wendy rightly pointed out, the advertising and marketing we're tracking this correctly. We haven't seen any sort of levels as a percent of sales since fiscal 2003 for the company. So there is an awful lot of investment, both OpEx and CapEx going into the business. So it does certainly seems and certainly what's reflecting the stock right now is nothing in the 2% to 3% kind of range. So with all of that being said, when will the company be prepared to provide an update to investors or to the extent you can comment today, what are you thinking as part of your planning around capacity, around other investments in the P&L. So any commentary there would be helpful? Thank you.\nKevin Jacobsen: Hey Kevin, it's Kevin. And I can take that question. And you're right. Look, we have a -- an outlook right now as part of our IGNITE which is 2% to 4% growth. But what I think you're hearing from myself, Linda and Benno today, it is clear, our aspiration is to accelerate the profitable growth of this company. And we are leaning in. We have millions of new consumers coming into our categories. We have new growth opportunities, particularly out of home and we are leaning into these opportunities with the intent to accelerate the performance of the company. It is too early for us to raise our long-term goals. Remember, these goals go out over five years. So it's -- I would say it's in the early innings of the work we're doing. But that certainly is our intention. And at some point, we'll come back to the investor community and update you on our expectations, but I'd say a little too early for that right now. But trust, what you're hearing from us is our intent to accelerate performance and we're leaning in to do that.\nKevin Grundy: Okay, fair enough. Thanks, Kevin. I'll pass it on.\nBenno Dorer: Thanks, Kevin.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Olivia Tong of Bank of America.\nOlivia Tong: Thank you. Good afternoon and congrats Linda and Benno. It's been a pleasure. All the best to you guys. And Benno in your next endeavors with you. Wanted to talk a little bit about the performance of your categories in recession, because obviously you're leaning into quite a bit of spending. And if you could provide a bit more specificity on your expectations by segment. Because, you're looking for -- obviously a pretty rapid deceleration against the COVID backdrop. And you talked about new customers without losing the old, the potential to further expand your professional partnerships which seems obviously pretty meaningful in this environment. And you seem more amenable to potential international expansion to with the Saudi JV and obviously there's innovation. So on top of that still catching up to demand, so if you could just talk through how drastic maybe the last recession was in some of your categories or what you had to do in terms of promotional advertising to help us understand the outlook a little bit better. That would be super helpful. Thank you.\nBenno Dorer: I'll start and then Kevin can build on that. So typically what we see in a recession, if you take the last recession. You see about a 0.2 growth in our categories lower than what you'd see in an average year. And then if you double click, there is a number of categories in a normal recession and again right now you have the pandemic, of course, as an additional impact. But you have a number of categories that actually see stronger sales doing a recession. And intuitively that makes sense to see businesses like Kingsford, as people grill more at-home, Brita as people use less bottled water and move to filtered water for it's much superior value, Hidden Valley for more at-home eating occasions, those categories have historically performed very well. And we'd expect to continue that. So there will be puts and takes, and again the difficulty of course, for this outlook is in the volatility created by recession, but also the pandemic as an outlook. And of course, fiscal year '21 back half that will lapse some pretty formidable numbers. But what's been part of the recipe last time in 2008 - '09 was to really focus on investing into the consumer, play offense as we call it, which is our intention now. The playbook includes innovation and we have a strong innovation portfolio in fiscal year '21. And the playbook includes to emphasize consumer value and of course, we're going into this recession with a lot of momentum being seen as superior value on so many of our brands at this point. So we have a strong recession playbook. Our portfolio typically has been recession-resilient, and importantly, we have a very experienced team where nine out of 10 BU General Managers have been with the business at the time of the last recession and a very experienced Senior Management team knowing how to handle this. So we feel like we have an established playbook, and we will certainly continue to invest in the long-term health of the business and the elevated advertising sales promotion spend is certainly part of that. Kevin, any additional thoughts from you.\nKevin Jacobsen: Hey, Olivia. Maybe just a couple other thoughts as it relates to the recession and how we managed through the last recession about 11 years ago. So as Benno said, our belief is, and what we've seen as our categories tend to be fairly resilient. If you look at our business performance in the last recession, I believe 8 of our 10 business units grew sales over that period. So not only have the categories been resilient, but our brands have also been resilient during that period of time. And what I'd also have you note is, you always have to think about what drove the recession back in '08-'09, that was a financial crisis. This is a healthcare crisis. So it's very different. We have much more engaged consumers in our categories than we did back in '08 and '09. In addition to that, if you look at our CVM, we're at an all-time high with about 59% of our portfolio identified as superior relative to competition. And we've got the highest household penetration either stable or growing that we had in the history of the company. So you never look forward to recession, but I can tell you having been through three at Clorox, this is the strongest our portfolio has been going into a recession. And then, the only other item I'd offer is what may be different about this recession is, the government as obviously stepped in and this is the most support we've ever seen for consumers during this recession right now in terms of unemployment benefits. We'll have to see how that plays out. But if you assume that government is going to continue to actively support consumers through this process that will certainly help us as well. And so we'll see how that plays out. But I feel pretty good about the overall health of our portfolio heading into this recession.\nOlivia Tong: Thanks. That's helpful. And then Linda, you're obviously taking over arguably with a lot of growth priorities today versus history. So I'm wondering if you could talk more about how you're prioritizing them relative to one another? I'm sure, obviously the first order business is increasing the capacity for Cleaning and Disinfecting, but there is e-commerce stepping up support for professional, obviously driving the rest of the business as well. So how are you thinking about allocating those investment dollars that you're planning for next year? And then with that JV acquisition, does that in any way signal how open you are to M&A in support of some of the initiatives? Thanks.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks. Yes, you hit it on the head. The absolute number one priority is executing with excellence this year and increasing supply to meet the demand. We will be focused on delivering the plan that we put in place, which we have passion and conviction around. The business fundamentals are strong across categories. But we must do better on supply to meet demand. Second, IGNITE for us is the right strategy. I was the Lead Architect of that, got to lead our team in creating that and what it has done for us over these last many months as helped us lead through really troubling and volatile times. And what that strategy commits us to us putting people at the center of everything we do, knowing consumers and the people we serve in communities better than anyone, innovating great experiences for them with our products, and that's what we're going to continue to lean into. And we have a team of 8,800 people and an executive team that's passionate and own that strategy, and want to accelerate it. And that gets me to my third point. Where we place investment is in those IGNITE areas that we have passion and conviction around. We're going to lean into our global portfolio, and given the strength of it across the board, we will do what we always do is, we'll follow the money and where we think the best long-term value creation opportunities exist. Cleaning is certainly one of those areas and we've talked a lot about the opportunities we have there around the globe. And then last, what I'll leave you with is, we're committed to how we work. This pandemic has allowed us to re-imagine work quicker than we had ever imagined. Moving our people to work from home, keeping our essential workers healthy and our manufacturing running at full speed. But now what we imagine work will turn to is playing offense 100% of the time. That will be our focus. We use technology to do that to make quick decisions and pivot to put investment where we'll get the highest long-term return, but we feel really confident about those choices and we've managed a number of categories and brands for years and we always feel like we are able to put the investment where it's best suited and we'll do that again this year. And then NASA is a continued focus actually on the core, excuse me, Saudi Arabia is a continued focus on the core. We've been in that business for 50 years, and a joint venture with a family-owned business. It is core to our Cleaning business where we serve many countries in the Gulf region. And we have tremendous confidence in the ability for that business to continue strong growth in the future. It's core to Health and Wellness. We know that consumer has high demand for those products today. We saw double-digit growth in our Saudi Arabia business in fiscal year '20, and it's margin accretive to the company. So to us this isn't a right churn, but this is just a focus on what we talked about in International, which is accelerating profitable growth and leaning into areas that are stable and that we can ensure have long-term growth run rate for us.\nOlivia Tong: Thanks very much. All the best.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge.\nJonathan Feeney: Thanks very much for the question. And let me add my congratulations to both Benno and Linda. Thank you. I wanted to follow-up on -- last quarter you gave us some very, very helpful breakdowns of household penetration versus retail. I guess two questions in there. First, can you tell us -- can you give us any more update about how much of your growth this quarter in Cleaning particularly has been household -- new households, new claim behaviors? And now to worry about -- I don't know, a few months into this and you have some new users. Any additional [indiscernible] give us about repeat -- particularly among new users, new cleaning behavior, people buy more wipes. Are those people coming back to the store for a second, third and at what rate? Thank you.\nBenno Dorer: Yes. Thanks, Jonathan. Double-digit growth in Q4 in all four segments, and certainly seeing elevated consumer demand across the majority of our categories. Consumer fundamentals as we've noted and as you picked up on are very strong and certainly fueled by the incremental $70 million that we put in in advertising sales promotion in the back half of last fiscal year. But I would say in the vast majority of categories, if you double-click on the consumer behavior, leading to such strong growth, it's very, very strong. What we're seeing is more usage occasions in many categories caused by the pandemic, of course, but also by people staying at home. And we're seeing household penetration increases in most of our categories, and that's really been the major growth driver here. And then we're also seeing, which is very encouraging a higher purchase frequency in several categories indicating that it's more people using our product more than they ever have. We see very, very little stock-up, the exception maybe is, Burt's Bees, where store closings and lower food traffic and beauty care, but also less usage in some categories like facial towel lets and color cosmetics, which makes sense as people stay home has led to a pressure on sales and litter, where we're seeing a category-wide trough from initial pantry loading, but more broadly this is all fundamentally healthy growth with higher household penetration and higher purchase frequencies. I want to maybe point out Kingsford, as an example, beyond cleaning and disinfecting where it's quite obvious, I think that we are seeing particularly strong household penetration increases, but also strong increases in usage frequency. Kingsford for the first time in a while is going household penetration again and all the fundamental underlying indicators in the category is very healthy. We are seeing people buy more Grills, and of course, that Grill purchase increase leads to more consumption of consumables like charcoal. We are seeing millenials come into the category. A big reason why we've been able to grow household penetration is that millennials now come back into the category, so we're seeing incredibly strong growth even with a complete assets. John I don't know if that's you with we need a phone on mute. Thank you. But we're seeing new people come in, we're seeing millennials enter the category and we're seeing them use the product often. So lot of positive underlying metrics behind our Q4 sales growth and we expect this to continue for sure mid-term.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Thanks. Good morning and congratulations to both of you also. I wanted to talk a little bit about International. I know that the Saudi Arabia joint venture is something that Clorox has been very proud of for many years. But you mentioned -- Linda, I think you mentioned the word global. There has been international few times and the company I think has for the last several years has been more about the go lean, get tight control cost and really focused on right models from where you were playing. But to what degree does -- I guess, the current landscape, both in terms of consumer need and in terms of the strength of the Clorox brand and the sort of flexibility you presumably have on profitability, does that enhance your international growth aspirations? Maybe Linda if you were looking at IGNITE and setting the strategy today versus 12 months ago, do you think International would play a bigger role and if not, why not? Thanks.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks, Lauren. So we absolutely have the opportunity to meet more consumer demand in the US and International. And we're moving quickly with supply chain investments to support expansion in both. What I want you to take away is, we don't see a fundamental change in the composition between the percent of our business in the US and International. We see the ability to grow both strongly. But if you think about the International opportunity specifically, there are three things that we're focused on. The first is, we just need to increase supply to meet the demand that we have in the markets we're already in and the products that we already have in those locations. And we're focused on that just like we are in the US. The second is, we absolutely have an opportunity to expand our product forms in countries we compete in today. So for example, there are many places around the world where wipes have low penetration or we don't play and we see that as being an offering that consumers might be ready for in different areas of the world. And then the third, we are evaluating expansion into new geographies and we certainly see very high interest from consumers in different parts of the world for the Clorox brand in particular. And whether it's interest, we will look and see if there is long-term disciplined approach we can take to entering that market where we see strong return on investments. So that will be very consistent with how we've approached International to date. And that's what I would leave you with is, definite opportunity in International. No change in terms of how we think about the role it will play in our overall portfolio. And we'll be aggressive in pursuing opportunities when we have confidence in them.\nLauren Lieberman: Thanks. And then, if I may just also a question on competition. So I think you went -- you've all went through very clearly reasons why market share performance at least in tracked channels is what it is, and it may be not the best gauge of kind of what's materially going on in your business, both curious still how you were thinking about an increase in competitive dynamics, more players, more brands with really reasonable and strong brand equities, looking to play in some of your phases. Historically, actually part of the hallmark of Clorox has been that sort of big share brands and in kind of midsized categories. Your categories aren't going to midsized anymore possibly with where we're talking today. So what do you do in the dynamics those categories change, the competitive landscape changes. What -- how are you thinking about that?\nBenno Dorer: Thank you, Lauren. I mean look our competitors -- our categories, have always been very competitive. They are competitive and they will be competitive. There is no question. And we also can assume I think that reasonably assume that in the disinfecting space in particular, it's an attractive space. Looking at the growth and the profitability and the ability to make a difference to so many consumers around the world we can expect that that will be more competitive. But for us that's our daily bread and has been our daily bread for very long time. And how do we go about that? We build leading brands. And as we've commented a few times those brands generally are in a great shape. We invest behind them. We invest with an eye on the long-term. We keep the value sharp and we've also commented how that's in the best shape it's ever been, and we innovate, innovate, innovate. So we're not waiting for competition to come in and we are certainly used to competition to try and come in and disinfecting and without sounding arrogant, a lot of times the competition came and went, and we will defend our home turf and importantly as Linda said earlier, we will play offense a 100% of the time. So, we can assume that this business is going to continue to be very competitive. But we're ready for it and we certainly as you noted, are taking the stance and have the financial flexibility to invest in our business in order to ensure success with an aspiration of accelerating long-term growth for the company.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay. Thanks so much and congratulations, again.\nOperator: Our next question is from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Thank you. And sincere congratulations from me as well Benno. And Linda obviously big congratulations you're way too. I guess, I was hoping you could talk more about the biggest drivers underlying what I see is a fairly wide bottom line range for fiscal '21 relative to an arguably more narrow top line range and I guess I'm specifically interested in how you're thinking about gross margins. I missed the demand volatility and supply constraints, recessionary pressures that you've alluded to as well as some of the competitive dynamics that Lauren just called out. So is there a way to talk about gross margin as a driver of '21 guidance?\nKevin Jacobsen: Steve, this is Kevin. And I can talk about both our EPS range and gross margin. I'd say, to your point, our EPS range we're providing this year is wider than what we typically provide on a normal year end. And I'd say that that wider range is really driven by two areas that we expect to see increased variability in our results. The first is the top line, and I think that's probably pretty obvious. The ongoing impact of COVID-19. The impact of the recession, how that will play out on our portfolio will clearly be difficult to predict over the course of the full year. I think we've got decent visibility as we look out over the very near term. But as we get into the back half of the year and we're lapping the 20% organic growth from last year, more difficult for us to determine exactly where that will play out. And so there will be some level of variability from the top line. I would say in addition to the top line variability, when you look at our supply chain, where I expect to see increased variability from previous years is specifically in manufacturing and logistics in terms of the impact we're seeing from COVID-19 and maybe to dimensionalize that, in our fourth quarter, we had about a $30 million of up charges we incurred in our supply chain related to COVID-19. And now as I look forward into '21, we expect those to be temporary charges and we expect them to diminish over time. But a lot of that will be driven by how the pandemic plays out, which is clearly outside of our control. And so it's difficult to call exactly where our gross margin land. And if you think about it $10 million change in profitability is worth about 1 point of EPS growth for this company. And so it's not inconceivable that we could see $20 million or $30 million variability and the supply chain as it relates to the impact of COVID over the course of the year, that would generate 2 point to 3 point change in our EPS performance for the year. And so I think when you look at the variability in the top line, you look at the variability on the COVID cause hitting our supply chain, that's the reason why we have a wider EPS range to start the year. Now as it relates to gross margin, I actually think gross margin be very much in line with where we land on EPS. If we end up with negative EPS for the years because we had larger COVID cost and supply chain than we anticipated and likely declining gross margin. And conversely, if we generate EPS growth this year it will be driven by COVID cost doing better than we anticipated in growing margins for the year. And so that's how we're seeing right now. It's obviously very early in the year, as we get smarter, we'll certainly update you as we learn more in terms of how we think it's going to land, but I think to start the year this feels like a prudent place to start with the range we said.\nSteve Powers: Yes, that's fair. Thank you for that. I guess, kind of, while you're talking, is there a way you can put some numbers around your expectations for cash generation next year and also the uses of that cash, I'm particularly interested in CapEx, just given the manufacturing ramp that you've called out?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes. So as it relates to cash and maybe specifically CapEx, with significant access of cash we're generating as a company. I think you saw in my prepared remarks, it's up about 56% for the full fiscal year, although I'd tell you in the back half year we had doubled the rate of cash we are generating over the last six months of fiscal year '20. So the company is in very good financial position in terms of access to cash to allow us to invest in the business. And again what you're hearing from the three of us today is, we are doing just that, we're taking that cash and we're putting into the business with our intent to accelerate our performance over the long-term. As it relates specific to CapEx, we are also investing in capacity expansion is the primary focus for us. Typically, as a company, our capital spending is somewhere between 3% and 4% of sales revenue each year. I'd say if you look back over the last few years, we've been closer to the low end of that range, a little over 3%. We started investing in the fourth quarter. We invested about $100 million of additional capital in the fourth quarter and that put us just below 4% last year as a percent of sales. As I look forward to '21, as we continue to invest in capacity expansion particularly in disinfecting, Steve, I think we'll end up somewhere between 4% and 4.5% as a percent of sales into capital spending and that puts us if you do the math, that gets us to about $300 million in CapEx spending for the year. And I think that's probably a pretty good assumption for now to work with.\nSteve Powers: Makes sense. Congratulations again. Lisah -- I mean sorry Linda and Benno. Thank you.\nBenno Dorer: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jason English of Goldman Sachs.\nJason English: Hey. Good afternoon, folks. And I'll fill that last sentiment, congratulations Linda and Benno I wish you well and I'm going to miss your quarterly banter. So on to my questions. The guidance for a sequential deceleration, albeit it's still strong levels. It is a little bit surprising context of what any of you guys say that your demand is massively outstripping your supply and your shipping pretty much -- you're selling everything you can and selling everything you could in the fourth quarter translated into 23% organic sales growth and nearly $2 billion of revenue. Why couldn't you match that in the first quarter, if demand is so robust and so meaningfully outstripping supply?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes. Jason, this is Kevin. I think your question is specifically really to Q1 and while we don't typically provide quarterly guidance, we thought it was helpful to provide some perspective front half, back half and what we said is, we do expect double-digit top line growth in Q1, to your point. We continue to see very strong demand for our products. It is outstripping our ability to supply. In the near term, we expect that to continue and because of that, we do expect a very strong first quarter.\nJason English: Okay. I'll try offline on that one later. On components of your growth, price was obviously a meaningful contributor to this quarter and I imagine promotions. I suspect a lot of that's trade spent with the promotional programs pulled out of the market, given supply-demand imbalance. What is the cadence of that look like based on your expectations as we progress through the year. Should we expect similar price contribution in the first quarter and waning over the quarter? Or could it moderate even faster?\nBenno Dorer: Yes. Jason there is -- there are clearly as you noted, there hasn't been a lot of price promotion in our categories for sure. It's part of what's encouraging for instance on Kingsford that we were able to grow double-digits without what is usually a pretty healthy price promotion during peak events or holidays like 4th of July and Memorial Day. So that's all encouraging. But if you think about our trade spends, our trade spend, the vast majority of our trade spend is performance-driven, meaning it's tied to customer performance and the customer performance is there. So there are -- there aren't a lot of savings in trade spend, because we're honoring the commitments and because for many of our customers the trade spend is rolled into everyday low pricing. And that's going to continue. So as you think about trade spend, there is not going to be a windfall over the next fiscal year. It's been a little lower in Q4 as you will have noted. And that could continue. But it's also going to vary by quarter and trade spend is not going to be a big source of savings going forward.\nJason English: Okay. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: And our final question comes from Linda Bolton-Weiser of D.A. Davidson.\nLinda Bolton-Weiser: Hi, thanks for taking my question. You made some comments about the general charcoal category and the growth there and what's driving it, but I was wondering if you could be more specific about your own share recovery that at least in the tracked channels it does look like your share is improving. And was the hickory pellet launch important in share growth or is that just too small at this point? And when can we expect the next innovation in charcoal? Thanks.\nBenno Dorer: Yes. Thanks, Linda and welcome back. That's a nice way to end it. I would characterize Kingsford as a good story in that we had implemented much improved plans, which led to a really strong retailer support and that came just in time as consumers were looking to Grill more in the face of pandemic. So a really nice turnaround story with the second quarter -- consecutive quarter of growth, after certainly a weaker period and Q4 up double digits. Share was up strongly. It's one of our strongest growing businesses share-wise. And if you look at the underlying factors, it is strong retailer support as mentioned, it's household penetration returning to growth. On the brand, it's a growing category, even without the aggressive peak holiday discounts, heavy Grill sales, all of it really encouraging. So the vast majority of the sales and share growth is just on the core. And the good news is, there is so much opportunity left, given the performance in previous years, we are really just scratching the surface of what we can do to recover lost share growth, but also benefit from a category that clearly is on trend. Pellets itself is off to a strong start, and also continues to build and will also keep building in the fiscal year '21 season. But really it has not been a strong factor in the grand scheme of things as we think about the sales growth. So really solid momentum on Kingsford as we enter fiscal year '21 with so much opportunity ahead.\nLinda Bolton-Weiser: Thank you and good luck.\nKevin Jacobsen: Thanks, Linda.\nBenno Dorer: Thanks, Linda and thanks to everybody. Thank you everyone again for joining us today. I hope that all of you and your families will stay healthy, and I also hope that our paths will cross again at some point after we get through this pandemic. And in the meantime, please stay well and Linda, Kevin and Lisah will speak to you about Clorox's Q1 fiscal year '21 results on November 20 -- no, on November 2. Thank you, all.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kevin Jacobsen",
            "content": "Thank you, Lisah. And thank you everyone for joining us today. We hope you and your families are well. I'm proud of a very strong performance in Q4 and our overall results for fiscal year '20. As we continue to navigate the global pandemic, our team has been unwavering in our efforts to maximize supply disinfectants and other essential products needed by Healthcare workers, consumers and our communities. In the fourth quarter, COVID-19 continued to have a significant impact on our results. In addition to double-digit sales growth in all four of our reportable segments, we delivered our seventh consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion and another quarter of strong cash flow, all of which contributed to strong fiscal year '20 performance. As you saw in our press release, we are providing a financial outlook today, because, despite the increased challenge of anticipating how the full year will play out, we believe that in this period of heightened uncertainty, it's important to provide investors with as much transparency and perspective as possible. That said, we anticipate a higher level of variability than what you might normally expect, as the results will be heavily influenced by the depth and the duration of the ongoing health crisis. I'll comment more on our outlook shortly. Turning to our fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter sales were up 22%, driven by 21 points of volume growth and 3 points of favorable price mix, partially offset by 2 points of FX headwinds. Gross margin for the quarter, increased 170 basis points to 46.8% compared to 45.1% for the year ago quarter. Fourth quarter gross margin included the benefits of higher volume as well as 170 basis points from cost savings, and 120 basis points from favorable mix. These factors were partially offset by higher manufacturing and logistics cost which included temporary spending related to increasing our production capacity and expediting transportation of our products. Fourth quarter gross margin also reflected ongoing cost favorability in commodities, more than offset by the impact from foreign currency headwinds. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales came in at 14.1% compared to 13.3% in the year ago quarter. This higher rate primarily reflects increased year-over-year incentive compensation, consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels as a percentage of sales came in at about 11%, about 0.5 point higher than the year ago quarter. We're spending for our US retail business coming in at about 12% of sales for the second consecutive quarter. For additional perspective, we invested $70 million more in the back half of fiscal year '20, compared to the same period in fiscal year '19, reflecting aggressive investments consistent with our ambition to accelerate long-term profitable growth. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate was about 22% compared to about 17% in the year ago quarter, due to lapping tax benefits in the year ago period. Net of all these factors, we delivered diluted net earnings per share of $2.41 versus $1.88 in the year ago quarter, an increase of 28%. Commenting briefly on our fiscal year results, I'm pleased with the progress we made in our core business prior to the impact of COVID-19, plus our teams dedication to respond to unprecedented demand resulting in very strong results for fiscal year '20. We delivered sales growth of 8% and on our organic basis grew sales 10%. Gross margin expansion of 170 basis points versus fiscal year '19, supported by strong volume growth and another year of robust cost savings. These factors enabled us to close out the overall fiscal year delivering diluted EPS of $7.36, an increase of 16%. As you saw in our press release, fiscal year '20 net cash provided by operations was $1.5 billion versus $992 million in fiscal year '19, an increase of 56%. Our accelerating cash flow and strong balance sheet, give us the flexibility to continue investing behind long-term growth opportunities. Now I'll provide more perspective on our outlook. Starting with our key assumptions for fiscal year '21. First, we expect the impact of COVID-19 to be with us for the bulk of fiscal year '21 resulting in our expectation for ongoing elevated global demand for our Cleaning and Disinfecting products, particularly through the first half of our fiscal year, Next, we expect the US and many parts of the world to face an ongoing recession that will reduce consumers' disposable spending and increase the importance of providing superior consumer value. And we plan to aggressively invest behind the momentum we're seeing in our global portfolio, including increasing production capacity to address ongoing elevated demand for our products. Our outlook also assumes minimal disruption through extended supply chain over the course of the fiscal year. And finally, we are assuming about a 40% devaluation of the Argentine peso which is materially less than the potential devaluation if the currency moves to the country's parallel rate. For our fiscal year sales outlook. We expect fiscal year sales to be flat to up low-single-digits, reflecting our expectation for continued elevated demand for the first half of the fiscal year and a deceleration in the back half as we lap the initial spike in demand from COVID-19. As you saw in our press release, we have acquired a majority stake in our Saudi Arabia joint venture, which we anticipate will contribute about 1 point of growth to our fiscal year '21 sales. We expect this to be offset by about 1 point of foreign exchange headwinds primarily in Argentina. On an organic sales basis, our outlook assumes flat to low single-digit growth. For additional perspective on our fiscal year sales expectations, we anticipate strong growth in the front half of the fiscal year, including double-digit increases in Q1, although decelerating from the 19% sales growth we delivered in the back half of fiscal year 20. In the back half of fiscal year 21, while we expect strong performance relative to our pre-pandemic sales levels, we expect sales to decline as we lapped the initial impact from COVID-19 in the year ago period. We expect fiscal year selling and administrative expenses to come in at about 14% of sales as we continue to invest aggressively in long-term growth initiatives. Additionally, we are increasing investments in our brands to address this unprecedented demand for our products from existing and new consumers with plans to increase advertising spending to about 11% of sales, to build loyalty with many new consumers entering our categories for the first time, in addition to continuing to deliver superior consumer value, which is more critical than ever as we navigate the global recession. As I mentioned, we will continue to invest in expanding our production capacity to address our expectation for ongoing elevated demand for our products and support new longer term growth opportunities. In the near term, we will continue to expand our use of third-party manufacturers to increase our production capacity, while this comes at a higher cost we believe is an important action to take while our internal expansion efforts come online. We expect our fiscal year tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 23%, closer to our long-term tax rate assumption. Net of these factors, we expect fiscal year '21 diluted EPS to be down mid-single-digits to up mid-single-digits. Our fiscal year diluted EPS outlook includes an estimated contribution of $0.45 to $0.53 from our increased stake in our Saudi Arabia joint venture, primarily driven by a one-time non-cash gain associated with a fair market value adjustment to our previously held stake in the joint venture. This one-time gain is projected to be recognized in Q1 and on a full year basis offset by our expectations for a high tax rate and foreign currency headwinds for the company. Before I turn it over to Benno, I'd like to reiterate how proud I am of the Clorox team for delivering strong performance in fiscal year '20 and the role we're playing to help fight this global pandemic. Our Disinfecting products continue to support public health and other essential products continue to make a difference in the day-to-day lives of people as they spend more time at home. Consumer interest in our categories has never been higher. And a robust fiscal year sales results, provide a strong foundation for ongoing momentum. We certainly plan to build on that by aggressively investing in our IGNITE Strategy to drive long-term shareholder value. And finally, I also want to say how much I've enjoyed working with Benno over the years. I'm also looking forward to Clorox' next chapter with Linda, who will be a strong CEO for the company. And with that, I'll turn it over to Benno. Hey Kevin, it's Kevin. And I can take that question. And you're right. Look, we have a -- an outlook right now as part of our IGNITE which is 2% to 4% growth. But what I think you're hearing from myself, Linda and Benno today, it is clear, our aspiration is to accelerate the profitable growth of this company. And we are leaning in. We have millions of new consumers coming into our categories. We have new growth opportunities, particularly out of home and we are leaning into these opportunities with the intent to accelerate the performance of the company. It is too early for us to raise our long-term goals. Remember, these goals go out over five years. So it's -- I would say it's in the early innings of the work we're doing. But that certainly is our intention. And at some point, we'll come back to the investor community and update you on our expectations, but I'd say a little too early for that right now. But trust, what you're hearing from us is our intent to accelerate performance and we're leaning in to do that. Hey, Olivia. Maybe just a couple other thoughts as it relates to the recession and how we managed through the last recession about 11 years ago. So as Benno said, our belief is, and what we've seen as our categories tend to be fairly resilient. If you look at our business performance in the last recession, I believe 8 of our 10 business units grew sales over that period. So not only have the categories been resilient, but our brands have also been resilient during that period of time. And what I'd also have you note is, you always have to think about what drove the recession back in '08-'09, that was a financial crisis. This is a healthcare crisis. So it's very different. We have much more engaged consumers in our categories than we did back in '08 and '09. In addition to that, if you look at our CVM, we're at an all-time high with about 59% of our portfolio identified as superior relative to competition. And we've got the highest household penetration either stable or growing that we had in the history of the company. So you never look forward to recession, but I can tell you having been through three at Clorox, this is the strongest our portfolio has been going into a recession. And then, the only other item I'd offer is what may be different about this recession is, the government as obviously stepped in and this is the most support we've ever seen for consumers during this recession right now in terms of unemployment benefits. We'll have to see how that plays out. But if you assume that government is going to continue to actively support consumers through this process that will certainly help us as well. And so we'll see how that plays out. But I feel pretty good about the overall health of our portfolio heading into this recession. Steve, this is Kevin. And I can talk about both our EPS range and gross margin. I'd say, to your point, our EPS range we're providing this year is wider than what we typically provide on a normal year end. And I'd say that that wider range is really driven by two areas that we expect to see increased variability in our results. The first is the top line, and I think that's probably pretty obvious. The ongoing impact of COVID-19. The impact of the recession, how that will play out on our portfolio will clearly be difficult to predict over the course of the full year. I think we've got decent visibility as we look out over the very near term. But as we get into the back half of the year and we're lapping the 20% organic growth from last year, more difficult for us to determine exactly where that will play out. And so there will be some level of variability from the top line. I would say in addition to the top line variability, when you look at our supply chain, where I expect to see increased variability from previous years is specifically in manufacturing and logistics in terms of the impact we're seeing from COVID-19 and maybe to dimensionalize that, in our fourth quarter, we had about a $30 million of up charges we incurred in our supply chain related to COVID-19. And now as I look forward into '21, we expect those to be temporary charges and we expect them to diminish over time. But a lot of that will be driven by how the pandemic plays out, which is clearly outside of our control. And so it's difficult to call exactly where our gross margin land. And if you think about it $10 million change in profitability is worth about 1 point of EPS growth for this company. And so it's not inconceivable that we could see $20 million or $30 million variability and the supply chain as it relates to the impact of COVID over the course of the year, that would generate 2 point to 3 point change in our EPS performance for the year. And so I think when you look at the variability in the top line, you look at the variability on the COVID cause hitting our supply chain, that's the reason why we have a wider EPS range to start the year. Now as it relates to gross margin, I actually think gross margin be very much in line with where we land on EPS. If we end up with negative EPS for the years because we had larger COVID cost and supply chain than we anticipated and likely declining gross margin. And conversely, if we generate EPS growth this year it will be driven by COVID cost doing better than we anticipated in growing margins for the year. And so that's how we're seeing right now. It's obviously very early in the year, as we get smarter, we'll certainly update you as we learn more in terms of how we think it's going to land, but I think to start the year this feels like a prudent place to start with the range we said. Yes. So as it relates to cash and maybe specifically CapEx, with significant access of cash we're generating as a company. I think you saw in my prepared remarks, it's up about 56% for the full fiscal year, although I'd tell you in the back half year we had doubled the rate of cash we are generating over the last six months of fiscal year '20. So the company is in very good financial position in terms of access to cash to allow us to invest in the business. And again what you're hearing from the three of us today is, we are doing just that, we're taking that cash and we're putting into the business with our intent to accelerate our performance over the long-term. As it relates specific to CapEx, we are also investing in capacity expansion is the primary focus for us. Typically, as a company, our capital spending is somewhere between 3% and 4% of sales revenue each year. I'd say if you look back over the last few years, we've been closer to the low end of that range, a little over 3%. We started investing in the fourth quarter. We invested about $100 million of additional capital in the fourth quarter and that put us just below 4% last year as a percent of sales. As I look forward to '21, as we continue to invest in capacity expansion particularly in disinfecting, Steve, I think we'll end up somewhere between 4% and 4.5% as a percent of sales into capital spending and that puts us if you do the math, that gets us to about $300 million in CapEx spending for the year. And I think that's probably a pretty good assumption for now to work with. Yes. Jason, this is Kevin. I think your question is specifically really to Q1 and while we don't typically provide quarterly guidance, we thought it was helpful to provide some perspective front half, back half and what we said is, we do expect double-digit top line growth in Q1, to your point. We continue to see very strong demand for our products. It is outstripping our ability to supply. In the near term, we expect that to continue and because of that, we do expect a very strong first quarter. Thanks, Linda."

            "content": "Thank you, Lisa, and hello everyone. You've likely seen this morning's announcement about my decision to step down from my role as CEO. With our current President, Linda Rendle, being named my successor, effective September 14. I will continue to serve as Executive Chair of the Board. It has been my great privilege to carry forward the legacy of generations of strong Clorox leaders in my pursuit of Good Growth. Growth that is profitable, sustainable and responsible. The idea of Good Growth was created based on the very strong belief, that companies can deliver great results the right way, and that's serving employees, communities and the planet as a whole is as important as serving shareholders, and that's how we generate profit matters. I am proud that as a company, we have always been strategy led and committed to our values, both of which have guided us successfully in making the right choices on behalf of our shareholders and all of our stakeholders. After 15 terrific years at the company, I am particularly grateful for my teams of 8,800 strong, and especially for the current executive team. I have great confidence in them. I also want to thank the Board of Directors for their support of a guy who ventured out of a small town in the German Black forest, 35 years ago to pursue a dream that let me to places and allowed me to do things I could not have possibly imagined. My thanks also go out to everyone in the investment community around the world for your support, helpful perspective and of course, your candor, which I look forward to momentarily. I appreciate all of you, and I particularly appreciate the wonderful friendships that I've been able to make along the way. On September 14, I could not be more pleased to hand over the reins to Linda and I look forward to supporting her and her team. I've worked with Linda for 13 of her 17 years with the company. She is an exceptional leader, with an outstanding track record, the right leader for this great company and I cannot wait for all of you to be able to see what she can do. Linda is joining us today and will participate in Q&A and also say a few words towards the end of the call. Thank you. It's been an honor and a privilege. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Lisah. Thanks, Kevin. Here are my three key messages for our Q4 and fiscal year '20 results. First, I continue to be proud of our people's leadership and commitment to serving public health and supporting our consumers and communities during this global health crisis. The dedication has led to outstanding Q4 results, contributing to very strong performance in fiscal year '20. I'm pleased we delivered fiscal year 2020 sales growth of 8% reflecting growth in all reportable segments and organic sales were up 24% [ph], our highest organic sales growth on record. We also delivered totally company gross margin expansion reflecting gross margin increases in all four segments for the fiscal year, supported by the strength of our volume results and robust cost savings. And even with significant advertising investments, we were able to expand fiscal year EBIT margin by 110 basis points. And we delivered a 16% increase in diluted earnings per share for fiscal year '20. While our financials for the quarter and full year were very strong, there's one area of ongoing focus for us, keeping up with continued elevated demand. We take very seriously the important role we play in this pandemic [indiscernible] and customers are counting on all our products. Frankly, we thought we would be in a better position by now, but demand in Q4 exceeded our expectations. We're certainly not at all happy with our service levels for our retail customers on many products, as demand for our products exceeded our own expectations in the face of this persistent pandemic. We have a high sense of urgency on this with all hands on deck. We're accessing third-party supply sources and focusing our manufacturing on those products that can be supplied more quickly. And we are ahead of plan on this. Since Q3, we were able to bring on more than 10 new suppliers to help us maximize our output, not just for disinfecting products but for other parts of our portfolio too. For disinfecting products, we're continuing to run our plants 24/7 and we'll be bringing more disinfecting capacity online in the mid-term. With all the levers we're pulling to expand output, I am confident in our ability to do better for our customers and consumers. Before I go on to my next message, I'd like to say again, how much I've valued the commitment of Clorox people and their contributions to our Q4 and fiscal year results. Our team of 8,800 strong continues to step up every day to contribute to our efforts of supporting our consumers, customers and communities. My second message is this. The fundamentals of our business are strong. Given the progress on our core business, which contributed to our overall fiscal year '20 results and gives us momentum for fiscal year '21. I feel good about the fundamentals of our business and the continued progress on our core. In fiscal year '20, incremental sales from innovation exceeded the company's historical average. As you've heard from Lisah, we introduced a number of exciting products in fiscal year '20 and continue to see growth from big innovation platforms. Our relentless focus on delivering superior consumer value through market leading innovation continues to differentiate our products and brands. And I'm proud that in fiscal year '20, the percentage of our US portfolio seen by consumers as delivering superior value has risen to an all-time high, positioning our brands well in this recession. In Q4, we also had more than 90% of our US portfolio at growing or stable household penetration, the strongest results we've achieved to date. I'm also pleased that total company market share in tracked channels grew. And our market shares in the fast e-commerce -- fast growing e-commerce channel continued to grow as well supported by increase in digital advertising. After fiscal year '20, our sales in the e-commerce channel now represents about 12% of total company sales, compared to 8% in fiscal year 2019, and well ahead of our plan. Results like these demonstrate we made the right choice to lean into advertising investments in fiscal year '20 including spending about $70 million more in the back half of the fiscal year, compared to the same period in fiscal year '19. Importantly our progress against business fundamentals is setting us up well for fiscal year '21, and I feel confident about our ability to continue driving long-term momentum. And this leads me to my last message. We remain committed to building on this momentum for our global portfolio through strong investments to further strengthen our competitive position, grow our categories and deliver long-term shareholder value guided by our IGNITE Strategy. Clearly these are extraordinary times. So it's hard to anticipate what will happen even in the near-term future. We continue to believe COVID-19 will have lasting impacts on global consumer behavior and trends including how consumers engage in our categories and with our brands, leading to meaningful long-term growth potential for our company. And as people continue to navigate what looks to be a significant recession, we anticipate that pressures related to unemployment and discretionary spending will spotlight the need to focus on value. We also anticipate they will keep turning to trusted brands to help them and their families stay safe as well as to support the Health and Wellness on day-to-day needs. As Kevin noted, our fiscal year '21 earnings outlook reflects the significant volatility and uncertainty, and also deliberate and aggressive investments behind our global portfolio and longer term growth initiatives. During these uncertain times, we plan to play offense to grow sales in fiscal year '21 off of an elevated fiscal year '20 base. And we plan to continue investing in long-term value creation with a focus on our ambition to accelerate sales growth beyond the fiscal year. Here is what you can expect in fiscal year '21. We will plan to increase advertising to about 11% of sales. We will invest in innovating experiences behind brand purpose, frictionless shopping and sticky product innovation, including our strong innovation pipeline in fiscal year '21. We will increase capital spending to expand production capacity so that together with our customers, we can better meet consumer demand, particularly for disinfecting products, but also, so that we can begin to fully take advantage of the opportunity to support public health out of home. As you've likely seen, we've started collaborating with leading brands like Uber Technologies, United Airlines and AMC Theaters to support their efforts to keep their customers safe. And we recently announced our partnership with Cleveland Clinic, which brings together our respective capabilities and expertise to support public health as we all continue to face COVID-19. As a people centered company, everything we do through our IGNITE Strategy continues to be in service of delivering superior value, because now and longer term we know it's the key to keep winning with consumers. And of course, we'll continue to focus on growing our business the right way, committed to our values with ESG integrated in our business, so that we are also creating value for all of our stakeholders. We're proud that last week's Axios Harris Poll 100, a survey of about 35,000 Americans ranked The Clorox Company number one for corporate reputation in the US based on seven dimensions: trust, vision, growth, products, culture, ethics and citizenship. Now and in the future Clorox will remain focused on Good Growth. Growth that's profitable, responsible and sustainable. And with that let me turn it over to Linda. Yes. Thank you, Wendy. What you should takeaway is that this is an aggressive investment that is into the momentum that we have in the business. It also signals confidence in our strategy. And of course, as always with our company that's done with an eye on the long- term. For us advertising sales promotion is not a quarterly expense, it's a long-term investment in the health of our brands. And while 10% continues to be the level long-term that we're comfortable with, we see a particular opportunity at this time to invest in this pivotal opportunity that we have for our company to accelerate growth. It will go into demand building across all businesses both in the core as well as in innovation. I mentioned earlier, we have a very strong innovation program, in spite of the supply challenges right now, that we have great confidence and we have so much opportunity ahead. So we feel like this is the right thing to. It is an investment in the long-term health of the business. And, if you look at the fundamental business drivers of our business; as I mentioned them in Q4 with rising market shares, with household penetration growing or stable in north of 90% of our US portfolio. With market shares growing in International, with further opportunity to build out our International business to serve more consumers in the face of the pandemic. With consumer value perception being at its all-time high with well north of 50% of our portfolio being seen as superior. All those things are particularly strong indicators of future business momentum. So, against all of that and in particular also with the looming recession, which we think is going to be significant and is perhaps underestimated or somewhat overlooked at this time, in particular here in the US, we think this is simply the right thing to do, and it's certainly part of our recession playbook that we've successfully apply once before about 11 years ago. So, we have great confidence in this choice as part of a long-term growth strategy for our company. Typically we don't provide quarterly outlook. But it can certainly vary by quarter depending on, for instance, the timing of innovation launches. So you should expect that variation. Based on what we know today, even though you can never say never, right, in this business. But I cannot see us touch advertising sales promotion because like I said, it's not a tactical expense. It's an investment in long-term growth. So we will remain committed to spending the dollars. And frankly, if the recession gets worse, that's even more of a reason for us to spend in advertising sales promotion, in particular at this time, when people are looking at trusted brands to meet their needs. And as you know, we have many of those trusted brands that people rely on in particular doing a recession. Thanks, Kevin. I'll start and then Kevin can build on that. So typically what we see in a recession, if you take the last recession. You see about a 0.2 growth in our categories lower than what you'd see in an average year. And then if you double click, there is a number of categories in a normal recession and again right now you have the pandemic, of course, as an additional impact. But you have a number of categories that actually see stronger sales doing a recession. And intuitively that makes sense to see businesses like Kingsford, as people grill more at-home, Brita as people use less bottled water and move to filtered water for it's much superior value, Hidden Valley for more at-home eating occasions, those categories have historically performed very well. And we'd expect to continue that. So there will be puts and takes, and again the difficulty of course, for this outlook is in the volatility created by recession, but also the pandemic as an outlook. And of course, fiscal year '21 back half that will lapse some pretty formidable numbers. But what's been part of the recipe last time in 2008 - '09 was to really focus on investing into the consumer, play offense as we call it, which is our intention now. The playbook includes innovation and we have a strong innovation portfolio in fiscal year '21. And the playbook includes to emphasize consumer value and of course, we're going into this recession with a lot of momentum being seen as superior value on so many of our brands at this point. So we have a strong recession playbook. Our portfolio typically has been recession-resilient, and importantly, we have a very experienced team where nine out of 10 BU General Managers have been with the business at the time of the last recession and a very experienced Senior Management team knowing how to handle this. So we feel like we have an established playbook, and we will certainly continue to invest in the long-term health of the business and the elevated advertising sales promotion spend is certainly part of that. Kevin, any additional thoughts from you. Yes. Thanks, Jonathan. Double-digit growth in Q4 in all four segments, and certainly seeing elevated consumer demand across the majority of our categories. Consumer fundamentals as we've noted and as you picked up on are very strong and certainly fueled by the incremental $70 million that we put in in advertising sales promotion in the back half of last fiscal year. But I would say in the vast majority of categories, if you double-click on the consumer behavior, leading to such strong growth, it's very, very strong. What we're seeing is more usage occasions in many categories caused by the pandemic, of course, but also by people staying at home. And we're seeing household penetration increases in most of our categories, and that's really been the major growth driver here. And then we're also seeing, which is very encouraging a higher purchase frequency in several categories indicating that it's more people using our product more than they ever have. We see very, very little stock-up, the exception maybe is, Burt's Bees, where store closings and lower food traffic and beauty care, but also less usage in some categories like facial towel lets and color cosmetics, which makes sense as people stay home has led to a pressure on sales and litter, where we're seeing a category-wide trough from initial pantry loading, but more broadly this is all fundamentally healthy growth with higher household penetration and higher purchase frequencies. I want to maybe point out Kingsford, as an example, beyond cleaning and disinfecting where it's quite obvious, I think that we are seeing particularly strong household penetration increases, but also strong increases in usage frequency. Kingsford for the first time in a while is going household penetration again and all the fundamental underlying indicators in the category is very healthy. We are seeing people buy more Grills, and of course, that Grill purchase increase leads to more consumption of consumables like charcoal. We are seeing millenials come into the category. A big reason why we've been able to grow household penetration is that millennials now come back into the category, so we're seeing incredibly strong growth even with a complete assets. John I don't know if that's you with we need a phone on mute. Thank you. But we're seeing new people come in, we're seeing millennials enter the category and we're seeing them use the product often. So lot of positive underlying metrics behind our Q4 sales growth and we expect this to continue for sure mid-term. Thank you, Lauren. I mean look our competitors -- our categories, have always been very competitive. They are competitive and they will be competitive. There is no question. And we also can assume I think that reasonably assume that in the disinfecting space in particular, it's an attractive space. Looking at the growth and the profitability and the ability to make a difference to so many consumers around the world we can expect that that will be more competitive. But for us that's our daily bread and has been our daily bread for very long time. And how do we go about that? We build leading brands. And as we've commented a few times those brands generally are in a great shape. We invest behind them. We invest with an eye on the long-term. We keep the value sharp and we've also commented how that's in the best shape it's ever been, and we innovate, innovate, innovate. So we're not waiting for competition to come in and we are certainly used to competition to try and come in and disinfecting and without sounding arrogant, a lot of times the competition came and went, and we will defend our home turf and importantly as Linda said earlier, we will play offense a 100% of the time. So, we can assume that this business is going to continue to be very competitive. But we're ready for it and we certainly as you noted, are taking the stance and have the financial flexibility to invest in our business in order to ensure success with an aspiration of accelerating long-term growth for the company. Thanks, Steve. Yes. Jason there is -- there are clearly as you noted, there hasn't been a lot of price promotion in our categories for sure. It's part of what's encouraging for instance on Kingsford that we were able to grow double-digits without what is usually a pretty healthy price promotion during peak events or holidays like 4th of July and Memorial Day. So that's all encouraging. But if you think about our trade spends, our trade spend, the vast majority of our trade spend is performance-driven, meaning it's tied to customer performance and the customer performance is there. So there are -- there aren't a lot of savings in trade spend, because we're honoring the commitments and because for many of our customers the trade spend is rolled into everyday low pricing. And that's going to continue. So as you think about trade spend, there is not going to be a windfall over the next fiscal year. It's been a little lower in Q4 as you will have noted. And that could continue. But it's also going to vary by quarter and trade spend is not going to be a big source of savings going forward. Yes. Thanks, Linda and welcome back. That's a nice way to end it. I would characterize Kingsford as a good story in that we had implemented much improved plans, which led to a really strong retailer support and that came just in time as consumers were looking to Grill more in the face of pandemic. So a really nice turnaround story with the second quarter -- consecutive quarter of growth, after certainly a weaker period and Q4 up double digits. Share was up strongly. It's one of our strongest growing businesses share-wise. And if you look at the underlying factors, it is strong retailer support as mentioned, it's household penetration returning to growth. On the brand, it's a growing category, even without the aggressive peak holiday discounts, heavy Grill sales, all of it really encouraging. So the vast majority of the sales and share growth is just on the core. And the good news is, there is so much opportunity left, given the performance in previous years, we are really just scratching the surface of what we can do to recover lost share growth, but also benefit from a category that clearly is on trend. Pellets itself is off to a strong start, and also continues to build and will also keep building in the fiscal year '21 season. But really it has not been a strong factor in the grand scheme of things as we think about the sales growth. So really solid momentum on Kingsford as we enter fiscal year '21 with so much opportunity ahead. Thanks, Linda and thanks to everybody. Thank you everyone again for joining us today. I hope that all of you and your families will stay healthy, and I also hope that our paths will cross again at some point after we get through this pandemic. And in the meantime, please stay well and Linda, Kevin and Lisah will speak to you about Clorox's Q1 fiscal year '21 results on November 20 -- no, on November 2. Thank you, all."

            "name": "Linda Rendle",
            "content": "Thanks, Benno. And hello to everyone on the call today. First, let me start off by saying just how excited I am to be Clorox' next CEO. After 17 years with the company, what makes me most proud about taking the reins from Benno is that Clorox is truly a special company. We have iconic brands people love and a wonderful values-led team that takes to heart our role in making people's lives better. Second, I'm optimistic about the company's future and look forward to working with the executive team to accelerate growth. This is a pivotal time for the company and there is no better time to be CEO at Clorox. What's become even clearer during this pandemic is that we're a Health and Wellness company at heart. Whether through our disinfecting products that support public health, our Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements that enhance wellness, or other essential products that people count on for their families and homes, I firmly believe that our global portfolio of trusted brands is in a strong position to address the shifting consumer mindsets and behaviors related to health and wellbeing. What's also clear is that we have a big opportunity to build on our momentum from fiscal year '20 for long-term value creation. And we're investing behind this momentum to support our ambition to accelerate profitable growth in fiscal year '21 and beyond. And finally before we begin Q&A, I want to take the opportunity to thank Benno for his just terrific leadership as CEO. Under Benno's guidance, Clorox more than doubled total shareholder return by putting innovation front and center, recognizing it's critical role in differentiating our products and brands to deliver superior consumer value. By investing in digital consumer engagement as a means to interact with people on their terms and through more personal experiences, and by taking ESG to the next level, challenging each of us to demonstrate its value to our business and society. Benno talked earlier about our commitment to Good Growth. Growth, that's profitable, responsible and sustainable. What he didn't say is that he was the one who introduced this. It captures most simply what we're all about. Profitable growth achieved the right way for our consumers, our shareholders and society. I've been very fortunate to work closely with Benno over the years. He has been a great mentor, and I look forward to continuing to partner with him to drive the business when I step into my role as CEO. Operator, you may now open it up for questions. Thanks, Andrea. I'll get us started here. So as Benno mentioned earlier, we're very serious about the role that we play in public health. And as we look at our cleaning and disinfecting portfolio, we see opportunity broadly in the US and International across several spaces and I'll outline high level what those are. The first is continuing to delight people with products in the retail space. We know that we are not able to meet the demands and that is priority number one is getting much supply as we possibly can into the retail space to ensure that consumers have products they need during this time. The same is true in our traditional professional business, which you highlighted is about 7% of sales in fiscal year '20 and has been a high single-digit grower for us over a number of years. So working on supply in both of those. With the opportunity that you highlighted is one that we're aggressively pursuing and that is the merger of those two areas. As people re-enter public life, they are looking to be reassured that the spaces they enter are clean and disinfected. And what they would be reassured by as a trusted brands like the brand Clorox, is to ensure that that space is clean. They have that reassurance in their mind. And we're helping businesses do is welcome people back, whether that would be their employees or their guests and by using and partnering with Clorox's protocols and brands. They can offer their guests that reassurance that the space is safe. That's how we're thinking about that broader what we're calling out of home opportunity. We staffed a dedicated team to go after these partnerships and have resulted in things like you highlighted with United Airlines, Cleveland Clinic, AMC Theaters and Uber Technologies. What will be really important for us moving forward though is getting supply. So these are in initial stages of agreements, and what we're looking for is increase supply before we continue to expand the test markets that we have today, but we're seeing very good consumer and business response in the initial days. And if you think about our B2C and B2B in total, I think the thing for us to consider is those lines will continue to blur as we move forward, and that's what we are really well suited to do with all of our technologies and capabilities. Yes. Our plan is on pace to increase supply versus what we committed in Q4, but what Benno highlighted is the key, the demand that we're seeing is significantly higher than we had expected in Q4, and we expect that demand to remain elevated as we head into fiscal year '21. Our increase that we were able to deliver on supply did support strong double-digit growth in our Cleaning businesses. But to be clear, we're not satisfied with our service levels right now, and we have the absolute highest urgency to improve. Some of the things we're pleased to see though and will give us confidence as we move into the fiscal year '21 is that our state -- our supply chain remains very stable. So we have had very few COVID related disruptions. We were able to bring on more than 10 new suppliers. The majority of those in disinfecting to help us to support the increase in demand. We had anticipated that some businesses would begin to recover quicker, and we have seen that in the case of bleach where in stock levels at retail are looking much stronger than they had been, despite the fact that we've been prioritizing Healthcare. And the key message for takeaway is we are aggressively investing to expand capacity. We are working across the entire supply chain all the way back into raw materials, up through manufacturing, packaging and conversion. And we expect sequential improvement in fiscal year '21 in meeting that increase in demand. Hi, Nik. Thanks for the question. So you're right, we're at a time where it is not a precise science right now to predict what the future is going to whole given what we're facing, but we are putting our analytics hard at work to understand what we think that future will look like. And if you take cleaning and disinfecting for example, we do strongly believe the category will remain elevated for the mid to long-term future and we're building capacity to address that. But how we're taking the approach on this one is to make sure that we build the right mid to long-term that allows us to have flexibility, and whether we in-house or we use co-packers for that production. So right now, as we've said we've added 10 new suppliers to help us with this incremental production and over time, if it's appropriate, we can insource that production, which helps us balance quality and cost, and also gets us to the right ratio from an efficiency perspective. So I feel really confident about our ability to do that and we're making choices that allow us to pivot depending on where this all shakes out. Yes. For a good portion of our businesses, Kingsford, Brita, Glad, Nutranext, for example, we feel like will be normalized by the end of the calendar, where we have a really good supply and demand match. From cleaning and disinfecting perspective, we do expect this to continue to be a ramp-up over the entire fiscal year. And we'll see sequential improvement throughout the fiscal year, but given the fact that cold and flu sits in the middle of the year, and then we expect the pandemic to be with us for the entirety of the year. It will take the full year to get up to the supply levels that we need to be at. Thanks, Nik. Thanks. Yes, you hit it on the head. The absolute number one priority is executing with excellence this year and increasing supply to meet the demand. We will be focused on delivering the plan that we put in place, which we have passion and conviction around. The business fundamentals are strong across categories. But we must do better on supply to meet demand. Second, IGNITE for us is the right strategy. I was the Lead Architect of that, got to lead our team in creating that and what it has done for us over these last many months as helped us lead through really troubling and volatile times. And what that strategy commits us to us putting people at the center of everything we do, knowing consumers and the people we serve in communities better than anyone, innovating great experiences for them with our products, and that's what we're going to continue to lean into. And we have a team of 8,800 people and an executive team that's passionate and own that strategy, and want to accelerate it. And that gets me to my third point. Where we place investment is in those IGNITE areas that we have passion and conviction around. We're going to lean into our global portfolio, and given the strength of it across the board, we will do what we always do is, we'll follow the money and where we think the best long-term value creation opportunities exist. Cleaning is certainly one of those areas and we've talked a lot about the opportunities we have there around the globe. And then last, what I'll leave you with is, we're committed to how we work. This pandemic has allowed us to re-imagine work quicker than we had ever imagined. Moving our people to work from home, keeping our essential workers healthy and our manufacturing running at full speed. But now what we imagine work will turn to is playing offense 100% of the time. That will be our focus. We use technology to do that to make quick decisions and pivot to put investment where we'll get the highest long-term return, but we feel really confident about those choices and we've managed a number of categories and brands for years and we always feel like we are able to put the investment where it's best suited and we'll do that again this year. And then NASA is a continued focus actually on the core, excuse me, Saudi Arabia is a continued focus on the core. We've been in that business for 50 years, and a joint venture with a family-owned business. It is core to our Cleaning business where we serve many countries in the Gulf region. And we have tremendous confidence in the ability for that business to continue strong growth in the future. It's core to Health and Wellness. We know that consumer has high demand for those products today. We saw double-digit growth in our Saudi Arabia business in fiscal year '20, and it's margin accretive to the company. So to us this isn't a right churn, but this is just a focus on what we talked about in International, which is accelerating profitable growth and leaning into areas that are stable and that we can ensure have long-term growth run rate for us. Thanks, Lauren. So we absolutely have the opportunity to meet more consumer demand in the US and International. And we're moving quickly with supply chain investments to support expansion in both. What I want you to take away is, we don't see a fundamental change in the composition between the percent of our business in the US and International. We see the ability to grow both strongly. But if you think about the International opportunity specifically, there are three things that we're focused on. The first is, we just need to increase supply to meet the demand that we have in the markets we're already in and the products that we already have in those locations. And we're focused on that just like we are in the US. The second is, we absolutely have an opportunity to expand our product forms in countries we compete in today. So for example, there are many places around the world where wipes have low penetration or we don't play and we see that as being an offering that consumers might be ready for in different areas of the world. And then the third, we are evaluating expansion into new geographies and we certainly see very high interest from consumers in different parts of the world for the Clorox brand in particular. And whether it's interest, we will look and see if there is long-term disciplined approach we can take to entering that market where we see strong return on investments. So that will be very consistent with how we've approached International to date. And that's what I would leave you with is, definite opportunity in International. No change in terms of how we think about the role it will play in our overall portfolio. And we'll be aggressive in pursuing opportunities when we have confidence in them."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President, Investor Relations for the Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin the conference.\nLisah Burhan: Thank you, Christine. Welcome everyone and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, our Chair and CEO and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. Before I go into results, I just want to express how grateful we are to be speaking to all of you today. This is clearly an unprecedented time. Our thoughts are with everyone who has been affected by this pandemic, especially those who have lost friends and loved ones. At the same time, we are also inspired by so many frontline healthcare workers, first responders, delivery and grocery workers, our own production employees and more. We are grateful to them for their selfless dedication to helping others. A few usual reminders before we go into results. We are broadcasting this call over the Internet and a replay of the call will be available for 7 days on our website, thecloroxcompany.com. On today\u2019s call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA, organic sales growth and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enable investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliations with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today\u2019s press release, this webcast\u2019s prepared remarks or supplemental information available on our website as well as in our SEC filings. In particular, it maybe helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today\u2019s earnings release. Please also recognize that today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements, including among others, statements related to the expected or potential impact of COVID-19. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management\u2019s current views, beliefs, assumptions and expectations and plans. I would also direct you to read forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release. Please review our most recent 10-K filings with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcome to differ materially from management\u2019s current views, beliefs, assumptions, expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Turning to today\u2019s discussion of our business results, I will start covering our top line commentary as usual with highlights in each of our segments. Kevin will then address our financial results as well as outlook for fiscal year 2020. Finally, Benno will offer his perspective and we will close with Q&A. For the total company, Q3 sales grew 15%, reflecting increases in every reportable segment. Organic sales were up 17%, supported by strong volume growth in all segments and significant demand of our products during the pandemic, products that either play an important role in public health or support the everyday lives of people, especially as they spend more time at home. In Cleaning segment, Q3 sales were up 32% for the quarter, with strong double-digit growth in all three businesses. For perspective, more than two-thirds of sales in this segment come from products with disinfecting claims. In Home Care, Q3 sales increased by strong double-digits behind broad-based growth across the portfolio, with all-time record shipments of Clorox disinfecting wipes, Clorox ToiletWand, Clorox cleanup disinfecting spray, Clorox disinfecting bathroom cleaner, Clorox Scentiva products and Clorox toilet bowl cleaner. Shipments were strong across all channels, but especially in non-tracked channels such as club and online, where volume growth was nearly double that in tracked channels. While early, we are encouraged to see from our data that the majority of the higher demand is coming from incremental households rather than just stockpiling or higher usage from existing users. With the pandemic expected to have a sustained positive impact on consumers\u2019 disinfecting and hygiene habits, we will invest further in our brands, turn incremental usage into loyalty. Laundry sales also grew by strong double-digits for the quarter fueled by high demand for Clorox Bleach. It has long been recommended by public health authorities for its disinfecting capabilities and the positive role it plays in public health. As we have mentioned in higher communication, we are running our plants around the clock to get our products to where they are needed the most. In the case of Clorox Bleach, we have been directing our shipments to healthcare facilities to prioritize supporting those on the frontlines of public health. Putting recent demand aside, our bleach compaction rollout is in line with expectations, with our Clorox laundry sanitizing products are now on shelf. Consistent with our IGNITE Strategy we will support our brands and innovations with strong marketing investment to drive awareness and trial at a time when hygiene and disinfection is top of mind for consumers. Lastly, within the Cleaning segment, our professional products business also saw strong double-digit sales growth driven by unprecedented demands from healthcare facilities and commercial cleaning institutions that rely on our portfolio of disinfecting products. In this channel, higher shipments are driven by higher usage as healthcare facilities are operating at full capacity and there is a step-up in cleaning protocol everywhere. Turning to the Household segment, Q3 sales were up 2%. Our Cat Litter sales were up strongly behind double-digit increase in volume as cat owners stocked up on essential products to care for their pets. Our Fresh Step Clean Paws product line continues to resonate well with consumers with all-time high record all-time record high shipments this quarter, even its third year after initial launch. We\u2019ll continue to build on this differentiated platform and also highlight the value proposition of our Scoop Away brand, which is seen as affordable yet high performing. Grilling saw solid sales growth for the quarter, with grilling occasions up significantly as consumers stayed home. Importantly, we began to see improvements in the base health of this business even before the surge in demand related to COVID-19. There was higher consumption in January and February, and our share of the total Grilling category was also up at the end of February in tracked channels. Our innovation in pellets, a growing segment, shipped in March, and we\u2019re in the process of expanding distribution, which will build throughout the grilling season. Early retailer response to our plans has been positive, helping drive strong sales. Going forward, we\u2019ll continue to build on this momentum, focusing on our strategy that includes enhancing consumer experience, implementing the right trade and pricing structure and investing in innovation. Glad sales were down slightly for the quarter. Like the other businesses, Glad also saw assertion demand as consumers stocked up on essentials to stay at home. However, that benefit for this business was more than offset by the negative impact from the loss of distribution at a customer. It\u2019s important to note that while there are many puts and takes in distribution in any particular quarter we expect an overall net gain in distribution by the end of this quarter through significant wins at other customers. Earlier this quarter, before the surge in demand from COVID-19, we had already begun to see share improvements due to progress, including price gap and increased distribution in tracked channels. And we\u2019ll continue to build on this progress, coupled with strong innovation and retail execution, return to profitable category growth. Going forward, we expect higher demand to continue accompanied by higher usage as long as consumers are staying at home. In RenewLife, sales declined by double-digits due to continued category and competitive headwinds. While there are early signs of progress and pockets of success, this business is not where we want it to be. We continue to believe this is a space with long-term tailwinds. Since we acquired this business, the category has fragmented more, including a proliferation of offerings that has led to an overall category deflation. We are actively partnering with retailers to reinvigorate the category. We have been seeing volume growth with two of our three top customers. Our brand re-launch in FY 2021 is on track. In our Lifestyle segment, sales grew 10%, reflecting growth in three of four businesses. Brita sales were up high double digits on top of very strong results in the year ago quarter. Our data shows that people are seeking out Brita filtration systems and filters to ensure they have access to clean, great-tasting water during this pandemic. Brita is a business that has been building momentum even before the onset of the global pandemic, with consistent volume growth dating back more than a year. During this recession, we will be focusing our marketing communication on value to further build on the good progress we\u2019ve made in household penetration and share to drive profitable growth in the long run. Food sales were up strongly for the quarter driven by higher shipments of bottle Hidden Valley Ranch dressing and Dry Hidden Valley Ranch seasoning as many more people cook at home. The surge in demand due to COVID-19 builds on an already strong momentum within the Hidden Valley franchise, which has grown share in tracked channels for 21 consecutive quarters. Going forward, we expect this momentum to continue. The last recession, our Food business grew as people ate at home. The strong results in this quarter are allowing us to invest further in building our fast-growing online presence to capitalize on the ongoing shift to this channel. Sales were up strongly for the quarter driven by continued strength in Lip Care and Face Care. And sales were driven by volume growth due to innovation, including double-digit shipment increases for both renewal and sensitive skin line. Also contributing to the strong growth this quarter were higher shipments of personal hygiene products, in particular, cleansers, moisturizers, baby care products that are so important to protecting families today. In March, the overall Beauty segment was negatively impacted by store closures as well as lower foot traffic in stores that remain open. As the stay-home measures are prolonged, consumer shopping patterns have also changed. While we expect the near-term while we expect softness in the near term with this category continuing to be negatively impacted, we believe the future of this business is bright as fundamentals of our Burt\u2019s Bees brand remains very strong. Finally, sales for Nutranext were down by double-digits this quarter, mainly driven by a disruption of our supply chain related to COVID-19. While orders reached a record high in March, fulfillment was challenged due to a shortage of labor at our third-party distributor in the face of the pandemic. Excluding the impact of the supply disruption, our strategic brands would have grown strongly. Lastly, turning to International, sales were up 11% for the quarter driven mainly by 60% volume growth as we saw very high demand from not just our cleaning and disinfecting products, but also our household essential household products. Growth was broad-based with double-digit volume increases in every single region. Sales were also impacted by unfavorable foreign currency headwinds of about 11%, partially offset by the benefits of pricing, which was implemented before the onset of the pandemic. With cleaning and disinfecting products accounting for more than half of the segment sales, expect consumer demand in International to remain elevated in the near-term. Now, I will turn it over to Kevin, who will discuss our Q3 financial performance and our updated outlook for FY 2020.\nKevin Jacobsen: Thank you, Lisah and thank you everyone for joining us today, particularly during this difficult time. We hope you and your loved ones are well. I\u2019m extremely proud of the strong financial results we delivered this quarter as they reflect how our company responded so quickly to address an unprecedented demand for disinfecting products and our other trusted products people count on every day as they shelter in place during this global pandemic. The impact from COVID-19 had a significant impact on our third quarter results. At the same time, I am also encouraged by the continued progress we see in our core business prior to the increased sales as a result of COVID-19. In addition to our strong sales performance, we delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion and another quarter of strong cash flow. And as you saw in our press release, with this quarter\u2019s strong performance and our expectation for continued strong demand for our products in the fourth quarter, we have raised our fiscal year outlook, which I will discuss in a moment. Turning to our third quarter results, sales increased 15%, reflecting 18 points of volume growth, partially offset by two points of unfavorable foreign currency headwinds and one point of unfavorable price/mix. On an organic sales basis, third quarter sales grew 17%. Additionally, based on the trends we were seeing in the quarter prior to the impact of COVID-19, sales are tracking in line with our original plan to return to organic sales growth in the back half of the fiscal year. Gross margin for the quarter increased 330 basis points to 46.7% compared to 43.4% for the year ago quarter. Third quarter gross margin included the benefits of increased volume as well as 150 basis points from cost savings and 90 basis points from pricing, primarily in our international markets to offset inflation. These factors were partially offset by 70 basis points of higher trade spending, 60 basis points of unfavorable mix and assortment as well as 50 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs. Third quarter gross margin also reflected ongoing cost favorability in commodities, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency headwinds. Additionally, while we did begin to incur costs late in the third quarter in our supply chain as a result of COVID-19, these costs will be more pronounced in our fourth quarter. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales came in at 15.1% compared to 13.9% in the year ago quarter. This higher rate primarily reflects higher year-over-year incentive compensation expense, consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy. In addition to higher incentive compensation expense, it also includes donations we made to nonprofit organizations in support of COVID-19 relief. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels as a percentage of sales came in at about 10% of sales or about equal to the year ago quarter. On an absolute basis spending increased about $23 million versus year ago quarter. Additionally, spending in our U.S. retail business came in at nearly 12% of sales. Importantly, we continue to invest in our brands and are not reducing investment levels during this period of heightened demand. Our third quarter effective tax rate was about 19% compared to about 22% in the year ago quarter due to higher excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation. Net of all these factors, we delivered diluted net earnings per share of $1.89 versus $1.44 in the year ago quarter, an increase of 31%. Turning to cash flow, at the end of Q3, year-to-date net cash provided by operations increased to $806 million from $603 million in the year ago period. The 34% year-over-year increase was primarily driven by lower working capital due to reduced inventory positions to support increased demand and profitable sales growth. Now I will turn to our fiscal year 2020 outlook, which we have updated and noted in our press release. Our fiscal year sales outlook is now expected to be in the range of 4% to 6% growth driven by increased demand for our products as a result of COVID-19. Our sales outlook also reflects our ongoing efforts to accelerate the sales momentum of our portfolio, fueled by strong customer plans, meaningful back half innovation programs and higher consumer investments, leading to increased distribution. Our updated sales outlook continues to assume about two points of foreign exchange headwinds. Our fiscal year organic sales outlook now assumes a range of 6% to 8% growth. Turning to gross margin, we now expect fiscal year gross margin to be up strongly or about 100 basis points, reflecting the continued benefit of operating leverage driven by our sales momentum, strong cost savings and favorable category mix as our Cleaning segment grows at an accelerated rate. This will be partially offset by temporary increased investments we are making within our production team in the form of increased wages and benefits as well as enhanced safety measures. In addition to investing in our team, we are incurring increased transportation and warehousing costs as we expedite shipments to our customers to support the heightened demand for our products. We estimate these temporary cost increases to negatively impact our fourth quarter gross margin by about 250 basis points. We continue to expect fiscal year advertising and sales promotion investment levels to be about 10% of sales. We now expect selling and administrative expenses to come in at about 15% of sales, reflecting anticipated higher incentive compensation, consistent with our commitment to our pay-for-performance philosophy. We now expect fiscal year EBIT margin to be up modestly, reflecting strong gross margin expansion, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses. We now expect our fiscal year effective tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 22% due to higher excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation. Net of all these factors, we now expect fiscal year 2020 diluted EPS to be in the range of $6.70 to $6.90. While this range is wider than what we would normally provide at this time of year, we think the range is appropriate given the heightened volatility we are managing, which makes estimating our fourth quarter results more challenging as they will be influenced by a number of factors we don\u2019t directly control and are difficult to predict accurately at this time. Importantly, this outlook assumes minimal supply chain disruptions for the remainder of the fiscal year. Additionally, we have temporarily suspended both of our share repurchase programs. While the company maintains a very strong balance sheet and access to additional capital, we believe this is a prudent action to take while we further assess the environment and our capital allocation plans. Before I turn over to Benno, I would like to reinforce that I am pleased with the progress we continue to make on our base business. We have begun to rebuild distribution in the third quarter prior to the impact of COVID-19 and I expect that to continue this quarter. Additionally, we remain on track to deliver another strong year of cost savings and we continue to increase brand investment in support of our strong innovation program focused on improving consumer value. Additionally, I am pleased with our team\u2019s effort to significantly increase manufacturing production capacity while continuing to operate safely to help provide essential products needed during this global health crisis. We have made good progress to date and expect to continue to expand disinfection production capacity over the balance of the calendar year and beyond, supported by the resiliency of our supply chain. To-date, we have had no major disruptions, with all of our plants currently running and the vast majority of our contract manufacturers and suppliers continuing to operate. And finally, with accelerating revenue and cash flow, Clorox maintains a strong investment-grade balance sheet, giving the company plenty of financial flexibility. I believe Clorox is well positioned to manage through an economic recession while capitalizing on changing consumer behaviors as a result of this health crisis. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Benno.\nBenno Dorer: Thanks, Kevin. We appreciate all of you joining the call today. Our hearts go out to everyone who has been impacted by this global health crisis and we hope that you and your families are safe and well. Clorox is a health and wellness company at heart. And during these past few months, our mission has never been clearer. In the uncharted territory presented by COVID-19, we knew it was important to act quickly to help, always grounded in our most important company value, do the right thing. We know that the public is counting on the Clorox Company and our products around the world, and our team of 8,800 strong is stepping up every day to make a difference the right way. With this in mind, here are the three important takeaways from today\u2019s call. First, I am proud of our people\u2019s leadership and passion in serving public health, which has been rewarded by our consumers, customers and the communities we serve and has led to strong Q3 financial results. Back in early January, we activated our company to guide our response to increased supply to protect public health and people and we have pursued three priorities since then front and center: first, protecting the health, safety and well-being of our employees; second, making cash and product contributions to support caregivers and other organizations providing coronavirus relief; and third, maximizing supply to get our products where they are needed most. In the U.S., our employees qualify as critical infrastructure workers, because we make essential household products. Our third quarter results reflect directly on the outstanding job our people are doing in the face of extraordinary circumstances and the health and well-being and that of our families is top of mind. To support those who continue to work in our facilities, we have enhanced our infection prevention measures with increased pay and added benefits for the frontline workers making our products. For our broader global team, we have established an initial $1 million employee relief fund to provide COVID-19 support to them and their families. For more than 100 years, the Clorox Company has helped communities in times of global health crisis and natural disasters. As we work with our communities to help support them in battling this crisis, we have now committed about $14 million in cash and product donations. In addition to our initial $5 million to support caregivers on the front lines, our additional support extends to organizations such as Feeding America and Americares as well as local organizations in the United States and internationally, helping to meet the needs of vulnerable populations in our communities. Clearly, we have faced extraordinary demand for our products, especially our disinfecting products. To try and meet demand to the greatest extent possible, we have been running our cleaning and disinfecting product plants 24/7. To increase output, we have accessed third-party supply sources focused on manufacturing of disinfecting products and those that can be supplied most quickly, and we\u2019ve been partnering with suppliers and retailers to get product where it is needed the most. In the United States in Q3, we supplied 40 million more disinfecting units for consumers and end users for an increase of more than 40% versus the year ago quarter. We are very grateful to our heroic production associates who made this possible. Additionally, we continue to find new ways to produce more disinfecting wipes and other products such as germicidal bleach for healthcare facilities. Importantly, we have zero tolerance for price gouging. And we want to ensure that everyone has access to our sanitizing and disinfecting products at standard prices at all times and especially now. As such, we have taken aggressive action to combat price gouging, including partnering with online retail platforms to identify and remove such offers or sellers in the third-party marketplace. As needed, we are collaborating with law enforcement agencies in connection with third-party price gouging increase regarding disinfecting products. More than ever, in an uncertain environment, people turn to trusted brands they can count on. And Clorox has the most trusted brands in many of the categories we compete in. And we see that reflected in strong market share performance and in rising household penetration on many of our U.S. brands. We also see it in strong double-digit sales growth, a sixth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion and a 31% diluted EPS growth this last quarter. My second message is I feel good about the progress we\u2019re making on our core business, which also contributed to our strong Q3 growth and is on track against our expectations for the back half. In Q3, before the impact of COVID-19, volume and sales growth trends were in line with expectations, and we were seeing the anticipated distribution gains. We were particularly pleased with the significant progress we were making on our Grilling business. Shared rents have been improving prior to the impact of COVID-19 and have accelerated since then. I am pleased that we grew share in six out of nine businesses in tracked channels. Our strong innovation program for the back half played a meaningful part in these improvements. In Grilling, we launched the new Kingsford hardwood pellets, which helped gain strong retailer traction for our 2020 grilling season plans and we will build distribution throughout the season. In Laundry, we started shipping our compacted bleach product, and we are very pleased with initiatives performance to date. Other innovations are off to promising starts, including a new platform of Clorox odor-eliminating fabric sanitizers and a new Glad Flex\u2019n Seal food storage bags that stretch around food to keep it fresh, which builds on a highly successful presence and innovation. One exception to our Q3 innovation plans was our new Clorox compostable cleaning wipes, which were off to a tremendous start. However, we made a deliberate choice to temporarily suspend their production in order to prioritize disinfecting wipes at this time. We will pick up on this initiative as soon as possible and remain very excited about its future prospects. What\u2019s important to understand is our business is performing well at its core. Prior to the impact of the pandemic, we were very pleased with the trends we were seeing in the majority of the business. We were rebuilding distribution, sales were strong and gross margin was continuing to expand. We expect those core trends to continue in the fourth quarter, even as we experience further impact from COVID-19. And my last point today is we remain confident that our strong portfolio, our IGNITE Strategy, our organization and our core capabilities will position us to pursue emerging opportunities and to manage through the expected near-term challenges to perform well and generate long-term shareholder value. As we are facing a period of volatility with the global economy now in economic recession, there are a number of external factors we\u2019re monitoring. COVID-19 will continue to impact global consumer behavior, future government actions and our supply chain, and it\u2019s difficult to predict the near-term future. With predictions that personal income will decline during the recession as unemployment rises, we anticipate discretionary spending will contract as consumers prioritize essentials. At the same time, we are seeing new households entering several of our categories, and we will invest strongly to turn many of them into loyal consumers. Most prominently, early indications are that the heightened awareness of the role disinfecting products play in public health brought about by this pandemic may be more lasting than following past global health crisis and will provide a meaningful long-term growth trend for our company. Clorox is the most trusted brand in the United States home care category with differentiated products fueled by a strong innovation program and our commitment to strongly invest in this business. We\u2019re optimistic about our future prospects given the elevated role disinfecting products will have in consumers\u2019 lives for the foreseeable future. Moreover, our portfolio has proven to be relatively recession resilient in the past as major Clorox categories like trash, grilling and food generally benefit from consumers eating out less as well as water filtration as consumers recognize the superior value of Brita filtered water when comparing to bottled water. The percentage of our U.S. portfolio that is seen by consumers as delivering superior value was at an all-time high level since we began using this measure, positioning our brands well as we enter this recession. We will remain keenly focused on consumer value through strong brand investments, meaningful innovation and adequate price gaps. And given our expanding margins and strong cash flow, backed by a strong portfolio, strategy and core capabilities, Clorox is uniquely positioned to play offense by leaning into investments in the long-term health of our business. As we manage through an unprecedented business environment near term, we remain committed to long-term value creation for our shareholders and all stakeholders, and we\u2019ll continue to be a purpose-driven business, committed to ESG and to doing the right thing. This core value of our company has served us well since 1913, and it has never been more important than now. Operator, you may now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Dorer. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you and hope all is well and congrats on your results. So Benno, I was hoping if you can comment on your increasing production capacity into the fourth quarter. And I understand you were using third parties and using some of this capacity that you always had through peak season of cold and flu. So if you can comment on, obviously, in the sanitizing and in all your portfolio, which I understand is about 20% to 25%, and into the International, too, if you can keep that production. And in terms of consumption trends against shipments, if you can update us if you\u2019re still seeing a lot of demand from replenishing inventories at the shelf and also what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the grilling season for the other products you commented on the prepared remarks, but just to see if you can position us on the other portions of the portfolio? And then I have a follow-up on the gross margin, then I will pass it on.\nBenno Dorer: Yes. Thanks, Andrea. That\u2019s a lot of good ground to cover. And product supply, of course, is on everybody\u2019s mind. What we\u2019ve commented on is that demand has been clearly unprecedented, and we\u2019re in uncharted territory for our supply chain, in particular, in disinfecting products. Typically, if you think about supply chains, they\u2019re built to be in the sweet spot of quality, safety, efficiency, cost, effectiveness required to produce the necessary output for the long term. But when you have situations like we faced where, in March, we saw demand spikes for some of our disinfecting products of 500-plus percent, I think it\u2019s evident to everybody that despite heroic efforts, you have out of stocks. And clearly, we are continuing to see out of stocks. We\u2019re really proud of how our organization has responded. As Kevin commented, we haven\u2019t seen any major supply disruptions on our side. We have been able to increase our production of disinfecting products by 40%. We focused on fewer SKUs. We saw great partnership and patience from retailers, and I want to thank all of them for it to help us bring products to market as quickly as possible. We accepted incremental costs like air freighting, speeding up the supply chain to serve stores as quickly as possible. And as you commented, we activated third-party suppliers to help us cope with the surge in demand. We will continue to do that. We continue to find new ways to increase our capacity. We should see meaningful continued improvement this summer. And of course, we are also investing in the right capacity long term as we expect that demand for disinfecting products is going to be elevated for a long time as they will continue to play significantly increased role in people\u2019s lives. As we\u2019ve commented, we\u2019re seeing very little stockpiling. We\u2019re seeing a lot of use come from incremental households and in disinfecting, in particular. As you think about the future, as people stay home, they will want to protect themselves. At some point, when countries open up again, they will want to stay safe when they get out. And we have a lot of to-go products as well, in particular, with wipes. So that will continue to drive demand. Demand continues to be exorbitantly high. As you look at consumption data in tracked channels, it\u2019s very, very high. And of course, that doesn\u2019t factor in the fact that there\u2019s a lot of latent demand given the out-of-stocks, which as people see wipes in store, they grab them and they are pretty much sold out right away. And we\u2019re far from refilling customer inventories. Typically, customers keep about four weeks of inventory. So at some point, hopefully, we\u2019ll be able to also refill inventories, which will also give us an opportunity to keep selling a lot of wipes sometime in the future. As we said, in the U.S., wipes is or disinfecting products account for about one-fourth of our sales. It\u2019s definitely more right now, but we will see an elevation in demand for a while. We\u2019ve also commented that in International, that number is about 50% of our sales being in disinfecting products. And of course, we\u2019re seeing about the same dynamics there. So we feel like this is ongoing demand that we\u2019ll be able to serve. On many of our other product lines were on allocation as well given the spikes in demand. But we expect to come out of that this quarter, which will help us. And I feel like on our core business, the demand continues to be high. We made a lot of progress even before the pandemic, as we\u2019ve commented. But there are a number of product categories that see higher demand as consumers stay home. Grilling, of course, is one of them. We\u2019re really pleased with the progress on Grilling even before the pandemic as we made strong progress to engage retailers in our 2020 grilling season, and we were rewarded with much better plans. Clearly, as we think about Grilling, there\u2019s not a lot of merchandising happening right now, so we expect that to partially offset the growth that we\u2019re seeing. Memorial Day usually is a big grilling occasion, and I doubt that we will see a lot of merchandising at this point around Memorial Day, said that it\u2019s offset by a really strong base business. So in a nutshell, supply has been difficult. We have done extraordinary work to meet the demand as best as we can. We expect substantial improvements this summer, both in disinfecting as well as earlier, perhaps on our core business. And we\u2019re not seeing demand slowdown. If you think about the midpoint of our fiscal year sales outlook, which we\u2019ve increased to 4% to 6%, it still assumes a double-digit sales growth in Q4. So that tells you that we believe that elevated consumption is going to be around for a while.\nAndrea Teixeira: That\u2019s helpful, Benno. But if you if I can also ask on the gross margin point, but before we go into the gross margin, just even if you do the midpoint of your range, it sounds a little conservative to everything you\u2019ve just said. So I was wondering if it\u2019s just a level of being conservative at this point, just for the puts and takes and potentially retailers facing their own issues because it looks like as everything you\u2019ve said in the prepared remarks and now indicates that you can safely be at the top of that range or is it just like you\u2019re trying to be conservative given the uncertainty?\nBenno Dorer: Yes. We think we have a balanced outlook, Andrea. As you think about the range also, 4% to 6% with one quarter to go, and you can do the math, that implies a very wide range. Again, we think it\u2019s balanced. We think that there is a lot of uncertainty as far as the consumer is concerned. We\u2019re assuming that supply is not going to be disrupted, importantly. And as we learn more about asymptomatic cases, and the safety of our employees is very critical. And of course, for us, it\u2019s important to continue to be able to manufacture the way we have, but we can\u2019t take that for granted. So I would say, at this point, this is our best foot forward with a wide range, and it\u2019s a balanced outlook. And perhaps Kevin can comment on gross margin. Do you want to?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes. The nature of the question, though. Did you have a question, Andrea, specifically related to gross margin?\nAndrea Teixeira: Yes. Yes. I appreciate the time. And just quickly on your point about 250 basis points, is that just the separate logistics impact or you are saying that we should be seeing it seems to me just an isolated impact and temporary? But obviously, it\u2019s the trend for gross margin, as we implied in the guidance, is up for the fourth quarter.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes. So thank you for the question. On the 250 bps, we do believe that\u2019s temporary. It\u2019s really related to two items. We are investing more with our production team, as I mentioned, both in wages and benefits as well as enhanced cleaning measures. So that\u2019s part of it. As well as I think Benno just mentioned some of the specifics, the increased transportation, warehousing costs we\u2019re incurring. And I\u2019d say that\u2019s going to continue until we can catch up with the demand signal. So I\u2019d expect in the near term, that\u2019s something we\u2019ll see hitting margin. And we\u2019ll have to see how this plays out. That will be very much influenced by the shape of the demand.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Strycula from UBS.\nSteven Strycula: Hi. Good afternoon and congratulations on a very strong quarter. So Benno, I have a question as retailers have a newfound appreciation for some of the disinfectant strength that you guys have in your portfolio. How are your conversations going as retailers think about planning forward, maybe for fall, winter resets, in terms of the amount of linear display space for some of the disinfection products? And then as you think about your International business, given that COVID is a global pandemic situation, does this extend your portfolio reach and use maybe the wipes business as a foot forward into some markets where maybe you didn\u2019t have a strong presence previously?\nBenno Dorer: Yes, international first, Steve. So we do think that this gives us an opportunity to think about international expansion plans. And without getting into too much detail, we\u2019re certainly expecting that disinfecting, in general and perhaps wipes, in particular, are going to be seeing a lot of consumer demand. And this would give us an opportunity to serve more consumers. So it\u2019s something we certainly look at and something that, as we have no shortage of dry powder to invest in growth, we would be willing to invest in should there be profitable opportunities that we can take advantage of with an eye on sustainable competitive advantage. So we would probably not be interested in opportunistic market entries. But where we see a strategic long-term opportunity, we\u2019re certainly prepared to take advantage of it and we are seeing what you see on this. As far as retailer conversations, I will tell you that most of the conversations right now are about meeting the current demand, which is difficult enough. But what I would expect, of course, is that we\u2019re going to have those discussions with retailers at the right time. And they certainly see the numbers as we see them. It\u2019s a lot of incremental usage coming out of disinfecting products. The wipes household penetration sits a little north of 50%. Bleach is about the same. So and what we\u2019re seeing more recently is that the household penetration on those two categories is climbing. So that would suggest that there is an opportunity to expand shelf space in those two categories. But it\u2019s a conversation that still lies ahead of us, but it could certainly contribute to what we believe to be strong ongoing opportunities to serve more consumers with disinfecting products through the right amount of shelf space in store.\nSteven Strycula: Thank you.\nBenno Dorer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Hey, thanks. Good to hear your voices. Benno, just to build on your capacity planning comments and cleaning, as you think about getting ahead of the structural demand for disinfecting that you mentioned, not just in the U.S. in the near term but perhaps also over time overseas, how are you thinking about capacity builds against that backdrop? And should we begin to think of elevated CapEx associated with that or can this all be handled through third-party supply?\nBenno Dorer: I\u2019ll let Kevin comment on CapEx. But we are prepared to invest and, frankly, have started investing in more capacity in disinfecting with an eye on the long-term because of the anticipated demand. And it will be a mix, but typically, we, on an ongoing basis, always like to manufacture our products in-house because we can deliver the right combination of quality and cost. So I\u2019ll let Kevin give you his detailed perspective on how we should be thinking about CapEx.\nKevin Jacobsen: Hi, Steve. As it relates to CapEx, typically, we spend about 3% of sales each year on CapEx. We\u2019re doing the work right now. But I suspect, as we look to fiscal year 2021, we\u2019ll be closer to 4%. And it\u2019s really for the reasons Benno just talked about. We see a number of opportunities to increase investments and expanding capacity of our self-manufacturing facilities because as I think you\u2019re hearing from us today, we\u2019re seeing heightened demand certainly in Q3 and our Q4. We expect this to continue over a longer term basis. And so we are leaning in right now to start increasing capacity, and we\u2019re investing right now to do that.\nSteve Powers: Okay, thank you. And then if I could just follow up real quick on the household business and Glad specifically. Clearly, a step back on the distribution loss in the third quarter. But if I heard you correctly, Lisah, I think you spoke of net wins as of the fourth quarter. So I guess net of all the moving parts, how should we think about your shipments relative to takeaway in the fourth quarter and beyond as everything settles out across the market based on that? Thanks.\nBenno Dorer: Yes. So first of all, I will say that this distribution loss which occurred was contemplated in the previous outlook. So it\u2019s not a change to the previous outlook. We knew this for a while. And as we think about by quarter, it\u2019s simply a timing saying, so we lost this in Q3. But for the total back half of the fiscal year, as Lisah has commented, we expect distribution points to be up because we will get significant wins with other customers, including new distribution with significant customers. So it\u2019s a net positive. And what we expect is, for the midterm, this business should do quite well given that it\u2019s also positively impacted by the pandemic as people stay home more. But we\u2019re also, as you will have seen, growing share market share quite significantly as a result of not just the improved distribution position but also some spillover from the lost distribution. We know that some Glad consumers are willing to change stores to buy their brands. And of course, the core fundamentals, as we think about innovation, as we think about price gaps, which we have continued to invest in, continue to improve. So we\u2019re comfortable with where Glad is and the path forward on the business.\nSteve Powers: Yes, okay. I just want to make sure I hear I mean my impression based on all that is that we should think about shipments coming in ahead of wherever consumption lands in the fourth quarter. But before I walk away with that, I just want to test that hypothesis with you.\nBenno Dorer: Yes. So we always try to stay away from being that specific on any business forward-looking, so bear with us at this point. You will continue to see the negative impact of the loss distribution for a while, right? But that will be partially offset by or it will be offset by the distribution gains that we\u2019re adding. So it\u2019s going to be a little bit noisy for a quarter or two, but it will normalize after that period of time.\nSteve Powers: Okay, fair enough. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi from RBC.\nNik Modi: Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. I hope everyone is doing well. Benno, I\u2019m curious how you would think about answering this question because I\u2019ve been thinking about it a lot. There\u2019s just so much trial. I mean how much marketing do you think sorry. How many marketing dollars do you think Clorox would have had to spend in order to get the kind of top line that you have right now? And the reason why I ask that question is this seems, I hope, like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity where so many consumers are trying these brands and some for the first time across a wide ring of demographics. And how you can spend or lean into that to really engage them to create the stickiness. Now I know everyone is more focused on disinfecting, but I\u2019m talking also about charcoal and your other products, salad dressing, etcetera. So I don\u2019t know how you want to approach that question, but I\u2019m just curious, like how much do you think how much value was created by this situation across your portfolio?\nBenno Dorer: So we are not going to be a company that\u2019s going to cut advertising. For us, advertising is a long-term investment. And as you say, we have a unique opportunity now to turn trial into loyal users. One of our IGNITE Strategies, as you probably recall, is to increase the number of people we have a close personal relationship with in the United States from 20 million to 100 million people over the next five years. Now we\u2019re getting a lot of incremental people in, and it\u2019s our opportunity to hold on to that volume. So in the back half of this fiscal year, we will spend $50 million, 5-0, more than in the previous year. And that tells you the stance that we are taking. We will play offense. We think that advertising investment is a very good investment. Clearly, the ROIs, in theory, they\u2019re a little lower right now than they would be if we didn\u2019t have out of stocks. But the ROIs are still very good. And we\u2019re not spending to make quarter commitments, but we\u2019re spending to build the long-term equity of our brands. How we spend is different. For instance, as you think about our disinfecting products, we\u2019re trying to be useful in people\u2019s lives. We\u2019re trying to live the purpose that we have created for the Clorox brand. And in this particular case, we are spending a lot of money on consumer education, in making sure that people use our brands the right way and in helping them be safe. That is a great investment because at this time, brands need to show up. And at this time, people make up their minds as to whether they trust the brands or not. And for Clorox, we believe that it\u2019s a unique opportunity to continue to build trust in our brands, to hold on to the increased trial that we are seeing. And as a result, we will be very bullish with our advertising spend and not cut any single dollars. Like I said, we\u2019re spending $50 million more in the back half. And I would expect us to continue to spend quite strongly in the next fiscal year as well.\nNik Modi: Very helpful. And then if I could, just a quick question on the Glad distribution loss. I know you\u2019ve already budgeted for it, but can you just talk a little bit what was driving the distribution loss? Like what happened?\nBenno Dorer: We typically don\u2019t do that. It\u2019s a discussion that happens between a retailer and the manufacturer. So I\u2019d prefer not to comment as in all cases, just to protect the integrity of the conversations that we have with retailers. But it\u2019s a good retailer. It\u2019s a good partner of ours. We\u2019re growing very strongly with them in other parts of the portfolio. And we\u2019re also optimistic perhaps that at some point, we can have a different kind of conversation in this category with the same customer as we might have had in previous categories. So respect their decision, don\u2019t agree with the decision, we\u2019ll have to see how it works for them. And in the meantime, we\u2019re very comfortable with where we are on Glad and our plans on the business going forward.\nNik Modi: Fair enough. Thank you, Benno.\nBenno Dorer: Thanks, Nik.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy from Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. And I hope that you\u2019re doing well. I wanted to pick up, Benno, if we could, on the topic of disinfectants and hygiene products but bring it to the company\u2019s long-term guidance. So as you are well aware, there\u2019s a lot of pushback on these calls, I think, for a number of years on your prior guidance, the 3% to 5% organic sales growth and the achievability of it. And so it was just this past October, as you guys are well aware, that you trimmed it down to 2% to 4%. And now just building on the discussion in terms of increased consumer demand in some of your big product categories like disinfectants, it seems like this is certainly going to be more lasting. You\u2019re seeing an increase in household penetration, you\u2019re increasing capacity. So clearly, that\u2019s a view that you guys share as well. But I was just hoping that you could comment, maybe you could quantify this a bit in terms of what you see as the appropriate long-term algorithm now for the company getting beyond this period of pantry load and so forth. But over the next three to five years, is 3% to 5%, again, more relevant? If so, where do you think is sort of appropriate as you guys are planning within that range? So thanks for that.\nBenno Dorer: So I think you will understand how we\u2019re not going to give any numbers or any updated view on our long-term sales guidance. Like we said, we think that there\u2019s going to be continued heightened consumer engagement, and that gives us an opportunity to serve more consumers in the U.S. and international. At the same time, I\u2019d also expect that it\u2019s going to be a more competitive space. As you know, we always worry about competition, and this is going to be an attractive category. And we will have to see what happens to the competitive landscape in the future. And then, of course, there\u2019s other puts and takes, right? So if I think about Burt\u2019s Bees right now, which, as you all know, has been an incredible success story for the company for a very long time, and we expect that to pick up at some point. But personal care businesses, in particular, are challenged. So I think there\u2019s going to be puts and takes. We\u2019re certainly thinking about what the right algorithm might be. We are having the right conversations internally. And at the right time, if we believe there\u2019s a change, we\u2019ll communicate it. Now is not that time. We\u2019re comfortable with the 2% to 4%. Near term, like we said in our fiscal year outlook, we expect elevated demand, but it\u2019s way too early to say how this will translate into long-term value creation. The important thing to take away, though, beyond the numbers is that we will aggressively invest into it. We will play offense, and we will put ourselves in the best possible position in the retail and the professional business to serve as many consumers and institutional customers as we possibly can. And then we\u2019ll see what comes out of that.\nKevin Grundy: Okay, thanks Ben. I will pass it on. Good luck guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney from Consumer Edge.\nJonathan Feeney: Good morning and thanks very much. And appreciate your leadership in all of this. Kevin, you gave us a couple of figures, and just a simplistic question. Can you tell us what either global takeaway was or U.S. takeaway was as far as you can? I\u2019m just trying to understand what that will mean when we come to model next year and try to compare and see how this big surge of volume sort of smooths out over a few quarters. And secondly, on the cost front, it strikes me that your cost structure looking over the next year, so 12 months from now, not the rest of the fiscal year, which is probably pretty fixed, is pretty petro heavy. And can you give me a sense how much that is that right? And how much your sort of prospective look at those sorts of input costs has come down since, say, the past say, maybe January 1 when some changes in the price of energy and some of these upstream components? Thanks very much.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes. Thanks, Jonathan. On the second question related to our cost inputs, you see the same data we see, which, clearly, there\u2019s a significant pullback in the price of oil. But we\u2019re also seeing that in the resin market. But I\u2019d tell you to a much lesser degree because I think there\u2019s some structural issues going on in oil, it\u2019s going to get to pull back much further. I would say this. I think a lot of that is going to be driven by global demand more so than input costs. With GDP globally continue to decline, I think that will continue to put downward pressure on cost inputs, particularly in the energy complex. And for us, that really plays out in a couple of areas. So obviously, for us, resin is a big component of our buy, and that\u2019s most pronounced on our Glad business. Keep in mind, though, in Glad, as we see cost inputs coming down on resin, typically, that means heightened trade spending within the category. And that\u2019s really how the category is managed, that, that flows through to consumers through the form of increased trade. So as resin prices come down, I would expect to see increased trade spending on the Bags and Wraps business across the categories. And then as it relates to oil, oil usually takes six months or so to work through our supply chain. So if oil stays down at these levels, this $20 a barrel level it looks like it\u2019s projecting over the next few months, that certainly would be a tailwind for us going out for the foreseeable future. Now I think it\u2019s probably too early to know that for sure. But certainly, if you look at the environment today, it certainly suggests that\u2019s possible. And then, Jonathan, say more on your global takeaway. Tell me more what you\u2019re looking for in that question.\nJonathan Feeney: Pretty simple. Whenever you told about we know what U.S. takeaway is or at least your measured channels. You told us that club and e-com was something like double that rate. I assume that\u2019s just a U.S. number. I\u2019m wondering if you could give us if you think about global takeaway through retail, like how as it compares to your total global sales number or the U.S. version of that, just an actual number as opposed to double the rate, etc.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes. I mean I\u2019d say a few things. As we\u2019ve talked, our volume growth is about 18% as a company. And International, we had very strong volume growth as well, very close to that. So our International business is growing at a fairly comparable rate to what we\u2019re seeing in the U.S. And again, because of what we talked about, this is a global health crisis, and we have an international portfolio that\u2019s very lined up to address this and help consumers. And so we\u2019re seeing strong growth broadly. As I think about tracked versus non-tracked, we are seeing elevated growth in non-tracked channels. It\u2019s probably growing 10-plus points higher than tracked right now. But I think that\u2019s also not surprising. We\u2019re seeing very strong growth in e-com, and we\u2019re seeing very strong growth in club as consumers are even ordering from home or they\u2019re trying to order in larger quantities. So we\u2019re seeing those channels grow at an accelerated rate right now.\nJonathan Feeney: Okay. That helps a lot. Thank you very much.\nKevin Jacobsen: Thanks, Jonathan.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman from Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Thanks, and good afternoon. I just wanted to ask a little about the commercial environment because I would expect and hope that there\u2019s some pullback on promotional activity with demand trending so high. Promotion was still mentioned in the release, and the Nielsen data is sort of a bit of a mixed bag, and I know that\u2019s always the best picture. So wondering if we can hit off on that promotional environment, I guess, within the cleaning categories and then your other businesses would be great.\nBenno Dorer: Hey Lauren as you might expect, given the supply shortages, there aren\u2019t a lot of promotions, and we expect that there won\u2019t be for the rest of the fiscal year. Said that, the way we accrue promotions is less of invoice, but most of our promotional dollars are reflected in everyday low pricing with most of our customers. And we also have a performance-based annual program where a lot of the promotional dollars are being spent. So the fact that there isn\u2019t a lot of promotions given that EDLP is where it\u2019s always been and given that retailers are more than meeting our performance requirements, the trade dollars are continuing to be spent. And we don\u2019t expect that, nor frankly do we necessarily want it to be a source of savings. We have continued to spend against the right price gaps on Glad. And as you can see from market share gains and also pricing developments, we\u2019re continuing to make progress, and we feel good about that. So promotional environments, pretty benign. Expect that to continue, but it will not translate to cost savings.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay. So the investments in the trade dollars and adjusting price points that\u2019s something that is still ongoing. We just don\u2019t see it manifest as like promotion in store. But ultimately, it will show up as like a permanent list price change, for example, for Glad.\nBenno Dorer: I\u2019m not saying that. All I\u2019m saying is that we\u2019re continuing to spend the dollars. We\u2019re not pulling back on any dollars in any area. And in Glad, we are spending against a very specific objective, and that is to temporarily keep up pricing in line. What happens with that spend and whether it\u2019s going to, at some point, be converted to a different list price will very much depend on what competition is doing, and that\u2019s out of our control. Right now, we are comfortable spending the dollars in trade, and it\u2019s working.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay. Great. And then I was curious with the Professional Products business because that\u2019s obviously been an area of interest for you guys for some time. And I feel like there were some fits and starts in really getting that business to grow as it was sort of hoped maybe at least not now, but five or seven years ago. So where that clearly is an opportunity in terms of usage, but just in terms of, call it, account wins or sales force investments, things like that, that you can do, it maybe early to talk about, but I was just curious about longer-range investments to continue supporting the growth of that business in a more contractual level rather than just right now meeting the surge in absolute need.\nBenno Dorer: Yes, absolutely. That\u2019s part of the broader disinfecting opportunity, Lauren. The Professional business, or PPD, as we call it, has done very well for us for a prolonged period of time. And the core of the business, which is to serve hospitals and other healthcare facilities with disinfecting products, has always done well. What we have done in the past was to look at whether we can enter additional categories. Some of it was successful and still is. Some of it was not mostly because the regulatory environment has changed quite significantly. But the core of the professional business is serving healthcare facilities with disinfecting products, and we have a number of proprietary and unique technologies. We have germicidal wipes, of course, which can help a great deal at this point. But also our total 360 electrostatic sprayer system is seeing an incredible uptick in demand that this fiscal year will be up 500% from last year, and we continue to see an opportunity to drive distribution. So what you can expect is that we will continue to invest very aggressively in strategic opportunities that are centered around areas where the Clorox brand matters, which it does; where we have unique technology, which is predominantly in the healthcare space; and where our know-how in cleaning and disinfecting protocols can come into play. Importantly, we look at these options increasingly, not just as options that are limited to the Professional business but where we can bring the full power of the total company into play. And that will increasingly involve ways to reassure consumers that certain places are cleaned with the Clorox brand as a way to make them feel safe as, at some point, hopefully, we will be all back to normal and enjoying the things outside our homes that we used to enjoy and look forward to.\nLauren Lieberman: Thank you, Benno.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong from Bank of America.\nOlivia Tong: Thanks. Good afternoon. And hope everyone is well. We\u2019ve covered a lot of ground, cleaning, disinfecting already. So maybe I can ask one about just private label and how to think about what potentially happens in some of your more private label exposed categories outside of cleaning, of course, as we think about the recession taking hold. What are you doing to stay focused in this in these categories as we emerge out of the pandemic? Thanks.\nBenno Dorer: Yes. So right now, I would say market share is driven by two things. First of all, just sheer availability, right? And as you think about our disinfecting products, for instance, one of the strategic choices, as hard as it may be, but whether you\u2019re doing the right thing isn\u2019t necessarily just determined by your words, but it\u2019s determined by actions. And one thing we are doing is we\u2019re prioritizing the healthcare section. That leads to more out-of-stocks at retail and it leads could lead to lower shares. And that is okay because that is the right thing to do. That could mean that private label in disinfecting could grow share. Said that, what we\u2019re seeing also is that at the time of crisis, people turn to brands that they trust. And we have many of those brands that people trust. And if you look at tracked channels to date, what\u2019s been happening is that we grow share very strongly, six out of nine categories in tracked channels. We\u2019re seeing one category also growing non-tracked channels, so it\u2019s 7 out of 9 in non-tracked channels. And we\u2019re seeing private label and what we might casually call secondary brands or all other brands decline, all other brands declined very heavily. That is the fact, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing right now. And for us, as we have entered the recession, there are a number of things that we\u2019re bullish about. First of all, the fact that brands do matter, and we have many of the brands that people care about. Second, as I said earlier, the percentage of our brands that is seen by consumers in the U.S. as superior in value is at an all-time high. And if you think about this recession and compare it to the 2008, 2009 recession, that recession was prior to our focus on consumer value. Our focus on consumer value started with our Strategy 2020, which was put in place in 2013. And since then, the percentage of our volume, of our NCS that\u2019s seen as better in value is up significantly. If you add to that our commitment to play offense, if you add to that our ability to invest in the consumer, if you add to that a portfolio that\u2019s relatively recession resistant, several categories typically do quite well during a time of recession. If you then finally add to that our commitment to keep innovating and our expected continued strong innovation plan, we feel like we\u2019re entering the recession with momentum, and we expect that we will do quite well with consumers. And we\u2019re always taking private label seriously, but we like where we stand at this point.\nOlivia Tong: Great. Thanks. Appreciate it.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. Benno, I would now turn the program back over to you.\nBenno Dorer: Yes, thank you all of you. I look forward to speaking with you again in August when we will share our Q4 and fiscal year 2020 results. And in the meantime, please stay safe and well. Thanks.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Jacobsen",
            "content": "Thank you, Lisah and thank you everyone for joining us today, particularly during this difficult time. We hope you and your loved ones are well. I'm extremely proud of the strong financial results we delivered this quarter as they reflect how our company responded so quickly to address an unprecedented demand for disinfecting products and our other trusted products people count on every day as they shelter in place during this global pandemic. The impact from COVID-19 had a significant impact on our third quarter results. At the same time, I am also encouraged by the continued progress we see in our core business prior to the increased sales as a result of COVID-19. In addition to our strong sales performance, we delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion and another quarter of strong cash flow. And as you saw in our press release, with this quarter's strong performance and our expectation for continued strong demand for our products in the fourth quarter, we have raised our fiscal year outlook, which I will discuss in a moment. Turning to our third quarter results, sales increased 15%, reflecting 18 points of volume growth, partially offset by two points of unfavorable foreign currency headwinds and one point of unfavorable price/mix. On an organic sales basis, third quarter sales grew 17%. Additionally, based on the trends we were seeing in the quarter prior to the impact of COVID-19, sales are tracking in line with our original plan to return to organic sales growth in the back half of the fiscal year. Gross margin for the quarter increased 330 basis points to 46.7% compared to 43.4% for the year ago quarter. Third quarter gross margin included the benefits of increased volume as well as 150 basis points from cost savings and 90 basis points from pricing, primarily in our international markets to offset inflation. These factors were partially offset by 70 basis points of higher trade spending, 60 basis points of unfavorable mix and assortment as well as 50 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs. Third quarter gross margin also reflected ongoing cost favorability in commodities, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency headwinds. Additionally, while we did begin to incur costs late in the third quarter in our supply chain as a result of COVID-19, these costs will be more pronounced in our fourth quarter. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales came in at 15.1% compared to 13.9% in the year ago quarter. This higher rate primarily reflects higher year-over-year incentive compensation expense, consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy. In addition to higher incentive compensation expense, it also includes donations we made to nonprofit organizations in support of COVID-19 relief. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels as a percentage of sales came in at about 10% of sales or about equal to the year ago quarter. On an absolute basis spending increased about $23 million versus year ago quarter. Additionally, spending in our U.S. retail business came in at nearly 12% of sales. Importantly, we continue to invest in our brands and are not reducing investment levels during this period of heightened demand. Our third quarter effective tax rate was about 19% compared to about 22% in the year ago quarter due to higher excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation. Net of all these factors, we delivered diluted net earnings per share of $1.89 versus $1.44 in the year ago quarter, an increase of 31%. Turning to cash flow, at the end of Q3, year-to-date net cash provided by operations increased to $806 million from $603 million in the year ago period. The 34% year-over-year increase was primarily driven by lower working capital due to reduced inventory positions to support increased demand and profitable sales growth. Now I will turn to our fiscal year 2020 outlook, which we have updated and noted in our press release. Our fiscal year sales outlook is now expected to be in the range of 4% to 6% growth driven by increased demand for our products as a result of COVID-19. Our sales outlook also reflects our ongoing efforts to accelerate the sales momentum of our portfolio, fueled by strong customer plans, meaningful back half innovation programs and higher consumer investments, leading to increased distribution. Our updated sales outlook continues to assume about two points of foreign exchange headwinds. Our fiscal year organic sales outlook now assumes a range of 6% to 8% growth. Turning to gross margin, we now expect fiscal year gross margin to be up strongly or about 100 basis points, reflecting the continued benefit of operating leverage driven by our sales momentum, strong cost savings and favorable category mix as our Cleaning segment grows at an accelerated rate. This will be partially offset by temporary increased investments we are making within our production team in the form of increased wages and benefits as well as enhanced safety measures. In addition to investing in our team, we are incurring increased transportation and warehousing costs as we expedite shipments to our customers to support the heightened demand for our products. We estimate these temporary cost increases to negatively impact our fourth quarter gross margin by about 250 basis points. We continue to expect fiscal year advertising and sales promotion investment levels to be about 10% of sales. We now expect selling and administrative expenses to come in at about 15% of sales, reflecting anticipated higher incentive compensation, consistent with our commitment to our pay-for-performance philosophy. We now expect fiscal year EBIT margin to be up modestly, reflecting strong gross margin expansion, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses. We now expect our fiscal year effective tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 22% due to higher excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation. Net of all these factors, we now expect fiscal year 2020 diluted EPS to be in the range of $6.70 to $6.90. While this range is wider than what we would normally provide at this time of year, we think the range is appropriate given the heightened volatility we are managing, which makes estimating our fourth quarter results more challenging as they will be influenced by a number of factors we don't directly control and are difficult to predict accurately at this time. Importantly, this outlook assumes minimal supply chain disruptions for the remainder of the fiscal year. Additionally, we have temporarily suspended both of our share repurchase programs. While the company maintains a very strong balance sheet and access to additional capital, we believe this is a prudent action to take while we further assess the environment and our capital allocation plans. Before I turn over to Benno, I would like to reinforce that I am pleased with the progress we continue to make on our base business. We have begun to rebuild distribution in the third quarter prior to the impact of COVID-19 and I expect that to continue this quarter. Additionally, we remain on track to deliver another strong year of cost savings and we continue to increase brand investment in support of our strong innovation program focused on improving consumer value. Additionally, I am pleased with our team's effort to significantly increase manufacturing production capacity while continuing to operate safely to help provide essential products needed during this global health crisis. We have made good progress to date and expect to continue to expand disinfection production capacity over the balance of the calendar year and beyond, supported by the resiliency of our supply chain. To-date, we have had no major disruptions, with all of our plants currently running and the vast majority of our contract manufacturers and suppliers continuing to operate. And finally, with accelerating revenue and cash flow, Clorox maintains a strong investment-grade balance sheet, giving the company plenty of financial flexibility. I believe Clorox is well positioned to manage through an economic recession while capitalizing on changing consumer behaviors as a result of this health crisis. And with that, I'll turn it over to Benno. Yes. The nature of the question, though. Did you have a question, Andrea, specifically related to gross margin? Yes. So thank you for the question. On the 250 bps, we do believe that's temporary. It's really related to two items. We are investing more with our production team, as I mentioned, both in wages and benefits as well as enhanced cleaning measures. So that's part of it. As well as I think Benno just mentioned some of the specifics, the increased transportation, warehousing costs we're incurring. And I'd say that's going to continue until we can catch up with the demand signal. So I'd expect in the near term, that's something we'll see hitting margin. And we'll have to see how this plays out. That will be very much influenced by the shape of the demand. Hi, Steve. As it relates to CapEx, typically, we spend about 3% of sales each year on CapEx. We're doing the work right now. But I suspect, as we look to fiscal year 2021, we'll be closer to 4%. And it's really for the reasons Benno just talked about. We see a number of opportunities to increase investments and expanding capacity of our self-manufacturing facilities because as I think you're hearing from us today, we're seeing heightened demand certainly in Q3 and our Q4. We expect this to continue over a longer term basis. And so we are leaning in right now to start increasing capacity, and we're investing right now to do that. Yes. Thanks, Jonathan. On the second question related to our cost inputs, you see the same data we see, which, clearly, there's a significant pullback in the price of oil. But we're also seeing that in the resin market. But I'd tell you to a much lesser degree because I think there's some structural issues going on in oil, it's going to get to pull back much further. I would say this. I think a lot of that is going to be driven by global demand more so than input costs. With GDP globally continue to decline, I think that will continue to put downward pressure on cost inputs, particularly in the energy complex. And for us, that really plays out in a couple of areas. So obviously, for us, resin is a big component of our buy, and that's most pronounced on our Glad business. Keep in mind, though, in Glad, as we see cost inputs coming down on resin, typically, that means heightened trade spending within the category. And that's really how the category is managed, that, that flows through to consumers through the form of increased trade. So as resin prices come down, I would expect to see increased trade spending on the Bags and Wraps business across the categories. And then as it relates to oil, oil usually takes six months or so to work through our supply chain. So if oil stays down at these levels, this $20 a barrel level it looks like it's projecting over the next few months, that certainly would be a tailwind for us going out for the foreseeable future. Now I think it's probably too early to know that for sure. But certainly, if you look at the environment today, it certainly suggests that's possible. And then, Jonathan, say more on your global takeaway. Tell me more what you're looking for in that question. Yes. I mean I'd say a few things. As we've talked, our volume growth is about 18% as a company. And International, we had very strong volume growth as well, very close to that. So our International business is growing at a fairly comparable rate to what we're seeing in the U.S. And again, because of what we talked about, this is a global health crisis, and we have an international portfolio that's very lined up to address this and help consumers. And so we're seeing strong growth broadly. As I think about tracked versus non-tracked, we are seeing elevated growth in non-tracked channels. It's probably growing 10-plus points higher than tracked right now. But I think that's also not surprising. We're seeing very strong growth in e-com, and we're seeing very strong growth in club as consumers are even ordering from home or they're trying to order in larger quantities. So we're seeing those channels grow at an accelerated rate right now. Thanks, Jonathan."

            "content": "Thanks, Kevin. We appreciate all of you joining the call today. Our hearts go out to everyone who has been impacted by this global health crisis and we hope that you and your families are safe and well. Clorox is a health and wellness company at heart. And during these past few months, our mission has never been clearer. In the uncharted territory presented by COVID-19, we knew it was important to act quickly to help, always grounded in our most important company value, do the right thing. We know that the public is counting on the Clorox Company and our products around the world, and our team of 8,800 strong is stepping up every day to make a difference the right way. With this in mind, here are the three important takeaways from today's call. First, I am proud of our people's leadership and passion in serving public health, which has been rewarded by our consumers, customers and the communities we serve and has led to strong Q3 financial results. Back in early January, we activated our company to guide our response to increased supply to protect public health and people and we have pursued three priorities since then front and center: first, protecting the health, safety and well-being of our employees; second, making cash and product contributions to support caregivers and other organizations providing coronavirus relief; and third, maximizing supply to get our products where they are needed most. In the U.S., our employees qualify as critical infrastructure workers, because we make essential household products. Our third quarter results reflect directly on the outstanding job our people are doing in the face of extraordinary circumstances and the health and well-being and that of our families is top of mind. To support those who continue to work in our facilities, we have enhanced our infection prevention measures with increased pay and added benefits for the frontline workers making our products. For our broader global team, we have established an initial $1 million employee relief fund to provide COVID-19 support to them and their families. For more than 100 years, the Clorox Company has helped communities in times of global health crisis and natural disasters. As we work with our communities to help support them in battling this crisis, we have now committed about $14 million in cash and product donations. In addition to our initial $5 million to support caregivers on the front lines, our additional support extends to organizations such as Feeding America and Americares as well as local organizations in the United States and internationally, helping to meet the needs of vulnerable populations in our communities. Clearly, we have faced extraordinary demand for our products, especially our disinfecting products. To try and meet demand to the greatest extent possible, we have been running our cleaning and disinfecting product plants 24/7. To increase output, we have accessed third-party supply sources focused on manufacturing of disinfecting products and those that can be supplied most quickly, and we've been partnering with suppliers and retailers to get product where it is needed the most. In the United States in Q3, we supplied 40 million more disinfecting units for consumers and end users for an increase of more than 40% versus the year ago quarter. We are very grateful to our heroic production associates who made this possible. Additionally, we continue to find new ways to produce more disinfecting wipes and other products such as germicidal bleach for healthcare facilities. Importantly, we have zero tolerance for price gouging. And we want to ensure that everyone has access to our sanitizing and disinfecting products at standard prices at all times and especially now. As such, we have taken aggressive action to combat price gouging, including partnering with online retail platforms to identify and remove such offers or sellers in the third-party marketplace. As needed, we are collaborating with law enforcement agencies in connection with third-party price gouging increase regarding disinfecting products. More than ever, in an uncertain environment, people turn to trusted brands they can count on. And Clorox has the most trusted brands in many of the categories we compete in. And we see that reflected in strong market share performance and in rising household penetration on many of our U.S. brands. We also see it in strong double-digit sales growth, a sixth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion and a 31% diluted EPS growth this last quarter. My second message is I feel good about the progress we're making on our core business, which also contributed to our strong Q3 growth and is on track against our expectations for the back half. In Q3, before the impact of COVID-19, volume and sales growth trends were in line with expectations, and we were seeing the anticipated distribution gains. We were particularly pleased with the significant progress we were making on our Grilling business. Shared rents have been improving prior to the impact of COVID-19 and have accelerated since then. I am pleased that we grew share in six out of nine businesses in tracked channels. Our strong innovation program for the back half played a meaningful part in these improvements. In Grilling, we launched the new Kingsford hardwood pellets, which helped gain strong retailer traction for our 2020 grilling season plans and we will build distribution throughout the season. In Laundry, we started shipping our compacted bleach product, and we are very pleased with initiatives performance to date. Other innovations are off to promising starts, including a new platform of Clorox odor-eliminating fabric sanitizers and a new Glad Flex'n Seal food storage bags that stretch around food to keep it fresh, which builds on a highly successful presence and innovation. One exception to our Q3 innovation plans was our new Clorox compostable cleaning wipes, which were off to a tremendous start. However, we made a deliberate choice to temporarily suspend their production in order to prioritize disinfecting wipes at this time. We will pick up on this initiative as soon as possible and remain very excited about its future prospects. What's important to understand is our business is performing well at its core. Prior to the impact of the pandemic, we were very pleased with the trends we were seeing in the majority of the business. We were rebuilding distribution, sales were strong and gross margin was continuing to expand. We expect those core trends to continue in the fourth quarter, even as we experience further impact from COVID-19. And my last point today is we remain confident that our strong portfolio, our IGNITE Strategy, our organization and our core capabilities will position us to pursue emerging opportunities and to manage through the expected near-term challenges to perform well and generate long-term shareholder value. As we are facing a period of volatility with the global economy now in economic recession, there are a number of external factors we're monitoring. COVID-19 will continue to impact global consumer behavior, future government actions and our supply chain, and it's difficult to predict the near-term future. With predictions that personal income will decline during the recession as unemployment rises, we anticipate discretionary spending will contract as consumers prioritize essentials. At the same time, we are seeing new households entering several of our categories, and we will invest strongly to turn many of them into loyal consumers. Most prominently, early indications are that the heightened awareness of the role disinfecting products play in public health brought about by this pandemic may be more lasting than following past global health crisis and will provide a meaningful long-term growth trend for our company. Clorox is the most trusted brand in the United States home care category with differentiated products fueled by a strong innovation program and our commitment to strongly invest in this business. We're optimistic about our future prospects given the elevated role disinfecting products will have in consumers' lives for the foreseeable future. Moreover, our portfolio has proven to be relatively recession resilient in the past as major Clorox categories like trash, grilling and food generally benefit from consumers eating out less as well as water filtration as consumers recognize the superior value of Brita filtered water when comparing to bottled water. The percentage of our U.S. portfolio that is seen by consumers as delivering superior value was at an all-time high level since we began using this measure, positioning our brands well as we enter this recession. We will remain keenly focused on consumer value through strong brand investments, meaningful innovation and adequate price gaps. And given our expanding margins and strong cash flow, backed by a strong portfolio, strategy and core capabilities, Clorox is uniquely positioned to play offense by leaning into investments in the long-term health of our business. As we manage through an unprecedented business environment near term, we remain committed to long-term value creation for our shareholders and all stakeholders, and we'll continue to be a purpose-driven business, committed to ESG and to doing the right thing. This core value of our company has served us well since 1913, and it has never been more important than now. Operator, you may now open up the line for questions. Yes. Thanks, Andrea. That's a lot of good ground to cover. And product supply, of course, is on everybody's mind. What we've commented on is that demand has been clearly unprecedented, and we're in uncharted territory for our supply chain, in particular, in disinfecting products. Typically, if you think about supply chains, they're built to be in the sweet spot of quality, safety, efficiency, cost, effectiveness required to produce the necessary output for the long term. But when you have situations like we faced where, in March, we saw demand spikes for some of our disinfecting products of 500-plus percent, I think it's evident to everybody that despite heroic efforts, you have out of stocks. And clearly, we are continuing to see out of stocks. We're really proud of how our organization has responded. As Kevin commented, we haven't seen any major supply disruptions on our side. We have been able to increase our production of disinfecting products by 40%. We focused on fewer SKUs. We saw great partnership and patience from retailers, and I want to thank all of them for it to help us bring products to market as quickly as possible. We accepted incremental costs like air freighting, speeding up the supply chain to serve stores as quickly as possible. And as you commented, we activated third-party suppliers to help us cope with the surge in demand. We will continue to do that. We continue to find new ways to increase our capacity. We should see meaningful continued improvement this summer. And of course, we are also investing in the right capacity long term as we expect that demand for disinfecting products is going to be elevated for a long time as they will continue to play significantly increased role in people's lives. As we've commented, we're seeing very little stockpiling. We're seeing a lot of use come from incremental households and in disinfecting, in particular. As you think about the future, as people stay home, they will want to protect themselves. At some point, when countries open up again, they will want to stay safe when they get out. And we have a lot of to-go products as well, in particular, with wipes. So that will continue to drive demand. Demand continues to be exorbitantly high. As you look at consumption data in tracked channels, it's very, very high. And of course, that doesn't factor in the fact that there's a lot of latent demand given the out-of-stocks, which as people see wipes in store, they grab them and they are pretty much sold out right away. And we're far from refilling customer inventories. Typically, customers keep about four weeks of inventory. So at some point, hopefully, we'll be able to also refill inventories, which will also give us an opportunity to keep selling a lot of wipes sometime in the future. As we said, in the U.S., wipes is or disinfecting products account for about one-fourth of our sales. It's definitely more right now, but we will see an elevation in demand for a while. We've also commented that in International, that number is about 50% of our sales being in disinfecting products. And of course, we're seeing about the same dynamics there. So we feel like this is ongoing demand that we'll be able to serve. On many of our other product lines were on allocation as well given the spikes in demand. But we expect to come out of that this quarter, which will help us. And I feel like on our core business, the demand continues to be high. We made a lot of progress even before the pandemic, as we've commented. But there are a number of product categories that see higher demand as consumers stay home. Grilling, of course, is one of them. We're really pleased with the progress on Grilling even before the pandemic as we made strong progress to engage retailers in our 2020 grilling season, and we were rewarded with much better plans. Clearly, as we think about Grilling, there's not a lot of merchandising happening right now, so we expect that to partially offset the growth that we're seeing. Memorial Day usually is a big grilling occasion, and I doubt that we will see a lot of merchandising at this point around Memorial Day, said that it's offset by a really strong base business. So in a nutshell, supply has been difficult. We have done extraordinary work to meet the demand as best as we can. We expect substantial improvements this summer, both in disinfecting as well as earlier, perhaps on our core business. And we're not seeing demand slowdown. If you think about the midpoint of our fiscal year sales outlook, which we've increased to 4% to 6%, it still assumes a double-digit sales growth in Q4. So that tells you that we believe that elevated consumption is going to be around for a while. Yes. We think we have a balanced outlook, Andrea. As you think about the range also, 4% to 6% with one quarter to go, and you can do the math, that implies a very wide range. Again, we think it's balanced. We think that there is a lot of uncertainty as far as the consumer is concerned. We're assuming that supply is not going to be disrupted, importantly. And as we learn more about asymptomatic cases, and the safety of our employees is very critical. And of course, for us, it's important to continue to be able to manufacture the way we have, but we can't take that for granted. So I would say, at this point, this is our best foot forward with a wide range, and it's a balanced outlook. And perhaps Kevin can comment on gross margin. Do you want to? Yes, international first, Steve. So we do think that this gives us an opportunity to think about international expansion plans. And without getting into too much detail, we're certainly expecting that disinfecting, in general and perhaps wipes, in particular, are going to be seeing a lot of consumer demand. And this would give us an opportunity to serve more consumers. So it's something we certainly look at and something that, as we have no shortage of dry powder to invest in growth, we would be willing to invest in should there be profitable opportunities that we can take advantage of with an eye on sustainable competitive advantage. So we would probably not be interested in opportunistic market entries. But where we see a strategic long-term opportunity, we're certainly prepared to take advantage of it and we are seeing what you see on this. As far as retailer conversations, I will tell you that most of the conversations right now are about meeting the current demand, which is difficult enough. But what I would expect, of course, is that we're going to have those discussions with retailers at the right time. And they certainly see the numbers as we see them. It's a lot of incremental usage coming out of disinfecting products. The wipes household penetration sits a little north of 50%. Bleach is about the same. So and what we're seeing more recently is that the household penetration on those two categories is climbing. So that would suggest that there is an opportunity to expand shelf space in those two categories. But it's a conversation that still lies ahead of us, but it could certainly contribute to what we believe to be strong ongoing opportunities to serve more consumers with disinfecting products through the right amount of shelf space in store. Thank you. I'll let Kevin comment on CapEx. But we are prepared to invest and, frankly, have started investing in more capacity in disinfecting with an eye on the long-term because of the anticipated demand. And it will be a mix, but typically, we, on an ongoing basis, always like to manufacture our products in-house because we can deliver the right combination of quality and cost. So I'll let Kevin give you his detailed perspective on how we should be thinking about CapEx. Yes. So first of all, I will say that this distribution loss which occurred was contemplated in the previous outlook. So it's not a change to the previous outlook. We knew this for a while. And as we think about by quarter, it's simply a timing saying, so we lost this in Q3. But for the total back half of the fiscal year, as Lisah has commented, we expect distribution points to be up because we will get significant wins with other customers, including new distribution with significant customers. So it's a net positive. And what we expect is, for the midterm, this business should do quite well given that it's also positively impacted by the pandemic as people stay home more. But we're also, as you will have seen, growing share market share quite significantly as a result of not just the improved distribution position but also some spillover from the lost distribution. We know that some Glad consumers are willing to change stores to buy their brands. And of course, the core fundamentals, as we think about innovation, as we think about price gaps, which we have continued to invest in, continue to improve. So we're comfortable with where Glad is and the path forward on the business. Yes. So we always try to stay away from being that specific on any business forward-looking, so bear with us at this point. You will continue to see the negative impact of the loss distribution for a while, right? But that will be partially offset by or it will be offset by the distribution gains that we're adding. So it's going to be a little bit noisy for a quarter or two, but it will normalize after that period of time. So we are not going to be a company that's going to cut advertising. For us, advertising is a long-term investment. And as you say, we have a unique opportunity now to turn trial into loyal users. One of our IGNITE Strategies, as you probably recall, is to increase the number of people we have a close personal relationship with in the United States from 20 million to 100 million people over the next five years. Now we're getting a lot of incremental people in, and it's our opportunity to hold on to that volume. So in the back half of this fiscal year, we will spend $50 million, 5-0, more than in the previous year. And that tells you the stance that we are taking. We will play offense. We think that advertising investment is a very good investment. Clearly, the ROIs, in theory, they're a little lower right now than they would be if we didn't have out of stocks. But the ROIs are still very good. And we're not spending to make quarter commitments, but we're spending to build the long-term equity of our brands. How we spend is different. For instance, as you think about our disinfecting products, we're trying to be useful in people's lives. We're trying to live the purpose that we have created for the Clorox brand. And in this particular case, we are spending a lot of money on consumer education, in making sure that people use our brands the right way and in helping them be safe. That is a great investment because at this time, brands need to show up. And at this time, people make up their minds as to whether they trust the brands or not. And for Clorox, we believe that it's a unique opportunity to continue to build trust in our brands, to hold on to the increased trial that we are seeing. And as a result, we will be very bullish with our advertising spend and not cut any single dollars. Like I said, we're spending $50 million more in the back half. And I would expect us to continue to spend quite strongly in the next fiscal year as well. We typically don't do that. It's a discussion that happens between a retailer and the manufacturer. So I'd prefer not to comment as in all cases, just to protect the integrity of the conversations that we have with retailers. But it's a good retailer. It's a good partner of ours. We're growing very strongly with them in other parts of the portfolio. And we're also optimistic perhaps that at some point, we can have a different kind of conversation in this category with the same customer as we might have had in previous categories. So respect their decision, don't agree with the decision, we'll have to see how it works for them. And in the meantime, we're very comfortable with where we are on Glad and our plans on the business going forward. Thanks, Nik. So I think you will understand how we're not going to give any numbers or any updated view on our long-term sales guidance. Like we said, we think that there's going to be continued heightened consumer engagement, and that gives us an opportunity to serve more consumers in the U.S. and international. At the same time, I'd also expect that it's going to be a more competitive space. As you know, we always worry about competition, and this is going to be an attractive category. And we will have to see what happens to the competitive landscape in the future. And then, of course, there's other puts and takes, right? So if I think about Burt's Bees right now, which, as you all know, has been an incredible success story for the company for a very long time, and we expect that to pick up at some point. But personal care businesses, in particular, are challenged. So I think there's going to be puts and takes. We're certainly thinking about what the right algorithm might be. We are having the right conversations internally. And at the right time, if we believe there's a change, we'll communicate it. Now is not that time. We're comfortable with the 2% to 4%. Near term, like we said in our fiscal year outlook, we expect elevated demand, but it's way too early to say how this will translate into long-term value creation. The important thing to take away, though, beyond the numbers is that we will aggressively invest into it. We will play offense, and we will put ourselves in the best possible position in the retail and the professional business to serve as many consumers and institutional customers as we possibly can. And then we'll see what comes out of that. Hey Lauren as you might expect, given the supply shortages, there aren't a lot of promotions, and we expect that there won't be for the rest of the fiscal year. Said that, the way we accrue promotions is less of invoice, but most of our promotional dollars are reflected in everyday low pricing with most of our customers. And we also have a performance-based annual program where a lot of the promotional dollars are being spent. So the fact that there isn't a lot of promotions given that EDLP is where it's always been and given that retailers are more than meeting our performance requirements, the trade dollars are continuing to be spent. And we don't expect that, nor frankly do we necessarily want it to be a source of savings. We have continued to spend against the right price gaps on Glad. And as you can see from market share gains and also pricing developments, we're continuing to make progress, and we feel good about that. So promotional environments, pretty benign. Expect that to continue, but it will not translate to cost savings. I'm not saying that. All I'm saying is that we're continuing to spend the dollars. We're not pulling back on any dollars in any area. And in Glad, we are spending against a very specific objective, and that is to temporarily keep up pricing in line. What happens with that spend and whether it's going to, at some point, be converted to a different list price will very much depend on what competition is doing, and that's out of our control. Right now, we are comfortable spending the dollars in trade, and it's working. Yes, absolutely. That's part of the broader disinfecting opportunity, Lauren. The Professional business, or PPD, as we call it, has done very well for us for a prolonged period of time. And the core of the business, which is to serve hospitals and other healthcare facilities with disinfecting products, has always done well. What we have done in the past was to look at whether we can enter additional categories. Some of it was successful and still is. Some of it was not mostly because the regulatory environment has changed quite significantly. But the core of the professional business is serving healthcare facilities with disinfecting products, and we have a number of proprietary and unique technologies. We have germicidal wipes, of course, which can help a great deal at this point. But also our total 360 electrostatic sprayer system is seeing an incredible uptick in demand that this fiscal year will be up 500% from last year, and we continue to see an opportunity to drive distribution. So what you can expect is that we will continue to invest very aggressively in strategic opportunities that are centered around areas where the Clorox brand matters, which it does; where we have unique technology, which is predominantly in the healthcare space; and where our know-how in cleaning and disinfecting protocols can come into play. Importantly, we look at these options increasingly, not just as options that are limited to the Professional business but where we can bring the full power of the total company into play. And that will increasingly involve ways to reassure consumers that certain places are cleaned with the Clorox brand as a way to make them feel safe as, at some point, hopefully, we will be all back to normal and enjoying the things outside our homes that we used to enjoy and look forward to. Yes. So right now, I would say market share is driven by two things. First of all, just sheer availability, right? And as you think about our disinfecting products, for instance, one of the strategic choices, as hard as it may be, but whether you're doing the right thing isn't necessarily just determined by your words, but it's determined by actions. And one thing we are doing is we're prioritizing the healthcare section. That leads to more out-of-stocks at retail and it leads could lead to lower shares. And that is okay because that is the right thing to do. That could mean that private label in disinfecting could grow share. Said that, what we're seeing also is that at the time of crisis, people turn to brands that they trust. And we have many of those brands that people trust. And if you look at tracked channels to date, what's been happening is that we grow share very strongly, six out of nine categories in tracked channels. We're seeing one category also growing non-tracked channels, so it's 7 out of 9 in non-tracked channels. And we're seeing private label and what we might casually call secondary brands or all other brands decline, all other brands declined very heavily. That is the fact, and that's what we're seeing right now. And for us, as we have entered the recession, there are a number of things that we're bullish about. First of all, the fact that brands do matter, and we have many of the brands that people care about. Second, as I said earlier, the percentage of our brands that is seen by consumers in the U.S. as superior in value is at an all-time high. And if you think about this recession and compare it to the 2008, 2009 recession, that recession was prior to our focus on consumer value. Our focus on consumer value started with our Strategy 2020, which was put in place in 2013. And since then, the percentage of our volume, of our NCS that's seen as better in value is up significantly. If you add to that our commitment to play offense, if you add to that our ability to invest in the consumer, if you add to that a portfolio that's relatively recession resistant, several categories typically do quite well during a time of recession. If you then finally add to that our commitment to keep innovating and our expected continued strong innovation plan, we feel like we're entering the recession with momentum, and we expect that we will do quite well with consumers. And we're always taking private label seriously, but we like where we stand at this point. Yes, thank you all of you. I look forward to speaking with you again in August when we will share our Q4 and fiscal year 2020 results. And in the meantime, please stay safe and well. Thanks."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call. Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for the Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference.\nLisah Burhan: Thanks, Sharon. Welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, our Chairman and CEO; and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet, and a replay of the call will be available for seven days on our website thecloroxcompany.com. On today's call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA, organic sales growth and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enable investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliations with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available on our website as well as in our SEC filings. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release. Please also recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcome could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. With that I'll start by covering our top line commentary, discussing highlights in each of our segments. Kevin will then address our financial results as well as outlook for the fiscal year 2020. Finally, Benno will offer his perspective, and we'll close with Q&A. For the total company, Q2 sales decreased 2%. These results are on top of solid sales growth in the year ago period. Organic sales were flat. I'll now go through our results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, Q2 sales were flat for the quarter as gains in Professional Products and Home Care were offset by a decline in laundry. In Home Care, sales were up behind strong volume growth across a number of product lines, including Clorox disinfecting wipes, Clorox toilet bowl cleaners, and Clorox Scentiva, particularly in non-tracked channels. Our Scentiva innovation platform continues to show robust growth, even three years after its initial launch. We remain focused on driving superior consumer value through innovations, like our Scentiva Wet Mopping Cloth, which are doing well and continue to build distribution. A new scent across the platform, Tahitian Grapefruit, will start shipping this month. Additionally, we were pleased to deliver record second quarter shipment growth of Clorox disinfecting wipes. However, our shares in this category continue to be down as a result of higher competitive merchandising activities, and we expect these activities to continue in the back half of the fiscal year. We're increasing our investments to support the long-term health of our brand. We're doing this in two ways. First, we're strengthening our merchandising plans with higher trade investments. And second, we're increasing our marketing investments behind Clorox compostable cleaning wipes, which have had a positive early reception from both retailers and consumers. Laundry sales were down for the quarter, driven primarily by distribution launches among retailers -- select retailers, which continued from last quarter. We expect improvement going forward as we start rolling out a full line of compacted bleach products this month. Our plans this fiscal year also include a new laundry sanitizing innovation platform, which started shipping towards the end of 2019. We're supporting this innovation through strong marketing investments to drive awareness and trial. Lastly, within the cleaning segment, Professional Products continued this momentum and delivered another quarter of robust sales growth, with broad-based growth across all channels and product line supported by innovation. Turning to the Household segment, Q2 sales were down 8% with declines in all businesses. In Bags and Wraps, Q2 sales were down due to ongoing distribution losses and select portions of the portfolio and increased competitive activity. While we continue to make progress and have seen sequential improvement in both volumes and sales, we've seen a further increase in competitive activity, consistent with what we've seen in past periods when there was a pullback in resin price, even on a temporary basis. We expect these competitive price reductions and higher promotional activities to continue in the back half for fiscal year. With a keen focus on consumer value, we're further increasing our investments in Glad and coupling that with a number of innovations to drive long-term profitable growth for our brand and the category.  As expected, grilling sales were down double digits this quarter. While consumption was strong, it was more than offset by lower shipments and we finished working through high retail inventory from a weak 2019 grilling season and efforts that started in Q1. We expect to return to normal retail inventory levels as we enter the new grilling season. As a reminder, Q2 is a relatively small quarter for this business representing about 10% of annual shipments. Going forward, we remain focused on executing our strategy in three areas. One, enhancing the consumer experience; two, implementing the right trade and pricing structure; and three, investing in innovation including our core charcoal products and alternative fuels such as pellets. As noted in our press release, we've changed the name of this strategic business unit from Charcoal to Grilling, to reflect our broadest strategic view of the category. In RenewLife, which represents about 1% of total company sales, sales declined by double-digits due to the continued category and competitive headwinds. However, we're encouraged by the early signs of progress we are seeing with two of our three biggest customers now showing growth. As a reminder, a full brand re-launch will occur in the first half of FY 21. Finally, our Cat Litter business was down slightly due to higher trade spending and lapping strong double-digit sales growth in the year ago quarter which benefited from price increases. The Fresh Step Clean Paws innovation platform, which saw a double-digit increase in shipment this quarter, continues to show promise and we\u2019re behind this momentum in the back half. In our Lifestyle segment, sales grew 4%, reflecting volume growth across all businesses. Burt's Bees delivered a record quarter of sales, driven by continued strength in its core categories of Lip Care and Face Care. In Lip Care, Burt's Bees achieved a market leadership status in 2019 as the number one overall lip balm in the United States for the first time ever over a 52-week period. Burt's Bees lip balm has grown shares for 20 consecutive quarters for five years in a row. This success was fueled by a strong pipeline of innovation such as the watermelon enhanced flavors. In Face Care, Masks, the restaged sensitive skin care line and pore cleansers all had double-digit consumption growth. Food sales were up again this quarter supported by higher merchandising level, driving strong shipments of Hidden Valley Ranch products. On the innovation side, our Ready-to-Eat Dips platform is expanding to include French onion, Fiesta Ranch, and deluxe cheese and Ranch dips. And while a new Hidden Valley Ranch Secret Sauce line, which was launched in January, is continuing to help unlock new Hidden Valley Ranch eating occasions. Hidden Valley Ranch extended its streak of share growth to 20 quarters. Brita sales were up strongly behind higher shipments of our premium filtering bottles and Long Last filters and water filtration systems. New products, including large capacity plastic and stainless steel bottles, are expected to enhance the filtering water bottle innovation platform even further building on consistent volume growth in Brita that now dates back more than a year. Finally, sales for Nutranext were down slightly this quarter, reflecting double-digit decrease in our non-strategic brands, partially offset by solid growth in our strategic brands. We are encouraged by the success of our strategic brands, which was fueled by higher demand creation investments, and we\u2019re increasing those investments further to driver additional awareness and trial in these emerging and fast-growing categories. The decrease in non-strategic part of this portfolio was driven mainly by our decision to continue rationalizing the lower margin part of this business that came as part of the acquisition. Lastly, turning to International. Sales were down 2% for the quarter, reflecting 8 points of foreign currency headwinds, mainly from Argentina, partially offset by the benefits of price increases. Organic sales in the segment grew 6% consistent with our IGNITE Strategy that aims to improve profitability in international. We're continuing to invest selectively in profitable markets and growth platforms to keep yielding returns on businesses like Burt's Bees, Cat Litter, and the Clorox equity. Now, let me turn it over to Kevin who will discuss our Q2 financial performance and our updated outlook for FY \u201820.\nKevin Jacobsen: Thank you, Lisah, and thank you everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased with the progress you've made in Q2 as we delivered sequential improvement and organic sales, our fifth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion and another quarter of strong cash flow. I'm also encouraged by our continued progress in Bags and Wraps and Grilling business units and expect to see continued sequential improvement on these businesses in the back half of the fiscal year. As you saw in our press release, I've updated our outlook which I'll discuss in a moment. Turning to our second quarter results, sales decreased 2%, reflecting 2 points of unfavorable foreign currency headwinds. On an organic sales basis, second quarter sales were flat. Gross margin for the quarter increased 40 basis points to 44.1% compared to 43.7% for the year ago quarter. Second quarter gross margin included the benefit of a 150 basis points from cost savings and a 100 basis points from pricing. These factors were partially offset by 90 basis points of higher trade spending and 80 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs. Second quarter gross margin also reflected ongoing cost durability and commodities partially offset by the impact from foreign currency headwinds. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sale came in slightly higher at 14.5% compared to 14.3% in year ago quarter due to reduced operating leverage. Year-over-year selling administrative spending for the quarter was relatively flat. Advertising and sales motion investment levels of a percentage of sale came in at about 10% of sales are about equal to year ago quarter with spending in our U.S retail business coming in at 11% of sales. Our second quarter effective tax rate was 21% compared to about 19% in year ago quarter. Net of all these factors we delivered diluted net earnings per share of a $46 versus a $40 in a year ago quarter and increase a 4%. Turning to year to date cash flow. Net cash flow provided by operations for the last six months of the fiscal year came in at 498 million versus 449 million a year ago period, an increase of 11%. The year over year increase was primarily due to lower working capital, partially offset by the timing of payments. Now we'll turn to our fiscal year 2020 outlook. As we mentioned in our press release, we've confirmed our fiscal year sales outlook of down low single digits, dropped 1%. We are now projecting lower devaluations of the Argentina peso, which we expect to be offset by increased competitive activity and the bags and wraps and wipes categories, partially driven by resin cost deflation. Our fiscal year organic sales outlook now assumes a range of about flat to 2% growth. Embedded in organic sales assumption is a more cautious near-term view of our back half sales expectations for bags and wraps, reflecting increased competitive activity. Importantly, we continue to expect our grilling business to return to growth in the second half of the fiscal year. As a reminder, we've previously assumed devaluation of the Argentine peso at about 50% and now our expectation is closer to 40% devaluation over the course of the fiscal year. Turning to gross margin, we now expect fiscal year gross margin to be up slightly, reflecting our expectations for ongoing cost favorability and commodities and a slightly lower impact from foreign currencies. These factors are expected to be partially offset by a lower price and benefit in the back half as we have now last majority of our fiscal year '19 pricing actions. Our fiscal year gross margin also reflects higher trade promotion spending to address increased competitive activity and select categories. In addition, our fiscal year gross margin outlook continues to anticipate additional supplies investments to support long-term value creation, including a rollout of Clorox liquid bleach compaction beginning this quarter. We now expect fiscal year advertising and sales promotion investment levels to be slightly above 10% of sales, reflecting increased investments and support of robust innovation pipeline in the back half of the fiscal year. We also continue to expect selling and administrative expenses to come in about 14% of sales. We now expect fiscal year EBIT margin to be about flat. Our outlook continued to anticipate our fiscal year tax rate to be in a range of 22% to 23%. Net of all these factors, we now expect fiscal year 2020 diluted EPS to be in the range of 610 to 625 which ranges the lowering of our range by $0.05. Before I turn it over to Benno, I'd like to reinforce that I'm pleased with the progress we continue to make on our business. We delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion with strong contributions from our cost savings program. We also delivered another quarter of strong cash flow. Importantly, we remain on track to return to organic sales growth in the back half of the fiscal year. Looking ahead, I continue to believe Clorox to taking to results that are more in line with our long term financial goals, as to continue to focus on executing our IGNITE strategy to drive long term shareholder value. And with that, I'll turn it over to Benno.\nBenno Dorer: Hello, everyone, and thank you Kevin. Here are my three key messages for the second quarter. First, while our top line performance is not yet where it needs to be, I'm pleased with the progress we're making on our business which is evident in our Q2 results. As I look at the results of our overall portfolio in the quarter, I do feel good about the growth we saw in a number of Clorox branded products in our homecare business, even as I fully expect stronger growth in wipes category in the future. I'm also pleased about the broad-based strength in our Professional Products business. In Lifestyle, Burt's Bees continued its strong top line momentum with record quarterly sales, and we saw sustained strength in our food business, behind increased merchandising support, and also in water filtration behind innovation. And once again, our team in International continues to deliver very good results in currency neutral terms behind strong execution of our pricing initiatives. I'm also pleased to have delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion supported by our strong cost savings program. Importantly, we are continuing our focus on improving our bags and wraps and grilling businesses. On our grilling business, we're pleased to see solid consumption growth and we feel good about retailer reception to our go-to-market plans for the 2020 grilling season. Now that we're finished working through retail inventory from the year ago season, we continue to expect this business to grow in the second half. Now, as Kevin mentioned, we've taken a somewhat more cautious near-term view about bags and wraps business, given our expectations for continued increase competitive activity. Moving forward on that, we are focused on driving superior consumer value. We'll do this with a consistent stream of unique innovations, leveraging our superior capabilities and technology and consumer insights backed by category-leading advertising investments. We believe these focus areas will allow us to sustain a competitive advantage and help engage retailers leading to strong in-store position. As I look at the other parts of our portfolio, generally, I feel good about our backup plans, which effects our expectation for improved sales behind strong innovation and marketing plans as well as progress on the distribution front. This brings me to my next message, which is that, we have strong consumer and retail plans for the second half of the fiscal year, fueled by increased investments that reflect confidence in our innovation program. Bringing value to our consumers and retailers is the key to returning to growth. Our second half plans emphasize this and we're executing with a strong sense of urgency, yet also the right way. Our relentless focus on strengthening the value proposition of our brands through meaningful innovation continues with a strong pipeline of new products in the back half, including the compaction of Clorox liquid bleach as well as the introduction of Clorox compostable cleaning wipes, Clorox fabric sanitizers, Kingsford grilling pallets and several innovations in Bags and Wraps, Food and Natural Personal Care. As you saw on a press release, we're leaning harder into supporting awareness and trial behind these new products, with plans to increase year-over-year advertising spending in the second half of the fiscal year. And of course, we'll continue to invest behind the momentum and significant upside opportunity in ongoing innovation platforms such as Clorox Scentiva, Fresh Step Clean Paws, Brita filtering water bottles, and Hidden Valley Ready-to-Eat Dips. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect that our retailer engagement and the strength of our innovation programs will contribute to better back half results. I'm very encouraged by the strong retail receptions to our innovation so far, which is part of why we're stepping up our advertising investments. And finally, I'm pleased about our progress to improve distribution trends moving forward. We will provide another update in Q3 once results are in market, but assume feel good about the constructive conversations with retailers overall, putting us in a position to earn meaningful net distribution gains across our portfolio in 2020. And for my last message, I'd like to reinforce that I have the confidence that our IGNITE strategy will guide us in our ongoing pursuit of delivering long-term shareholder value. The focus of IGNITE is to innovate across the entire Clorox value chain to earn people's enduring loyalty to our leading brands. We are innovating how we build brands and on are track to begin implementing purpose on all major U.S. brands by the end of this fiscal year, which should significantly boost marketing ROI over time. We are innovating shopping experiences and making good progress, engaging customers in strategies to grow their businesses through new and frictionless experiences that can help eliminate shopping barriers in our categories. We are innovating how we work by continuing to invest in digitizing our supply chain to drive productivity and we remain focused on achieving our new higher annual cost savings target of about 175 basis points. And finally, we are driving our ESG commitments to create value for all our stakeholders. As we invest in major sustainability driven product innovations in the second half, we also are accelerating our goal of achieving 100% renewable electricity in the U.S. and Canada through 2021, full years ahead of our original goal. We continue to view ESG as fundamental to long term value creation and I'm pleased with our progress to integrate ESG even further in our business strategy. Operator, you may now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Great, thanks. Hey, guys. Maybe first, Kevin, just a quick cleanup and clarification on Argentina. Are you getting incremental pricing in that market? And I just asked because I think your October outlook presumed you would not. I just wanted to understand what the current state was.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes. Hi, Steve. Good morning. Yes, we are getting pricing better from Argentina. Maybe just a little more background there. As you saw, we've updated our expectations for devaluation. We assumed 50%. We've seen the currency hold up pretty well in our second quarter, and so we revised that to 40%. But additionally, we get out pretty early with pricing in Argentina. So, we took a number of price increases in the first quarter. They are certainly benefiting the overall profitability you may have seen in our International segment.\nSteve Powers: Okay, perfect. And then a second clarification, I think despite the competitive challenges, the flat organic result this quarter came in a little better than you telegraphed in October. Was there a particular driver there, and in the context of the full year coming down, that implied second half reversal. Is that just bags, Wraps, and Grilling staying weaker than planned for a bit longer, requiring more work or other areas showing less resilience versus what you hoped? Or is it -- I think it's the former, but I just wanted to -- want to clarify that?\nKevin Jacobsen: Sure. So, on the first part of the question, yes. It did come in a little bit better than we anticipated. And there's really two areas. The first was FX, while it's still about a 2 point drag, that's a little bit better than we anticipated in the quarter, and then the other area was our Lifestyle segment that was really strong performance, and the performance is really broad-based. We saw every business within that segment perform quite well and exceed our expectations. And then as we look out over the full year, what I\u2019d say the two areas that we've highlighted is, we are seeing increased competitive activity in two categories; our wipes category and our bags and wraps category. So, because of that, we will increase trade spending to defend share in those categories, and specifically, maybe the bags and wraps I'd tell you, not surprising. We've seen this before. When we see the type of resin deflation, we typically see manufacturers invest more when that occurs. And so, we're going to have to spend some money to defend there. And then, Steve, on your question on Grilling, we continue to feel very good about grilling. It's on track with our expectations for the full year. We fully expect to return that business to growth, and so that business is very much on track.\nSteve Powers: Okay. And if I could, maybe for Benno, in addition to the promotional investment, you're also as you discussed stepping up the A&P investments, my guess is that that's targeted different businesses than the promotional spend. So, can you confirm that? And then I guess what's really motivating the uptick? Is it just that you have more funds given the -- given the FX environment? So you -- you feel like you have the flexibility to spend or is there something you've seen that's giving you more confidence in the ROI now versus three months ago? Thanks.\nBenno Dorer: Steve, the step up in investments really reflects our confidence in our plans. That's the sole motivation. It certainly does include a strong retailer reception to our innovations. Also in a few cases, strong initial consumption results out of the gate on some of the innovations that we launched in January, which includes compostable wipes. So, you know, we are leaning into this innovation to lean into the momentum that we all see, and of course, three months ago, six months ago, we would have said that we're taking a more realistic view of our spending given that we're still cycling through distribution losses, and now of course in the back half we are lapping those distribution losses. We expect, given the productive discussions that we have with retailers, solid results on the distribution front. So, it's really driven by the confidence that we have in our plans. The spending will go into innovations that we launched in the back half, but also innovations from previous years and I mentioned some like Clorox Scentiva, which is still showing robust growth, Clean Paws and Fresh Step, which grew double-digits last quarter, Brita Filtering Bottles, which is showing nice continued progress, ready-to-eat dips on Hidden Valley which we're supporting with more innovation going to back half. We feel really strongly and encouraged about all the back half plans, and we're not afraid to invest behind it. A question that maybe could come up in the context of it that is maybe worthy of addressing upfront is do we expect the change in our mid-term outlook on how much we will spend in advertising and sales promotion, the answer to that is no. This is really an increase that is really related to the back half of this fiscal year. We certainly commented in the past that we think that an average level of about 10% of sales per fiscal year is the right level, and we continue to believe that.\nOperator: Next question comes from Steve Strycula with UBS.\nSteve Strycula: So, Benno, just a very straightforward question. Wanted to understand, the back-half sales is a relatively wide range and just wanted to understand based off your retail conversations would seem like they went well, what takes us to the low end versus the high end, whether it's the distribution clarity or maybe the consumer pull through and responsiveness to some of the innovation? Thank you.\nBenno Dorer: Yes, it's a combination, Steve. Certainly what we -- first of all, I have to say there's six months left in the -- in the fiscal year. But several things can make up for the range. First of all, competitive activity, right, we cannot predict that and we have commented that certainly in two categories, we're seeing the promotional and merchandising environment increase as those categories tend to be more sensitive in spending toward the -- in particular resin environments, which, as you know, is a little more favorable at this point, so cannot fully predict competitive activity, but that can have a major impact distribution outcomes. So we know quite a bit, of course on what distribution outcomes are, but we don't know everything. We also know from the information that we have about decisions that retailers may have taken as it relates to our brands, but not competitive brands. That's still ahead of us. And then of course coronavirus, cold and flu, you know that hasn't been a factor in Q2 and so far, we're not seeing an uptick but it's a rapidly evolving situation. So we're certainly watching that and we're getting ready to be able to supply our customers and also our healthcare institutional customers with products, should they need that to help consumers combat the virus. So these are three pretty important swing items that could lead us to the lower or higher end. But all in all, we feel like the midpoint of the range would point to a 3% sales growth in the back half on average, which of course is very much in line with our ongoing algorithm and because we are investing in items that don't just have a short-term impact but drive our brand equities and have a long term impact, we feel like those investments also set us up nicely for a solid fiscal year '21.\nOperator: Next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Hi, thank you. So I understand you have [indiscernible]\nLisah Burhan: Andrea, you breaking up quite a bit. Hey, operator maybe we move onto the next question and try to have Andrea call back.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi.\nWendy Nicholson: Hi, good afternoon. A couple of quick ones. First thing, Kevin, maybe just to clarify the trade spending in the quarter, I think you said it was 90 basis points of gross margin pressure but if my memory is right, I think it was 180 basis points in the first quarter. So is that just a timing issue? I would have expected higher spending this quarter as you try to regain distribution etc., etc. and see more gross margin pressure from that, but curious if there's any commentary on that.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes. Hi, Wendy, good afternoon. You're right on your memory, it was 90 basis points this quarter, it was a 180 basis point hit the margin last quarter. The biggest change from the first quarter is less investment in charcoal as we cycle through the bulk of the season, as I think, Lisa mentioned in her prepared remarks. Q2 is a very small quarter for us. So we have less investment in the category due to -- and as we also said what we're really working on the trade spending is working through higher retail inventories as we had a poor season year '19 and we want to make sure we're set up for a strong season year '20. And so we've been investing in trade in that business in both Q1 and to a lesser extent Q2 and we feel like we're in a good position as we head into season year '20 that we've got retail inventories right and we're ready for a much stronger season.\nWendy Nicholson: Got it, got it. That makes sense. On the bleach compaction that I think you said were shipping this month. What's your expectation for competition? Do you think they follow the same degree of compaction? Do you think there's going to be incremental promotion? How much of a price increase are you embedding? Maybe if you could just talk a little bit more about that, that would be great.\nBenno Dorer: Yes, Wendy. So compaction is starting this month as you rightly said, and will take until the end of the fiscal year. There is no pricing, it's a straight conversion. Typically with -- with initiation of retailers, we see a whole category move. So of course we have yet to see that because that's really well outside our control. But if this compaction wave mirrors previous compaction waves then what we're typically seeing is the whole category to move because this really is an initiative that's certainly good for all the manufacturers, it's good for retailers, it's good for the category. It's also good for the planet. So it's a win, win, win and there really isn't a reason for the category not to move. Consumers of course are getting a more convenient product and again there is no performance trade-off for consumers either. So we are optimistic that this will be an initiative that will see the whole category move and we'll provide an update, after Q3.\nWendy Nicholson: Got it. Fair enough. And then my very last question is just on trash bags. In the Nielsen data that we saw today and I know Nielsen doesn't tell the whole story or even -- even close to the whole story. But still, you commented on a higher level of competitive activity in the bags category. On the trash side in particular, it looks like private label is the one who is actually doing more of the promotions but their market shares aren't increasing. So I wondered if you could just comment kind of on your read where the promotion is coming from. What do you see in the broader universe and whether you're more worried about the branded side of the competitive dynamic or the private label side? Thanks.\nBenno Dorer: Yes, really varies by category, Wendy. On the Glad side, we see what you see that if I take us back a few months ago, what we said is that we are spending in trades to address price gaps that really works. We saw price gaps moves down and we saw significant increase in momentum on our business. What we've seen more recently in a more benign resin environments is that, in particular from private label, we are seeing more activity and we see price gaps increase again. Now we also see what I think you hinted on and that is, that that's really not working for the category. The category trends are softer. We've always commented that people are not buying more trash bags, if they're cheaper and that's pretty much how it's playing out. And what that really does is give us optimism that in the long run, rational behavior will prevail and that we're going to see a continued balance in the category that will allow premium brands to grow behind innovation and delivering value that consumer see as superior and that's certainly our focus in this category.\nOperator: Next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you for taking me back. Sorry for before. So I was hoping to go back to the cadence of the second half for organic. So I understand what you said in terms of -- in the past of regaining distribution in trash to one -- I believe one large customer. Is that something that we should be looking more into the fourth quarter building with what you mentioned to Wendy? And then on the gross margin, just a clarification in terms of the gross margin bridge, is that -- Kevin was talking about is our commodity is actually getting better like for the second half for, I understand you're going to lap some of these -- of these improvement by the fourth quarter. So I just want to know if embedded on that, you're actually having a better outlook for commodities than before. Thank you.\nKevin Jacobsen: Sure. Hi, Andrea. It's Kevin, I can take both your questions. On organic progression, what you should assume is we continue to demonstrate sequential improvement as we move through the year. And so, as you recall, in Q1, organic was down about 2%. It was flat in our most recent quarter and if you take a midpoint of our organic sales outlook, it would suggest 3 points of organic sales growth in the back half of the year and I would expect to continue to see sequential improvement as we move through the back half of the year. Much of the distribution benefits will have a bigger impact in Q4 than they will in Q3. And so that's our expected progress. And then maybe just also, as we think about our organic sales goal for the year, the 0% to 2%, I would just offer -- I'm much less concerned about the average for the year and much more focused on the momentum we're creating as we head into fiscal year '21. So I feel very good about the progress we're making and where I believe we'll end up in the fourth quarter as we head into '21. And then our gross margins on -- in terms of the commodity environment, what I'd tell you is, if I set resin aside, commodities are pretty much playing out as we expected, which is slightly inflationary, generally in line with broader inflation in the economy and that's pretty consistent with what we expected. What we are seeing is, while we expected resin to be deflationary, we certainly saw a bigger movement in the second quarter than we anticipated. I still think it will be down in the back half of the year, but to a lesser degree. Typically what we see is that manufacturers go down for planned maintenance in the spring and that usually puts a little upward pressure. Now, I think what we have to balance out right now is with what's going on with the coronavirus and it's certainly reducing overall global productivity. We'll have to see what that does to global demand for resin but for right now, my expectation is that it continues to be favorable, but not to the same degree we saw in the front half.\nOperator: Next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thanks. I just wanted to go back to distribution. Because, Benno I think the specific language you used was that, we're -- we positioned ourselves well to earn back distribution. So I just wanted to get a sense for how much visibility you do have at this point for both things building in kind of the traditional reset timeline of this quarter and then even going into Q4?\nBenno Dorer: Yes. So, obviously wording carefully chosen because as always, and as all manufacturers, we have to earn distribution from retailers, right, because they have to believe that our products are value added, said that, two things are going on. First of all, as you remember, there are a number of distribution losses post pricing that we're now lapping in the back half. So that should play in our favor. And then, realize that you'd all like a very detailed updates but the reality is not all decisions are made by retailers requiring us to be respectful here. There are of course also competitive implications because this is all sensitive and, like I said earlier, we know quite a bit of our distribution results for the back half, but not all. This will play out with implementation in Q3 and Q4. But clearly I think as you also saw us talk about the conversations that we have, we feel good about them being constructive and productive. We have a lot of innovation. Innovation, generally is effective driving distribution and our sales outlook for the back half wouldn't be doable without generally a more favorable environment on distribution. So I think this is probably the appropriate way for us to characterize where we are. There'll be a further update in Q3, but the fact that we are investing more in our brands is based on confidence as we've all said earlier and certainly how we feel about the conversations that we have with retailers, an indication that we may get, should they materialize the way we think they might, we feel positive about what we'll see in that environment and then more update in Q3.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay, great, thanks. And then just continuing to another question on the bags and wraps category. So, one thing that's changed very recently is now your competitor, right, is public. So we've got a lot more visibility into dynamics in that category. And I think many of us sort of understood in the past. So one of the things that was interesting to me in that process was seeing the innovation with, in particular with ultra strong rates sort of a bag, that's a real competitor to ForceFlex and that it's actually been on -- it's been capacity constrained there. So it just -- looking forward, is your thinking about competitive dynamics thinking about your branded competitor thinking about innovation there, thinking about that they were capacity constrained while you were losing distribution. Just anything more you can offer on this build back rate. Is there a lot of innovation in your plan? Is there adjustments in your pricing structure that kind of helps you regain leadership positions as a total in that business? Thanks.\nBenno Dorer: Yes, Lauren, of course, we are following that closely, even though I will tell you that many of the things that you quoted were news to us. I certainly don't want to speculate about what might happen, but there are two things, perhaps are most important here. The first one is that generally publicly traded companies care about the top line and also margin growth and what that does is drive productive and rational behaviors. So we just leave it there. And, second, we remain confident in our right to win in these categories, which really isn't affected by them going public. First of all, we have commented on a superior innovation capability that we continue to have with the joint venture that we maintain with Procter & Gamble. I'd just point to the more than 100 patents and patent applications that we have over the last five years, and that compares to less than 10 for the said company. And then as we think about our brand building efforts, the fact that we continue to be a leading investor in the consumer in this category, along with our commitment in superior consumer value, that's been a robust right to win for sure a decade and a half now since we've had the joint venture. And the proof will be in our continued innovation and without getting into details. All I can say is that we have a lot of confidence in not just our back half innovation on this business and as you know, there is quite a bit, but in the long term innovation as we manage innovation with minimum three-year timeframe, we know obviously about the innovation that we have are coming on to the business and we're pretty happy with the innovation platform that we have on Glad and we're pretty confident that we can get this business back on track once we've cycled through the well-documented issues, which we continue to characterize as short-term.\nOperator: Next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America.\nOlivia Tong: Great, thanks. Want to talk a little bit on your commentary around competition spends and why you think that about 10% is still the right number, because if competition is spending more and you feel good about your line up, why wouldn't you look to invest more heavily over a longer term period or is it just that you prefer to keep that flexibility in between trading support between promotion and advertising? Thanks.\nBenno Dorer: Yes, Olivia we've always commented that we're not afraid to spend more, should there be an opportunity, and right now, certainly, there is an opportunity. And spending, of course is also broadly defined, right, whether that's in advertising, sales promotion or capital spending in initiatives that deliver growth. So we will always prioritize the long term health of our brands. We will always manage this business for the long term versus for the quarter. So all those things that -- I know you're used to from Clorox, they remain true, said that, you know, we think that the overall spending level in advertising and sales promotion isn't going up. So as a general rule of thumb, we like the 10%. Part of why we're taking it up in the back half is that in the front half, we spend less than 10% because we have waited for our back half innovations to come on and certainly the fact that our margin situation is slightly more positive. It gives us a little bit of room to do so. But 10% continues to be the right number, we'll always take a look at that, but that's been the right number for a while and we don't see any reason why we should move off of that.\nOlivia Tong: Got it. And then just on gross margin. Raw materials, obviously, we can see, has been a nice driver. But has there been any change in your expectations in other areas particularly either cost saves or manufacturing logistics? Last quarter you mentioned a delay in the litter plant. Any other changes in terms of the timing of project that might be helping this year, but the expenses will eventually come and the investments are just further down the line?\nKevin Jacobsen: Hi, Olivia. Yes, I would say, no real changes in timing or expectations for the year. As we mentioned, we have two large cost savings projects, bleach compaction, our new litter facility, those projects both continue to progress. As you know, obviously compaction, we're starting this quarter, litter we're probably 18 to 24 months out before we bring a new plant online, but those both continue on track.\nOperator: Next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC.\nNik Modi: Yes, good afternoon, everyone. Benno, can you just talk about what's going on in Laundry in terms of some of the distribution losses? I mean, is there a plan here? Can we build distribution or is it just cutting space overall of the aisle? And then on the compaction, how should we think about the margin implications of that as you guys kind of get the full scale of the distribution of that product?\nBenno Dorer: Yes. Thanks, Nik. Laundry was down for the quarter, certainly in volume and share and it's not our aspiration for the business and certainly not happy with that. The reason is mostly post pricing distribution losses sound like a broken record, perhaps, but that's, of course, been a known issue on several of the categories and something that we're cycling through. Said that, I'll also give the perspective that our past 13 weeks share through November is about 61% and that's well within the long term range and just to name three examples, it's higher than it was two years ago, or three years ago or four years ago. So maybe that's helpful for perspective. Feeling good about back half plans, obviously on the distribution side, cannot say what will happen to the category. We have seen a little bit of a contraction in overall space that retailers dedicate to this category, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. And generally leading brands and importantly leading SKUs are benefiting from that because there is greater shelf clarity. So we haven't seen a reduction in overall shelf space for the category leads to a reduction in sales or a reduction in market share. It would be our expectation that among compaction, perhaps or after compaction perhaps distribution is about neutral versus what it is today, because all we're trying to do is convert the category. We're not using that as an opportunity to build distribution. We're really leveling the playing field with compaction. Margin impact on compaction, obviously is positive. What we've commented on in the past, is that the last time we compacted, it was a 500 basis point margin improvement to the business. We'd expect this one to be somewhat lower, but still meaningful to the business. So feeling good about compaction and feeling that this initiative is on track. Also want to point in Laundry to fabric sanitizers which we're launching now and is off to a good start and that will be one of the initiatives that we're investing in quite significantly because it's a growing category that's become quite sizable and it's one, given the nature of the category, sanitization where we feel like the Clorox name has a strong equity with consumers and customers, for that matter, and we feel like our products can add meaningful value to that category and its momentum. So feel -- feel good about the back half in Laundry and expect better results, certainly not happy with the share losses and also the volume losses in Q2.\nOperator: Next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.\nAli Dibadj: Hi guys. I have a few. I would like first to just go back to Lauren's question. We've seen Glad volatility based on commodities for a while. It just -- it feels like the market share shifts have been a little bit more severe this time, particularly -- I am tying bags and wraps specifically, sorry, particularly given the fact that you changed your portfolio on bags and wraps and gotten out of the kind of lower-end stuff for the past few years. And so I struggle with Reynolds hasn't changed the dynamic of the industry, that margin dynamic for you that much, particularly because you guys will remember but I think a lot of people don't remember this when PakTech was public, it's not like things were easier. In fact, it sounds like they are harder than they were in the past few years. So I just want to go back to that question and really get a sense of whether you really think there is no impact or is even better that a big competitor is now public and and I'd say that in the context of a category that just doesn't grow, so to grow your top line, you basically have to go to some market share.\nBenno Dorer: Yes, on profit. So all I'd say is that I don't want to speculate at this point and what -- all I did say is that for a publicly traded company buying growth and buying market share, it doesn't necessarily work, because the margins and profit growth matters, too. So we'll see how it all plays out. You and I have followed this category for a long time obviously, I don't remember it being easier or more difficult when PakTech was public. The reality is this is a very competitive category, there is no question. And we have lost some market share but if I unpack that a little bit, the market shares are mostly because of post pricing distribution losses. So it's our own doing and what I've commented on in the past is that we have taken into account a very conscious trade-off between short term and long term. If you then look at where the distribution losses occur though and also the share losses occur, they are mainly in the less profitable base trash segment, as you know and also in food storage. As you know, we're very focused on trash. If I look at the indoor premium trash bag, which is the heart of our business and also the largest sub segment in trash and as you can imagine, one of the more profitable parts of the business, that part actually grew in Q2. So there is puts and takes on Glad, clearly we're taking a more cautious approach. Clearly, we are in a mode of defending this business and not everything is rosy while we're seeing green shoots. But what I'd say is that we have confidence in our right to win in this category. The right to win in this category does not change and we're investing behind it which expresses our confidence going forward.\nAli Dibadj: No, helpful context. I do want to go back to -- you mentioned long term and short term and just ended on investments. You guys over the -- over a while have looked at things like charcoal strategically and Brita strategically and other than I'm sure you're not going to name strategically, I'm sure Glad is in there as well. I guess if you take a step back. Why do you own Glad strategically?\nBenno Dorer: First of all, I can't confirm that we've looked at certain businesses that you've mentioned.\nAli Dibadj: Understood. I get it.\nBenno Dorer: So, that would be speculation on your end. And I hope you can tolerate me saying that. Why do we own Glad? Why do we own Glad strategically is, first of all, it's very aligned with our capabilities, first of all. Second, over the long term it's added an enormous amount of shareholder value. So obviously we want each of the businesses that we own to add shareholder value in the long term. That does mean that every now and then there is a business that struggles in the short term. And you know whether that was Brita a year or two ago, which is now one of our strongest performing businesses or litter and charcoal certainly falls into that camp right now as well. That does happen in a highly diversified portfolio. So while we always look at whether and how we can be the highest value owner of our business, we like this business, we're confident in our plans forward and it's a very solid fit with our capabilities on multiple fronts.\nAli Dibadj: Okay,. And then last question maybe for Kevin on the gross margin drivers. If you look at kind of a net price, so price change and then subtract out the trade spend that you mentioned in the footnote went negative 60, negative 10 and really if you go back it was positive-positive in '19 then negative 60, negative 10 for Q1, Q2. Well, maybe it was on, I think, Wendy's question earlier but like, what should we expect the gross margin impact of net pricing to be as we go forward?\nKevin Jacobsen: Definitely, there is a pretty big inflection point that will start in Q3 as I'm sure you'll recall most of the pricing we took last year was front-loaded. And so it's driven very nice benefits to margin. You'll see a pretty material change starting in Q3. So if you think about the front half of this year, pricing generate about 110 benefit to gross margin. I expect in the back half of the year, you'll see that closer to 20, 25 benefit as we now cycle through it. And so what I expect to see going forward is a smaller benefit from pricing, a little bit of International still to go, and then you'll have the impact of trade spending as we've talked about some increased competitive activity that we'll address with increased trade spending and so trade spending will outpace the benefit from pricing as we think about the back half of the year.\nAli Dibadj: Got it. So it's like a negative 90 basis point we saw from higher trade promotion spend in that footnote number four will be even higher than 90 as the price changes will be closer to 20 to 25?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, I think in terms of the net benefit just because you will see less benefit from pricing, you'll see ongoing trade investment.\nOperator: Next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Thank you, everybody. Benno, you mentioned that you're now happy with inventory levels. Can you give a little more context on the impact that decreasing inventory levels had on your top line over the past couple of quarters?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, Kaumil. Hey, this is Kevin, I can address that one. And I would say we feel very good about the progress we're making on inventory. In fact, if you -- if you saw in our prepared remarks, we had very nice growth in cash provided by operations over the first six months was up 11%. That's primarily driven by some really good work we're doing on improvements in working capital and specifically, inventory. And I would highlight a number of areas. The first is on our Nutranext acquisition. We've owned that business a little less than two years. And I think we continue to get better understanding the demand signal and managing inventory to meet demand, so we've got more efficient on that business over time. The other two I'd point to is on Brita. If you recall, we've moved our supply chain. We're just finishing up moving our supply chain out of China to the Dominican Republic. We started to do that work because of the tariffs that were imposed. But we've built up some additional safety stock inventory to manage that transition, which we're mostly through now. And beyond doing the safety stock system, we also now have moved production much closer to the market and to allow us to keep less inventory going forward. And then the last item I'd point to is, we've done some nice work in our Glad business. You know, as we recapitalize that client based on our new technology, if you recall, ForceFlex came off patent, a while back. We've introduced our new patent protected technology and we've invested manufacturing assets behind that technology and we brought some more in line recently that's allowed us to reduce overall inventory levels on Glad and has been very nice benefit that should continue. And so good work to date. What I'd also tell you though is, as we look forward and Benno made this comment earlier, we do understand the coronavirus is something we're thoughtful about, we'll see how that plays out with retailers, but we are taking up inventory levels to be prepared for the potential increase in demand for some of our bleach products. And so that's something you'll see in the back half of the year.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Okay, got it. And then you also mentioned in your -- in the press release on cleaning some unfavorable mix effect from channel shift. Can you just talk a little bit about what you're talking about there. Is this product specific? Is it margin specific? What exactly is the difference there?\nBenno Dorer: Yes. Pretty simple, Kaumil. Thanks for allowing us to clarify. So there is some non-tracked channels where the net sales for volume sold is lower, right? So think about Klub, typically where products are sold at a discount, that shows up as a drag at the sales or at least in the volume to sales ratio and that's happened in cleaning, where we see certain parts of our portfolio in part of the non-tracked channel perform particularly well.\nOperator: Next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.\nJason English: Excellent. Thank you guys for squeezing me in and I appreciate it. Two questions from me. First, a pretty simple one on compaction. You start shipping this quarter, should we expect a nice pipeline fill given the shelf holding capacity should accommodate many more bottles with the smaller size?\nBenno Dorer: Not really. I don't think it's going to be very material, Jason.\nJason English: Okay, like I said, that was a quick and easy one. Now stepping back, you've mentioned a few times the -- the broad-based distribution losses that you've suffered in the wake of the price increases. I step back and I rewind the clock to the time where you were taking these prices and you were very pleased then and you were very confident then like you are now in the strength of the relationships with the retailers and I think I remember you saying the talk the talk, the conversations are strong, the message is one of support for you. Yes in the wake, we've seen a lot of negative ramifications for those actions. So what changed? Where -- what did you sort of misjudge in that, that caused that derailment? And since all that's happened, what steps have you taken to kind of go the other way in mending those relationships and strengthen them to the point where you now have this resonating confidence in your ability to recover the distribution and drive the sharp inflection in the back half?\nBenno Dorer: Yes, if I rewind and what really happened was that, first of all, right after we took pricing, our consumption was very strong, as you will remember. That was prior to distribution losses but what we said then is that we expect significant bumpiness and a significant bumpiness would show up, for example in distribution losses and in merchandising losses. So that's exactly what happens and as a result, I don't really see any change. So you don't find me any more or less confident on this than I was six months ago or 18 months ago. The reality is that we are playing a long game here. We are protecting our ability to grow margins in the face of cost adversity with an eye on the long term and retailers understand that, but retailers certainly also didn't consistently like that as we had anticipated. Where the case is perhaps like on Glad that where it was more pronounced than we had anticipated, I would absolutely say that that's true in parts, because as we've duly noted, like so many institutions and companies, we didn't necessarily get the resin forecast right, right? So if I look back, I would have liked to get more accuracy into our resin forecast because maybe our plan forward then would have been different and maybe distribution losses, if I speculate for a second, would have been more benign. But by and large, this is playing out exactly as we anticipated then. We've always said that we're after good growth and good growth is profitable and sustainable and responsible and we don't like the distribution and the share losses either, at the same time, we do like our margin enhancements, which allows us to invest in the momentum of our brands in the back half and that's what we're focused on.\nOperator: And we have a question from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nKevin Grundy: Hey. Hello, everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in, two quick ones for me because we've covered a lot of ground. Benno, I just want to make sure I'm clear on the messaging with respect to the adequacy of the investment levels in your guidance for this year. So it sounds like the additional investment behind price and trade investment in advertising and marketing will position the Company well to get back to its normal type of algorithm back half of this year and into next year. So both top line and from an earnings perspective as best we know sort of steady state commodities, if you could confirm that. I'm just trying to handicap the risk that this is a multiyear necessity for higher investment levels, so maybe you could just comment on that. And then quickly on M&A, given some of the challenges in some of your bigger businesses, are you any less inclined near term on the M&A front, given the potential distraction and integration risk. Thank you.\nBenno Dorer: Yes, I'll take M&A and then Kevin is going to take your good question on advertising sales force levels. Not anymore or less inclined to do M&A, than we always are. As we always comment, we look at many things throughout the year, certainly continue to find desired valuations to be on the higher side and we'll continue to be disciplined. What we have said in the past is that our priority is to have a healthy core. So our focus right now is on just that and we like the progress. Said that, for a good acquisition that is on strategy and where we feel like we can add clear value to a business, we remain open, so that there is no change to what we've talked about during our Investor Day in October.\nKevin Jacobsen: And Kevin, on your question about investment levels, I will make a couple of comments. First is, I'm sure you can appreciate, I won't provide any outlook for fiscal year '21. We'll come back and do that at a later date. But what I would say is, as Benno mentioned, we do believe 10% about is the right investment level, sometimes a little bit more, sometimes a little bit less, but feel like that's the right level of investment long term. And we are working to get back to our IGNITE financial goals that we set back in October, if you recall, 2% to 4% top line growth. We believe, we're taking the right actions to get back to those levels in the back half of the year and that certainly what we care about is that momentum going into fiscal year '21, that we get back to growing the top-line. And since they are the long-term goals, we're expanding margins, and we feel pretty good about our ability to do that.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Dorer, I would now like to turn the program over to you.\nBenno Dorer: Yes. Thank you all and all that's left is to say is that I look forward to talking with you again in May when we discuss our Q3 results. Thank you and have a good day everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Jacobsen",
            "content": "Thank you, Lisah, and thank you everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased with the progress you've made in Q2 as we delivered sequential improvement and organic sales, our fifth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion and another quarter of strong cash flow. I'm also encouraged by our continued progress in Bags and Wraps and Grilling business units and expect to see continued sequential improvement on these businesses in the back half of the fiscal year. As you saw in our press release, I've updated our outlook which I'll discuss in a moment. Turning to our second quarter results, sales decreased 2%, reflecting 2 points of unfavorable foreign currency headwinds. On an organic sales basis, second quarter sales were flat. Gross margin for the quarter increased 40 basis points to 44.1% compared to 43.7% for the year ago quarter. Second quarter gross margin included the benefit of a 150 basis points from cost savings and a 100 basis points from pricing. These factors were partially offset by 90 basis points of higher trade spending and 80 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs. Second quarter gross margin also reflected ongoing cost durability and commodities partially offset by the impact from foreign currency headwinds. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sale came in slightly higher at 14.5% compared to 14.3% in year ago quarter due to reduced operating leverage. Year-over-year selling administrative spending for the quarter was relatively flat. Advertising and sales motion investment levels of a percentage of sale came in at about 10% of sales are about equal to year ago quarter with spending in our U.S retail business coming in at 11% of sales. Our second quarter effective tax rate was 21% compared to about 19% in year ago quarter. Net of all these factors we delivered diluted net earnings per share of a $46 versus a $40 in a year ago quarter and increase a 4%. Turning to year to date cash flow. Net cash flow provided by operations for the last six months of the fiscal year came in at 498 million versus 449 million a year ago period, an increase of 11%. The year over year increase was primarily due to lower working capital, partially offset by the timing of payments. Now we'll turn to our fiscal year 2020 outlook. As we mentioned in our press release, we've confirmed our fiscal year sales outlook of down low single digits, dropped 1%. We are now projecting lower devaluations of the Argentina peso, which we expect to be offset by increased competitive activity and the bags and wraps and wipes categories, partially driven by resin cost deflation. Our fiscal year organic sales outlook now assumes a range of about flat to 2% growth. Embedded in organic sales assumption is a more cautious near-term view of our back half sales expectations for bags and wraps, reflecting increased competitive activity. Importantly, we continue to expect our grilling business to return to growth in the second half of the fiscal year. As a reminder, we've previously assumed devaluation of the Argentine peso at about 50% and now our expectation is closer to 40% devaluation over the course of the fiscal year. Turning to gross margin, we now expect fiscal year gross margin to be up slightly, reflecting our expectations for ongoing cost favorability and commodities and a slightly lower impact from foreign currencies. These factors are expected to be partially offset by a lower price and benefit in the back half as we have now last majority of our fiscal year '19 pricing actions. Our fiscal year gross margin also reflects higher trade promotion spending to address increased competitive activity and select categories. In addition, our fiscal year gross margin outlook continues to anticipate additional supplies investments to support long-term value creation, including a rollout of Clorox liquid bleach compaction beginning this quarter. We now expect fiscal year advertising and sales promotion investment levels to be slightly above 10% of sales, reflecting increased investments and support of robust innovation pipeline in the back half of the fiscal year. We also continue to expect selling and administrative expenses to come in about 14% of sales. We now expect fiscal year EBIT margin to be about flat. Our outlook continued to anticipate our fiscal year tax rate to be in a range of 22% to 23%. Net of all these factors, we now expect fiscal year 2020 diluted EPS to be in the range of 610 to 625 which ranges the lowering of our range by $0.05. Before I turn it over to Benno, I'd like to reinforce that I'm pleased with the progress we continue to make on our business. We delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion with strong contributions from our cost savings program. We also delivered another quarter of strong cash flow. Importantly, we remain on track to return to organic sales growth in the back half of the fiscal year. Looking ahead, I continue to believe Clorox to taking to results that are more in line with our long term financial goals, as to continue to focus on executing our IGNITE strategy to drive long term shareholder value. And with that, I'll turn it over to Benno. Yes. Hi, Steve. Good morning. Yes, we are getting pricing better from Argentina. Maybe just a little more background there. As you saw, we've updated our expectations for devaluation. We assumed 50%. We've seen the currency hold up pretty well in our second quarter, and so we revised that to 40%. But additionally, we get out pretty early with pricing in Argentina. So, we took a number of price increases in the first quarter. They are certainly benefiting the overall profitability you may have seen in our International segment. Sure. So, on the first part of the question, yes. It did come in a little bit better than we anticipated. And there's really two areas. The first was FX, while it's still about a 2 point drag, that's a little bit better than we anticipated in the quarter, and then the other area was our Lifestyle segment that was really strong performance, and the performance is really broad-based. We saw every business within that segment perform quite well and exceed our expectations. And then as we look out over the full year, what I'd say the two areas that we've highlighted is, we are seeing increased competitive activity in two categories; our wipes category and our bags and wraps category. So, because of that, we will increase trade spending to defend share in those categories, and specifically, maybe the bags and wraps I'd tell you, not surprising. We've seen this before. When we see the type of resin deflation, we typically see manufacturers invest more when that occurs. And so, we're going to have to spend some money to defend there. And then, Steve, on your question on Grilling, we continue to feel very good about grilling. It's on track with our expectations for the full year. We fully expect to return that business to growth, and so that business is very much on track. Yes. Hi, Wendy, good afternoon. You're right on your memory, it was 90 basis points this quarter, it was a 180 basis point hit the margin last quarter. The biggest change from the first quarter is less investment in charcoal as we cycle through the bulk of the season, as I think, Lisa mentioned in her prepared remarks. Q2 is a very small quarter for us. So we have less investment in the category due to -- and as we also said what we're really working on the trade spending is working through higher retail inventories as we had a poor season year '19 and we want to make sure we're set up for a strong season year '20. And so we've been investing in trade in that business in both Q1 and to a lesser extent Q2 and we feel like we're in a good position as we head into season year '20 that we've got retail inventories right and we're ready for a much stronger season. Sure. Hi, Andrea. It's Kevin, I can take both your questions. On organic progression, what you should assume is we continue to demonstrate sequential improvement as we move through the year. And so, as you recall, in Q1, organic was down about 2%. It was flat in our most recent quarter and if you take a midpoint of our organic sales outlook, it would suggest 3 points of organic sales growth in the back half of the year and I would expect to continue to see sequential improvement as we move through the back half of the year. Much of the distribution benefits will have a bigger impact in Q4 than they will in Q3. And so that's our expected progress. And then maybe just also, as we think about our organic sales goal for the year, the 0% to 2%, I would just offer -- I'm much less concerned about the average for the year and much more focused on the momentum we're creating as we head into fiscal year '21. So I feel very good about the progress we're making and where I believe we'll end up in the fourth quarter as we head into '21. And then our gross margins on -- in terms of the commodity environment, what I'd tell you is, if I set resin aside, commodities are pretty much playing out as we expected, which is slightly inflationary, generally in line with broader inflation in the economy and that's pretty consistent with what we expected. What we are seeing is, while we expected resin to be deflationary, we certainly saw a bigger movement in the second quarter than we anticipated. I still think it will be down in the back half of the year, but to a lesser degree. Typically what we see is that manufacturers go down for planned maintenance in the spring and that usually puts a little upward pressure. Now, I think what we have to balance out right now is with what's going on with the coronavirus and it's certainly reducing overall global productivity. We'll have to see what that does to global demand for resin but for right now, my expectation is that it continues to be favorable, but not to the same degree we saw in the front half. Hi, Olivia. Yes, I would say, no real changes in timing or expectations for the year. As we mentioned, we have two large cost savings projects, bleach compaction, our new litter facility, those projects both continue to progress. As you know, obviously compaction, we're starting this quarter, litter we're probably 18 to 24 months out before we bring a new plant online, but those both continue on track. Definitely, there is a pretty big inflection point that will start in Q3 as I'm sure you'll recall most of the pricing we took last year was front-loaded. And so it's driven very nice benefits to margin. You'll see a pretty material change starting in Q3. So if you think about the front half of this year, pricing generate about 110 benefit to gross margin. I expect in the back half of the year, you'll see that closer to 20, 25 benefit as we now cycle through it. And so what I expect to see going forward is a smaller benefit from pricing, a little bit of International still to go, and then you'll have the impact of trade spending as we've talked about some increased competitive activity that we'll address with increased trade spending and so trade spending will outpace the benefit from pricing as we think about the back half of the year. Yes, I think in terms of the net benefit just because you will see less benefit from pricing, you'll see ongoing trade investment. Yes, Kaumil. Hey, this is Kevin, I can address that one. And I would say we feel very good about the progress we're making on inventory. In fact, if you -- if you saw in our prepared remarks, we had very nice growth in cash provided by operations over the first six months was up 11%. That's primarily driven by some really good work we're doing on improvements in working capital and specifically, inventory. And I would highlight a number of areas. The first is on our Nutranext acquisition. We've owned that business a little less than two years. And I think we continue to get better understanding the demand signal and managing inventory to meet demand, so we've got more efficient on that business over time. The other two I'd point to is on Brita. If you recall, we've moved our supply chain. We're just finishing up moving our supply chain out of China to the Dominican Republic. We started to do that work because of the tariffs that were imposed. But we've built up some additional safety stock inventory to manage that transition, which we're mostly through now. And beyond doing the safety stock system, we also now have moved production much closer to the market and to allow us to keep less inventory going forward. And then the last item I'd point to is, we've done some nice work in our Glad business. You know, as we recapitalize that client based on our new technology, if you recall, ForceFlex came off patent, a while back. We've introduced our new patent protected technology and we've invested manufacturing assets behind that technology and we brought some more in line recently that's allowed us to reduce overall inventory levels on Glad and has been very nice benefit that should continue. And so good work to date. What I'd also tell you though is, as we look forward and Benno made this comment earlier, we do understand the coronavirus is something we're thoughtful about, we'll see how that plays out with retailers, but we are taking up inventory levels to be prepared for the potential increase in demand for some of our bleach products. And so that's something you'll see in the back half of the year. And Kevin, on your question about investment levels, I will make a couple of comments. First is, I'm sure you can appreciate, I won't provide any outlook for fiscal year '21. We'll come back and do that at a later date. But what I would say is, as Benno mentioned, we do believe 10% about is the right investment level, sometimes a little bit more, sometimes a little bit less, but feel like that's the right level of investment long term. And we are working to get back to our IGNITE financial goals that we set back in October, if you recall, 2% to 4% top line growth. We believe, we're taking the right actions to get back to those levels in the back half of the year and that certainly what we care about is that momentum going into fiscal year '21, that we get back to growing the top-line. And since they are the long-term goals, we're expanding margins, and we feel pretty good about our ability to do that."

            "name": "Benno Dorer",
            "content": "Hello, everyone, and thank you Kevin. Here are my three key messages for the second quarter. First, while our top line performance is not yet where it needs to be, I'm pleased with the progress we're making on our business which is evident in our Q2 results. As I look at the results of our overall portfolio in the quarter, I do feel good about the growth we saw in a number of Clorox branded products in our homecare business, even as I fully expect stronger growth in wipes category in the future. I'm also pleased about the broad-based strength in our Professional Products business. In Lifestyle, Burt's Bees continued its strong top line momentum with record quarterly sales, and we saw sustained strength in our food business, behind increased merchandising support, and also in water filtration behind innovation. And once again, our team in International continues to deliver very good results in currency neutral terms behind strong execution of our pricing initiatives. I'm also pleased to have delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion supported by our strong cost savings program. Importantly, we are continuing our focus on improving our bags and wraps and grilling businesses. On our grilling business, we're pleased to see solid consumption growth and we feel good about retailer reception to our go-to-market plans for the 2020 grilling season. Now that we're finished working through retail inventory from the year ago season, we continue to expect this business to grow in the second half. Now, as Kevin mentioned, we've taken a somewhat more cautious near-term view about bags and wraps business, given our expectations for continued increase competitive activity. Moving forward on that, we are focused on driving superior consumer value. We'll do this with a consistent stream of unique innovations, leveraging our superior capabilities and technology and consumer insights backed by category-leading advertising investments. We believe these focus areas will allow us to sustain a competitive advantage and help engage retailers leading to strong in-store position. As I look at the other parts of our portfolio, generally, I feel good about our backup plans, which effects our expectation for improved sales behind strong innovation and marketing plans as well as progress on the distribution front. This brings me to my next message, which is that, we have strong consumer and retail plans for the second half of the fiscal year, fueled by increased investments that reflect confidence in our innovation program. Bringing value to our consumers and retailers is the key to returning to growth. Our second half plans emphasize this and we're executing with a strong sense of urgency, yet also the right way. Our relentless focus on strengthening the value proposition of our brands through meaningful innovation continues with a strong pipeline of new products in the back half, including the compaction of Clorox liquid bleach as well as the introduction of Clorox compostable cleaning wipes, Clorox fabric sanitizers, Kingsford grilling pallets and several innovations in Bags and Wraps, Food and Natural Personal Care. As you saw on a press release, we're leaning harder into supporting awareness and trial behind these new products, with plans to increase year-over-year advertising spending in the second half of the fiscal year. And of course, we'll continue to invest behind the momentum and significant upside opportunity in ongoing innovation platforms such as Clorox Scentiva, Fresh Step Clean Paws, Brita filtering water bottles, and Hidden Valley Ready-to-Eat Dips. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect that our retailer engagement and the strength of our innovation programs will contribute to better back half results. I'm very encouraged by the strong retail receptions to our innovation so far, which is part of why we're stepping up our advertising investments. And finally, I'm pleased about our progress to improve distribution trends moving forward. We will provide another update in Q3 once results are in market, but assume feel good about the constructive conversations with retailers overall, putting us in a position to earn meaningful net distribution gains across our portfolio in 2020. And for my last message, I'd like to reinforce that I have the confidence that our IGNITE strategy will guide us in our ongoing pursuit of delivering long-term shareholder value. The focus of IGNITE is to innovate across the entire Clorox value chain to earn people's enduring loyalty to our leading brands. We are innovating how we build brands and on are track to begin implementing purpose on all major U.S. brands by the end of this fiscal year, which should significantly boost marketing ROI over time. We are innovating shopping experiences and making good progress, engaging customers in strategies to grow their businesses through new and frictionless experiences that can help eliminate shopping barriers in our categories. We are innovating how we work by continuing to invest in digitizing our supply chain to drive productivity and we remain focused on achieving our new higher annual cost savings target of about 175 basis points. And finally, we are driving our ESG commitments to create value for all our stakeholders. As we invest in major sustainability driven product innovations in the second half, we also are accelerating our goal of achieving 100% renewable electricity in the U.S. and Canada through 2021, full years ahead of our original goal. We continue to view ESG as fundamental to long term value creation and I'm pleased with our progress to integrate ESG even further in our business strategy. Operator, you may now open up the line for questions. Steve, the step up in investments really reflects our confidence in our plans. That's the sole motivation. It certainly does include a strong retailer reception to our innovations. Also in a few cases, strong initial consumption results out of the gate on some of the innovations that we launched in January, which includes compostable wipes. So, you know, we are leaning into this innovation to lean into the momentum that we all see, and of course, three months ago, six months ago, we would have said that we're taking a more realistic view of our spending given that we're still cycling through distribution losses, and now of course in the back half we are lapping those distribution losses. We expect, given the productive discussions that we have with retailers, solid results on the distribution front. So, it's really driven by the confidence that we have in our plans. The spending will go into innovations that we launched in the back half, but also innovations from previous years and I mentioned some like Clorox Scentiva, which is still showing robust growth, Clean Paws and Fresh Step, which grew double-digits last quarter, Brita Filtering Bottles, which is showing nice continued progress, ready-to-eat dips on Hidden Valley which we're supporting with more innovation going to back half. We feel really strongly and encouraged about all the back half plans, and we're not afraid to invest behind it. A question that maybe could come up in the context of it that is maybe worthy of addressing upfront is do we expect the change in our mid-term outlook on how much we will spend in advertising and sales promotion, the answer to that is no. This is really an increase that is really related to the back half of this fiscal year. We certainly commented in the past that we think that an average level of about 10% of sales per fiscal year is the right level, and we continue to believe that. Yes, it's a combination, Steve. Certainly what we -- first of all, I have to say there's six months left in the -- in the fiscal year. But several things can make up for the range. First of all, competitive activity, right, we cannot predict that and we have commented that certainly in two categories, we're seeing the promotional and merchandising environment increase as those categories tend to be more sensitive in spending toward the -- in particular resin environments, which, as you know, is a little more favorable at this point, so cannot fully predict competitive activity, but that can have a major impact distribution outcomes. So we know quite a bit, of course on what distribution outcomes are, but we don't know everything. We also know from the information that we have about decisions that retailers may have taken as it relates to our brands, but not competitive brands. That's still ahead of us. And then of course coronavirus, cold and flu, you know that hasn't been a factor in Q2 and so far, we're not seeing an uptick but it's a rapidly evolving situation. So we're certainly watching that and we're getting ready to be able to supply our customers and also our healthcare institutional customers with products, should they need that to help consumers combat the virus. So these are three pretty important swing items that could lead us to the lower or higher end. But all in all, we feel like the midpoint of the range would point to a 3% sales growth in the back half on average, which of course is very much in line with our ongoing algorithm and because we are investing in items that don't just have a short-term impact but drive our brand equities and have a long term impact, we feel like those investments also set us up nicely for a solid fiscal year '21. Yes, Wendy. So compaction is starting this month as you rightly said, and will take until the end of the fiscal year. There is no pricing, it's a straight conversion. Typically with -- with initiation of retailers, we see a whole category move. So of course we have yet to see that because that's really well outside our control. But if this compaction wave mirrors previous compaction waves then what we're typically seeing is the whole category to move because this really is an initiative that's certainly good for all the manufacturers, it's good for retailers, it's good for the category. It's also good for the planet. So it's a win, win, win and there really isn't a reason for the category not to move. Consumers of course are getting a more convenient product and again there is no performance trade-off for consumers either. So we are optimistic that this will be an initiative that will see the whole category move and we'll provide an update, after Q3. Yes, really varies by category, Wendy. On the Glad side, we see what you see that if I take us back a few months ago, what we said is that we are spending in trades to address price gaps that really works. We saw price gaps moves down and we saw significant increase in momentum on our business. What we've seen more recently in a more benign resin environments is that, in particular from private label, we are seeing more activity and we see price gaps increase again. Now we also see what I think you hinted on and that is, that that's really not working for the category. The category trends are softer. We've always commented that people are not buying more trash bags, if they're cheaper and that's pretty much how it's playing out. And what that really does is give us optimism that in the long run, rational behavior will prevail and that we're going to see a continued balance in the category that will allow premium brands to grow behind innovation and delivering value that consumer see as superior and that's certainly our focus in this category. Yes. So, obviously wording carefully chosen because as always, and as all manufacturers, we have to earn distribution from retailers, right, because they have to believe that our products are value added, said that, two things are going on. First of all, as you remember, there are a number of distribution losses post pricing that we're now lapping in the back half. So that should play in our favor. And then, realize that you'd all like a very detailed updates but the reality is not all decisions are made by retailers requiring us to be respectful here. There are of course also competitive implications because this is all sensitive and, like I said earlier, we know quite a bit of our distribution results for the back half, but not all. This will play out with implementation in Q3 and Q4. But clearly I think as you also saw us talk about the conversations that we have, we feel good about them being constructive and productive. We have a lot of innovation. Innovation, generally is effective driving distribution and our sales outlook for the back half wouldn't be doable without generally a more favorable environment on distribution. So I think this is probably the appropriate way for us to characterize where we are. There'll be a further update in Q3, but the fact that we are investing more in our brands is based on confidence as we've all said earlier and certainly how we feel about the conversations that we have with retailers, an indication that we may get, should they materialize the way we think they might, we feel positive about what we'll see in that environment and then more update in Q3. Yes, Lauren, of course, we are following that closely, even though I will tell you that many of the things that you quoted were news to us. I certainly don't want to speculate about what might happen, but there are two things, perhaps are most important here. The first one is that generally publicly traded companies care about the top line and also margin growth and what that does is drive productive and rational behaviors. So we just leave it there. And, second, we remain confident in our right to win in these categories, which really isn't affected by them going public. First of all, we have commented on a superior innovation capability that we continue to have with the joint venture that we maintain with Procter & Gamble. I'd just point to the more than 100 patents and patent applications that we have over the last five years, and that compares to less than 10 for the said company. And then as we think about our brand building efforts, the fact that we continue to be a leading investor in the consumer in this category, along with our commitment in superior consumer value, that's been a robust right to win for sure a decade and a half now since we've had the joint venture. And the proof will be in our continued innovation and without getting into details. All I can say is that we have a lot of confidence in not just our back half innovation on this business and as you know, there is quite a bit, but in the long term innovation as we manage innovation with minimum three-year timeframe, we know obviously about the innovation that we have are coming on to the business and we're pretty happy with the innovation platform that we have on Glad and we're pretty confident that we can get this business back on track once we've cycled through the well-documented issues, which we continue to characterize as short-term. Yes, Olivia we've always commented that we're not afraid to spend more, should there be an opportunity, and right now, certainly, there is an opportunity. And spending, of course is also broadly defined, right, whether that's in advertising, sales promotion or capital spending in initiatives that deliver growth. So we will always prioritize the long term health of our brands. We will always manage this business for the long term versus for the quarter. So all those things that -- I know you're used to from Clorox, they remain true, said that, you know, we think that the overall spending level in advertising and sales promotion isn't going up. So as a general rule of thumb, we like the 10%. Part of why we're taking it up in the back half is that in the front half, we spend less than 10% because we have waited for our back half innovations to come on and certainly the fact that our margin situation is slightly more positive. It gives us a little bit of room to do so. But 10% continues to be the right number, we'll always take a look at that, but that's been the right number for a while and we don't see any reason why we should move off of that. Yes. Thanks, Nik. Laundry was down for the quarter, certainly in volume and share and it's not our aspiration for the business and certainly not happy with that. The reason is mostly post pricing distribution losses sound like a broken record, perhaps, but that's, of course, been a known issue on several of the categories and something that we're cycling through. Said that, I'll also give the perspective that our past 13 weeks share through November is about 61% and that's well within the long term range and just to name three examples, it's higher than it was two years ago, or three years ago or four years ago. So maybe that's helpful for perspective. Feeling good about back half plans, obviously on the distribution side, cannot say what will happen to the category. We have seen a little bit of a contraction in overall space that retailers dedicate to this category, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. And generally leading brands and importantly leading SKUs are benefiting from that because there is greater shelf clarity. So we haven't seen a reduction in overall shelf space for the category leads to a reduction in sales or a reduction in market share. It would be our expectation that among compaction, perhaps or after compaction perhaps distribution is about neutral versus what it is today, because all we're trying to do is convert the category. We're not using that as an opportunity to build distribution. We're really leveling the playing field with compaction. Margin impact on compaction, obviously is positive. What we've commented on in the past, is that the last time we compacted, it was a 500 basis point margin improvement to the business. We'd expect this one to be somewhat lower, but still meaningful to the business. So feeling good about compaction and feeling that this initiative is on track. Also want to point in Laundry to fabric sanitizers which we're launching now and is off to a good start and that will be one of the initiatives that we're investing in quite significantly because it's a growing category that's become quite sizable and it's one, given the nature of the category, sanitization where we feel like the Clorox name has a strong equity with consumers and customers, for that matter, and we feel like our products can add meaningful value to that category and its momentum. So feel -- feel good about the back half in Laundry and expect better results, certainly not happy with the share losses and also the volume losses in Q2. Yes, on profit. So all I'd say is that I don't want to speculate at this point and what -- all I did say is that for a publicly traded company buying growth and buying market share, it doesn't necessarily work, because the margins and profit growth matters, too. So we'll see how it all plays out. You and I have followed this category for a long time obviously, I don't remember it being easier or more difficult when PakTech was public. The reality is this is a very competitive category, there is no question. And we have lost some market share but if I unpack that a little bit, the market shares are mostly because of post pricing distribution losses. So it's our own doing and what I've commented on in the past is that we have taken into account a very conscious trade-off between short term and long term. If you then look at where the distribution losses occur though and also the share losses occur, they are mainly in the less profitable base trash segment, as you know and also in food storage. As you know, we're very focused on trash. If I look at the indoor premium trash bag, which is the heart of our business and also the largest sub segment in trash and as you can imagine, one of the more profitable parts of the business, that part actually grew in Q2. So there is puts and takes on Glad, clearly we're taking a more cautious approach. Clearly, we are in a mode of defending this business and not everything is rosy while we're seeing green shoots. But what I'd say is that we have confidence in our right to win in this category. The right to win in this category does not change and we're investing behind it which expresses our confidence going forward. First of all, I can't confirm that we've looked at certain businesses that you've mentioned. So, that would be speculation on your end. And I hope you can tolerate me saying that. Why do we own Glad? Why do we own Glad strategically is, first of all, it's very aligned with our capabilities, first of all. Second, over the long term it's added an enormous amount of shareholder value. So obviously we want each of the businesses that we own to add shareholder value in the long term. That does mean that every now and then there is a business that struggles in the short term. And you know whether that was Brita a year or two ago, which is now one of our strongest performing businesses or litter and charcoal certainly falls into that camp right now as well. That does happen in a highly diversified portfolio. So while we always look at whether and how we can be the highest value owner of our business, we like this business, we're confident in our plans forward and it's a very solid fit with our capabilities on multiple fronts. Yes. Pretty simple, Kaumil. Thanks for allowing us to clarify. So there is some non-tracked channels where the net sales for volume sold is lower, right? So think about Klub, typically where products are sold at a discount, that shows up as a drag at the sales or at least in the volume to sales ratio and that's happened in cleaning, where we see certain parts of our portfolio in part of the non-tracked channel perform particularly well. Not really. I don't think it's going to be very material, Jason. Yes, if I rewind and what really happened was that, first of all, right after we took pricing, our consumption was very strong, as you will remember. That was prior to distribution losses but what we said then is that we expect significant bumpiness and a significant bumpiness would show up, for example in distribution losses and in merchandising losses. So that's exactly what happens and as a result, I don't really see any change. So you don't find me any more or less confident on this than I was six months ago or 18 months ago. The reality is that we are playing a long game here. We are protecting our ability to grow margins in the face of cost adversity with an eye on the long term and retailers understand that, but retailers certainly also didn't consistently like that as we had anticipated. Where the case is perhaps like on Glad that where it was more pronounced than we had anticipated, I would absolutely say that that's true in parts, because as we've duly noted, like so many institutions and companies, we didn't necessarily get the resin forecast right, right? So if I look back, I would have liked to get more accuracy into our resin forecast because maybe our plan forward then would have been different and maybe distribution losses, if I speculate for a second, would have been more benign. But by and large, this is playing out exactly as we anticipated then. We've always said that we're after good growth and good growth is profitable and sustainable and responsible and we don't like the distribution and the share losses either, at the same time, we do like our margin enhancements, which allows us to invest in the momentum of our brands in the back half and that's what we're focused on. Yes, I'll take M&A and then Kevin is going to take your good question on advertising sales force levels. Not anymore or less inclined to do M&A, than we always are. As we always comment, we look at many things throughout the year, certainly continue to find desired valuations to be on the higher side and we'll continue to be disciplined. What we have said in the past is that our priority is to have a healthy core. So our focus right now is on just that and we like the progress. Said that, for a good acquisition that is on strategy and where we feel like we can add clear value to a business, we remain open, so that there is no change to what we've talked about during our Investor Day in October. Yes. Thank you all and all that's left is to say is that I look forward to talking with you again in May when we discuss our Q3 results. Thank you and have a good day everyone."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call. Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference.\nLisah Burhan: Thanks, Sharon. Welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Happy Halloween. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, our Chairman and CEO; and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet. And a replay of the call will be available for seven days on our website thecloroxcompany.com. On today's call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA, organic sales growth and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enable investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliations with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available on our website as well as in our SEC filings. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release. Please also recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcome could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. I'll start by covering our top line commentary, discussing highlights in each of our segments. Kevin will then address our financial results as well as our outlook for the fiscal year 2020. Finally, Benno will offer his perspective and we'll close with Q&A. For the total company, Q1 sales decreased 4%. The results are on top of solid sales growth in the year ago period. Organic sales were down 2%. I'll now go through our results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, sales decreased 2% for the quarter. Our Professional Products business delivered strong sales growth, driven by a successful back-to-school campaign particularly in the e-commerce channel. We also continue to see strength and longevity of our innovation in this business, with platforms such as Clorox Hydrogen Peroxide and Clorox Fuzion, both disinfectants used in health care setting, delivering double-digit growth even four years after their initial launch. In Home Care, sales were down slightly with volume growth offset by unfavorable mix and increased performance bifurcation between tracked and non-tracked channels. Shipments of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes grew solidly for the quarter with growth in non-tracked channels, outpacing tracked channels by a wide margin. Our investments were fully implemented are working and helping grow the category. Our near-term focus is to strengthen our results consistently across all channels. Additionally, as highlighted in our IGNITE Strategy launch, we have a strong innovation plan based on bigger, stickier platforms, with Clorox Compostable Cleaning Wipes launching in late Q2. Our Scentiva platform continues to perform well with high single digit volume growth three years after its initial launch. Lastly, within the Cleaning segment, our Laundry business sales were down for the quarter, driven primarily by distribution losses of Clorox liquid bleach in select retailers coupled with increased competitive promotion. We're addressing this with innovation on multiple fronts, including launch of a full line of compacted bleach product in spring 2020. During the same period, we're also launching a sanitizing innovation platform, including a trigger, spray aerosol spray and a liquid laundry additive product, bringing the strong Clorox equity to the fast-growing sanitization segment. Turning to the Household segment, Q1 sales were down 14%, driven mainly by declines in Bags and Wraps and Charcoal. In Bags and Wraps, Q1 sales were down double digits, driven by the same factors we discussed previously, wider price gaps as well as distribution losses in select portions of the portfolio. Higher trade investments on Glad trash bags are now in place. We're seeing sequential improvements in volume as well as market share and we're focused on building on this momentum. As expected, Charcoal sales were down double digits this quarter, driven by lower shipments. The sales decline also reflected higher trade spending, part of an ongoing effort to reduce market inventory from a weak 2019 grilling season and to gear up a stronger 2020 grilling season. Building on a strong grilling category consumption and a normalized inventory level going into the upcoming grilling season, we'll be focused on executing our plan to turn this business around. In RenewLife, sales declined double digits due to category slowdown and persisting consumption headwinds. As part of our effort to return this business to growth, we're continuing to focus on engaging retailers in support of our category growth plans, supported by a full brand relaunch next calendar year. Finally, our Cat Litter business was down slightly, lapping strong double-digit sales growth in the year ago quarter. Similar to the other businesses, we're seeing much stronger sales and share performance in non-tracked channels than in tracked channels. Our Fresh Step Clean Paws innovation platform continues to grow strongly beyond its first year. So, we'll lean in further with dedicated advertising and continued trial-building activities. In our Lifestyle segment, sales grew 4%, reflecting growth in three of our four businesses. Burt's Bees delivered double-digit sales growth, fueled by strength in its core categories of Lip Care and Face Care. Successful innovation in Lip Care including the new watermelon lip balm that was the number one overall flavor at a key retailer and mass channel drove share growth for a 19th consecutive quarter and reinforced the brand's position as the number one overall lip balm in the category. In Face Care, there were record shipments of products such as face masks and pore cleansers as well as relaunched sensitive skin care line. The business also has a strong pipeline of innovation including a hemp line as well as men's line launching in Q3. For Burt's Bees, a combination of pricing and innovation has been a successful formula in driving strong category growth. Food sales were up for the quarter as well, reflecting higher shipments of dry Hidden Valley seasonings and dressings. The results were on top of strong sales growth in the year ago quarter. The Ready-to-Eat Dips innovation remained on track with plans to increase demand-building investments to expand usage occasion. The brand also extended its streak of share growth to 19 quarters. Brita sales were up slightly for the quarter behind higher shipments of our new Brita bottles and Brita Longlast water filtration systems, which performed strongly in the e-commerce and mass channels. The Brita business continued the streak of solid consistent volume growth dating back a year. Finally, sales for Nutranext were down this quarter, reflecting growth in our strategic brands and a double-digit decrease in our nonstrategic brands. Our strategic brands grew behind strong shipments of Neocell and Natural Vitality. The decrease in the nonstrategic part of this portfolio is mainly driven by our decision to exit the private label business that came with the acquisition. Moving up the initial integration phase of Nutranext, we're now working on optimizing the portfolio, focusing on a few strategic brands, representing more than 80% of the portfolio. We continue to be excited about the growth prospects of this business. Lastly, turning to international. Sales were flat for the quarter with volume growth, innovation and the benefit of price increases, offset by about eight points of unfavorable foreign currency impact. Despite the strong headwinds, we grew sales in Latin America and the International segment grew sales 8% on an organic basis. Consistent with our IGNITE Strategy that aims to improve profitability in international we continue to invest selectively in profitable platforms and see the returns on businesses like Burt's Bees and Cat Litter. Now, I'll turn it over to Kevin, who will discuss our Q1 financial performance and our outlook for FY '20.\nKevin Jacobsen: Thank you, Lisah, and thank you everyone for joining us today. First quarter results came in generally as expected, as we continue to work through the challenges in our Bags and Wraps and Charcoal businesses. Importantly as we noted in our press release, we remain on track for fiscal year 2020 and confirmed our outlook. Turning to our first quarter results, sales decreased 4% reflecting about 3 points of higher trade spending about 2 points of unfavorable mix and about 2 points of foreign currency headwinds. These factors were partially offset by about 3 points of pricing benefit. On an organic sales basis, first quarter sales decreased 2%, primarily driven by our Bags and Wraps and Charcoal businesses. Gross margin for the quarter increased 60 basis points to 44% compared to 43.4% for the year ago quarter. First quarter gross margin included 180 basis points of benefit from cost savings and a 120 basis point benefit from pricing partially offset by 180 basis points of higher trade spending. I'd like to note that a portion of the benefits to gross margin was related to timing. First quarter gross margin also reflected favorability in commodity and logistics costs. And while it's still early in the fiscal year, we're encouraged by the cost favorability we're seeing in these markets. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of sales came in at 14% compared to 13.6% due to reduced operating leverage. Importantly year-over-year selling and administrative spending for the quarter declined. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels as a percentage of sales were about flat with spending for our U.S. retail business coming in at about 10% of sales. Our first quarter effective tax rate was about 22% equal to the year ago quarter. Net of all these factors, we delivered diluted net earnings per share of $1.59 versus $1.62 in the year ago quarter, a decrease of 2%. Turning to year-to-date cash flow, net cash provided by operations in the first quarter came in at $271 million versus $259 million in the prior quarter, an increase of 5%.  Now I'll turn to our fiscal year 2020 outlook. As we communicated in our October 2, press release we expect this year's sales to be down low single digits to up 1% reflecting our recently updated assumption of about 2 points of impact from unfavorable foreign currencies, primarily from Argentina. As I mentioned at our Analyst Day, we previously assumed devaluation of the Argentine peso at about 25%. And now our expectations are closer to 50%. Importantly, our fiscal year organic sales outlook remains unchanged reflecting 1% to 3% organic sales growth driven by innovation and our expectation for stronger business performance on Bags and Wraps and Charcoal in the back half of the fiscal year. Turning to gross margin, we continue to expect fiscal year margin to be down slightly reflecting our recently updated assumption on foreign currencies. Our fiscal year gross margin outlook continues to reflect our expectation for additional supply chain investments to support long-term value creation including our investment in the rollout of Clorox Liquid Bleach compaction in the spring of 2020. We continue to expect fiscal year advertising and sales promotion investment levels to be at about 10% of sales. We also continue to expect selling and administrative expenses to come in at about 14% of sales. Consistent with our fiscal year gross margin assumptions, we expect fiscal year EBIT margin to be down slightly. Our fiscal year 2020 outlook continues to anticipate our fiscal year effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 23%. Net of all these factors, we continue to expect fiscal year 2020 diluted EPS to be in the range of $6.05 to $6.25. In closing, first quarter results came in generally as anticipated. We continue to work through the short-term challenges, we're facing in Bags and Wraps and Charcoal and continue to expect improvement in our overall results in the back half of the fiscal year. We're certainly pleased that our cost savings program is off to a good start contributing significantly to our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin expansion. Looking ahead, we'll continue to address short-term challenges while executing against the strategic choices we have made under our IGNITE Strategy. As we said at the Analyst Day, our focus with IGNITE is to create a virtuous cycle of generating fuel to continue investing to drive superior consumer value. We have a long track record of doing this successfully. And I continue to believe that once we work through the challenges we're facing in Bags and Wraps and Charcoal, Clorox will be in a position to deliver results that are more in line with our long-term financial goals. And with that, I'll turn it over to Benno.\nBenno Dorer : Hello everyone, and thank you Kevin. Here are my three key messages. First, Q1 results came in generally as expected. As we discussed last quarter, we anticipate fiscal year 2020 first half sales to be lower than the second half, as we continue working through the persistent challenges in Bags and Wraps and Charcoal. I am pleased we delivered volume growth and gross margin expansion in three out of four segments. And notwithstanding a tougher foreign currency environment, which drove flat sales in our international business for the quarter, our international team continues to make strong progress, delivering 8% organic sales growth and the seventh consecutive quarter of profit growth. Now clearly, we are not satisfied with our top line results. I do want to reinforce that improving Bags and Wraps and Charcoal is a top priority for us. We are actively working with customers to significantly strengthen our business plans with a keen eye on sustainable long-term improvement. This includes innovation that we believe will deliver meaningful value to our consumers and categories. Importantly, I'm pleased about the green shoots we're starting to see on these businesses. And I continue to anticipate improvement on Bags and Wraps and Charcoal in the second half of the fiscal year. My second message is that we're on track to deliver our outlook for the fiscal year 2020. This fiscal year brings another robust pipeline of innovation, led by the Compaction of Clorox Liquid Bleach as well as the launch of Clorox Compostable Cleaning Wipes, Clorox Fabric Sanitizer, Kingsford Pellets and several innovations in Bags and Wraps and Natural Personal Care. We will drive awareness and trial of these new products, while continuing to invest behind significant upside opportunity in ongoing innovation platforms, such as Clorox Scentiva, Fresh Step Clean Paws, Brita Filtering Water Bottles and Hidden Valley Ready-to-Eat Dips. I believe that consumer and retailer engagement in the strength of our innovation program along with stronger business plans for Bags and Wraps and Charcoal, supported by our commitment to excellent execution will contribute to improved overall results in the back half of the fiscal year. As I also mentioned previously, our fiscal year 2020 outlook continues to reflect our commitment to balancing our shorter-term focus on addressing the challenges on Bags and Wraps and Charcoal with strategic plans aimed at driving long-term profitable growth. Finally, my third message is this. I'm confident our new IGNITE Strategy will guide us in our ongoing pursuit of delivering long-term shareholder value. As we discussed at Analyst Day earlier this month, innovation to strengthen and extend our competitive advantage is front and center in our IGNITE Strategy. The integrated choices we've established for IGNITE create a virtuous circle of fueling growth and investing behind innovation to deliver superior value. By the end of fiscal year 2020, we expect to have begun activating brand purpose on all major brands, laying the groundwork to drive significant marketing ROI in the future. We expect to have engaged all major customers in new ways to create frictionless shopping experiences in-store and online leading to meaningful opportunities to drive category growth. We also expect to have surpassed 150 basis points of annual cost savings, supported by meaningful productivity improvements, moving steadily towards our new annual cost savings target of about 175 basis points. And finally, we expect to have made significant investments to drive stickier multi-year innovation platforms that differentiate our products and brands with a robust innovation pipeline in the back half of fiscal 2020. Everything we do is in service of superior value, because we know it's the key to winning with consumers. And of course, we'll continue our focus on growing the right way with ESG integrated into our business, so that we're also creating value for society. A recent announcement to join the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's New Plastics Economy Global Commitment is an example of this. As we reinforced at Analyst Day, IGNITE innovates for good growth, growth that's profitable, sustainable and responsible. Operator, you may now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Dorer. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America.\nOlivia Tong: Good morning -- good afternoon. In terms of just near-term trajectory, I know you have quite a few initiatives like for second half across several businesses, but what about Q2? You talked a little bit about green shoots. Do any of those help already, or are those all sort of second half weighted?\nKevin Jacobsen: Hey, Olivia, it's Kevin. Good morning. Let me see if I can take that one. What I expect in Q2, is you'll see improved organic sales growth. Now having said that, I expect our Q2 results to look similar to Q1, with a worsening FX environment, but improving organic sales growth and really because we're going to see improvements on both Glad and Charcoal. As you know, those are the two challenged businesses that we're working to turn around and I expect to see improvements next quarter.\nBenno Dorer: And then Olivia, of course, that means the growth will come in the back half. First of all, they'll have easier comps. I think everybody is aware of that. But we're also beginning to anniversary distribution losses in Q3. And as you know, we're very focused on strengthening distribution now. Two things are most important. We need Glad and Kingsford to improve and we expect improvement on both. And we're seeing green shoots I've mentioned that. Kingsford is growing mid-single digits in consumption lately. And Glad is starting to grow share where our plans are implemented by end quarter. So we feel good about that. Then, of course, we have a robust innovation program in the back half as stated. So the back half is where improvements are expected. We realize we have work to do this, but there's enough there to give us confidence.\nOlivia Tong: Got it. That's helpful. If I could ask a question about tracked versus non-tracked? I mean the spread between the two seems to be increasing. Obviously online continues to be a big driver. But is it growing even faster than it had been? Is that accelerating, or are there more efforts or just more opportunity across a broad spectrum of non-tracked channels whether it's club online or other retailers?\nBenno Dorer: Yes. What we've commented on is that the spread between tracked and non-tracked is indeed widening, right? And I think that's for two reasons. First -- and it was probably most evident in Home Care where we've seen the business down slightly but growing double digits in non-tracked channels. First of all, I would say, the consumer in part in our categories is migrating towards non-tracked channels. That's where a lot of the category growth is. We do know that our performance also market share-wise is better in non-tracked channels. And perhaps at this point, as we think about the post-pricing bumpiness that we talked about you'll find more of that which relates to distribution losses and perhaps less merchandising in tracked channels than in non-tracked channels. And what that gives us is confidence in the expected back half turnaround because we know that where our brands are able to perform, they do. And that's why the gap between track and untracked has been widening of late.\nOlivia Tong: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hi, everybody. A couple of questions. I think first on the issues over the recent period has been in trash bags and in wipes and such but now we're -- you mentioned distribution losses and in bleach as well some tough comps I suppose on litter. But it looks like some of the issues are expanding beyond some of the categories that were kind of initially in the area of focus. Can you talk about what's going on there if there's something connected between the various categories that we should be aware of?\nBenno Dorer: Thanks Kaumil. No, the issue remains Glad and Kingsford. If you think about the rest of the portfolio, there's actually quite a bit of strength. Burt's grew double-digits. Food, 19 quarters of share growth. The Professional business growing high single digits. Brita is now our fastest-growing business in terms of share. Parts of Home Care are seeing strength. Toilets, which is a strategic segment, has an all-time high in shipments. International performing well. So it's really Glad and Kingsford. If you take out Glad and Kingsford actually we grew organic sales for the quarter. Now I will tell you that if you just look at share, of course, there's always ups and downs, right? But what I'd tell you is, if you look at it over the longer term, which I think is perhaps helpful, we tracked eight businesses in terms of share. And six out of those eight if you compare the last quarter against three years ago are in line or higher. Home Care is in line coming off of 14 quarters of share growth. Bleach is higher than three years ago. Hidden Valley is higher than three years ago. Brita is doing well. Litter is about in line. Burt's is higher. It's really coal and trash. So, no news on the portfolio front. Clearly, not everything is performing as well as we want to, but much of the short-term noise can be attributed to the well-illustrated issues around lower merchandising and distribution losses post pricing. And as such we believe that they will be temporary.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Okay. Understood. And then just finally on the expectations for the back half. It seems to be rooted in the return of distribution from some of the losses from last year. At what point -- do you know now if you're going to be put back in? Or at what point will you have a good sense on if we're going to be going into a period where there's distribution gains as opposed to distribution losses?\nBenno Dorer: Yeah. Back half clearly does assume that some of the distribution losses, which we're anniversarying in Q3 will be mitigated and that will start to make progress there along with easier comps and a strong innovation program. Categories generally are healthy. On the distribution side, we've commented that we're not -- we haven't been where we want to be in the last 12 months post pricing. And our focus is to make those temporary. Discussions are happening this quarter, so that's all work in progress at this point. Reasons that give us optimism as we're focused on achieving these improvements starting in 2020 is that we do have a long track record of partnering with retailers. It's obviously a very strong organizational focus area right now. I'm looking at our business plans for 2020 in particular on Glad and Kingsford. They need to be better and they will be better including robust innovation. And then our new IGNITE Strategy of course gives us plenty of partnership opportunities around creating categories for the future to drive profitable growth for retailers. So, work in progress. Many of them are happening as we speak, but a big area of organizational focus now.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Okay. Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.\nJason English: Hey, good morning folks. Good afternoon I should say, by this point, the day is all blended together now. A quick housekeeping question. The logistics and manufacturing line in your gross margin bridge, it's been sort of a persistent drag for quite some time. But it's now moderated for two consecutive quarters to be reasonably marginal now in the first quarter. Is that a trend line we can expect to continue?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah, Jason. I would say, I'd separate transportation from manufacturing. On the transportation side, as you mentioned, we're pleased to see favorable transportation rates for the first time and probably the better part of two years. We have about 20 bps of favorability, as we're seeing a decline in the spot carrier market. We talked about this before, but just as a reminder. About 85% of our transportation is contracted with our eight carriers and those rates are set. But we are seeing a reduction in the spot market that I believe will continue. It also bodes well that as we renegotiate rates in the future that that may generate ongoing benefit as we look out to fiscal year 2021 and beyond. So I started the year thinking transportation would be up low single-digits. And what I'm seeing right now, I suspect it will be flat to down low single-digits, so a nice improvement there. And then manufacturing, a little favorable this time. We had some delays in some of our investments for our new litter plant. You'll see that play out later on in the year. As I mentioned, we're going to have about 20 bps to 25 bps of investment in the supply chain. It was pretty light in Q1, but I still expect to spend that money in the year. So, we'll pick that up later in the year.\nJason English: All right. That's helpful. And I guess I want to come back to the question. Everything excluding Charcoal and wipes, which don't seem to be really a whole lot worse than I was expecting. But your Cleaning segment, it's one of the weakest quarters in a very, very long time. And if Professional is growing high singles, it implies that the consumer-facing side of that business is now contracting somewhere in the 3% to 4% range. I'd love some context and color on what's causing that business to kind of get derailed. And as we look at the data, I think your biggest innovation platform in recent years has been Scentiva. And in Nielsen, if Scentiva is now declining high singles even with sort of a 14-point benefit coming from the Swiffer refills it begs the question of whether or not the issue there is just a lack of innovation effectiveness. I'd love your opinion on all those fronts. Thank you.\nBenno Dorer: Yes. First of all, Jason I'll strongly disagree with the statement that the business is derailed. I'm actually okay with where the business is at this point. And let me maybe take the two in turn. First of all laundry additives. The sales was down behind post-pricing distribution losses. We have anticipated those. We have commented on those several times and talked about them consistently. If you look at the bleach share for instance, I quoted shares versus three years ago because sometimes it helps to look at the forest but not look at trees. Bleach share is up 1.5 points versus three years ago. I hope that provides perspective. And now we're gearing up for a significant innovation in the spring, which includes bleach compaction and a new platform in the fast-growing laundry sanitizer segment behind us, an equity that is particularly well fitting there. Home Care, if you just look at shares, it's coming off of 3.5 years of share growth. It's normal to have some up and down, especially post pricing. Again loss in distribution well documented. At the same time volume grew in Q1. Sales is down due to non-tracked channels. They outgrew tracked channels by a wide margin. Out \u2013 non-tracked channels grew double-digits in absolute. So that's a negative mix effect. Wipes is growing mid-single-digits. Scentiva for the record is growing, which perhaps helps you understand the strength in non-tracked channels. And if you look at the past 13 weeks tracked channel share is lower than a year ago but it's higher than past 52 weeks. So we're making progress. I'll focus on this category. Obviously, an important category for us is on profitable growth. We will continue to activate the Clorox brand purpose, which has been working so well. And of course, we have a lot of innovation that I know you're well aware of lined up in the back half including our Compostable Cleaning Wipes launch, which is starting to go out in Q2 and then widely available in Q3. So, ups and downs, but I feel solid about where Cleaning is and optimistic about the back half with all the innovation coming in.\nJason English: Okay, thanks a lot. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nOperator: Next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi.\nWendy Nicholson: Hi, good afternoon. My first question just housekeeping. How much longer do we think the private label exit in the Nutranext business is going to continue to be a headwind? I know you said like 80% of the business is healthy and good. But just when should we expect that headwind to go away? And then my second question is just taking a step back on the fixed initiatives you're undertaking for Glad and Charcoal, are obviously huge and important. And between the two of them those are I think what 15%, 20% of your revenues. And so I'm just surprised that your guidance both for the S&A line on the P&L and advertising isn't higher than normal. I know 10% for advertising and 14% for S&A are kind of your long-term objectives. But I'm kind of questioning why in this year where it's so important to get those two big businesses really back on track you wouldn't sort of take a holiday from your long-term targets and just say \"This year we're going to spend more and absolutely make sure we get those businesses righted.\" Thanks.\nKevin Jacobsen: Hey, Wendy, maybe I'll take the first question you had on RenewLife and how long as we exit some of that businesses both private label and contract manufacturing. I would expect to see that a drag for the balance of this year. We will continue to step out of that business over the next several quarters. And that's a pretty natural sort of transition out as we use that capacity for our own needs. And so you should expect to see that drag for the next several quarters.\nBenno Dorer: And then the second part Wendy, more money is not the option here certainly on the people and on the advertising side. If you think about Glad, what we're trying to do is fix the widened price gaps. And we feel good about the progress that we're making. And towards the end of the quarter and also in October where the plans are now fully implemented, which they are we're seeing a return to share growth. But the increased spending there is going into trade where we are spending more, but we feel good about advertising and certainly people. On Kingsford, it's all about better plans. As we've commented at Analyst Day, it's less of a money issue. And again, we've certainly spent quite a bit of trade money this last quarter to get rid of excess inventory. But we're pleased with the amount of money that we're spending behind those two businesses. As we've commented in the past, we're always willing to look at spending. We're also willing to lean into spending where that's indicated important and necessary. But we don't think that more advertising or people is the solution here. We're certainly spending more trade. But, the progress starts to be evident and we expect more progress to be had in the back half.\nWendy Nicholson: And I'm just surprised. I guess the feedback from the retailers. I mean there's always -- the hope I know is to regain some lost share. But there's also a hope, I assume, of growing the category particularly in Charcoal. And I'm surprised that part of the conversation with the retailers isn't, hey, Clorox, you've got the biggest and most well-known brand. Please spend more money on advertising to get people to stop ordering their ribs from Grubhub and cook them at home. Is that not part of the conversation?\nBenno Dorer: So part of the conversation certainly is engaging the consumer. And like I said, Wendy, we spent quite a bit against the consumer. And we're making sure that the money counts with retailers as well. But if you think about the Charcoal category, the Charcoal category past 13 weeks, I believe, is up double-digits. And our business while it's still a little softer in shares is growing mid-single digits. So the conversations that we have are starting to bear fruit. And we're certainly seeing in this category as well as in other categories like Glad and in wipes, the strong correlation between the health of our categories and the health of our brands. If our brands are doing well, the categories generally tend to perform better. If our brands are not doing well, the categories are performing worse. And that very part certainly, is a key component of our discussions with retailers.\nWendy Nicholson: Got it. Thank you.\nKevin Jacobsen: If I just broaden that a little bit from just Kingsford and Glad. The other perspective, I'd offer is if you think about our IGNITE Strategy, we want to create fuel and we want to reinvest that back in the business. And I feel really good. If you look at our gross margin performance now, we've expanded gross margins for each of the last four quarters. And at the same time, we've increased advertising levels for each of the last three quarters. So, very consistent with our long-term strategic intent is we're going to drive waste out, and we're going to reinvest that in the brands to drive superior consumer value. And I think you're really seeing that over the last several quarters.\nWendy Nicholson: Got it. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. First I had two clarifying questions. First is just a follow-up. Wendy, I think had asked about Nutranext. But I believe Kevin you responded to that talking about RenewLife. So, I just want to go back. And even when you acquired Nutranext, I mean to what degree did you have an understanding of the portfolio and that there'd be this decision to cut so much of the business, because some of the brands that were held up, I think they're described as kind of core seems to be what you're deemphasizing. So just sort of almost like a post-mortem on Nutranext would be great. That's the first follow-up. Thanks.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah. It was Nutranext. I apologize, Lauren. That was a Nutranext answer. So when we acquired the business -- and this is typical. When we acquire businesses in many cases, it comes along with pieces of the portfolio that we don't have any interest in strategically. In this case, they had done a number of acquisitions. And so they picked up private label. They had some contract manufacturing. They have a number of minor brands in DTC that don't -- we don't see it having long-term value. And so, pretty typical for the first year or two we will clean that up and get the portfolio focused on what we think has long-term value for our shareholders. And that's certainly what we're doing. So, we're stepping out of the private label. We're stepping out of the contract manufacturing certain aspects of DTC as well and really getting this to the core portfolio that we believe has long-term value.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay, great. And then the second thing was just about the second quarter. We've talked about things will improve. But then you also said the growth will come in the back half. So, I just want to be clear if second quarter sales expected to be down, albeit, a bit better than what we saw in Q1.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes Lauren, that's correct. I expect second quarter to look fairly similar to the first quarter in terms of sales, but the drivers will be different. The FX environment is getting worse. Keep in mind the bulk of our FX exposure is in Argentina probably 70% 75%. The big step-down in the peso happened late in August and so you have a partial impact in Q1. You'll get a bigger impact going forward and then that will be offset by improving organic sales.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay. All right, great. And then the other thing I was curious. Sort of post-Analyst Day, I sort of look back and was then thinking back a few years prior to -- I guess it was maybe four years prior to Analyst Day where you'd introduced the concept of fuel versus grow brands. I'm sort of thinking about the degree to which that approach kind of got you to where you are now on some of these big more challenged businesses. So, I just want to talk about sort of -- there's these steps to improve the short-term challenges, but also maybe a structural change in how you address businesses across the portfolio. Is that sort of a fair thought process? Because it feels like maybe these businesses are to start for like good four, five years and that's sort of how we got here. And also what maybe led to some of the pricing decisions being as I'll call it stubborn as they sort of proved to be?\nBenno Dorer: Lauren not really. So, if I think about Glad trash, that's a growth business and Kingsford is a fuel business. So, there's no correlation there as I look at those two businesses. I think it makes perfect sense for us to disproportionately invest in businesses that are faster-growing and that are more profitable. And I feel good about that. Brita is returning to grow. Burt's Bees has had a strong run. The Food business has had a strong run. And many of those businesses are performing better than they did before we started the concept of fuel versus growth. I would point to post-pricing issues on those two businesses. We feel good about pricing. We have always said that this is a short-term versus long-term trade-off. It's absolutely necessary for us to offset cost increases through pricing to be able to ensure that we're able to drive long-term shareholder value. We continue to manage our business with an eye on the long-term. And as difficult as these -- some of these distribution losses and certainly challenges on Glad and Kingsford are, the reality is that we must power through them as part of our focus on long-term profitable growth. So, I feel good about the fact that we're offsetting pricing aggressively. I feel good about how we're managing the portfolio as a whole and see none of this is related to the choice that we made four years ago.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay, great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Hey, good afternoon guys.\nBenno Dorer: Hey Kevin.\nKevin Grundy: First a housekeeping question for Kevin. So, first quarter, obviously, a bit soft. It sounds like second quarter challenged as well although contemplated in your guidance to some degree. Kevin I apologize if I missed this. Is it your preference to kind of level set expectations towards the lower end of the 1% to 3% organic sales guidance for the year? Or you still see it's possible to do the higher end which would imply something like 5% organic sales growth for the balance of the year which feels a little bit ambitious?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, Kevin. Thanks for the question. What I would say is I am comfortable with our 1% to 3% organic sales. I don't plan to provide any more insight in terms of high-low. I think that's a good solid range for us and feel comfortable with where we're at this point.\nKevin Grundy: Okay. All right. And then a follow-up question on the margin structure in the Household business understanding the significant price investment in advertising and marketing going on there. But the margin in the quarter about 6.5% I call it for operating margin was one of the lowest that we see in that segment in a very long time. This had been a low 20% operating margin business not going back to too far. How do you see the margin structure for that business now going forward? How much of this is, sort of, a permanent impairment, higher cost of business, higher advertising and marketing, trade promotion levels with some of your big important businesses; charcoal, trash bags, litter et cetera? Do you see this as more, sort of, a permanent impairment? Or you think that, kind of, out of the woods after a challenging year this year? Then I'll pass it on. Thank you.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah. Thanks Kevin. When I think about it in terms of margin in Household, one thing to keep in mind. The two businesses that are challenged Glad and Charcoal, they're our most capital intensive businesses. And so when you lose volume in those two businesses, you've got a lot of fixed costs that get spread over a lot of fewer units and have an outsized impact on margin. So my expectation is as we get those businesses back on track and growing, you'll see that reflected more positively in the margin line.\nKevin Grundy: Okay. Thank you guys. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nKevin Jacobsen: Thanks, Kevin.\nOperator: Next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.\nAli Dibadj: Hi, guys. So I have a few questions. But one Benno, I just want to take a step back around the pricing strategy. So look I get the bumpiness commentary. I get we've seen this before commentary. But honestly, I guess, I would have thought that bumpiness is going to be more from the consumer elasticity\u2019s, which has certainly been the case historically. But they're just -- there are many perhaps too many instances of the retailers reacting badly to the price increases. And I guess, I just want to ask a very simple question and I apologize if it's na\u00efve. But why do you think the retailers are kicking you off the shelf now when you're taking the price increases?\nBenno Dorer: Yes. So as you -- so consumer elasticity are good, right? So we have commented that they're largely unchanged versus before price increases. We've also commented on the fact that the consumer value measure actually is really positive with 54% of our portfolio being seen as superior, which compares to 53% before price increases. So pricing generally is performing as expected. Why do -- why are we experiencing these distribution issues? We certainly went out early and confidently. So I would perhaps point to that. Other than that you'd have to ask retailers. But clearly what we're seeing in some categories is that some competitors didn't follow where we might have expected them to follow. And as a result we get an outside reaction. But look I understand this. In many cases categories where we've lost distribution are softer too. I commented on the correlation between our performance and category performance. And that's really what we're focused on right now. Losing distribution as hard as it was is water under the bridge. We're focused on getting distribution back. And we're working with retailers now to make progress in 2020.\nAli Dibadj: So I guess it's still helpful. But I guess because I just -- I'm sorry. I just don\u2019t -- I don't understand. So if elasticity\u2019s are good, the consumer doesn't respond poorly to this and that's all great. I mean their brands are good. So why are the retailers making -- it sounds like a mistake. What's going on? Is it that they disagree or\u2026?\nBenno Dorer: I'm sorry?\nAli Dibadj: Is it that they disagree and that they view elasticity\u2019s as worse? Or they don't think your brands are good enough? Or why do they kick you guys off shelf in many instances now when you're taking prices up, if elasticity\u2019s are good and consumers are okay with it? It helps our costs, so I just don't get it.\nBenno Dorer: Let's take Glad as the best example perhaps. We took pricing before, resin flipped. And then there were questions about the cost justification of pricing. To be clear pricing continues to be justified but that doesn't mean that retailers like it. So that part while it isn't something that is up in the category, it's also pretty consistent with what we've seen in the past with the one exception that resin flied after we took pricing. But this is not uncommon Ali. It's worse but in part it is that we took pricing early and perhaps very confidently, whereas, some of our peers did not.\nAli Dibadj: Okay, okay. And then -- so on the confidence going forward, confidence in the second half. Is lapping distribution losses in your second half guidance Kevin? Or is it actual kind of new distribution gains which is in your guidance?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes. I'd say it's a combination of both. Certainly lapping distribution losses is a big element, when you look at our comps, we'll be lapping in the back half of the year particularly Q4. And then as Benno commented to a certain extent, we're actually working on rebuilding distribution and have some expectation in terms of how that will play out. But as we said earlier, those decisions are being made right now over the next quarter or so. So we'll have to see how that goes. It's still fairly early but there's certainly an expectation that we make progress there as well.\nAli Dibadj: Okay. And just my last question around Cleaning, you went through it in detail, thank you Benno for doing that. Are laundry shelf space losses or laundry issues -- is that anything in anticipation of the compaction of the product? Or was it just an isolated and different incident?\nBenno Dorer: No. I wouldn't call that related to compaction Ali. It's a loss of distribution post pricing as we commented, but nothing related to compaction. No.\nAli Dibadj: Okay, all right. Thanks very much for your help.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we have a question from Steve Strycula with UBS.\nSteve Strycula: Hi good afternoon. So Kevin quick question for you on the gross margin, you talked about timing and cadence a little bit saying the first quarter was a little bit better. Can you walk us through some of the puts and takes for the gross margin? Should we expect it down for the next several quarters of the year for the balance of the year? That would be my first question.\nKevin Jacobsen: Sure Steve. As you think about gross margin phasing, as you know for the full year our outlook is it will be down slightly. This was the easiest comp we had. We were down 150 basis points in Q1 last year. So we had a pretty easy comp. The other item to think about though is on cost savings, we had a very strong quarter. We delivered 180 basis points of benefit to margin. That was the strongest quarter we've had in five years. I am pleased with the performance. But we have a big number we're trying to hit this year and quite a bit of work ahead of us. So while I'm pleased with Q1, I don't expect to be taking the number up at this point. As I said previously our expectation on cost savings to be close to last year maybe a little bit better. That's 150 basis points, so you kind of phase that through the year.  Also if you think about pricing the bulk of the pricing we took last year was front-loaded. And so in Q1 with 120 basis points of benefit, I'd expect to see that decline as we move through the year. Same with FX, we have a partial impact this year -- or excuse me this quarter. So as you get the full impact from Argentina, plus the ongoing devaluation, I'd expect FX impact to be more negative going forward. And then finally, as I mentioned earlier, the supply chain events we're making fairly light in Q1. We will make those investments over the balance of the year. So you'll see that pick up in the manufacturing line over the course of the year. So when I play all that out, I still think, it's a balanced view about down slightly for the year. And that would suggest you'll see negative gross margins going forward, with our plus 60 to begin the year.\nSteve Strycula: Okay. And then, Benno a quick question. As we lap last year's, weaker flu season. Have you seen retailers start to build back up for the Cleaning and the wipes business, as they think about arguably an easy flu season compare? And then, can you remind us -- it's been a few years since we've had a compaction cycle. Just to think about, the various -- whether it's volume or margin implications that investors should think about as we move through that period in the spring. Thank you.\nBenno Dorer: Thanks, Steve. On the flu season, we're always working with retailers to prepare for flu season, no matter whether flu season is good or bad. So, we will be prepared to serve consumers, as they are looking for more disinfecting products. And on compaction, typically what you see, if we can repeat what happened in the last few times the way we did compaction is one the gross margin expansion. So we would expect that. I think that's pretty obvious as logistics and packaging material costs are lower predominantly. And then, what you often see is consumers migrate to larger sizes. And with that usually comes and expansion of consumption which in the previous two times also had a positive top line effect. So the primary benefit is on gross margin. But it does have a top line effect that can be persistent for the first 12 to 24 months post launch.\nSteve Strycula: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Dorer, I would now like to turn the program, back over to you.\nBenno Dorer: Yeah. Thank you. And thank you for joining everyone. I wish all of you, a happy Halloween.

            "content": "Thank you, Lisah, and thank you everyone for joining us today. First quarter results came in generally as expected, as we continue to work through the challenges in our Bags and Wraps and Charcoal businesses. Importantly as we noted in our press release, we remain on track for fiscal year 2020 and confirmed our outlook. Turning to our first quarter results, sales decreased 4% reflecting about 3 points of higher trade spending about 2 points of unfavorable mix and about 2 points of foreign currency headwinds. These factors were partially offset by about 3 points of pricing benefit. On an organic sales basis, first quarter sales decreased 2%, primarily driven by our Bags and Wraps and Charcoal businesses. Gross margin for the quarter increased 60 basis points to 44% compared to 43.4% for the year ago quarter. First quarter gross margin included 180 basis points of benefit from cost savings and a 120 basis point benefit from pricing partially offset by 180 basis points of higher trade spending. I'd like to note that a portion of the benefits to gross margin was related to timing. First quarter gross margin also reflected favorability in commodity and logistics costs. And while it's still early in the fiscal year, we're encouraged by the cost favorability we're seeing in these markets. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of sales came in at 14% compared to 13.6% due to reduced operating leverage. Importantly year-over-year selling and administrative spending for the quarter declined. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels as a percentage of sales were about flat with spending for our U.S. retail business coming in at about 10% of sales. Our first quarter effective tax rate was about 22% equal to the year ago quarter. Net of all these factors, we delivered diluted net earnings per share of $1.59 versus $1.62 in the year ago quarter, a decrease of 2%. Turning to year-to-date cash flow, net cash provided by operations in the first quarter came in at $271 million versus $259 million in the prior quarter, an increase of 5%.  Now I'll turn to our fiscal year 2020 outlook. As we communicated in our October 2, press release we expect this year's sales to be down low single digits to up 1% reflecting our recently updated assumption of about 2 points of impact from unfavorable foreign currencies, primarily from Argentina. As I mentioned at our Analyst Day, we previously assumed devaluation of the Argentine peso at about 25%. And now our expectations are closer to 50%. Importantly, our fiscal year organic sales outlook remains unchanged reflecting 1% to 3% organic sales growth driven by innovation and our expectation for stronger business performance on Bags and Wraps and Charcoal in the back half of the fiscal year. Turning to gross margin, we continue to expect fiscal year margin to be down slightly reflecting our recently updated assumption on foreign currencies. Our fiscal year gross margin outlook continues to reflect our expectation for additional supply chain investments to support long-term value creation including our investment in the rollout of Clorox Liquid Bleach compaction in the spring of 2020. We continue to expect fiscal year advertising and sales promotion investment levels to be at about 10% of sales. We also continue to expect selling and administrative expenses to come in at about 14% of sales. Consistent with our fiscal year gross margin assumptions, we expect fiscal year EBIT margin to be down slightly. Our fiscal year 2020 outlook continues to anticipate our fiscal year effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 23%. Net of all these factors, we continue to expect fiscal year 2020 diluted EPS to be in the range of $6.05 to $6.25. In closing, first quarter results came in generally as anticipated. We continue to work through the short-term challenges, we're facing in Bags and Wraps and Charcoal and continue to expect improvement in our overall results in the back half of the fiscal year. We're certainly pleased that our cost savings program is off to a good start contributing significantly to our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin expansion. Looking ahead, we'll continue to address short-term challenges while executing against the strategic choices we have made under our IGNITE Strategy. As we said at the Analyst Day, our focus with IGNITE is to create a virtuous cycle of generating fuel to continue investing to drive superior consumer value. We have a long track record of doing this successfully. And I continue to believe that once we work through the challenges we're facing in Bags and Wraps and Charcoal, Clorox will be in a position to deliver results that are more in line with our long-term financial goals. And with that, I'll turn it over to Benno. Hey, Olivia, it's Kevin. Good morning. Let me see if I can take that one. What I expect in Q2, is you'll see improved organic sales growth. Now having said that, I expect our Q2 results to look similar to Q1, with a worsening FX environment, but improving organic sales growth and really because we're going to see improvements on both Glad and Charcoal. As you know, those are the two challenged businesses that we're working to turn around and I expect to see improvements next quarter. Yeah, Jason. I would say, I'd separate transportation from manufacturing. On the transportation side, as you mentioned, we're pleased to see favorable transportation rates for the first time and probably the better part of two years. We have about 20 bps of favorability, as we're seeing a decline in the spot carrier market. We talked about this before, but just as a reminder. About 85% of our transportation is contracted with our eight carriers and those rates are set. But we are seeing a reduction in the spot market that I believe will continue. It also bodes well that as we renegotiate rates in the future that that may generate ongoing benefit as we look out to fiscal year 2021 and beyond. So I started the year thinking transportation would be up low single-digits. And what I'm seeing right now, I suspect it will be flat to down low single-digits, so a nice improvement there. And then manufacturing, a little favorable this time. We had some delays in some of our investments for our new litter plant. You'll see that play out later on in the year. As I mentioned, we're going to have about 20 bps to 25 bps of investment in the supply chain. It was pretty light in Q1, but I still expect to spend that money in the year. So, we'll pick that up later in the year. Hey, Wendy, maybe I'll take the first question you had on RenewLife and how long as we exit some of that businesses both private label and contract manufacturing. I would expect to see that a drag for the balance of this year. We will continue to step out of that business over the next several quarters. And that's a pretty natural sort of transition out as we use that capacity for our own needs. And so you should expect to see that drag for the next several quarters. If I just broaden that a little bit from just Kingsford and Glad. The other perspective, I'd offer is if you think about our IGNITE Strategy, we want to create fuel and we want to reinvest that back in the business. And I feel really good. If you look at our gross margin performance now, we've expanded gross margins for each of the last four quarters. And at the same time, we've increased advertising levels for each of the last three quarters. So, very consistent with our long-term strategic intent is we're going to drive waste out, and we're going to reinvest that in the brands to drive superior consumer value. And I think you're really seeing that over the last several quarters. Yeah. It was Nutranext. I apologize, Lauren. That was a Nutranext answer. So when we acquired the business -- and this is typical. When we acquire businesses in many cases, it comes along with pieces of the portfolio that we don't have any interest in strategically. In this case, they had done a number of acquisitions. And so they picked up private label. They had some contract manufacturing. They have a number of minor brands in DTC that don't -- we don't see it having long-term value. And so, pretty typical for the first year or two we will clean that up and get the portfolio focused on what we think has long-term value for our shareholders. And that's certainly what we're doing. So, we're stepping out of the private label. We're stepping out of the contract manufacturing certain aspects of DTC as well and really getting this to the core portfolio that we believe has long-term value. Yes Lauren, that's correct. I expect second quarter to look fairly similar to the first quarter in terms of sales, but the drivers will be different. The FX environment is getting worse. Keep in mind the bulk of our FX exposure is in Argentina probably 70% 75%. The big step-down in the peso happened late in August and so you have a partial impact in Q1. You'll get a bigger impact going forward and then that will be offset by improving organic sales. Yes, Kevin. Thanks for the question. What I would say is I am comfortable with our 1% to 3% organic sales. I don't plan to provide any more insight in terms of high-low. I think that's a good solid range for us and feel comfortable with where we're at this point. Yeah. Thanks Kevin. When I think about it in terms of margin in Household, one thing to keep in mind. The two businesses that are challenged Glad and Charcoal, they're our most capital intensive businesses. And so when you lose volume in those two businesses, you've got a lot of fixed costs that get spread over a lot of fewer units and have an outsized impact on margin. So my expectation is as we get those businesses back on track and growing, you'll see that reflected more positively in the margin line. Thanks, Kevin. Yes. I'd say it's a combination of both. Certainly lapping distribution losses is a big element, when you look at our comps, we'll be lapping in the back half of the year particularly Q4. And then as Benno commented to a certain extent, we're actually working on rebuilding distribution and have some expectation in terms of how that will play out. But as we said earlier, those decisions are being made right now over the next quarter or so. So we'll have to see how that goes. It's still fairly early but there's certainly an expectation that we make progress there as well. Sure Steve. As you think about gross margin phasing, as you know for the full year our outlook is it will be down slightly. This was the easiest comp we had. We were down 150 basis points in Q1 last year. So we had a pretty easy comp. The other item to think about though is on cost savings, we had a very strong quarter. We delivered 180 basis points of benefit to margin. That was the strongest quarter we've had in five years. I am pleased with the performance. But we have a big number we're trying to hit this year and quite a bit of work ahead of us. So while I'm pleased with Q1, I don't expect to be taking the number up at this point. As I said previously our expectation on cost savings to be close to last year maybe a little bit better. That's 150 basis points, so you kind of phase that through the year.  Also if you think about pricing the bulk of the pricing we took last year was front-loaded. And so in Q1 with 120 basis points of benefit, I'd expect to see that decline as we move through the year. Same with FX, we have a partial impact this year -- or excuse me this quarter. So as you get the full impact from Argentina, plus the ongoing devaluation, I'd expect FX impact to be more negative going forward. And then finally, as I mentioned earlier, the supply chain events we're making fairly light in Q1. We will make those investments over the balance of the year. So you'll see that pick up in the manufacturing line over the course of the year. So when I play all that out, I still think, it's a balanced view about down slightly for the year. And that would suggest you'll see negative gross margins going forward, with our plus 60 to begin the year."

            "name": "Benno Dorer",
            "content": "Hello everyone, and thank you Kevin. Here are my three key messages. First, Q1 results came in generally as expected. As we discussed last quarter, we anticipate fiscal year 2020 first half sales to be lower than the second half, as we continue working through the persistent challenges in Bags and Wraps and Charcoal. I am pleased we delivered volume growth and gross margin expansion in three out of four segments. And notwithstanding a tougher foreign currency environment, which drove flat sales in our international business for the quarter, our international team continues to make strong progress, delivering 8% organic sales growth and the seventh consecutive quarter of profit growth. Now clearly, we are not satisfied with our top line results. I do want to reinforce that improving Bags and Wraps and Charcoal is a top priority for us. We are actively working with customers to significantly strengthen our business plans with a keen eye on sustainable long-term improvement. This includes innovation that we believe will deliver meaningful value to our consumers and categories. Importantly, I'm pleased about the green shoots we're starting to see on these businesses. And I continue to anticipate improvement on Bags and Wraps and Charcoal in the second half of the fiscal year. My second message is that we're on track to deliver our outlook for the fiscal year 2020. This fiscal year brings another robust pipeline of innovation, led by the Compaction of Clorox Liquid Bleach as well as the launch of Clorox Compostable Cleaning Wipes, Clorox Fabric Sanitizer, Kingsford Pellets and several innovations in Bags and Wraps and Natural Personal Care. We will drive awareness and trial of these new products, while continuing to invest behind significant upside opportunity in ongoing innovation platforms, such as Clorox Scentiva, Fresh Step Clean Paws, Brita Filtering Water Bottles and Hidden Valley Ready-to-Eat Dips. I believe that consumer and retailer engagement in the strength of our innovation program along with stronger business plans for Bags and Wraps and Charcoal, supported by our commitment to excellent execution will contribute to improved overall results in the back half of the fiscal year. As I also mentioned previously, our fiscal year 2020 outlook continues to reflect our commitment to balancing our shorter-term focus on addressing the challenges on Bags and Wraps and Charcoal with strategic plans aimed at driving long-term profitable growth. Finally, my third message is this. I'm confident our new IGNITE Strategy will guide us in our ongoing pursuit of delivering long-term shareholder value. As we discussed at Analyst Day earlier this month, innovation to strengthen and extend our competitive advantage is front and center in our IGNITE Strategy. The integrated choices we've established for IGNITE create a virtuous circle of fueling growth and investing behind innovation to deliver superior value. By the end of fiscal year 2020, we expect to have begun activating brand purpose on all major brands, laying the groundwork to drive significant marketing ROI in the future. We expect to have engaged all major customers in new ways to create frictionless shopping experiences in-store and online leading to meaningful opportunities to drive category growth. We also expect to have surpassed 150 basis points of annual cost savings, supported by meaningful productivity improvements, moving steadily towards our new annual cost savings target of about 175 basis points. And finally, we expect to have made significant investments to drive stickier multi-year innovation platforms that differentiate our products and brands with a robust innovation pipeline in the back half of fiscal 2020. Everything we do is in service of superior value, because we know it's the key to winning with consumers. And of course, we'll continue our focus on growing the right way with ESG integrated into our business, so that we're also creating value for society. A recent announcement to join the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's New Plastics Economy Global Commitment is an example of this. As we reinforced at Analyst Day, IGNITE innovates for good growth, growth that's profitable, sustainable and responsible. Operator, you may now open up the line for questions. And then Olivia, of course, that means the growth will come in the back half. First of all, they'll have easier comps. I think everybody is aware of that. But we're also beginning to anniversary distribution losses in Q3. And as you know, we're very focused on strengthening distribution now. Two things are most important. We need Glad and Kingsford to improve and we expect improvement on both. And we're seeing green shoots I've mentioned that. Kingsford is growing mid-single digits in consumption lately. And Glad is starting to grow share where our plans are implemented by end quarter. So we feel good about that. Then, of course, we have a robust innovation program in the back half as stated. So the back half is where improvements are expected. We realize we have work to do this, but there's enough there to give us confidence. Yes. What we've commented on is that the spread between tracked and non-tracked is indeed widening, right? And I think that's for two reasons. First -- and it was probably most evident in Home Care where we've seen the business down slightly but growing double digits in non-tracked channels. First of all, I would say, the consumer in part in our categories is migrating towards non-tracked channels. That's where a lot of the category growth is. We do know that our performance also market share-wise is better in non-tracked channels. And perhaps at this point, as we think about the post-pricing bumpiness that we talked about you'll find more of that which relates to distribution losses and perhaps less merchandising in tracked channels than in non-tracked channels. And what that gives us is confidence in the expected back half turnaround because we know that where our brands are able to perform, they do. And that's why the gap between track and untracked has been widening of late. Thanks Kaumil. No, the issue remains Glad and Kingsford. If you think about the rest of the portfolio, there's actually quite a bit of strength. Burt's grew double-digits. Food, 19 quarters of share growth. The Professional business growing high single digits. Brita is now our fastest-growing business in terms of share. Parts of Home Care are seeing strength. Toilets, which is a strategic segment, has an all-time high in shipments. International performing well. So it's really Glad and Kingsford. If you take out Glad and Kingsford actually we grew organic sales for the quarter. Now I will tell you that if you just look at share, of course, there's always ups and downs, right? But what I'd tell you is, if you look at it over the longer term, which I think is perhaps helpful, we tracked eight businesses in terms of share. And six out of those eight if you compare the last quarter against three years ago are in line or higher. Home Care is in line coming off of 14 quarters of share growth. Bleach is higher than three years ago. Hidden Valley is higher than three years ago. Brita is doing well. Litter is about in line. Burt's is higher. It's really coal and trash. So, no news on the portfolio front. Clearly, not everything is performing as well as we want to, but much of the short-term noise can be attributed to the well-illustrated issues around lower merchandising and distribution losses post pricing. And as such we believe that they will be temporary. Yeah. Back half clearly does assume that some of the distribution losses, which we're anniversarying in Q3 will be mitigated and that will start to make progress there along with easier comps and a strong innovation program. Categories generally are healthy. On the distribution side, we've commented that we're not -- we haven't been where we want to be in the last 12 months post pricing. And our focus is to make those temporary. Discussions are happening this quarter, so that's all work in progress at this point. Reasons that give us optimism as we're focused on achieving these improvements starting in 2020 is that we do have a long track record of partnering with retailers. It's obviously a very strong organizational focus area right now. I'm looking at our business plans for 2020 in particular on Glad and Kingsford. They need to be better and they will be better including robust innovation. And then our new IGNITE Strategy of course gives us plenty of partnership opportunities around creating categories for the future to drive profitable growth for retailers. So, work in progress. Many of them are happening as we speak, but a big area of organizational focus now. Yes. First of all, Jason I'll strongly disagree with the statement that the business is derailed. I'm actually okay with where the business is at this point. And let me maybe take the two in turn. First of all laundry additives. The sales was down behind post-pricing distribution losses. We have anticipated those. We have commented on those several times and talked about them consistently. If you look at the bleach share for instance, I quoted shares versus three years ago because sometimes it helps to look at the forest but not look at trees. Bleach share is up 1.5 points versus three years ago. I hope that provides perspective. And now we're gearing up for a significant innovation in the spring, which includes bleach compaction and a new platform in the fast-growing laundry sanitizer segment behind us, an equity that is particularly well fitting there. Home Care, if you just look at shares, it's coming off of 3.5 years of share growth. It's normal to have some up and down, especially post pricing. Again loss in distribution well documented. At the same time volume grew in Q1. Sales is down due to non-tracked channels. They outgrew tracked channels by a wide margin. Out \u2013 non-tracked channels grew double-digits in absolute. So that's a negative mix effect. Wipes is growing mid-single-digits. Scentiva for the record is growing, which perhaps helps you understand the strength in non-tracked channels. And if you look at the past 13 weeks tracked channel share is lower than a year ago but it's higher than past 52 weeks. So we're making progress. I'll focus on this category. Obviously, an important category for us is on profitable growth. We will continue to activate the Clorox brand purpose, which has been working so well. And of course, we have a lot of innovation that I know you're well aware of lined up in the back half including our Compostable Cleaning Wipes launch, which is starting to go out in Q2 and then widely available in Q3. So, ups and downs, but I feel solid about where Cleaning is and optimistic about the back half with all the innovation coming in. And then the second part Wendy, more money is not the option here certainly on the people and on the advertising side. If you think about Glad, what we're trying to do is fix the widened price gaps. And we feel good about the progress that we're making. And towards the end of the quarter and also in October where the plans are now fully implemented, which they are we're seeing a return to share growth. But the increased spending there is going into trade where we are spending more, but we feel good about advertising and certainly people. On Kingsford, it's all about better plans. As we've commented at Analyst Day, it's less of a money issue. And again, we've certainly spent quite a bit of trade money this last quarter to get rid of excess inventory. But we're pleased with the amount of money that we're spending behind those two businesses. As we've commented in the past, we're always willing to look at spending. We're also willing to lean into spending where that's indicated important and necessary. But we don't think that more advertising or people is the solution here. We're certainly spending more trade. But, the progress starts to be evident and we expect more progress to be had in the back half. So part of the conversation certainly is engaging the consumer. And like I said, Wendy, we spent quite a bit against the consumer. And we're making sure that the money counts with retailers as well. But if you think about the Charcoal category, the Charcoal category past 13 weeks, I believe, is up double-digits. And our business while it's still a little softer in shares is growing mid-single digits. So the conversations that we have are starting to bear fruit. And we're certainly seeing in this category as well as in other categories like Glad and in wipes, the strong correlation between the health of our categories and the health of our brands. If our brands are doing well, the categories generally tend to perform better. If our brands are not doing well, the categories are performing worse. And that very part certainly, is a key component of our discussions with retailers. Lauren not really. So, if I think about Glad trash, that's a growth business and Kingsford is a fuel business. So, there's no correlation there as I look at those two businesses. I think it makes perfect sense for us to disproportionately invest in businesses that are faster-growing and that are more profitable. And I feel good about that. Brita is returning to grow. Burt's Bees has had a strong run. The Food business has had a strong run. And many of those businesses are performing better than they did before we started the concept of fuel versus growth. I would point to post-pricing issues on those two businesses. We feel good about pricing. We have always said that this is a short-term versus long-term trade-off. It's absolutely necessary for us to offset cost increases through pricing to be able to ensure that we're able to drive long-term shareholder value. We continue to manage our business with an eye on the long-term. And as difficult as these -- some of these distribution losses and certainly challenges on Glad and Kingsford are, the reality is that we must power through them as part of our focus on long-term profitable growth. So, I feel good about the fact that we're offsetting pricing aggressively. I feel good about how we're managing the portfolio as a whole and see none of this is related to the choice that we made four years ago. Hey Kevin. Yes. So as you -- so consumer elasticity are good, right? So we have commented that they're largely unchanged versus before price increases. We've also commented on the fact that the consumer value measure actually is really positive with 54% of our portfolio being seen as superior, which compares to 53% before price increases. So pricing generally is performing as expected. Why do -- why are we experiencing these distribution issues? We certainly went out early and confidently. So I would perhaps point to that. Other than that you'd have to ask retailers. But clearly what we're seeing in some categories is that some competitors didn't follow where we might have expected them to follow. And as a result we get an outside reaction. But look I understand this. In many cases categories where we've lost distribution are softer too. I commented on the correlation between our performance and category performance. And that's really what we're focused on right now. Losing distribution as hard as it was is water under the bridge. We're focused on getting distribution back. And we're working with retailers now to make progress in 2020. I'm sorry? Let's take Glad as the best example perhaps. We took pricing before, resin flipped. And then there were questions about the cost justification of pricing. To be clear pricing continues to be justified but that doesn't mean that retailers like it. So that part while it isn't something that is up in the category, it's also pretty consistent with what we've seen in the past with the one exception that resin flied after we took pricing. But this is not uncommon Ali. It's worse but in part it is that we took pricing early and perhaps very confidently, whereas, some of our peers did not. No. I wouldn't call that related to compaction Ali. It's a loss of distribution post pricing as we commented, but nothing related to compaction. No. Thanks, Steve. On the flu season, we're always working with retailers to prepare for flu season, no matter whether flu season is good or bad. So, we will be prepared to serve consumers, as they are looking for more disinfecting products. And on compaction, typically what you see, if we can repeat what happened in the last few times the way we did compaction is one the gross margin expansion. So we would expect that. I think that's pretty obvious as logistics and packaging material costs are lower predominantly. And then, what you often see is consumers migrate to larger sizes. And with that usually comes and expansion of consumption which in the previous two times also had a positive top line effect. So the primary benefit is on gross margin. But it does have a top line effect that can be persistent for the first 12 to 24 months post launch. Yeah. Thank you. And thank you for joining everyone. I wish all of you, a happy Halloween. And we look forward to talking with you again in February, when we report on our Q2."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin.\nLisah Burhan: Thanks, Christy. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We hope you and your families are continuing to stay safe and well. Before we get started, I want to let you know that we are making some changes to how we present our result. Today, Linda will start by providing some overall key takeaways for the year. Next, I\u2019ll follow-up with some highlights from each of our segment. Kevin will then address our financial results as well as our outlook for fiscal year 2022. And, finally, Linda will return to offer her perspective and we\u2019ll close with Q&A. Now, a few reminders before we go into results. We\u2019re broadcasting this call over the Internet and a replay of the call will be available for 7 days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com. Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements, including statements related to the expected or potential impact of COVID-19. These statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations but may differ from actual results or outcome. In addition, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statement section, which identifies various factors that could affect such forward-looking statements and the non-GAAP financial information section, including the tables that reconcile non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, both of which are located at the end of today\u2019s earnings release, which is also been posted on our website and filed with the SEC. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Linda.\nLinda Rendle: Thank you, Lisa. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Fiscal 2021 was an extraordinary year for Clorox, with the pandemic putting us through the ultimate test of volatility, including rapid changes in consumer demand and significant cost inflation, which was reflected in our Q4 results. Despite the complexities we faced, we delivered 9% sales growth for the fiscal year on a reported and organic basis, reflecting growth in all 4 reportable segments. This was on top of the reported 8% increase we delivered in fiscal 2020. On a 2-year stack basis, we delivered 17% sales growth. With rising cost pressures, we experienced declines in gross margin, particularly in Q4, resulting in a decrease of 200 basis points for the fiscal year, which we will discuss in more detail. Fiscal year 2021 adjusted EPS decreased 2% to $7.25. Recognizing the immediate priorities before us, I\u2019d like to reinforce what matters most, long-term profitable growth. With a business that\u2019s significantly larger than before the pandemic and a portfolio of trusted brands exposed to more tailwinds, we have clarity in our strategic imperatives, and I have every confidence in our ability to continue delivering long-term value creation for our shareholders. When I look at fiscal 2021, our performance has shown the strength of our people, brands and products, as well as the resilience of our categories, as we work tirelessly to supply consumers with products across our portfolio. As a result, we experienced significant growth in demand and strengthened our position amongst global consumers, with strong household penetration supported by higher repeat rates across new and existing users. The last 12 months have also demonstrated the need to accelerate our IGNITE strategy, to address near-term headwinds and capitalize on long-term opportunities. The industry environment remains dynamic, with significant inflationary pressure and continuing uncertainty. In the face of these conditions, our top priority is strong execution, to mitigate the impact of elevated cost headwinds and continue to improve market share. The pandemic has also highlighted areas where additional investments can help us be as agile as possible in the future. We are clear on the opportunities ahead of us to differentiate Clorox and build a stronger, more resilient, and more profitable company. This includes driving our growth runways and making investments to enhance our digital capabilities and drive productivity improvements, which I will discuss shortly. We are confident that strong execution of our IGNITE strategy will enable us to achieve our 3% to 5% long-term sales target and deliver long-term shareholder value. Before I discuss Q4 and our progress against our strategy, I\u2019d like to thank our Clorox teammates around the world for everything they\u2019ve accomplished over the past year, as well as their commitment and dedication to serving people and communities around the world. For Q4, faster-than-expected moderating demand for cleaning and disinfecting products, had a pronounced impact on sales growth, as we move through the peak of the pandemic and lapped the unprecedented demand we experienced last year. The magnitude of this quarter\u2019s gross margin contraction was a result of faster-than-expected sales, moderation, acceleration of inflationary headwinds and improvements in supply, which led to broader product assortment, including the reintroduction of value packs. I\u2019ll discuss shortly the actions we\u2019re taking to address these headwinds. Now, let me share a few highlights of our progress on our IGNITE strategy. First, with fuel growth being a critical focus to help address elevated cost pressures, and ensure the long-term health of our brands, I\u2019m pleased we delivered over $120 million in cost savings in the fiscal year, surpassing our annual target. Second, we made strong progress on our 2025 goal to know 100 million people, crossing the halfway mark to our goal this fiscal year. Our higher investment and personalization has led to significantly improved ROI. It has been one of the contributors to increasingly strong payouts, driving our confidence in continued investments in our brands. Third, with innovation at the heart of our strategy, we doubled our innovation investments in fiscal 2021. And new products were a bigger contributor to our top-line, which we expect to continue in fiscal 2022. Next, as consumers have increased their digital usage during the pandemic, we leaned into digital marketing and commerce, resulting in our e-commerce business nearly doubling in the last 2 years, which today represents about 13% of total company sales. Finally, we continue to make progress on our ESG goals. For example, we advanced our commitment to climate action and submitted our proposal on Science Based Targets for our operations, and Scope 3 emissions to the Science Based Target Initiative in June. And as a people-centric company, we continue to focus on the wellbeing of our teammates, and our value-based inclusive culture. I\u2019m particularly proud that during this trying year, we achieved our best safety score in recorded history. With a recordable incident rate of 0.26, significantly lower than the 3.3 industry average. I\u2019m also pleased that in fiscal 2021, we continue to have high employee engagement of 87%, putting us at the top quartile of Fortune 500 companies. Now, let me turn to fiscal 2022. We expect inflationary pressure to persist along with continued moderating demand as we lap COVID-19-related demand surges in the first half of fiscal 2021. While this is reflected in our fiscal 2022 outlook, which Kevin will discuss, by the second half of the year, we expect to be within the lower end of the range of our long-term sales target. Like others in our industry and beyond, we are experiencing significant increases in input and transportation costs across all categories in our portfolio, which have accelerated since Q3, and we\u2019re holistically and dynamically managing this with a laser-focus on rebuilding margin. We implemented pricing on Glad and announced actions on our food, cleaning and international businesses. This represents about 50% of our portfolio. We\u2019re also pursuing pricing in additional parts of our portfolio, which we\u2019ll communicate at the right time. Based on the constructive conversations we\u2019re having with our retail partners, and importantly, the strength of our brands, we feel confident about our ability to execute our pricing plans. In addition, we will continue to drive our hallmark cost savings program. We expect sequential growth margin improvements as we progress through fiscal 2022, with our assumption for gross margin expansion by Q4. In terms of market share, as we\u2019ve discussed previously, we have experienced some declines due to supply challenges, but has made notable progress. With strong investments in internal and external production capacity, including additional manufacturing lines and a significant expansion of our production team, in June we achieved our highest case fill rate since the start of the pandemic. I\u2019m pleased to see that in the latest 13-week data ending July 17, we saw market share gains in 7 out of 9 businesses. Certainly, we recognize there is more work to do in parts of the portfolio, such as Glad trash. And we have adjusted our plans to drive market share improvements over time. Despite these near-term headwinds, we remain focused on our long-term priorities, rooted in our IGNITE strategy, to deliver our long-term growth aspirations. While some pandemic-related behaviors may revert over the next 12 months, we continue to believe there\u2019s been a shift in behaviors that will advantage Clorox longer-term, including a focus on health, wellness and hygiene, more time at home, as well as increased adoption of e-commerce and digital platforms. The pandemic also revealed the urgency to upgrade our digital infrastructure and capabilities. Last year, I brought in Chief Information and Enterprise Analytics Officer, Chau Banks, who has extensive experience in business driven digital transformation to conduct a fresh assessment of our own program that was already underway before the pandemic. With that assessment now complete, we are accelerating our transformation through planned investments of about $500 million over the next 5 years to enhance our digital capabilities and drive productivity improvements, including replacing our ERP. This will enhance our supply chain to better position, Clorox to meet customer needs, yield efficiencies, and support our digital commerce, innovation and brand building efforts. Prior to the pandemic, we were already adapting our business to differentiate Clorox from a digital perspective. We\u2019ll continue to invest in e-commerce and digital marketing across our portfolio, leveraging data driven insights to engage with consumers in more relevant ways. Moving to innovation, innovation continues to be a key focus area for me and our new Chief Growth Officer, Tony Matta, who joined last October. Tony has more than 20 years of brand building experience with leading consumer companies, ensuring we have stickier innovation delivering multi-year value. We\u2019re driving lasting new product platforms, such as Fresh Step Clean Paws and Scentiva, which continue to grow. In addition, we\u2019re extending innovation by leveraging external partners to create new revenue streams. We\u2019re continuing to support our brands, especially margin accretive innovation with disciplined, high ROI advertising and sales promotion investments to build and strengthen consumer loyalty. We also remain very focused on driving our growth runways to build Clorox into a global cleaning and disinfecting brand. We are still in the early stages of a multi-year journey, but continue to believe they can become a meaningful contributor to growth longer-term. And as we execute on all these initiatives, we will continue to drive the strategic link between our societal impact and long-term value creation, as we live our purpose and keep our ESG commitments front and center in our decision making every day. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Lisah to review our business unit performance.\nLisah Burhan: Thank you, Linda. Now turning to our segment results. In Health and Wellness, Q4 sales decreased 17% for the quarter, while full year sales were up 8% with growth across all businesses. On a two-year stack basis, Q4 sales grew 16% and full year sales grew 22%. In cleaning, sales were down by double-digits compared to double-digit growth in the year ago quarter, primarily due to the deceleration of demand across various cleaning and disinfecting products. On a full year basis, cleaning sales grew behind a strong front half performance. While demand fell faster than anticipated, it remains higher than it was pre-pandemic with strong repeat rates among new buyers. Importantly, our supply and product assortment are almost fully restored, which is reflected in our market share improvements, especially in wipes and sprays. As consumer demand migrated to more preferred forms and value packs. We also saw a negative impact to price mix, which we expect to continue over the next few quarters. Going forward, we\u2019ll be focused on strengthening our merchandising activities, especially for the back-to-school period. Sales in professional products were down by double-digits versus year ago period when we experienced double-digit growth. For the full year, professional product sales were up by double-digits, fueled by an exceptional front half performance. Demand started moderating in Q3, and continued into Q4 as customers work through high inventory levels, especially of Clorox T-360 electrostatic sprayers. In the short-term, we expect results will continue to be volatile as we lap periods with unprecedented demand. Longer-term, this business continues to be a strategic growth area for the company. As part of our initiative to expand into new channels, we continue to add to our roster of out-of-home partnerships, including Live Nation, the world\u2019s leading live events company. Lastly, within the Health and Wellness segment, our vitamins, minerals and supplements business increased by double-digits this quarter after lapping a double-digit decrease caused by a supply disruption related COVID-19. For the full year, sales were up as well. Sales growth for the quarter was driven by a strong performance in the food, drug and mass channel and e-commerce. Turning to the Household segment, Q4 sales were down 8%. Full year sales grew 10% with growth across all 3 businesses. On a two-year stack basis, Q4 sales grew 8% and full year sales grew 12%. Glad sales decreased by double-digits in Q4 lapping strong double-digit growth in the year-ago quarter, which was impacted by initial stockpiling. For the full year, sales were up. Our efforts going forward, our focus on managing the strong inflationary headwinds we\u2019re facing. And as Linda mentioned, we still have more work to do in this business to restore market share. Grilling sales decreased by double-digits in Q4 as demand started moderating after 4 consecutive quarters of strong double-digits growth. For the full year, sales grew by double-digits, fueled by very strong consumption overall. Our focus on expanding distribution of our latest innovation Kingsford pellets continued with a nationwide launch, building on the products initial success, while they\u2019re also introducing signature flavors made with 100% real spices that will be available in select retailers before Labor Day as we gear up for the 2022 grilling season. This innovation is intended to help our business continue building consumption among multicultural millennials, and other healthy growers. Cat Litter sales grew by double-digits in Q4, driven by continued strong consumption. For the full year, litter sales also grew. The results reflected strengthen e-commerce with Fresh Step becoming the number one brand online for the first time and positive overall category trends boosted by record pet adoptions during the pandemic. Going forward, we\u2019re excited about our latest innovation Fresh Step Outstretch litter, which lasts 50% longer than regular litter, thanks to patent pending technology. In our Lifestyle segment, sales were down 3% and full year sales grew 6%. On a two-year stack basis, Q4 sales grew 13% and full year sales grew 16%. Brita sales were down as demand continued to moderate from an extended period of elevated consumption. Full year sales grew on top of double-digit growth in the prior year. Despite the deceleration in Q4, business fundamentals are strong, especially now that our supply is mostly restored. We\u2019re excited about the strong merchandising program we put in place this year, including the largest back to college event ever for the brand. The food business was down primarily due to lower shipments of Hidden Valley Ranch bottle dressings, with consumption moderating as consumer mobility improved. Full year sales were up by double-digits, on top of double-digit growth in the prior year. The consumer fundamentals for this business are strong with the brand growing market share and household penetration. Burt\u2019s Bees sales increased by double-digit this quarter as overall category consumption began to recover. Full year sales were down as category consumption was negatively impacted by store closures, mask mandate and stay-at-home measures. We expect this business to continue to recover as people begin returning to their pre-pandemic shopping patterns and consumer mobility keeps improving. We\u2019ll build on that momentum with our new lips to love campaign supported by strong innovation pipeline. Lastly, turning to international, Q4 sales grew 5% reflecting the combined impact of the Saudi JV acquisition and benefit of price increases partially offset by lower shipments due to moderating demand after a period of elevated consumption. Extended lockdowns in Canada also contributed to the decrease in shipments. The results on top of 12% growth in the year-ago period, when we saw elevated consumption across our portfolio during the early stages of the pandemic, importantly, we continue to expand our global disinfecting wipes business building on the dedicated international supply chain that was developed in 5 months in our making progress launching our Clorox expert disinfecting wipes in existing countries as well as new markets. For the full year, sales increased 14% reflecting very strong growth for the majority of the year before moderating in Q4. On a two-year stack basis, Q4 sales grew 17% and full year sales grew 19%. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kevin, who will discuss Q4 and full year financial results for FY 2021 as well as our outlook for FY 2022.\nKevin Jacobsen: Thank you, Lisah, and thank you everyone for joining us today. As Linda mentioned, for fiscal year 2021, we delivered 9% sales growth on top of 8% sales growth in fiscal year 2020. Well, this is lower than we anticipated in our outlook. We feel good about delivering another strong sales year. Of course, we continue to manage to an extremely challenging cost environment, which impacted our fiscal year margins and earnings. Importantly, we delivered another year of strong cash flow, which came in at $1.3 billion, compared to a record $1.5 billion for fiscal year 2020. I\u2019m pleased our strong cash flow allowed us to return almost $1.5 billion to our shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase program, representing an increase of about 90% in cash return to shareholders versus fiscal year 2020. Before review our Q4 results, I wanted to highlight a $28 million non-cash charge we booked in Q4 related to a third-party supplier for our professional products business. As we have shared previously, during the height of the pandemic, we worked with a number of third-party suppliers to support us in addressing unprecedented demand in the consumer and professional spaces. We\u2019re reducing our reliance on one of these suppliers. And as a result, we took a charge in the fourth quarter. Important to note, this non-cash charge is included in our reported EPS and excluded from our Q4 adjusted EPS, as it represents a non-reoccurring item. Turning to our fourth quarter results, fourth quarter sales decreased 9% in comparison to a 22% increase in the year-ago quarter, delivering a two-year stack of 13% sales growth. Our sales results reflected 8% decline organic volume and two-points of unfavorable price mix primarily in our Health and Wellness segment, as supply improvements result in a broader product assortment, including the reintroduction of value packs. On an organic basis, fourth quarter sales declined 10%. Fourth quarter sales were lower than expected primarily in our Health and Wellness segment, as demand for cleaning and disinfecting products moderated more rapidly than we had previously anticipated. While the cleaning and disinfecting category continues to moderate, we\u2019re pleased to see improving share as we increased our ability to supply. Gross margin for the quarter decreased 970 basis points to 37.1% compared to 46.8% in the year ago quarter. Gross margin results were lower than anticipated, largely driven by higher input costs and lower sales. The year-over-year change in Q4 gross margin was primarily driven by lower sales, resulting in lower manufacturing fixed costs absorption as well as a significant cost headwinds driving about 290 basis points of higher commodity costs, 180 basis points of increased transportation costs as well as 130 basis points of unfavorable mix. Our fourth quarter gross margin also includes about 70 basis points of negative impact from the non-cash charges just mentioned. These margin headwinds were partially offset by about 90 basis points of cost savings, and 50 basis points of benefit from our pricing actions in our international division. Selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales came in at 14.4% compared to 14.1% in the year ago quarter. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels as a percentage of sales came in at about 12% with U.S. spending at about 14% of sales. Strong investments in Q4 supporting our back half innovation program and reflected our continued focus on building loyalty among new consumers. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate was 0%, primarily driven by a tax benefit from exiting of a small foreign subsidiary, which was mostly offset by the charge we took to pre-tax book income associated with this decision, as well as favorable return to provision adjustments. On a full year basis, our effective tax rate was 20%. Net of all these factors, adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter came in at $0.95 versus $2.41 in the year ago quarter, a decline of 61%. Before I review the details of our outlook, let me provide perspective on the strategic investment, Linda discussed. We\u2019re planning to invest about $500 million over the next 5 years to enhance our digital capabilities and drive productivity improvement, including the replacement of our ERP. In fiscal year 2022, we plan to invest about $90 million in operating and capital expenditures with about $55 million impacting our P&L, and the remainder reflected on our balance sheet. Beginning in Q1 and going forward, our adjusted EPS, will exclude the portion of the $500 million investment that flows through our P&L to provide better insights into our underlying operating performance of our business. Now, turning to our fiscal year 2022 outlook. We anticipate fiscal year sales to be down 2% to 6%, reflecting ongoing demand moderation, primarily in our cleaning and disinfecting products in the front half of the fiscal year. In addition to the unfavorable mix, and higher trade spending, as we move to a more normalized supply and promotional environment. We assume these factors will be partially offset by the pricing actions we\u2019re taking broadly across our portfolio. Organic sales are expected to be down 2% to 6% as well. We expect front-half sales to decline high-single to low-double-digits as we lapped 27% growth in the front-half of this year 2021 during the height of the pandemic. Additionally, we expect Q1 sales to decline low-double-digits. As we move to the back half of the year, we expect to return to the lower-end of our long-term sales growth targets. Of course, we continue to operate in a dynamic and uncertain environment, which could impact our outlook. We anticipate fiscal year gross margin to be down 300 to 400 basis points, due to our assumption for significant ongoing headwinds from elevated commodity and transportation costs, which represent nearly $300 million in year-over-year cost increases. We expect these headwinds to be more pronounced in the front-half of the year, particularly in Q1, as we expect key commodity cost increases to reduce gross margin by about 500 basis points, driving our assumption for Q1 gross margin to decline 1,100 to 1,300 basis points. For perspective, in Q1 we\u2019re lapping a modern gross margin record of 48%, reflecting over 400 basis points of favorable operating leverage on 27% sales growth in the year-ago quarter. As we mentioned in our press release, we expect sequential improvement for gross margin over the course of fiscal year 2022, with the assumption for gross margin expansion in Q4. This is based on our assumption that cost inflation will begin to moderate. And then, we\u2019ll see the benefits from mitigating actions flow more fully through our P&L. We expect fiscal year selling and administrative expenses to be about 15% of sales, which includes about 1 point of impact related to our investment to enhance our digital capabilities. Additionally, we anticipate fiscal year advertising spending to be about 10% of sales, reflecting our ongoing commitment to invest behind our brands and build market share. We expect our fiscal year tax rate to be about 22% to 23%. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects lapping several onetime benefits in the prior fiscal year. Net of these factors, we anticipate fiscal year adjusted EPS to be between $5.40 to $5.70. As we start fiscal year 2022, I\u2019d like to emphasize our priority to address elevated cost pressures, from both commodities and transportation throughout the fiscal year. We are focused on executing the pricing actions we discussed today. We\u2019ve implemented our announced price increase on our bags and wraps, and are taking pricing on our Food, Cleaning and International businesses. This represents about 50% of our portfolio. We\u2019re also pursuing pricing and additional parts of our portfolio, which we\u2019ll announce at a later date. While it\u2019s still early, we are confident in our ability to price, given the strength of our brand, and the constructive conversations we\u2019re having with retailers. Consistent with our IGNITE strategy, we\u2019re addressing short-term headwinds head on, with an eye on the long-term health of our business. We will continue to invest in our brands, including meaningful innovation to drive differentiation, which will help us continue to drive superior consumer value. We are leaning into our cost-savings program and productivity initiatives to help address ongoing cost pressures. And, we\u2019re accelerating investments in our digital transformation, to drive increased capabilities, lower costs across our supply chain, and improve innovation efforts and our brand engagement activities. And finally, as Linda mentioned, our business is significantly larger than before the pandemic and we\u2019re well positioned for the future. Our global portfolio of trusted brands is more relevant than ever. And we\u2019re positioning ourselves to make the most of the changing consumer trends we see. We have confidence in our strategic plans and our ability to execute, to enable us to continue to create long-term value for our shareholders. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Linda.\nLinda Rendle: Thank you, Kevin. Before we open the line for questions, I wanted to take a moment to reiterate our commitment to and confidence in Clorox\u2019 long-term growth and value-creation potential, which is fueled by our IGNITE strategy. We\u2019re focused on strong execution in the face of dynamic conditions, including addressing significant cost headwinds and improving market share. In addition, we have clarity on the strategic imperative and executional mandate to differentiate Clorox and build a stronger, more resilient, and more profitable company. And as we accelerate and execute our IGNITE strategy, we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll drive improved performance. Christy, you may now open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, Ms. Rendle. [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, guys. So 2 questions, just first on the $500 million investment program on digital and productivity, could you just give us a better sense for why the program is necessary now? We\u2019ve heard the IGNITE strategy has been working the last couple of years. We\u2019ve heard historically that you\u2019re ahead of the curve in competition on the e-commerce side from you guys, and happy with innovation progress. So sounds like there was a review when you took over Linda, and obviously, Chau Bank\u2019s appointment. But I\u2019m sure you were focused on these areas before also. So, was this a surprise? How did it develop, particularly given it\u2019s such a large amount? And then, as we think about the payback, is this what\u2019s necessary to get back to long-term goals that at some point, in theory, sometimes a big spending program can yield payback above and beyond prior goals? I\u2019m assuming at this point, it\u2019s more to help return to prior long-term goals. And then, I also have a second question on gross margins if I can come back. Thanks.\nLinda Rendle: Sure, Dara. Thank you. So why don\u2019t we start with your first question, why necessary now? And what\u2019s clear is the pandemic has absolutely accelerated consumer digital behaviors in a way that we never contemplated during our IGNITE strategy. And certainly, we saw that as a key consumer tailwind for us as we penned that strategy. But we\u2019ve seen such a rapid movement online by consumers, both in the e-commerce space, and then certainly in the marketing consumption space, that we really knew we need to take a step back and look at the program that we had in place, and ensure that it was sufficient for us to deliver as we move forward, and what we look towards across the entire operation. And I think the other thing that I would note is, our challenges in fiscal year 2021, managing the type of volatility that we haven\u2019t been exposed to in the past, underscored the urgency to upgrade that digital infrastructure and capabilities. And what I want to make clear is, this is really not about today, this is about maintaining momentum as we come out of our IGNITE strategy period. And you\u2019ll see the bulk of the value of this comes after our IGNITE strategy period, so 2025 and beyond. This will allow us to have really real-time access to data and information that will help our entire operation move more efficiently and better serve consumer and customer needs. So we\u2019ll make first investment in our ERP, which is the foundation and infrastructure of all of these changes. And that\u2019s needed and accelerated to build these digital capabilities. We\u2019ll have better supply chain visibility across all parts of the supply chain with real time data, which will improve things like procurement and supply planning. It will further enhance the work that you already referenced, that we\u2019ve done on digital and e-commerce and further enhance our ability to do personalization, and get more out of that goal, and will help us on innovation. So really, what this was about was the change in circumstances and the environment, a rapid change in consumer behavior that couldn\u2019t have been predicted before the pandemic, and we\u2019re leaning in. And this is really about building a stronger company with more momentum coming out of the strategy period.\nDara Mohsenian: Okay. And then, could you just talk a little bit about the yield from this, how we should think about that in terms of timing and magnitude over time? And then second, Kevin, on gross margins, when you include the guidance for fiscal 2022, you\u2019re obviously experiencing a lot of gross margin depression over a 2-year period, probably record amount of compression. So I\u2019m just trying to understand your focus on pricing. It seems like the magnitude and timing of the pricing is less than what we\u2019ve seen in the past versus these unprecedented cost pressure. So I just want to understand why we\u2019re not seeing a greater offset through pricing. Is pricing more difficult in this environment from a retailer or competitive perspective? Is it more \u2013 some of the pressure was unexpected? Are there other pressure points of gross margin? How do you sort of think about and help us understand why we\u2019re not seeing more of an offset to those outsized cost pressures like we\u2019re seeing with some of your peers?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah, Dara, thanks for the question. And let me share our perspective on gross margin. If I think about where we were before the pandemic, our gross margin was just below 44%, about 43.9%. As we moved through the pandemic over the last couple of years, we ended this year about 43.6%, so just a little below where we were before the pandemic began. As we go forward, as both Linda and I talked about in our prepared remarks, we are facing what we\u2019re describing as unprecedented cost environment in terms of inflation. Just, Dara, for perspective, as I mentioned before, we\u2019re going to experience, we think about $300 million of cost increases this year between both commodities and transportation. That\u2019s about a 400 basis point hit to gross margin this year. Now, from the pricing actions we\u2019re taking, we think we can offset about 2/3rds of those this year, with the pricing actions we\u2019ve announced plus the more we\u2019ll announce at a later date. And then, we expect to fully offset the cost increase going forward. But that\u2019ll extend beyond fiscal year 2022, just based on the phasing of these actions we\u2019re taking. And so, I feel confident we\u2019ll recover these. But they\u2019ll take a little longer beyond 2022. And then the other items, Dara, I\u2019d point out to be aware of, as you think about our margin in fiscal year 2022. There are 2 other items. We had a temporary benefit during the pandemic as it relates to mix, as well as trade spending. As I think you know, for many of our categories, there is very limited promotional activity, because of lack of supply. We expect that is temporary and expect that to reverse out as we get back to a more normalized promotional environment. So we think about fiscal year 2022, I expect about 50 bps of headwind from higher trade spending. And then, also on mix, when the pandemic hit and we rationalized our production, try to get as much product out as possible, we ran 35 count canisters, an example on why, because we could run most of those. As we introduced larger sizes, as we introduced multi-packs, which is very good for consumption and trial, that will come in as a lower margin as well. So you\u2019ll see that positive mix turn negative, as we get back into a more normal level of skew offerings. And so, that\u2019s about another 100 basis point hit, we\u2019re going to see in 2022. Now, both of those are temporary benefits as a result of the pandemic that we expect to unwind. And they will unwind this year and get back to more normalized level. And so, I think what\u2019s important as we go through the year, and you think about the phasing of our margins, the biggest challenge we\u2019re going to face is in the front half. When you think about the cost environment I highlighted, we expect to take about 75% of those cost increases in the front half of the year. And then, you\u2019ll see sequential improvements as we move through the year and turn back to margin expansion. I expect ours \u2013 we get to Q4 and we start recovering some of these costs that you should see our gross margins back in the low 40%s. And we\u2019re committed to rebuilding it back to where we were before the pandemic began. Let me stop there and happy to take any follow-ups.\nDara Mohsenian: Yeah, just on the timing of pricing, it does seem like it\u2019s taking longer than it has previously. Obviously, a lot of compression year-over-year in Q4, almost 1,000 basis points. And we\u2019re not expecting positive gross margins until you get to Q4 of next year. So I\u2019d be curious for your thoughts, specifically around the pricing offset. I understand there are issues like mix and some of the other issues you mentioned. But it does seem like it\u2019s taking a long period of time to get pricing in, relative to history. So just trying to understand that.\nLinda Rendle: Yeah, timing is related to the commitment that we made at the beginning of the pandemic. And we continue to hold fast to, which is our absolute number one priority was to supply as much of the demand as we possibly could. And that continue to be our priority as we headed through Q4. We made the immediate call to price on Glad, given what we were seeing in resin. And that will go in market shortly. And we were doing the work behind the scenes to ready pricing across the rest of the portfolio as needed. Clearly, we\u2019re going to need to pull that lever and we are with about 50% announced to date and plans to take additional pricing that will communicate more details around coming up in the future. But it really was about that continued priority of meeting as much demand as we possibly could.\nDara Mohsenian: Great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is from Peter Grom of UBS.\nPeter Grom: Hey, hey, good afternoon, everyone. So my question is just more on the conservatism and the guidance at this point. I know there are a lot of moving parts here. But I think a lot of investors are kind of asking, is the company being prudent, conservative, lowering the bar, whatever term you really want to use or you\u2019ve embedded in the flex that even if trends deteriorate from here, is this guidance range still achievable? I think I know the operating environment is very different. And I\u2019m not sure I would necessarily call this a rebase versus what we\u2019ve seen in the past. But it will be helpful to get your view on how much flex there is in this guidance, should inflation rise or consumer demand fall more from here? Thanks.\nKevin Jacobsen: Hey, Peter, this is Kevin. Thank you for the question. On our outlook, what I\u2019d say is I don\u2019t view this as conservative. I view this as balanced. I think you folks all know, we are operating in an environment of unprecedented volatility, as you think about the changing consumer demand, the macroeconomy as well as, how the virus is going to play out. And so we recognize, we\u2019ve been operating this environment for the better part of the last 18 months and we expect that to continue. I would say that\u2019s certainly true in the front half of 2022. And then, our hope is we\u2019ll start to see it level out a bit in the back half and get to more normalized environment. And so, you should expect ongoing volatility in the front half. The way, Peter, we try to account for that is, we provide a bit of a wider range in our outlook than what we would normally provide at this time of the year. And we just think that\u2019s prudent to recognize the level of variability we have. But I would describe this as a balanced forecast based on everything we\u2019re seeing today.\nPeter Grom: Okay, super helpful. And then, just quickly, just maybe a point of clarification on Dara\u2019s a question or your response to Dara\u2019s question. Returning to 40% in Q4, does that mean that you don\u2019t expect to be about 40% gross margins until Q4? I just want to make sure I\u2019m thinking about that in the model correctly?\nKevin Jacobsen: Sure. So, Peter, the way we\u2019re envisioning this playing out over the course of the years, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we expect Q1 to be down about 1,100 to 1,300 basis points, primarily driven by the cost environment. I\u2019ll talk more about that in a moment. And then, we expect sequential improvements as we move through the year. And by the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll turn to margin growth. And then, what we expect is, by the fourth quarter, we\u2019ve got margins back in the low 40%s. With our expectation going forward into 2023 and while I\u2019m not providing an outlook today, I would say on margin, we fully expect to continue expand margins as we move into fiscal year 2023.\nPeter Grom: Okay, great. Thank you. Super helpful. Best of luck.\nKevin Jacobsen: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is from Wendy Nicholson of Citi.\nWendy Nicholson: Hi, a couple of questions. First of all, with the amount of money you\u2019re spending on the new digital ERP investments, what\u2019s your expectation for kind of capital allocation, potentially, to step in and support the stock and buy back stock here, because I know your leverage is still really low compared to your peers? But then, Linda, kind of stepping back aside from near-term, the guidance for 2022 gross margin, I mean, I\u2019ve covered this stuff for 20 years and I have to go back literally 20 years to find a 40% gross margin for the company. And I totally get that we\u2019re in a weird period with COVID. And you made a commitment to not raise prices. And I think that\u2019s great. But I think it begs the question, is there something structural in the business, when you mentioned higher promotional spending. I mean, this does not seem like the time to be investing in promotional spending when you\u2019re also raising prices, and you\u2019ve got so much commodity inflation. So sort of a year into your job as the new CEO, do you think a mid-40%s gross margin is the right number and this really is a temporary blip? Or is this a sort of, \u201cHey, we may be over-earning on the gross margin line. And, low-40%s or even high-30%s is really where we\u2019re sort of more normally positioned?\u201d Sorry for the long question, but the guidance for 40% gross margin just seems crazy to me.\nLinda Rendle: Sure, Wendy. I\u2019ll start with the second part of the question, then I\u2019ll hand it over to Kevin to talk a bit more about capital allocation on your first question. So what we\u2019re seeing and you said it, it\u2019s absolutely an extraordinary environment. And if you look at all the factors combined, and what\u2019s contributing to our gross margin, I hate this term a little bit, but it\u2019s really the perfect storm, where we\u2019re lapping incredible sales growth, and things like operating leverage. We are lapping promotional levels being down. And I would argue promotional levels for us are our strategic. We\u2019ve always viewed that investment, just like we do our marketing dollars, it helps us build trial, it helps us expose consumers to things like innovation. And that\u2019s going to continue to be important in the future. And it\u2019s why we want to put that money back in the system to ensure as we have record-setting innovation coming into the marketplace, from a top-line perspective, that we\u2019re able to support it with those dollars. And then, of course, the cost environment at which, I think, we\u2019re seeing broadly and it\u2019s not just a Clorox issue, but certainly an industry problem. So all of that is happening at once. What that leads me to is, this is natural issue. This is a temporary issue, albeit an extraordinary one. And we\u2019re managing with discipline. And I think the good news for us is we\u2019ve managed albeit not this deep, but certainly environments that have happened like this over time. And what we do is go to work and execute, and we\u2019re going to do it just like that in the past. We\u2019re going to take pricing, and you\u2019re going to see much more pricing come from us now as it starts to pick up and we\u2019ve improved supply as we\u2019ve spoken about. We\u2019re going to put our cost savings machine to work with the mandate to our team to remove any costs that are possible in the system. And that\u2019s what they are focused on every single day right now. And we\u2019re going to take it one day at a time and execute it. But I feel confident in our ability to get back to what Kevin spoke about, and get back to those margins. It\u2019s just not going to happen this year. Again, we\u2019ll see improvement in Q4 and continued improvement as we move through fiscal 2023. But we do view this as a temporary issue.\nKevin Jacobsen: And, Wendy, on capital allocation, I\u2019d tell you, there is no change in our priorities in terms of how we\u2019re going to allocate our capital. And as you know, our first priority will continue to invest in our base business. And that includes our digital investments. Both Linda and I spoke about that today. And so, if you think about where we were last year, we ramped up investments in our base business, both investing in innovation, investing in brand building, as well as investing in increasing production capacity within our supply network, primarily focused on increasing our wipes capacity. And so, as we move into fiscal year 2022, as we\u2019ve gotten through some of those investments in our facilities, you should see our capital spending return down more in our normalized range of 3% to 4% of sales we typically operate, and you should expect that this year. And then we will deploy a certain amount of capital towards this technology investment. The way I see this $500 million playing out is about 60% of it will flow through our P&L, and about 40% of that will flow through our balance sheet. And if you think specifically about fiscal year 2022, we\u2019re going to invest about $90 million, with about $35 million flowing through our balance sheet, will deploy cash. And then, after we invest in the base business, we\u2019ll continue to look for ways to return excess cash to shareholders. Last year, we generated tremendous amount of cash through the pandemic, and we returned almost $1.5 billion. I suspect this year, because of the challenging cost environment, and the reduced profitability we\u2019ll return closer somewhere between $700 million and $900 million between our dividend and our share buyback program. But I\u2019d also highlight, if you look at our dividend program, with our recent increase we announced back in June, we now have an average annual increase of a little over 7% over the last 5 years. And that puts us in the top third of our peer group. So I think we have committed to continually returning excess cash to our shareholders. And we\u2019ve operated fairly high level than our peer set and you should expect us to do that going forward.\nWendy Nicholson: Okay, that\u2019s great. And just on the digital investment, what\u2019s the sort of payback timing for that? I mean, when should we start to see whether this investment was worth it, if you will, bottom line?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah, Wendy, thanks for that question. So this is really an investment in setting our future. You\u2019ll start to see some of that payback late in our IGNITE strategy towards the tail-end of it. But this is really about setting up the company to be prepared to succeed over the long term. And so we\u2019ll invest the $500 million over the next 5 years. You should see an investment starting or return starting late in our IGNITE period, late 2024, 2025. And then, really accelerating as we get beyond IGNITE. And then, Wendy, our commitment is we\u2019ll continue to update folks exactly on our progress and both our investments and the returns we\u2019re generating on that investment.\nWendy Nicholson: Great. Thank you so much for the color.\nKevin Jacobsen: Thank you, Wendy.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Chris Carey, of Wells Fargo Securities.\nChristopher Carey: Hi, everyone.\nKevin Jacobsen: Hi, Chris.\nChristopher Carey: I want to understand, you made some comments of your quarter about the Health and Wellness business normalizing to something like $700 million or below run-rate, which could have played out this quarter. But that business could grow from that over time. And I\u2019m curious, your thoughts on timeline of that trajectory from where we are today. What you think is going to be developing over that time period, whether that\u2019s professional, getting back in stock in some of your businesses, the promotional spending or the pricing? And, I guess, underlying that question as well, as I\u2019m conscious, of course, that the Health and Wellness business has really tough comps in the first half. But the Household business also has pretty difficult comps, and the Grilling business is normalizing. And, just trying to get a sense of, if this trajectory is playing out in Health and Wellness? What you kind of see in your Household business for the first half of the year? I guess, back of the envelope math would just suggest that you kind of need to see some improvement on a stack basis there. And whether I\u2019m thinking about that correctly? And then, I just have a quick follow-up.\nLinda Rendle: Sure, Chris, I\u2019ll start with Cleaning. I think this is absolutely a dynamic time for cleaning, given all of the volatility. But there were 2 things that we said at the beginning. We believe that this was a change in consumer behavior that would be long-term. And the evidence continues to support that that is absolutely the case. So if you just look at some of the consumption numbers, even though it did decelerate faster than we expected, as vaccination rates picked up, at least until we got to the point we are today, you still see a very strong 2-year stack of growth. So in Q4, that was over 20% for our cleaning business. But also, if you look at consumption, that\u2019s been up in the range from 25% to 30% versus pre-pandemic level. So we really are seeing that behavior be sticky with consumers. Of course, we\u2019re lapping incredible growth in those businesses, and frankly, demand that we couldn\u2019t supply early in the pandemic. So what you\u2019re seeing is a normalization, but as we said, a significantly higher run rate moving forward. And we expect that to continue, exactly, where that will net out is still unknown. And, I think, there\u2019s a lot of unknowns moving forward. Delta certainly is an unknown, cold and flu season, et cetera. But we have continued confidence that this will be a long-term trend that we can grow off and will provide us the opportunity to accelerate profitable growth. And as we talked about raising ourselves target to 3 to 5, this is a portion of that. So continue confidence there. Again, I would say, though, as we look to the first half, and as we lap 27% sales growth overall for the company, for cleaning and disinfecting, and for our household business. We won\u2019t expect to deliver accelerated results versus that period. But as we start to lap in the back half is when we get to the low end of our sales algorithm, and seeing both cleaning and disinfecting, and our household business contributing positively to that.\nChristopher Carey: Okay. Yeah, thank you for that. Kevin, did you have something \u2013 I just have a quick follow-up. Just on the Health and Wellness margin in the quarter, I appreciate, there was a mix dynamics and volume deleveraging, but obviously, it was quite low, well below our model. And any perspective on, can you expand just on what exactly is occurring in that business? And how we should be thinking about the margin trajectory, they\u2019re going into fiscal 2022 and, perhaps, why that\u2019s going to be improved? Thanks so much.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah, Chris, as it relates to margin on our Health and Wellness segment, I would highlight a few items. The one is, as I mentioned, we took a charge as it relates to a PPD supplier that impacted our Health and Wellness segment, and that was about 11 points in terms of margin. That was non-cash that won\u2019t continue going forward. And then also keep in mind, we are lapping 85% growth in the Q4 prior year, so we\u2019re lapping a big year-over-year number, as well as we\u2019re dealing with increased costs. So, I think, it goes back to what we\u2019re talking about. We\u2019re dealing with a very challenging cost environment in a very near-term, and that\u2019s going to pressure margins. But we do think this is short-term, we continue to have tremendous confidence that we\u2019re going to be able to expand margins as we get into the back half of fiscal year 2022, and then on into 2023. But we have to recognize it in the very near-term is going to challenge margins. You saw that in the fourth quarter, and you\u2019ll see that in the first half of fiscal year 2022.\nChristopher Carey: Okay. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Jason English of Goldman Sachs.\nJason English: Hey, good morning, folks, or good afternoon, I guess, depending where you are. A couple of quick questions. First, real quick on cash flow, have you given free cash flow guidance? If not, can you? And you\u2019ve got this target out there free cash flow conversion as a percentage of sales 11% to 13%. As you migrate away from gap and start excluding things, should we expect that that ratio to move lower or for you to lower end of that ratio?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah. Jason, on cash flow, as you rightfully said, our target is 11% to 13%. We\u2019ve done very well against that target. If you look at fiscal year 2020, the height of the pandemic, we\u2019ve delivered a little bit over 19% in terms of cash flow, as a percent of sales. We had a good strong year in fiscal year 2021, we ended up at 12.9%. I would say this year, given the challenges on the cost environment, I expect, we\u2019re going to be at the low end of that range. So I think closer to 11%, if not slightly below that. But that\u2019s really a reflection of the more challenging cost environment. Long-term, we have tremendous confidence that we continue to deliver that 11% to 13% going forward.\nJason English: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And, Linda, I know you\u2019re pleased with the market share progress, but if we look at it versus pre-COVID levels, particularly for your cleaning segment. You\u2019re still well below where you are pre-COVID, even here in July and, in fact, if I look at like multipurpose cleaning \u2013 multipurpose clean spray or cleaning wipes, it\u2019s only gotten worse versus 2019 for the last couple of months. Is this the reason that your progress on pricing is so slow? Is it to try to sort of reset some price gaps and become more competitive to current market share? Or is it in fact due to like the service levels you mentioned and really the need to restore them first before we were able to start to push through pricing with retailers?\nLinda Rendle: Thanks, Jason. I would say, I\u2019m very pleased with our share results, given the environment that we have. We\u2019re seeing significant increased competition and we had supply challenges given the unprecedented demand and we\u2019re making, in my view, great progress. So share up in 7 of 9 businesses. If you look at the latest 13 weeks, we widened our share gap in wipes back to double digits and growing, and that\u2019s with significantly new competitive entries in the category, we grew [bread at] [ph] 8 share points. And we have a very strong start to back to school, and that programs working well continued strong Kingsford share growth, after many quarters in a row of share growth in Kingsford. And you\u2019ve heard my commitment, and I continue to stand by it, we remain committed to growing share. And we\u2019re focused on that fiscal 2022, and headed in absolutely the right direction. And I\u2019ve also called up places where I\u2019m not as happy, I\u2019m still not happy on where we are in Glad, we have work to do there, we\u2019re focused on the fundamentals and executing. And this really is completely unrelated to pricing, Jason. Pricing really has to do from a timing perspective with ensuring that we had the supply and then going back and working with our retail partners to ensure that we could implement the new plans in place. That really is the only reason why we\u2019ve delayed that. We will, of course, do the very important work you call out on price gaps as we move forward and that will be important. But given the incredible cost environment we see across the industry, we would expect to see categories moves, and we\u2019ll move along with them. And then we\u2019ll do the work to go back and ensure that we\u2019re in those right gaps. And then the other piece I would add Jason is our brands have never been stronger. And that was our goal exiting fiscal year 2021 was to be in a stronger position to grow off of this new significantly higher base. If you look at our household penetration, repeat rates, our consumer value. And as you know, we measured the percentage of our portfolio that is deemed superior by consumers that set a record high at 70%. So we feel fully confident in our ability to take pricing with the consumer. And then, of course, it\u2019ll be met with great marketing spend and innovation to continue to support that demand.\nJason English: Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks, Jason.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Great, thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions on your outlook. So first, just from an organic sales perspective, you\u2019re expecting down 2% to 6%. My question is perhaps for Kevin, what is embedded in that for category growth building on some of the prior questions, you sound pleased for the most part with some of the market share improvement? So is that reflective, generally of what you expect for the categories that you participate in? I\u2019ll be it against some difficult year-over-year comps in the first half of the year. And then a little bit longer term, I don\u2019t want to belabor this, but maybe I\u2019ll just kind of play it back. And you tell me if I\u2019m hearing this sort of correctly, the longer-term margin restoration now for this company. Linda, I think to an earlier question, you said you don\u2019t see this as a structurally lower margin business. Kevin, I think, you kind of alluded to this is probably a multi-year journey, though, to get back. So down materially this year, some improvement in fiscal 2023, but probably not getting back to what would be quote unquote, normal sort of margins for this business until fiscal 2024, 2025, maybe you can just confirm that, and I have a quick follow-up on pricing? Thank you.\nKevin Jacobsen: Hey, Kevin, thanks for the question. So on the 2, on organic sales growth, our assumption in the minus 6 to minus 2, is it we\u2019ll see modest category decline, as we see demand moderate, and the other pandemic, and then that\u2019ll be partially offset by share growth broadly across our portfolio. And so that\u2019s embedded in our assumptions for organic sales growth. And then on margin restoration, what I\u2019ll tell you is we are committed to recovering the cost inflation we\u2019re experiencing this year. And as I said, between our cost savings program and the pricing actions we\u2019re taking and the phasing of those pricing actions, we think that\u2019ll extend beyond this fiscal year. And so I see this more as a short-term issue, but medium- to long-term, I have confidence in our ability to get back to that mid-gross margin number. I\u2019m going to resist providing a gross margin outlook for fiscal year 2023. It\u2019s just too early to do that and there\u2019s a lot of moving parts. But embed in our assumptions right now is, we\u2019ll see a moderation in the commodity environment as we get through the end of this calendar year. And if that commodity environment moderates as we anticipate plus the pricing actions we\u2019re taking, you\u2019ll see a start to rebuild margin, and then continue into fiscal year 2023. And, Kevin, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen this before. But if you go back and you look at some of our previous pricing actions over the last decade, we\u2019ve done this 3 other times. And in all cases, what you saw was a margin decline in the year when the commodity costs spike. And then we went on to rebuild margins in subsequent years. And most recently, in fiscal 2018, if you recall, we had 9 straight quarters of gross margin expansion following our pricing actions. And so my expectation is, you\u2019ll see something similar where we\u2019ll start Q4, and then I\u2019ll continue on into the fiscal year 2023.\nKevin Grundy: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then the quick follow-up is just, I think, the comment was you price on 50% of the portfolio. I suppose maybe some questions on why the delay in doing that. But setting that aside, I guess, understanding some of the past competitive dynamics, what\u2019s the probability of pricing on the remaining 50%? Understanding there has to be a cost justification, but difficult to envision many categories where there\u2019s not talk about the decision there? What\u2019s going on price gaps versus private label game theory versus the competition? Why not moving on the other 50%? Or maybe sort of some further color on expectations there? And then, I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you.\nLinda Rendle: Sure, yeah, on the 50%, as we said, I think in an earlier answer, and in our prepared remarks. It means, we\u2019ve announced pricing of about 50% to date, and we are planning additional pricing that will speak a little bit more once the details are in market. And really, there were considerations across how we would do that at what credit categories and what time, and we really took the category by category, it started with that first principle that I spoke about, which is we had to ensure we were in the right supply position as a starting place, before we did that. And as we\u2019ve brought supply back online, we\u2019ve opened more and more of our categories to looking at that. And then, of course, we\u2019re doing the really important work to look at each category, look at the dynamics, our position in that, what our innovation and marketing plans look like and balancing that across every one of the categories, because what we\u2019re really here to do is maximize the long-term on this. And what we want to ensure is that pricing as a part of that way that we restore margins, but also that we don\u2019t give up the opportunities we see in front of us to accelerate overall long-term profitable growth, and that\u2019s the balance we\u2019ve gone through on every category. But, I think, what you\u2019re going to see from us as this all nets out, is that we\u2019re taking a very prudent stance on pricing. It will be a meaningful contributor to gross margin expansion as we move through the year. And as Kevin said, we have all confidence that as we move beyond that, we\u2019ll be able to restore margins with pricing as an important part of that.\nKevin Grundy: Okay. Very good. Thank you both. Good luck.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks, Kevin.\nKevin Jacobsen: Thanks, Kevin.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thanks. Good morning. I was hoping if you could just give us a little bit of color do you have it on where you think retailer inventories currently stand and same for PPD and any research you\u2019ve done on consumer pantries that you\u2019ve built in the category correction in the first half. But I\u2019m just curious, where you stood on retail inventory levels in particular in PPD? Thanks.\nLinda Rendle: Sure, Lauren, broadly as we look across retail inventory is given the good supply progress that we made in Q4, we have largely restored inventories across the bulk of our portfolio. We do have some additional work to do on the broader assortment, a few packs and cleaning and disinfecting here and there, and still have some work to do on Kingsford and Food. But largely, I would say on the retail side inventories are restored, we\u2019ll see how that plays out, of course, as delta takes on et cetera, how those inventories continue to progress as we go through the first half of the year, but largely in a good spot now. In the professional business, it is different. So if you look at the front half of fiscal year 2021, we had a 70% increase in sales for our professional products business. And then we had a big drop off of that in our back half, as we\u2019ve talked about in both sets of results. And what we\u2019ve uncovered is there just looks like there\u2019s a lot of inventory in the professional channel. Given that, that front half that we experienced and it\u2019s not just our inventory, it\u2019s actually inventory across all manufacturers. And that network is primarily supplied by distributors. And so having visibility into each point of that supply, we do now when we realized there is more inventory there. So that means, as we left that 70% growth in the front half of fiscal 2022. And we start to read down that inventory, it is going to be bumpy in the short-term, continue to have strong confidence in our ability to grow PPD, you look at the two-year stack growth, its 35% sales growth. But I think it is going to be bumpy here as we left this front half, having the inventory on the system and then lapping an incredibly strong first half of last year.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay. Thanks. That\u2019s super helpful. And then, I have a question about variety, you\u2019ve talked about how obviously during the height of the pandemic to increase throughput SKU rationalization and the smaller packs in particular now bringing some of those value packs back in and then larger sizes. Did you consider using this as sort of an opportunity to intentionally kind of streamline mix? Is everyone in the industry of revenue growth management, right, but ways to actually improve the profitability of what you do choose to merchandise, because I would have thought that that could also give you a bit more flexibility and particularly as you\u2019re going through this cost environment?\nLinda Rendle: Yeah, absolutely. We\u2019ve spoken about adding net revenue management more aggressively to our toolbox to deal with margin moving forward and that is absolutely the plan. So 2 things. One, as we brought SKUs back into assortment we did just that, Lauren, we did not bring back the full assortment, we took the opportunity to simplify which helps us in many areas in the cost lines and P&L. But also from a retailer perspective, optimizing their mix and leveraging their store shelf space, as well as online mix in the right way. So you will see a smaller assortment, our goal is to ensure that we had share of assortment, right? But in full knowing that distribution points might come down, and we\u2019re certainly seeing that play out. But your point moving forward is exactly right. We intend to use more net revenue management tools, which would include things like assortments and getting the mix right to drive margin over time, and all of our business units are developing plans to use that as a bigger lever moving forward.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay. Great. And then, Kevin, if I just can sneak in one more, I did have a question for you on the charge this quarter related to the PPD supplier, either just be helpful to better understand what was underlined next, because if it was you discussed, paying up for supply, which obviously given the commitment that the company made to supply these critical products during a very tough time is important. But I\u2019m just not sure \u2013 I\u2019m curious if the charge piece of this like why that choice would effectively be excluded from results. And I know this is backward looking. But I think it\u2019s just helpful to get that perspective.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah. Sure, Lauren, happy to talk about the charge we took. So as we mentioned, we took a $28 million charge in the fourth quarter. And this was related to a PPD supplier. And what this related to it very early in the pandemic, when we saw the unprecedented increase in demand, we invested to help scale this supplier up to help increase their ability to supply products. And so what we\u2019ve done now is as they\u2019ve done that they\u2019ve had some challenges more recently, and we made a decision, we\u2019re going to move away from them. And so what we\u2019re doing here is we wrote off the investments we made in that supplier, which was really done to help scale them back when the pandemic first began. And at this point, we\u2019ve moved our business away to other suppliers. So we think, we\u2019re in good shape going forward from a production perspective. And then, we excluded this as a non-reoccurring non-cash item in terms of the charge we took in Q4.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay. Thanks so much.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah. Thanks, Lauren.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks Lauren.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Stephen Powers of Deutsche Bank.\nStephen Powers: Hey, thanks very much. Hey, Linda and maybe Kevin as well, I listened to the discussion on the strategic investments that we started with, and it makes good sense to me logically, I\u2019m not today in the \u2013 the business case at all. But, I guess, I\u2019m not clear on why we\u2019re adjusting out those investments from recurring EPS. And, I know, we talked about this move to adjust their earnings last quarter, and I get the rationale to provide investors clarity. But the other one time gain or a charge for impairment, I think, that\u2019s different than what I\u2019m hearing, which is backing out strategic investments for a pretty long time, 5 years after years of not doing so. So just why are these investments different from what I perceive you guys, who have been doing proactively for the last several \u2013 any number of years to get you in a position where you are now? It seems almost normal course in evergreen for Clorox. So, I guess, there\u2019s more clarity on why these particular investments are unique and different enough for you to consider them non-recurring worthy of adjustment that would just help philosophically on this idea of adjusted earnings.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah, Steve, this is Kevin. Thanks for the question. I say about these investments, a couple of thoughts. The one is just in terms of the size and investment. So as we mentioned, $500 million over 5 years is a big investment for us. The vast majority of that investment will go towards are replacing our ERP system. So I think this is pretty typical for large ERP investments that you typically do only once every 20 years or so to isolate that. So people can understand the investments we\u2019re making there, versus underlying performance of the business. And then the other aspect on this investment, and Linda mentioned it, this investment really is about the future of the company, much more sales and what\u2019s going to do to benefit our IGNITE strategy through 2025. And so we\u2019re making some pretty significant investments here, both in replacing our ERP as well as up-scaling our digital capabilities that really will start to benefit us as we move beyond 2025 our IGNITE strategy. So we thought it\u2019s appropriate to be able to isolate these and help folks understand your underlying operating performance, which has been pretty volatile as well as the investments we\u2019re making really set the company up for the long-term.\nStephen Powers: Okay. Okay, fair enough. You talked a little bit about this already, but the building blocks, Kevin from the double-digit declines in the first quarter to achieving the low-end of the long-term algorithm in the back half. Can you just talk a little bit more about just, for my own benefit, that the bridge from 1Q the back half and really, where your confidence comes from that 3% plus will be kind of achievable in the back half and extrapolating forward?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah, thanks, Steve. So if you think about the top-line, the front half of the year, we said it\u2019s going to be much more challenged a big portion that is we\u2019re lapping 27% growth. So we had record growth in the back half \u2013 or, excuse me, the front half of fiscal 2021, we\u2019ve got a lap. As a result of that, we expect our business to be down high-single, low-double digits. I think, we\u2019re getting to the back half the year. And we get back to more normalized comps. And we think we\u2019ve gotten through the bulk of the demand moderation that we expect in the front half of the year that gives us more confidence that we\u2019re going to be in a more normalized operating environment with more normalized comparison periods, that we should be back in that 3% range or so. Linda and I continue to have tremendous confidence in the opportunity for the extra point of growth, I think a little bit out of getting hidden by the comps we\u2019re going through in the normalization. And so that\u2019s really a short-term issue for us that we think plays out over the next 6 months. But as we look to the back half of the year, and we think we get to a more normalized environment, then I think you\u2019ll start to see the benefits we\u2019ve been talking about that we can to see going forward, that we think is really a medium- to long-term opportunity.\nStephen Powers: Okay, great. And if I could squeeze one more clarifying in your release, Kevin, there was a line about unfavorable price mix driven by supply improvements that led to the reintroduction of value packs. I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s all mix. But it does a price mix, if there was a price component to that, could you just talk about that? Or is it \u2013 am I right that it was essentially mix?\nKevin Jacobsen: It was essentially mixed in terms of the headwind, the less favorable pricing, because we continue to price in international. So we had about a point benefit in price within that price mix, as it relate to the international pricing that we\u2019re doing, the rest of those about 3 points of negative mix. And that mix was, I\u2019d say two-fold, certainly as we talked about reintroducing additional SKUs. But the other item that we\u2019re seeing is, as we now have wipes\u2019 back end supply, consumers are changing to more convenient forms. So during the height of the pandemic, when we couldn\u2019t supply wipes, it increased our bleach sales in less convenient form. And now that we can produce wipes, consumers are moving back into more convenient form of wipes versus using bleach. Ultimately, that\u2019s good for consumers. It gives them a more preferred solution. But that comes at a slightly lower mix for us. So a combination of the conversion within the product families, as well as introducing additional SKUs, we get to more normalized environment.\nStephen Powers: Okay, understood. Thank you very much.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. So, Linda, I wanted to follow-up on your comments on Glad bag. I was hoping, if you can comment on why it\u2019s taking so long to recover even after your main competitor has been narrowing these price gaps and leading in prices increasing, I believe, twice already. Is that because you always laid on innovation and competitors and private-label caught up to it, especially during COVID? And following up on an earlier question, you had committed to keep prices intact during the pandemic, but what do you need to see now that your capacity is back on track and vaccinations are up? Are you still thinking you need to narrow those price gaps in particular for the value proposition in that category, and in particular, in large count bags for Glad trash? And then I have a follow-up question on commodities for Kevin, please.\nLinda Rendle: Sure. So on Glad, if you look at Q4, just to set the backdrop, sales were down double-digits, but we lapped very strong double-digit growth in Q4 of last year. And we had a 2-year stack of Glad on 9% sales growth, in the fiscal year results, low-single-digits. So overall from a sales perspective, we were happy with where we landed. Really, it\u2019s a sheer disappointment that I continue to have. We want to grow market share and particularly in a category like trash. We are seeing the share trends improving. So we were down about 0.9 points in the latest 52 weeks, down 0.5 points in the latest 13, and down 0.4 in the latest 4 or 5. So definitely trending in the right direction behind improving distribution, getting the fundamentals right, et cetera. When it came to pricing, again, we announced pricing back in the fourth quarter, it\u2019s being implemented now. So \u2013 and we took a larger first round than what we saw in the marketplace to take into account what we saw from the category. And we\u2019re evaluating that again if an additional price increase is warranted. But we feel like we\u2019ve made the right move on Glad. And again, we\u2019ll continue to watch that. Innovation continues to work incredibly well in Glad. And we\u2019re committed to that program moving forward to differentiate our bags. But what we\u2019re really focused on right now is in-market execution, ensuring we have the right distribution at every retailer, implementing pricing flawlessly, and then, getting back to merchandising, which will be important in this category. So, again, this is less of a comment overall in terms of sales, but more around winning in the market, ensuring that we have plans that grow share in the future.\nAndrea Teixeira: That\u2019s fair, thank you. And the question for Kevin is really like what are your guidance in bags for gross margin? In terms of \u2013 is that fair to say that guidance in bags, while you\u2019re announcing pricing, which is the 50% of the portfolio? And then, in terms of pricing, are you baking in resin to stay as spot or you\u2019re actually using forward curves to basically swap and adapt? Or in other words, if it gets better from here and you take more pricing, there is upside to your guidance.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah, thanks, Andrea, for the question as it relates to how we thought about commodity forecasts. We have projected out what we believe is a commodity environment over the course of the year. So we\u2019re not using a spot rate. And our fundamental assumption is we will see commodity costs continue to increase. In fact, we think this quarter, we\u2019ll see them peak and then begin to moderate in the fall, late calendar year, commodity costs will start to moderate and continue in the back half of the year. And so, this is I think I mentioned on one of the earlier questions, we anticipate about 75% of the commodity cost increases, we\u2019re projecting for the year, we\u2019re going to see in the front half of the year. This is going to be the most extreme comparison period. And just to give you maybe a little bit of additional information to help dimensionalize it, when you think about resin, we\u2019re projecting over 100% increase in the cost of resin in the front half of the year. So that\u2019s the type of environment we\u2019re dealing with. And so that\u2019s a difficult environment to recover that type of margin compression in the time that it\u2019s rising. But we do think we\u2019re positioned well to recover that over time. But right now, we\u2019re projecting for the full year what we think where commodities will land. So any change in that we\u2019ll certainly update you as we learn more.\nAndrea Teixeira: And if I can squeeze just one question on inventory, the pantry, is there any anecdotal evidence that you\u2019ve heard from your \u2013 basically, your customers saying that \u2013 consumers or even your market studies that consumers have built a lot of inventory on bleach, in particular. To your point already that they\u2019re using bleach to disinfect. And that is super dynamic, or just consumption still remains elevated from your commentary before. It\u2019s just a question of having them switch back to branded as you supply more.\nLinda Rendle: Yeah, we don\u2019t have any evidence from consumer studies or from retailers that there is excess pantry inventory across any of our categories, where there was pantry loading that happened early in the pandemic, for example, on Glad, those things have already reversed themselves out. And what we\u2019re just seeing is continued elevation of consumption in the cleaning categories as you articulate, but lower than levels at height of the pandemic. But really, we don\u2019t see this as a pantry-loading issue.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you so much, Linda. It\u2019s excellent.\nLinda Rendle: Great. Thank you. I believe that\u2019s the end of Q&A. Thanks again, everyone, for joining us. We look forward to speaking with you again on our next call in November. And until then, please take good care.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kevin Jacobsen",
            "content": "Thank you, Lisah, and thank you everyone for joining us today. As Linda mentioned, for fiscal year 2021, we delivered 9% sales growth on top of 8% sales growth in fiscal year 2020. Well, this is lower than we anticipated in our outlook. We feel good about delivering another strong sales year. Of course, we continue to manage to an extremely challenging cost environment, which impacted our fiscal year margins and earnings. Importantly, we delivered another year of strong cash flow, which came in at $1.3 billion, compared to a record $1.5 billion for fiscal year 2020. I'm pleased our strong cash flow allowed us to return almost $1.5 billion to our shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase program, representing an increase of about 90% in cash return to shareholders versus fiscal year 2020. Before review our Q4 results, I wanted to highlight a $28 million non-cash charge we booked in Q4 related to a third-party supplier for our professional products business. As we have shared previously, during the height of the pandemic, we worked with a number of third-party suppliers to support us in addressing unprecedented demand in the consumer and professional spaces. We're reducing our reliance on one of these suppliers. And as a result, we took a charge in the fourth quarter. Important to note, this non-cash charge is included in our reported EPS and excluded from our Q4 adjusted EPS, as it represents a non-reoccurring item. Turning to our fourth quarter results, fourth quarter sales decreased 9% in comparison to a 22% increase in the year-ago quarter, delivering a two-year stack of 13% sales growth. Our sales results reflected 8% decline organic volume and two-points of unfavorable price mix primarily in our Health and Wellness segment, as supply improvements result in a broader product assortment, including the reintroduction of value packs. On an organic basis, fourth quarter sales declined 10%. Fourth quarter sales were lower than expected primarily in our Health and Wellness segment, as demand for cleaning and disinfecting products moderated more rapidly than we had previously anticipated. While the cleaning and disinfecting category continues to moderate, we're pleased to see improving share as we increased our ability to supply. Gross margin for the quarter decreased 970 basis points to 37.1% compared to 46.8% in the year ago quarter. Gross margin results were lower than anticipated, largely driven by higher input costs and lower sales. The year-over-year change in Q4 gross margin was primarily driven by lower sales, resulting in lower manufacturing fixed costs absorption as well as a significant cost headwinds driving about 290 basis points of higher commodity costs, 180 basis points of increased transportation costs as well as 130 basis points of unfavorable mix. Our fourth quarter gross margin also includes about 70 basis points of negative impact from the non-cash charges just mentioned. These margin headwinds were partially offset by about 90 basis points of cost savings, and 50 basis points of benefit from our pricing actions in our international division. Selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales came in at 14.4% compared to 14.1% in the year ago quarter. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels as a percentage of sales came in at about 12% with U.S. spending at about 14% of sales. Strong investments in Q4 supporting our back half innovation program and reflected our continued focus on building loyalty among new consumers. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate was 0%, primarily driven by a tax benefit from exiting of a small foreign subsidiary, which was mostly offset by the charge we took to pre-tax book income associated with this decision, as well as favorable return to provision adjustments. On a full year basis, our effective tax rate was 20%. Net of all these factors, adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter came in at $0.95 versus $2.41 in the year ago quarter, a decline of 61%. Before I review the details of our outlook, let me provide perspective on the strategic investment, Linda discussed. We're planning to invest about $500 million over the next 5 years to enhance our digital capabilities and drive productivity improvement, including the replacement of our ERP. In fiscal year 2022, we plan to invest about $90 million in operating and capital expenditures with about $55 million impacting our P&L, and the remainder reflected on our balance sheet. Beginning in Q1 and going forward, our adjusted EPS, will exclude the portion of the $500 million investment that flows through our P&L to provide better insights into our underlying operating performance of our business. Now, turning to our fiscal year 2022 outlook. We anticipate fiscal year sales to be down 2% to 6%, reflecting ongoing demand moderation, primarily in our cleaning and disinfecting products in the front half of the fiscal year. In addition to the unfavorable mix, and higher trade spending, as we move to a more normalized supply and promotional environment. We assume these factors will be partially offset by the pricing actions we're taking broadly across our portfolio. Organic sales are expected to be down 2% to 6% as well. We expect front-half sales to decline high-single to low-double-digits as we lapped 27% growth in the front-half of this year 2021 during the height of the pandemic. Additionally, we expect Q1 sales to decline low-double-digits. As we move to the back half of the year, we expect to return to the lower-end of our long-term sales growth targets. Of course, we continue to operate in a dynamic and uncertain environment, which could impact our outlook. We anticipate fiscal year gross margin to be down 300 to 400 basis points, due to our assumption for significant ongoing headwinds from elevated commodity and transportation costs, which represent nearly $300 million in year-over-year cost increases. We expect these headwinds to be more pronounced in the front-half of the year, particularly in Q1, as we expect key commodity cost increases to reduce gross margin by about 500 basis points, driving our assumption for Q1 gross margin to decline 1,100 to 1,300 basis points. For perspective, in Q1 we're lapping a modern gross margin record of 48%, reflecting over 400 basis points of favorable operating leverage on 27% sales growth in the year-ago quarter. As we mentioned in our press release, we expect sequential improvement for gross margin over the course of fiscal year 2022, with the assumption for gross margin expansion in Q4. This is based on our assumption that cost inflation will begin to moderate. And then, we'll see the benefits from mitigating actions flow more fully through our P&L. We expect fiscal year selling and administrative expenses to be about 15% of sales, which includes about 1 point of impact related to our investment to enhance our digital capabilities. Additionally, we anticipate fiscal year advertising spending to be about 10% of sales, reflecting our ongoing commitment to invest behind our brands and build market share. We expect our fiscal year tax rate to be about 22% to 23%. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects lapping several onetime benefits in the prior fiscal year. Net of these factors, we anticipate fiscal year adjusted EPS to be between $5.40 to $5.70. As we start fiscal year 2022, I'd like to emphasize our priority to address elevated cost pressures, from both commodities and transportation throughout the fiscal year. We are focused on executing the pricing actions we discussed today. We've implemented our announced price increase on our bags and wraps, and are taking pricing on our Food, Cleaning and International businesses. This represents about 50% of our portfolio. We're also pursuing pricing and additional parts of our portfolio, which we'll announce at a later date. While it's still early, we are confident in our ability to price, given the strength of our brand, and the constructive conversations we're having with retailers. Consistent with our IGNITE strategy, we're addressing short-term headwinds head on, with an eye on the long-term health of our business. We will continue to invest in our brands, including meaningful innovation to drive differentiation, which will help us continue to drive superior consumer value. We are leaning into our cost-savings program and productivity initiatives to help address ongoing cost pressures. And, we're accelerating investments in our digital transformation, to drive increased capabilities, lower costs across our supply chain, and improve innovation efforts and our brand engagement activities. And finally, as Linda mentioned, our business is significantly larger than before the pandemic and we're well positioned for the future. Our global portfolio of trusted brands is more relevant than ever. And we're positioning ourselves to make the most of the changing consumer trends we see. We have confidence in our strategic plans and our ability to execute, to enable us to continue to create long-term value for our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Linda. Yeah, Dara, thanks for the question. And let me share our perspective on gross margin. If I think about where we were before the pandemic, our gross margin was just below 44%, about 43.9%. As we moved through the pandemic over the last couple of years, we ended this year about 43.6%, so just a little below where we were before the pandemic began. As we go forward, as both Linda and I talked about in our prepared remarks, we are facing what we're describing as unprecedented cost environment in terms of inflation. Just, Dara, for perspective, as I mentioned before, we're going to experience, we think about $300 million of cost increases this year between both commodities and transportation. That's about a 400 basis point hit to gross margin this year. Now, from the pricing actions we're taking, we think we can offset about 2/3rds of those this year, with the pricing actions we've announced plus the more we'll announce at a later date. And then, we expect to fully offset the cost increase going forward. But that'll extend beyond fiscal year 2022, just based on the phasing of these actions we're taking. And so, I feel confident we'll recover these. But they'll take a little longer beyond 2022. And then the other items, Dara, I'd point out to be aware of, as you think about our margin in fiscal year 2022. There are 2 other items. We had a temporary benefit during the pandemic as it relates to mix, as well as trade spending. As I think you know, for many of our categories, there is very limited promotional activity, because of lack of supply. We expect that is temporary and expect that to reverse out as we get back to a more normalized promotional environment. So we think about fiscal year 2022, I expect about 50 bps of headwind from higher trade spending. And then, also on mix, when the pandemic hit and we rationalized our production, try to get as much product out as possible, we ran 35 count canisters, an example on why, because we could run most of those. As we introduced larger sizes, as we introduced multi-packs, which is very good for consumption and trial, that will come in as a lower margin as well. So you'll see that positive mix turn negative, as we get back into a more normal level of skew offerings. And so, that's about another 100 basis point hit, we're going to see in 2022. Now, both of those are temporary benefits as a result of the pandemic that we expect to unwind. And they will unwind this year and get back to more normalized level. And so, I think what's important as we go through the year, and you think about the phasing of our margins, the biggest challenge we're going to face is in the front half. When you think about the cost environment I highlighted, we expect to take about 75% of those cost increases in the front half of the year. And then, you'll see sequential improvements as we move through the year and turn back to margin expansion. I expect ours \u2013 we get to Q4 and we start recovering some of these costs that you should see our gross margins back in the low 40%s. And we're committed to rebuilding it back to where we were before the pandemic began. Let me stop there and happy to take any follow-ups. Hey, Peter, this is Kevin. Thank you for the question. On our outlook, what I'd say is I don't view this as conservative. I view this as balanced. I think you folks all know, we are operating in an environment of unprecedented volatility, as you think about the changing consumer demand, the macroeconomy as well as, how the virus is going to play out. And so we recognize, we've been operating this environment for the better part of the last 18 months and we expect that to continue. I would say that's certainly true in the front half of 2022. And then, our hope is we'll start to see it level out a bit in the back half and get to more normalized environment. And so, you should expect ongoing volatility in the front half. The way, Peter, we try to account for that is, we provide a bit of a wider range in our outlook than what we would normally provide at this time of the year. And we just think that's prudent to recognize the level of variability we have. But I would describe this as a balanced forecast based on everything we're seeing today. Sure. So, Peter, the way we're envisioning this playing out over the course of the years, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we expect Q1 to be down about 1,100 to 1,300 basis points, primarily driven by the cost environment. I'll talk more about that in a moment. And then, we expect sequential improvements as we move through the year. And by the fourth quarter, we'll turn to margin growth. And then, what we expect is, by the fourth quarter, we've got margins back in the low 40%s. With our expectation going forward into 2023 and while I'm not providing an outlook today, I would say on margin, we fully expect to continue expand margins as we move into fiscal year 2023. Thank you. And, Wendy, on capital allocation, I'd tell you, there is no change in our priorities in terms of how we're going to allocate our capital. And as you know, our first priority will continue to invest in our base business. And that includes our digital investments. Both Linda and I spoke about that today. And so, if you think about where we were last year, we ramped up investments in our base business, both investing in innovation, investing in brand building, as well as investing in increasing production capacity within our supply network, primarily focused on increasing our wipes capacity. And so, as we move into fiscal year 2022, as we've gotten through some of those investments in our facilities, you should see our capital spending return down more in our normalized range of 3% to 4% of sales we typically operate, and you should expect that this year. And then we will deploy a certain amount of capital towards this technology investment. The way I see this $500 million playing out is about 60% of it will flow through our P&L, and about 40% of that will flow through our balance sheet. And if you think specifically about fiscal year 2022, we're going to invest about $90 million, with about $35 million flowing through our balance sheet, will deploy cash. And then, after we invest in the base business, we'll continue to look for ways to return excess cash to shareholders. Last year, we generated tremendous amount of cash through the pandemic, and we returned almost $1.5 billion. I suspect this year, because of the challenging cost environment, and the reduced profitability we'll return closer somewhere between $700 million and $900 million between our dividend and our share buyback program. But I'd also highlight, if you look at our dividend program, with our recent increase we announced back in June, we now have an average annual increase of a little over 7% over the last 5 years. And that puts us in the top third of our peer group. So I think we have committed to continually returning excess cash to our shareholders. And we've operated fairly high level than our peer set and you should expect us to do that going forward. Yeah, Wendy, thanks for that question. So this is really an investment in setting our future. You'll start to see some of that payback late in our IGNITE strategy towards the tail-end of it. But this is really about setting up the company to be prepared to succeed over the long term. And so we'll invest the $500 million over the next 5 years. You should see an investment starting or return starting late in our IGNITE period, late 2024, 2025. And then, really accelerating as we get beyond IGNITE. And then, Wendy, our commitment is we'll continue to update folks exactly on our progress and both our investments and the returns we're generating on that investment. Thank you, Wendy. Hi, Chris. Yeah, Chris, as it relates to margin on our Health and Wellness segment, I would highlight a few items. The one is, as I mentioned, we took a charge as it relates to a PPD supplier that impacted our Health and Wellness segment, and that was about 11 points in terms of margin. That was non-cash that won't continue going forward. And then also keep in mind, we are lapping 85% growth in the Q4 prior year, so we're lapping a big year-over-year number, as well as we're dealing with increased costs. So, I think, it goes back to what we're talking about. We're dealing with a very challenging cost environment in a very near-term, and that's going to pressure margins. But we do think this is short-term, we continue to have tremendous confidence that we're going to be able to expand margins as we get into the back half of fiscal year 2022, and then on into 2023. But we have to recognize it in the very near-term is going to challenge margins. You saw that in the fourth quarter, and you'll see that in the first half of fiscal year 2022. Yeah. Jason, on cash flow, as you rightfully said, our target is 11% to 13%. We've done very well against that target. If you look at fiscal year 2020, the height of the pandemic, we've delivered a little bit over 19% in terms of cash flow, as a percent of sales. We had a good strong year in fiscal year 2021, we ended up at 12.9%. I would say this year, given the challenges on the cost environment, I expect, we're going to be at the low end of that range. So I think closer to 11%, if not slightly below that. But that's really a reflection of the more challenging cost environment. Long-term, we have tremendous confidence that we continue to deliver that 11% to 13% going forward. Hey, Kevin, thanks for the question. So on the 2, on organic sales growth, our assumption in the minus 6 to minus 2, is it we'll see modest category decline, as we see demand moderate, and the other pandemic, and then that'll be partially offset by share growth broadly across our portfolio. And so that's embedded in our assumptions for organic sales growth. And then on margin restoration, what I'll tell you is we are committed to recovering the cost inflation we're experiencing this year. And as I said, between our cost savings program and the pricing actions we're taking and the phasing of those pricing actions, we think that'll extend beyond this fiscal year. And so I see this more as a short-term issue, but medium- to long-term, I have confidence in our ability to get back to that mid-gross margin number. I'm going to resist providing a gross margin outlook for fiscal year 2023. It's just too early to do that and there's a lot of moving parts. But embed in our assumptions right now is, we'll see a moderation in the commodity environment as we get through the end of this calendar year. And if that commodity environment moderates as we anticipate plus the pricing actions we're taking, you'll see a start to rebuild margin, and then continue into fiscal year 2023. And, Kevin, I'm sure you've seen this before. But if you go back and you look at some of our previous pricing actions over the last decade, we've done this 3 other times. And in all cases, what you saw was a margin decline in the year when the commodity costs spike. And then we went on to rebuild margins in subsequent years. And most recently, in fiscal 2018, if you recall, we had 9 straight quarters of gross margin expansion following our pricing actions. And so my expectation is, you'll see something similar where we'll start Q4, and then I'll continue on into the fiscal year 2023. Thanks, Kevin. Yeah. Sure, Lauren, happy to talk about the charge we took. So as we mentioned, we took a $28 million charge in the fourth quarter. And this was related to a PPD supplier. And what this related to it very early in the pandemic, when we saw the unprecedented increase in demand, we invested to help scale this supplier up to help increase their ability to supply products. And so what we've done now is as they've done that they've had some challenges more recently, and we made a decision, we're going to move away from them. And so what we're doing here is we wrote off the investments we made in that supplier, which was really done to help scale them back when the pandemic first began. And at this point, we've moved our business away to other suppliers. So we think, we're in good shape going forward from a production perspective. And then, we excluded this as a non-reoccurring non-cash item in terms of the charge we took in Q4. Yeah. Thanks, Lauren. Yeah, Steve, this is Kevin. Thanks for the question. I say about these investments, a couple of thoughts. The one is just in terms of the size and investment. So as we mentioned, $500 million over 5 years is a big investment for us. The vast majority of that investment will go towards are replacing our ERP system. So I think this is pretty typical for large ERP investments that you typically do only once every 20 years or so to isolate that. So people can understand the investments we're making there, versus underlying performance of the business. And then the other aspect on this investment, and Linda mentioned it, this investment really is about the future of the company, much more sales and what's going to do to benefit our IGNITE strategy through 2025. And so we're making some pretty significant investments here, both in replacing our ERP as well as up-scaling our digital capabilities that really will start to benefit us as we move beyond 2025 our IGNITE strategy. So we thought it's appropriate to be able to isolate these and help folks understand your underlying operating performance, which has been pretty volatile as well as the investments we're making really set the company up for the long-term. Yeah, thanks, Steve. So if you think about the top-line, the front half of the year, we said it's going to be much more challenged a big portion that is we're lapping 27% growth. So we had record growth in the back half \u2013 or, excuse me, the front half of fiscal 2021, we've got a lap. As a result of that, we expect our business to be down high-single, low-double digits. I think, we're getting to the back half the year. And we get back to more normalized comps. And we think we've gotten through the bulk of the demand moderation that we expect in the front half of the year that gives us more confidence that we're going to be in a more normalized operating environment with more normalized comparison periods, that we should be back in that 3% range or so. Linda and I continue to have tremendous confidence in the opportunity for the extra point of growth, I think a little bit out of getting hidden by the comps we're going through in the normalization. And so that's really a short-term issue for us that we think plays out over the next 6 months. But as we look to the back half of the year, and we think we get to a more normalized environment, then I think you'll start to see the benefits we've been talking about that we can to see going forward, that we think is really a medium- to long-term opportunity. It was essentially mixed in terms of the headwind, the less favorable pricing, because we continue to price in international. So we had about a point benefit in price within that price mix, as it relate to the international pricing that we're doing, the rest of those about 3 points of negative mix. And that mix was, I'd say two-fold, certainly as we talked about reintroducing additional SKUs. But the other item that we're seeing is, as we now have wipes' back end supply, consumers are changing to more convenient forms. So during the height of the pandemic, when we couldn't supply wipes, it increased our bleach sales in less convenient form. And now that we can produce wipes, consumers are moving back into more convenient form of wipes versus using bleach. Ultimately, that's good for consumers. It gives them a more preferred solution. But that comes at a slightly lower mix for us. So a combination of the conversion within the product families, as well as introducing additional SKUs, we get to more normalized environment. Yeah. Yeah, thanks, Andrea, for the question as it relates to how we thought about commodity forecasts. We have projected out what we believe is a commodity environment over the course of the year. So we're not using a spot rate. And our fundamental assumption is we will see commodity costs continue to increase. In fact, we think this quarter, we'll see them peak and then begin to moderate in the fall, late calendar year, commodity costs will start to moderate and continue in the back half of the year. And so, this is I think I mentioned on one of the earlier questions, we anticipate about 75% of the commodity cost increases, we're projecting for the year, we're going to see in the front half of the year. This is going to be the most extreme comparison period. And just to give you maybe a little bit of additional information to help dimensionalize it, when you think about resin, we're projecting over 100% increase in the cost of resin in the front half of the year. So that's the type of environment we're dealing with. And so that's a difficult environment to recover that type of margin compression in the time that it's rising. But we do think we're positioned well to recover that over time. But right now, we're projecting for the full year what we think where commodities will land. So any change in that we'll certainly update you as we learn more."

            "content": "Thank you, Lisa. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Fiscal 2021 was an extraordinary year for Clorox, with the pandemic putting us through the ultimate test of volatility, including rapid changes in consumer demand and significant cost inflation, which was reflected in our Q4 results. Despite the complexities we faced, we delivered 9% sales growth for the fiscal year on a reported and organic basis, reflecting growth in all 4 reportable segments. This was on top of the reported 8% increase we delivered in fiscal 2020. On a 2-year stack basis, we delivered 17% sales growth. With rising cost pressures, we experienced declines in gross margin, particularly in Q4, resulting in a decrease of 200 basis points for the fiscal year, which we will discuss in more detail. Fiscal year 2021 adjusted EPS decreased 2% to $7.25. Recognizing the immediate priorities before us, I'd like to reinforce what matters most, long-term profitable growth. With a business that's significantly larger than before the pandemic and a portfolio of trusted brands exposed to more tailwinds, we have clarity in our strategic imperatives, and I have every confidence in our ability to continue delivering long-term value creation for our shareholders. When I look at fiscal 2021, our performance has shown the strength of our people, brands and products, as well as the resilience of our categories, as we work tirelessly to supply consumers with products across our portfolio. As a result, we experienced significant growth in demand and strengthened our position amongst global consumers, with strong household penetration supported by higher repeat rates across new and existing users. The last 12 months have also demonstrated the need to accelerate our IGNITE strategy, to address near-term headwinds and capitalize on long-term opportunities. The industry environment remains dynamic, with significant inflationary pressure and continuing uncertainty. In the face of these conditions, our top priority is strong execution, to mitigate the impact of elevated cost headwinds and continue to improve market share. The pandemic has also highlighted areas where additional investments can help us be as agile as possible in the future. We are clear on the opportunities ahead of us to differentiate Clorox and build a stronger, more resilient, and more profitable company. This includes driving our growth runways and making investments to enhance our digital capabilities and drive productivity improvements, which I will discuss shortly. We are confident that strong execution of our IGNITE strategy will enable us to achieve our 3% to 5% long-term sales target and deliver long-term shareholder value. Before I discuss Q4 and our progress against our strategy, I'd like to thank our Clorox teammates around the world for everything they've accomplished over the past year, as well as their commitment and dedication to serving people and communities around the world. For Q4, faster-than-expected moderating demand for cleaning and disinfecting products, had a pronounced impact on sales growth, as we move through the peak of the pandemic and lapped the unprecedented demand we experienced last year. The magnitude of this quarter's gross margin contraction was a result of faster-than-expected sales, moderation, acceleration of inflationary headwinds and improvements in supply, which led to broader product assortment, including the reintroduction of value packs. I'll discuss shortly the actions we're taking to address these headwinds. Now, let me share a few highlights of our progress on our IGNITE strategy. First, with fuel growth being a critical focus to help address elevated cost pressures, and ensure the long-term health of our brands, I'm pleased we delivered over $120 million in cost savings in the fiscal year, surpassing our annual target. Second, we made strong progress on our 2025 goal to know 100 million people, crossing the halfway mark to our goal this fiscal year. Our higher investment and personalization has led to significantly improved ROI. It has been one of the contributors to increasingly strong payouts, driving our confidence in continued investments in our brands. Third, with innovation at the heart of our strategy, we doubled our innovation investments in fiscal 2021. And new products were a bigger contributor to our top-line, which we expect to continue in fiscal 2022. Next, as consumers have increased their digital usage during the pandemic, we leaned into digital marketing and commerce, resulting in our e-commerce business nearly doubling in the last 2 years, which today represents about 13% of total company sales. Finally, we continue to make progress on our ESG goals. For example, we advanced our commitment to climate action and submitted our proposal on Science Based Targets for our operations, and Scope 3 emissions to the Science Based Target Initiative in June. And as a people-centric company, we continue to focus on the wellbeing of our teammates, and our value-based inclusive culture. I'm particularly proud that during this trying year, we achieved our best safety score in recorded history. With a recordable incident rate of 0.26, significantly lower than the 3.3 industry average. I'm also pleased that in fiscal 2021, we continue to have high employee engagement of 87%, putting us at the top quartile of Fortune 500 companies. Now, let me turn to fiscal 2022. We expect inflationary pressure to persist along with continued moderating demand as we lap COVID-19-related demand surges in the first half of fiscal 2021. While this is reflected in our fiscal 2022 outlook, which Kevin will discuss, by the second half of the year, we expect to be within the lower end of the range of our long-term sales target. Like others in our industry and beyond, we are experiencing significant increases in input and transportation costs across all categories in our portfolio, which have accelerated since Q3, and we're holistically and dynamically managing this with a laser-focus on rebuilding margin. We implemented pricing on Glad and announced actions on our food, cleaning and international businesses. This represents about 50% of our portfolio. We're also pursuing pricing in additional parts of our portfolio, which we'll communicate at the right time. Based on the constructive conversations we're having with our retail partners, and importantly, the strength of our brands, we feel confident about our ability to execute our pricing plans. In addition, we will continue to drive our hallmark cost savings program. We expect sequential growth margin improvements as we progress through fiscal 2022, with our assumption for gross margin expansion by Q4. In terms of market share, as we've discussed previously, we have experienced some declines due to supply challenges, but has made notable progress. With strong investments in internal and external production capacity, including additional manufacturing lines and a significant expansion of our production team, in June we achieved our highest case fill rate since the start of the pandemic. I'm pleased to see that in the latest 13-week data ending July 17, we saw market share gains in 7 out of 9 businesses. Certainly, we recognize there is more work to do in parts of the portfolio, such as Glad trash. And we have adjusted our plans to drive market share improvements over time. Despite these near-term headwinds, we remain focused on our long-term priorities, rooted in our IGNITE strategy, to deliver our long-term growth aspirations. While some pandemic-related behaviors may revert over the next 12 months, we continue to believe there's been a shift in behaviors that will advantage Clorox longer-term, including a focus on health, wellness and hygiene, more time at home, as well as increased adoption of e-commerce and digital platforms. The pandemic also revealed the urgency to upgrade our digital infrastructure and capabilities. Last year, I brought in Chief Information and Enterprise Analytics Officer, Chau Banks, who has extensive experience in business driven digital transformation to conduct a fresh assessment of our own program that was already underway before the pandemic. With that assessment now complete, we are accelerating our transformation through planned investments of about $500 million over the next 5 years to enhance our digital capabilities and drive productivity improvements, including replacing our ERP. This will enhance our supply chain to better position, Clorox to meet customer needs, yield efficiencies, and support our digital commerce, innovation and brand building efforts. Prior to the pandemic, we were already adapting our business to differentiate Clorox from a digital perspective. We'll continue to invest in e-commerce and digital marketing across our portfolio, leveraging data driven insights to engage with consumers in more relevant ways. Moving to innovation, innovation continues to be a key focus area for me and our new Chief Growth Officer, Tony Matta, who joined last October. Tony has more than 20 years of brand building experience with leading consumer companies, ensuring we have stickier innovation delivering multi-year value. We're driving lasting new product platforms, such as Fresh Step Clean Paws and Scentiva, which continue to grow. In addition, we're extending innovation by leveraging external partners to create new revenue streams. We're continuing to support our brands, especially margin accretive innovation with disciplined, high ROI advertising and sales promotion investments to build and strengthen consumer loyalty. We also remain very focused on driving our growth runways to build Clorox into a global cleaning and disinfecting brand. We are still in the early stages of a multi-year journey, but continue to believe they can become a meaningful contributor to growth longer-term. And as we execute on all these initiatives, we will continue to drive the strategic link between our societal impact and long-term value creation, as we live our purpose and keep our ESG commitments front and center in our decision making every day. With that, I'll turn the call over to Lisah to review our business unit performance. Thank you, Kevin. Before we open the line for questions, I wanted to take a moment to reiterate our commitment to and confidence in Clorox' long-term growth and value-creation potential, which is fueled by our IGNITE strategy. We're focused on strong execution in the face of dynamic conditions, including addressing significant cost headwinds and improving market share. In addition, we have clarity on the strategic imperative and executional mandate to differentiate Clorox and build a stronger, more resilient, and more profitable company. And as we accelerate and execute our IGNITE strategy, we're confident that we'll drive improved performance. Christy, you may now open the line for questions. Sure, Dara. Thank you. So why don't we start with your first question, why necessary now? And what's clear is the pandemic has absolutely accelerated consumer digital behaviors in a way that we never contemplated during our IGNITE strategy. And certainly, we saw that as a key consumer tailwind for us as we penned that strategy. But we've seen such a rapid movement online by consumers, both in the e-commerce space, and then certainly in the marketing consumption space, that we really knew we need to take a step back and look at the program that we had in place, and ensure that it was sufficient for us to deliver as we move forward, and what we look towards across the entire operation. And I think the other thing that I would note is, our challenges in fiscal year 2021, managing the type of volatility that we haven't been exposed to in the past, underscored the urgency to upgrade that digital infrastructure and capabilities. And what I want to make clear is, this is really not about today, this is about maintaining momentum as we come out of our IGNITE strategy period. And you'll see the bulk of the value of this comes after our IGNITE strategy period, so 2025 and beyond. This will allow us to have really real-time access to data and information that will help our entire operation move more efficiently and better serve consumer and customer needs. So we'll make first investment in our ERP, which is the foundation and infrastructure of all of these changes. And that's needed and accelerated to build these digital capabilities. We'll have better supply chain visibility across all parts of the supply chain with real time data, which will improve things like procurement and supply planning. It will further enhance the work that you already referenced, that we've done on digital and e-commerce and further enhance our ability to do personalization, and get more out of that goal, and will help us on innovation. So really, what this was about was the change in circumstances and the environment, a rapid change in consumer behavior that couldn't have been predicted before the pandemic, and we're leaning in. And this is really about building a stronger company with more momentum coming out of the strategy period. Yeah, timing is related to the commitment that we made at the beginning of the pandemic. And we continue to hold fast to, which is our absolute number one priority was to supply as much of the demand as we possibly could. And that continue to be our priority as we headed through Q4. We made the immediate call to price on Glad, given what we were seeing in resin. And that will go in market shortly. And we were doing the work behind the scenes to ready pricing across the rest of the portfolio as needed. Clearly, we're going to need to pull that lever and we are with about 50% announced to date and plans to take additional pricing that will communicate more details around coming up in the future. But it really was about that continued priority of meeting as much demand as we possibly could. Sure, Wendy. I'll start with the second part of the question, then I'll hand it over to Kevin to talk a bit more about capital allocation on your first question. So what we're seeing and you said it, it's absolutely an extraordinary environment. And if you look at all the factors combined, and what's contributing to our gross margin, I hate this term a little bit, but it's really the perfect storm, where we're lapping incredible sales growth, and things like operating leverage. We are lapping promotional levels being down. And I would argue promotional levels for us are our strategic. We've always viewed that investment, just like we do our marketing dollars, it helps us build trial, it helps us expose consumers to things like innovation. And that's going to continue to be important in the future. And it's why we want to put that money back in the system to ensure as we have record-setting innovation coming into the marketplace, from a top-line perspective, that we're able to support it with those dollars. And then, of course, the cost environment at which, I think, we're seeing broadly and it's not just a Clorox issue, but certainly an industry problem. So all of that is happening at once. What that leads me to is, this is natural issue. This is a temporary issue, albeit an extraordinary one. And we're managing with discipline. And I think the good news for us is we've managed albeit not this deep, but certainly environments that have happened like this over time. And what we do is go to work and execute, and we're going to do it just like that in the past. We're going to take pricing, and you're going to see much more pricing come from us now as it starts to pick up and we've improved supply as we've spoken about. We're going to put our cost savings machine to work with the mandate to our team to remove any costs that are possible in the system. And that's what they are focused on every single day right now. And we're going to take it one day at a time and execute it. But I feel confident in our ability to get back to what Kevin spoke about, and get back to those margins. It's just not going to happen this year. Again, we'll see improvement in Q4 and continued improvement as we move through fiscal 2023. But we do view this as a temporary issue. Sure, Chris, I'll start with Cleaning. I think this is absolutely a dynamic time for cleaning, given all of the volatility. But there were 2 things that we said at the beginning. We believe that this was a change in consumer behavior that would be long-term. And the evidence continues to support that that is absolutely the case. So if you just look at some of the consumption numbers, even though it did decelerate faster than we expected, as vaccination rates picked up, at least until we got to the point we are today, you still see a very strong 2-year stack of growth. So in Q4, that was over 20% for our cleaning business. But also, if you look at consumption, that's been up in the range from 25% to 30% versus pre-pandemic level. So we really are seeing that behavior be sticky with consumers. Of course, we're lapping incredible growth in those businesses, and frankly, demand that we couldn't supply early in the pandemic. So what you're seeing is a normalization, but as we said, a significantly higher run rate moving forward. And we expect that to continue, exactly, where that will net out is still unknown. And, I think, there's a lot of unknowns moving forward. Delta certainly is an unknown, cold and flu season, et cetera. But we have continued confidence that this will be a long-term trend that we can grow off and will provide us the opportunity to accelerate profitable growth. And as we talked about raising ourselves target to 3 to 5, this is a portion of that. So continue confidence there. Again, I would say, though, as we look to the first half, and as we lap 27% sales growth overall for the company, for cleaning and disinfecting, and for our household business. We won't expect to deliver accelerated results versus that period. But as we start to lap in the back half is when we get to the low end of our sales algorithm, and seeing both cleaning and disinfecting, and our household business contributing positively to that. Thanks, Jason. I would say, I'm very pleased with our share results, given the environment that we have. We're seeing significant increased competition and we had supply challenges given the unprecedented demand and we're making, in my view, great progress. So share up in 7 of 9 businesses. If you look at the latest 13 weeks, we widened our share gap in wipes back to double digits and growing, and that's with significantly new competitive entries in the category, we grew [bread at] [ph] 8 share points. And we have a very strong start to back to school, and that programs working well continued strong Kingsford share growth, after many quarters in a row of share growth in Kingsford. And you've heard my commitment, and I continue to stand by it, we remain committed to growing share. And we're focused on that fiscal 2022, and headed in absolutely the right direction. And I've also called up places where I'm not as happy, I'm still not happy on where we are in Glad, we have work to do there, we're focused on the fundamentals and executing. And this really is completely unrelated to pricing, Jason. Pricing really has to do from a timing perspective with ensuring that we had the supply and then going back and working with our retail partners to ensure that we could implement the new plans in place. That really is the only reason why we've delayed that. We will, of course, do the very important work you call out on price gaps as we move forward and that will be important. But given the incredible cost environment we see across the industry, we would expect to see categories moves, and we'll move along with them. And then we'll do the work to go back and ensure that we're in those right gaps. And then the other piece I would add Jason is our brands have never been stronger. And that was our goal exiting fiscal year 2021 was to be in a stronger position to grow off of this new significantly higher base. If you look at our household penetration, repeat rates, our consumer value. And as you know, we measured the percentage of our portfolio that is deemed superior by consumers that set a record high at 70%. So we feel fully confident in our ability to take pricing with the consumer. And then, of course, it'll be met with great marketing spend and innovation to continue to support that demand. Thanks, Jason. Sure, yeah, on the 50%, as we said, I think in an earlier answer, and in our prepared remarks. It means, we've announced pricing of about 50% to date, and we are planning additional pricing that will speak a little bit more once the details are in market. And really, there were considerations across how we would do that at what credit categories and what time, and we really took the category by category, it started with that first principle that I spoke about, which is we had to ensure we were in the right supply position as a starting place, before we did that. And as we've brought supply back online, we've opened more and more of our categories to looking at that. And then, of course, we're doing the really important work to look at each category, look at the dynamics, our position in that, what our innovation and marketing plans look like and balancing that across every one of the categories, because what we're really here to do is maximize the long-term on this. And what we want to ensure is that pricing as a part of that way that we restore margins, but also that we don't give up the opportunities we see in front of us to accelerate overall long-term profitable growth, and that's the balance we've gone through on every category. But, I think, what you're going to see from us as this all nets out, is that we're taking a very prudent stance on pricing. It will be a meaningful contributor to gross margin expansion as we move through the year. And as Kevin said, we have all confidence that as we move beyond that, we'll be able to restore margins with pricing as an important part of that. Thanks, Kevin. Sure, Lauren, broadly as we look across retail inventory is given the good supply progress that we made in Q4, we have largely restored inventories across the bulk of our portfolio. We do have some additional work to do on the broader assortment, a few packs and cleaning and disinfecting here and there, and still have some work to do on Kingsford and Food. But largely, I would say on the retail side inventories are restored, we'll see how that plays out, of course, as delta takes on et cetera, how those inventories continue to progress as we go through the first half of the year, but largely in a good spot now. In the professional business, it is different. So if you look at the front half of fiscal year 2021, we had a 70% increase in sales for our professional products business. And then we had a big drop off of that in our back half, as we've talked about in both sets of results. And what we've uncovered is there just looks like there's a lot of inventory in the professional channel. Given that, that front half that we experienced and it's not just our inventory, it's actually inventory across all manufacturers. And that network is primarily supplied by distributors. And so having visibility into each point of that supply, we do now when we realized there is more inventory there. So that means, as we left that 70% growth in the front half of fiscal 2022. And we start to read down that inventory, it is going to be bumpy in the short-term, continue to have strong confidence in our ability to grow PPD, you look at the two-year stack growth, its 35% sales growth. But I think it is going to be bumpy here as we left this front half, having the inventory on the system and then lapping an incredibly strong first half of last year. Yeah, absolutely. We've spoken about adding net revenue management more aggressively to our toolbox to deal with margin moving forward and that is absolutely the plan. So 2 things. One, as we brought SKUs back into assortment we did just that, Lauren, we did not bring back the full assortment, we took the opportunity to simplify which helps us in many areas in the cost lines and P&L. But also from a retailer perspective, optimizing their mix and leveraging their store shelf space, as well as online mix in the right way. So you will see a smaller assortment, our goal is to ensure that we had share of assortment, right? But in full knowing that distribution points might come down, and we're certainly seeing that play out. But your point moving forward is exactly right. We intend to use more net revenue management tools, which would include things like assortments and getting the mix right to drive margin over time, and all of our business units are developing plans to use that as a bigger lever moving forward. Thanks Lauren. Sure. So on Glad, if you look at Q4, just to set the backdrop, sales were down double-digits, but we lapped very strong double-digit growth in Q4 of last year. And we had a 2-year stack of Glad on 9% sales growth, in the fiscal year results, low-single-digits. So overall from a sales perspective, we were happy with where we landed. Really, it's a sheer disappointment that I continue to have. We want to grow market share and particularly in a category like trash. We are seeing the share trends improving. So we were down about 0.9 points in the latest 52 weeks, down 0.5 points in the latest 13, and down 0.4 in the latest 4 or 5. So definitely trending in the right direction behind improving distribution, getting the fundamentals right, et cetera. When it came to pricing, again, we announced pricing back in the fourth quarter, it's being implemented now. So \u2013 and we took a larger first round than what we saw in the marketplace to take into account what we saw from the category. And we're evaluating that again if an additional price increase is warranted. But we feel like we've made the right move on Glad. And again, we'll continue to watch that. Innovation continues to work incredibly well in Glad. And we're committed to that program moving forward to differentiate our bags. But what we're really focused on right now is in-market execution, ensuring we have the right distribution at every retailer, implementing pricing flawlessly, and then, getting back to merchandising, which will be important in this category. So, again, this is less of a comment overall in terms of sales, but more around winning in the market, ensuring that we have plans that grow share in the future. Yeah, we don't have any evidence from consumer studies or from retailers that there is excess pantry inventory across any of our categories, where there was pantry loading that happened early in the pandemic, for example, on Glad, those things have already reversed themselves out. And what we're just seeing is continued elevation of consumption in the cleaning categories as you articulate, but lower than levels at height of the pandemic. But really, we don't see this as a pantry-loading issue. Great. Thank you. I believe that's the end of Q&A. Thanks again, everyone, for joining us. We look forward to speaking with you again on our next call in November. And until then, please take good care."

        "content": "Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Clorox Company Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference.\nLisah Burhan: Thanks Christy. Welcome everyone and thank you for joining us. We hope you and your families are continuing to stay safe and well. I'll start by providing some context to this quarter to give you an understanding of the dynamic environment we're seeing as we begin to emerge from this pandemic. Then I'll have my usual topline commentary with highlights from each of our segments. Kevin will then address our total company results as well as our FY 2021 outlook. Finally, Linda will offer her perspective and we'll close with Q&A. A few reminders before we go into results. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website at cloroxcompany.com. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements including statements related to the expected or potential impact of COVID-19. These statements are based on management's current expectations but may differ from actual results or outcome. In addition we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section which identifies various factors that could affect such forward-looking statements and the non-GAAP financial information section which include tables that reconcile non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, both of which are located at the end of today's earnings release which has also been posted on our website and filed with the SEC. To help cut through some of the complexities this quarter, I'd like to share what we see as three important key takeaways. First, we're on track for another strong year. Our FY 2021 outlook continues to project double-digit sales growth. On a two-year stack basis we're also positioned to deliver about 19% sales growth. Second, we continue to see opportunity to accelerate our long-term financial performance. For example, many consumer behaviors that have changed during the pandemic are expected to stick including enhanced hygiene practices. We're leaning into these changes through new growth runways to help Clorox develop into a global disinfecting brand. And third, the pandemic has only reinforced the relevance of our IGNITE strategy priorities which center around people and innovation leveraging technology as a critical enabler. Now, turning to our third quarter results. Our strategy has enabled us to deliver flat sales in Q3 on top of 15% growth in the year ago quarter. Q3 sales reflected about one point of net benefit from July 2020 acquisition that gave us a majority share in our joint venture in Saudi Arabia. On an organic basis sales were down 1%. In our Health and Wellness segment, sales were down 8% reflecting declines in Cleaning and PPD. Sales in Cleaning business declined this quarter from lower shipments in a number of our cleaning and disinfecting products. The lower shipments are a result of demand normalization in bleach and Pine-Sol relative to the year ago period when consumers turned to these products given the persistent out of stocks in wipes and sprays at the onset of the pandemic. Segment results also reflect ongoing supply constraints in our wipes and sprays. Nonetheless, two-year stack growth remains very strong, reflecting a much higher level of consumer demand and household penetration than pre-pandemic, even as we begin to see a return to new normal in the US with a growing percentage of the population vaccinated. As we continue to increase supply in our wipes and sprays, product availability and assortment will improve, which in turn should lead to improvements in shares. We're also excited to be bringing back some of the innovation we've had to pause during the pandemic, including Clorox compostable wipes and Clorox Scentiva disinfecting sprays and wipes. Sales in our Professional Products business were down by double-digits this quarter, due to lower shipments of cleaning and disinfecting products as many businesses remain close during the third quarter relative to the year-ago period. Similar to the trends in cleaning, demand for our consumer-preferred disinfectants, like wipes and sprays remain elevated and consumption continues to be limited by our ability to supply. And as expected, consumption of bleach and other cleaning and disinfecting products has normalized. With continuing category tailwinds, progress in our out-of-home partnerships and a strong innovation pipeline, PPD fundamentals remain healthy. Importantly, we feel good about the prospects of this business. Lastly, within this segment, sales in our vitamins, minerals and supplements business were up in the third quarter, driven by higher shipments of our strategic brands and lower trade spending. Notably, we were lapping a double-digit decrease from the year-ago period, driven by a disruption in our supply chain-related to COVID-19. As noted in today's press release, we recorded $267 million net non-cash impairment charge related to this business, which Kevin will address in more detail shortly. Despite the setback, we're moving forward focused on implementing a refreshed portfolio strategy and incorporating what we've learned since acquiring these brands. There continue to be strong tailwinds in the VMS space. And we have clarity on the path of this business becoming a more meaningful contributor in the long-term. Again, just some brief context before I get into the results in our other businesses. Similar to cleaning, inventory levels in the year-ago period impacted Q3 results, especially in Brita, where we remain supply constrained. With continued elevated demand and supply challenges, several of our businesses in these segments have gone back on allocation. In Household and Lifestyle, consumers continuing to stay at home as well as business closures impact our businesses differently, benefiting some and challenging others. Nonetheless, our two-year stack growth across our segments remain very strong and well above our long-term sales growth targets. Turning to the Household segment. Quarterly sales were up 6% with growth recorded in all three businesses for a fourth consecutive quarter. Grilling sales were up by double-digits in what was a record-setting quarter of shipments for the business. Through strategic collaborations with our retail partners, we've been able to continue to grow household penetration and share. In the past year, we've introduced Kingsford products - Kingsford's products to more than one million new households. And they've invested in their backyard, including buying new charcoal and pellet growth, which will create a lasting tailwind for this business. Our pricing strategy has also led to a less promotional environment, which will reduce pantry loading going forward. And we've improved our product lineup and distribution, making it easier for consumers to find our Kingsford pellet innovation and new flavors of our Kingsford product lineup at even more locations nationwide. All these goodness is helping us build a healthy momentum for this business, which is especially important, as we head into peak \u2013 the peak of the grilling season and tough comparable periods. Cat Litter sales increased this quarter, despite lapping consumer stockpiling in the year-ago period. The driving forces behind the business strong performance have been its success in the e-commerce channel and innovation. Fresh Step with Gain continues to do well and build distribution with more innovation planned for Q4. Additionally, the record number of pet adoptions that has occurred during the past year will resonate for years to come as cat parents continue to purchase necessities like litter long after the pandemic has ended. Glad sales increased in Q3, mainly behind lower trade promotion. As a reminder, while we began to see elevated demand at the tail end of the year-ago quarter, heavy consumption didn't occur until late in FY 2020. So Q4 will be a more challenging comparison than Q3. In recent months, we've also seen a significant resin price inflation. To manage those rising costs, we have announced a pricing action on this brand effective in July. As we've mentioned, we'll manage inflationary pressures holistically using all the tools in our toolbox. This approach will allow us to continue introducing innovation that resonates with consumers, which has driven profitable growth for the category for a long time. For example, over the past decade, we've started using higher-quality resin that has allowed us to reduce overall use by 20%, resulting in a stronger bag with a reduced environmental footprint, all while improving our cost structure over time. Our latest innovation Glad ForceFlex with Clorox trash bags has been performing well since its fall 2020 launch. In Lifestyle segment, Q3 sales were flat. The Food business had a double-digit sales increase for a fourth straight quarter behind continued consumption growth of our Hidden Valley Ranch bottle dressings and dry seasonings. This growth was on top of high single-digit growth in the year-ago period. The ongoing trend of at-home meals has driven household penetration to another record high. Our optimism for this business is further fueled by the success of our latest innovation Hidden Valley Secret Sauces and Hidden Valley plant right-based ranch dressing, which has both \u2013 have both been performing well. Brita sales in Q3 were down by double-digits, as the category consumption decelerated from its COVID-related buying spikes in the year-ago period. Despite these results, consumption level has remained much higher than pre-pandemic, partly fueled by strong filter replacement. As with wipes and sprays, our supply chains have not caught up with demand in Brita, particularly for filters and impacting our shares and sales. On a positive note, we're continuing to make progress in addressing these supply issues, which has already helped us begin to recover share. Burt\u2019s Bees sales also decreased by double digits, due to the changes in shopping and usage behavior, that have occurred during the pandemic. The business was also lapping the effect of pantry loading in the year-ago period. Mask wearing and decreased mobility have created headwinds in both the lip care and face care segments. Still, the brand has not only maintained, but fortified its position as the number one lip balm. As we prepare this business for improving consumer mobility and consumers returning to cosmetics and colors, we'll be launching towelette innovation in value sizes and the new watermelon scent. These bright spots, combined with the continued growth in online channels, contribute to our confidence in the long-term growth prospects of this business. Lastly, International has its own unique dynamics that sets us apart from our other segments. Unlike the US, most international markets where we operate don't yet have high vaccination rates. As a result, demand for cleaning and disinfecting product, remain elevated. The two-year stack growth rate for this business is about 22%. In our International segment, Q3 sales grew 9%. These results which reflect the combined impact of about seven points of benefit from the Saudi JV acquisition and about two points from foreign currency headwinds are on top of 11% growth in the year-ago period. Excluding the impact of Saudi acquisition, half of all sales growth was driven by the introduction of a new line of Clorox disinfecting wipes, mainly flat packs innovation sourced from our dedicated international supply chain and launched in more than 30 countries this fiscal year. With strong innovation like this and differentiation of our brands in their respective categories, we feel good about the growth runway of this business. Now, I'll turn it over to Kevin, who will discuss our Q3 performance, as well as our updated outlook for FY 2021.\nKevin Jacobsen: Thank you, Lisah, and thank you everyone for joining us today. We hope you and your families are well. Before I review our third quarter results, let me first address the non-cash impairment charge we reported today. The Better Health, Vitamins Minerals and Supplements business, represents about 4% of total company sales, comprising several small brands, we acquired in two separate transactions. Performance on this business has not delivered on our expectations. The impairment was a result of our updated valuation, which assumes lower sales and profit projections versus our initial expectations at the time of the acquisition, primarily driven by an increased level of competitive activity and the need for more investments to scale these small brands. As a result of our updated valuation, we record a pretax non-cash impairment charge of $329 to lower the carrying values of goodwill, trademarks and other assets of the Vitamin, Mineral and Supplement business unit. Net of a deferred tax benefit of $62 million associated with this impairment, we recorded a $267 million charge to net income or $2.11 per share. This represents about 27% of its initial purchase price. Going forward, we are implementing our refreshed portfolio strategy. We continue to believe in the attractiveness of the VMS space, driven by strong consumer tailwinds and the strategic fit, given our focus on health and wellness. Importantly, we fully expect that our VMS business will be a meaningful contributor to our company results over time. To ensure clarity around the underlying operating performance of our overall business, my comments on the third quarter results will exclude the impact of this non-cash impairment. In addition, my comments will exclude the impact of a onetime non-cash gain related to our Saudi joint venture acquisition. It's important to note, that while the Saudi joint venture is expected to contribute $0.45 to $0.50 to our reported EPS, it includes a $0.60 non-cash gain that we're excluding from our adjusted EPS outlook. Moving forward, in our fiscal year adjusted EPS 2021 outlook, we are continuing to include $0.10 to $0.15 charge, primarily from an ongoing intangible amortization related to the acquisition. Before I review our third quarter results, I'll comment briefly on our fiscal year outlook. As you saw in our press release, we've confirmed our fiscal year sales outlook and provided an adjusted EPS outlook, which excludes a non-cash impact from the VMS impairment in the third quarter, as well as a one-time non-cash gain of the Saudi joint venture acquisition in the first quarter. For perspective, excluding these items, help provide clarity around our underlying operational performance, which is unchanged from our previous outlook. Importantly I'm pleased we're on track to deliver another strong year for our shareholders, targeting a two-year stack of about 19% sales growth, well above our historical financial performance. Now, turning to our third quarter results. Third quarter sales were flat, in comparison to 15% growth in the year-ago quarter, when we saw the initial spike from COVID-19. Our sales results reflect a 5-point decline in organic volume, offset by 4 points of favorable price/mix and 1 point benefit from our Saudi joint venture acquisition. On an organic basis, third quarter sales declined 1%. Our sales results came in largely as expected, although there's certainly variability across our portfolio, which reflects a very dynamic environment we continue to navigate. Importantly, we grew sales in six out of our 10 businesses. Gross margin for the quarter decreased 320 basis points to 43.5%, compared to 46.7% for the year-ago quarter. Gross margin results reflect a pronounced inflationary environment, resulting in 360 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs, including temporary COVID-19 spending, as well as 170 basis points of higher commodity costs, primarily related to the rising cost of resin, partially impacted by the extreme weather events we experienced in the Southern US earlier this quarter. Gross margin also reflects 100 basis points of negative impact from lower volume in the quarter. These factors are partially offset by 140 basis points of favorable trade promotion and 110 basis points of cost savings. Selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, came in at 13.3%, compared to 15.1% in the year-ago quarter reflecting lower incentive compensation expenses, primarily related to the non-cash impairment on the VMS business. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels, as a percentage of sales, came in at 11%, reflecting continued strong investments across our portfolio, with U.S. spending at about 12% of sales, to support a robust innovation program in the back half of the fiscal year. Our third quarter effective tax rate was negative 1.4%, driven by the impairment charge we took on our VMS business. Excluding the impairment charge, our third quarter tax rate was 23%, compared to 19% in the year-ago quarter, as we lap excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation. Net of all these factors, adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter came in at $1.62 versus $1.89 in the year-ago quarter, a decline of 14%. As you also saw in our press release, year-to-date net cash provided by operations was $893 million versus $806 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 11%. Our strong cash flow was due to profitable sales growth, partially offset by higher tax payments and higher employee incentive compensation payments. Turning to our updated fiscal year outlook. We continue to anticipate fiscal year sales to grow between 10% to 13%, reflecting the strength of our first half results and our ongoing assumptions for moderating demand over the balance of the fiscal year as we move beyond the peak of the pandemic in the US and lap exceptional prior year comparisons.  Our assumptions for one point of contribution from our Saudi joint venture offset by one point of foreign exchange headwinds remain the same. On an organic sales basis, our outlook continues to assume 10% to 13% growth. We now expect fiscal year gross margin to be down due to a more pronounced headwinds from elevated commodity and transportation costs.  We now expect fiscal year selling and administrative expenses to come in below 14% of sales reflecting lower incentive compensation costs primarily due to our third quarter non-cash impairment on our VMS business.  Additionally, we continue to anticipate fiscal year advertising spending to be about 11% of sales, reflecting our ongoing assumption to spend about 12% in the back half to support our innovation program. For perspective, this fiscal year, we're planning to spend about $125 million more versus a year ago to ensure we're leaning into engaging consumers to build lifetime loyalty to our brands.  We continue to expect our fiscal year tax rate on a reported and adjusted basis to be between 21% and 22%. Net of these factors, we anticipate fiscal year adjusted EPS to be between $7.45 and $7.65 or 1% to 4% growth, reflecting the continued assumptions I mentioned last quarter, including strong top line performance partially offset by an increasingly elevated cost environment.  In closing, I'd like to note that as we transition from the peak of the pandemic in the US, we're navigating a highly dynamic operating environment with the following factors that can influence our results in the near to medium-term. First, category dynamics and consumption trends. As more people get vaccinated and become increasingly mobile in the US, although we recognize different markets are in varying stages of pandemic, we're keeping an eye on short-term changes in these trends as they could cause variability in our top line.  That said longer-term, we believe our portfolio will continue to play a meaningful role in addressing consumer megatrends that have accelerated over the last 12 months, which will contribute to higher demand for our products relative to demand levels prior to the pandemic.  Second, more pronounced cost headwinds, which we'll plan to navigate with all the tools in our toolkit including opportunities for pricing in key areas of our portfolio. And third, increased production capacity to support ongoing elevated demand. This remains a key priority for us as our teams continue to look for every opportunity to expand our production capacity, while recognizing the ongoing volatility this creates on our extended supply chain.  And finally, I'll reinforce that we're on track to deliver another strong year for our shareholders, while keeping our sights set on the long-term. As you saw in February, we raised our long-term annual sales target to 3% to 5%.  Based on the early success of our IGNITE strategy and our continued plans to lean in even further with strong investments behind our brands, people, technology, production capacity and of course, our new growth opportunities where we believe we have a right to win. These efforts are all in service of our broader ambition to accelerate profitable growth, to create long-term value for our shareholders.  And with that I'll turn it over to Linda. \nLinda Rendle: Thanks, Kevin. Hello, everyone and thank you for being with us today. I hope you are all well. A year ago around this time when the pandemic spiked in the US, we knew we were facing unchartered territory. And as I look back at how we've managed our business to support our consumers, retail partners and communities over the last 12 months what makes me proud is that we stayed true to three things.  We embraced our role as a health and wellness company, which helped us prioritize our actions, including ensuring the safety of our people and emphasizing our support for health care workers. We put people at the center taking care of our teammates around the world and staying the course in doing everything we could to serve public health and consumer needs. We were led by our values, with our commitment to do the right thing guiding our strategic choices and actions. Out of all of this, our purpose became clearer. We champion people to be well and thrive every single day. With this in mind, here's what's important for you to take away from today's call. First, our business is well positioned for the future. I'm grateful our consumers have rewarded our team's dedication to serving people and communities around the world. Our business is significantly larger than it was before the pandemic. People have turned to our trusted brands for support, during an incredibly tough year, and Clorox has the most trusted brands in many categories. We see this play out in strong household penetration across our portfolio, with our brands in 90% of US households. We continue to see strong repeat rates across our brands among core and new users versus last year. And as Lisah mentioned, we continue to focus on retaining this larger base of loyal consumers. And of course, this is showing up in our results, including flat sales in comparison to a very strong base in the year-ago quarter. For perspective, it's worth noting that we delivered a two-year stack of 15% total company sales growth in the third quarter. And as Kevin mentioned, we're on track to hit a two-year stack of about 19% sales growth for the fiscal year. My second message is that, we have strategic plans in place to address near-term priorities as we continue to navigate in a very dynamic environment. First, there's more work to be done on improving supply, especially after weather-related disruptions in the third quarter and higher-than-anticipated demand in certain parts of our portfolio. We're pulling every lever available to us to improve supply, including working with third-party supply sources as we continue to run flat out. I'm encouraged by our progress, but our overall supply chain remains a top priority focus for us. Next, we fully acknowledge that market shares for key brands are not where we want them to be. That said, share declines are primarily driven by recent supply challenges. And as we continue to improve supply capacity, we expect to recover market share. We feel good about seeing continued strong consumption and demand across our portfolio relative to pre-pandemic levels. And as Kevin discussed, we're facing stronger cost pressures from critical input costs and a tightening transportation market. One of the four key choices in our IGNITE strategy is to generate fuel to support growth and mitigate inflation. We're taking a holistic approach to address these cost pressures by leveraging a number of tools to support our margins, including margin accretive innovation, net revenue management, pricing through trade reduction, and less price increases and as always a relentless focus on cost savings. My last message is this. With conviction in our purpose and guided by a strategy that makes the most of our strength, we continue to have our sights set on our ambition to accelerate long-term profitable growth. In the past year, we learned that by putting people at the center our IGNITE strategy has helped us to do what we do best, serve people who count on our brands. And we continue to have an opportunity to serve even more people around the world. And as we think about our future, our strategy is proving to be particularly relevant as it leverages significant consumer megatrends that have accelerated because of the pandemic. The latest research still tells us that consumer routines and behaviors formed during the pandemic are expected to persist, including prioritizing health and hygiene, drinking more water, taking vitamins and supplements and spending more time online. What's more the role of home has changed. With many companies pursuing hybrid models for their workforce, we expect more cleaning, more meal occasions and more trash to be generated at home. Our portfolio continues to be in a unique position to play a meaningful role in people's lives and we have every intention of accelerating new growth opportunities to support these trends. Moving forward, we're leaning into our IGNITE strategy with innovation remaining core to our key areas of strength. That means; innovating in our products, especially, larger stickier innovation platforms that deliver superior consumer value and multiyear growth for our business; innovating in consumer and shopper engagement; personalizing experiences for consumers so that we get to know 100 million people by the year 2025; and partnering with our retailers on category vision and leadership to support healthy and profitable categories. The turnaround of our Kingsford business is a great example of how our focus on innovation is contributing significantly to strong category and brand growth. Innovating how we work across the organization through technology that makes us smarter, work faster and in the case of our supply chain enables us to respond more quickly to future demand spikes. And finally, innovating through an ESG lens because we believe in the strategic link between our societal impact and long-term value creation. Here are some highlights in the last quarter. We're 21% of the way toward our goal to reduce virgin plastic and fiber packaging by 50% by 2030. We've achieved 76% of our 100% goal for recyclable, reusable or compostable packaging by 2025. We're introducing a company-wide learning and development program focused on sustainability because ESG integration in our business not only means embedding it in every brand, but also rallying every person behind our efforts. And with ESG embedded into our operations, our brands are not only contributing to our corporate ESG goals, but they're also pursuing meaningful goals that matter to their consumers. As an example by 2030, Brita has a goal to provide clean water access to 0.5 million people in the US facing poor-quality tap water. This speaks to the heart of Brita's brand purpose. Before I open it up for questions, I'd like to echo the important takeaways Lisah mentioned at the beginning of the call. First, we're on track for another strong year. Second, we'll seize the opportunity before us to accelerate long-term profitable growth. Third, our IGNITE strategy has proven its relevance in the face of the pandemic by putting people at the center, emphasizing innovation and leveraging technology to lay the groundwork for the future. Operator, you may now open the line for questions. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: Hi, guys. \nKevin Jacobsen: Hi, Dara.\nDara Mohsenian: Two things for me. First, one just can you clarify the 3% to 5% long-term top-line growth range from down in CAGNY, can you just clarify specifically what time period is that over? Is that a post fiscal 2022 range? Does it include fiscal 2021-2022? Just trying to understand that? And then second there are a lot of sort of puts and takes as we think about the next few quarters here from a top-line standpoint. In theory more difficult comparisons, COVID cases are dropping off. Vaccine counts are going up. Those are some headwinds, but you mentioned some of the supply chain challenges that you're working on. And you've talked about the greater opportunity in professional and international longer-term, which drove that higher long-term top line growth guidance down at CAGNY. So I was just hoping you could give us a bit of context as you look out here over the next few quarters in terms of some of those headwinds versus tailwinds. Could the business potentially decelerate with the comparisons you're facing, or do some of those positive areas more than offset it as you think about the business over the next few quarters here? I know you're not going to give a specific number, but just trying to think how you guys think through that particularly with some of those longer-term positive top line tailwinds you're thinking of? Does that play out in the near-term, or how long does that take to play out? Thanks.\nKevin Jacobsen: Sure Dara. And let me start with your first question, or as you mentioned we raised our long-term sales goal of 3% to 5% back in February. In terms of the timing that's part of our IGNITE strategy, which runs through 2025. And Dara how I see that playing out as we talked back in February and we have the same point of view, we expect our sales to be roughly flat in the back half of the year. And that's consistent with Q3. And as we get into fiscal year 2022, our expectation is we're going to be by the back half of the year back to our long-term raised sales outlook at 3% to 5%. So as you know, we've got some tough comps here for the next three quarters. But as we get through those comps by January, we were at this new elevated level. And that's really as we work through the next phase of this pandemic as we see higher vaccination rates, more mobility, we fully expect that we'll see a slowdown in demand for products that's expected. When we get to that new normalized level, we think we're back at this 3% to 5% rate going forward.\nDara Mohsenian: Great. That's helpful. And then any context around some of those headwinds and tailwinds and particularly supply chain challenges? Any progress on that front, how much impact could that have from a top line perspective as you think over the next few quarters here?\nLinda Rendle: Sure. I'll take that one. I'll start maybe with the big picture on what we're seeing as definitely tailwinds for us and we mentioned some of this in the script but with a little bit more color. We're definitely seeing consumer behavior trend sticky as we look over the mid to long-term. We're seeing hygiene continue to be that cornerstone of health for folks. And even as people are getting vaccinated and mobility is starting to increase, we're seeing people embrace those new cleaning behaviors as new routines. And they're both doing that inside and out of the home. In the business case, we're still seeing the need for higher disinfection as they welcome people back. But the issue has been depending on the market you're in and certainly we're seeing that in the U.S. mobility has not really increased the point where businesses are fully at capacity yet or even open in many cases. So we're seeing that both as a long-term headwind but as a short-term impact definitely to Q3. And we're looking to the future quarters to see how mobility will improve. I think the other things that we continue to see around people taking care of their health and wellness are persisting. We have a new installed base, for example, with Brita with a lot of people who purchased pitchers over the last period and we're seeing them continue with filter sales in their quest to be healthier and you take on good habits. Digital continues to persist and we think that will be a tailwind for our business as we've invested as you well-know more in digital marketing than the average in our industry leaning into that trend already. And then, of course, our strong position in e-com that we've built over many years and we continue to see that accelerate. And that's up to 14% of our business year-to-date. And then, the role of home continues to be a tailwind. And that was above our expectations in quarter three for sure. But we're seeing people persist, even as people have more mobility, people are eating more at home. And that what hasn't really changed at all, as people who were working from home during the pandemic are continuing to work from home. So we see that in our impact whether that be on our Kingsford business, on our Hidden Valley Ranch business or our trash business there's definitely positivity to that stay-at-home trend. So I think all of those are going to be tailwinds, as we look to the coming months and in the long-term. From a headwind perspective, supply chain has continued to be a challenge. And what we've done is gone after a tremendous amount of sales. We're a much bigger company than we were pre-pandemic. And that means that we have increased the complexity in our supply chain. We have a lot more nodes. We have a lot more third parties helping us. And then, what didn't help this quarter, of course were the weather disruptions that we experienced that caused quite a few force majeures in our products. And although we were managed -- able to manage through it, and deliver our overall commitment from a quarter three perspective, it's something we're watching really closely to see any volatility we have. But the supply chain being more expanded, continues to be something that we're watching, continues to be something that could be a help or a hinder as we look forward.\nDara Mohsenian: Great. That's helpful. And if I can just sneak one more in, on the pricing front, obviously you mentioned the Glad increases, potentially opportunities in other areas. Can you talk a little bit about, if you have pricing plans in place across the rest of the portfolio? Is it still being decided? Is it just a matter of when you communicate it? How do you think about pricing, in the rest of the portfolio beyond Glad? Thanks.\nLinda Rendle: Absolutely, so as Kevin highlighted and Lisah highlighted in their scripts, absolutely seeing the inflationary pressure, as I think the entire ecosystem is now across our industry and from a retailer perspective as well. And what we have our sights set on is how, do we get to that long-term EBIT margin goal we have of 25 basis points to 50 basis points, from an accretion perspective. And the way we approach it, is very holistic. We're looking across a robust toolbox to address this, things like margin accretive innovation. And we have a terrific innovation program, that started at the beginning of this year and is continuing as we launch incremental innovations in Q4, net revenue management, pricing and that will include both, list price increases and trade reductions. And then, of course, our relentless focus on cost savings. So we're employing that entire toolbox right now, across all of our businesses. And we're coming from a place of strength in this. Our brands are strong right now. We have never had a higher consumer value measure. Household penetration is strong. We're seeing strong repeats. So we're feeling confident in that. And we're evaluating our ability to take price across all businesses. But I'll tell you, we will be very surgical and targeted in this. We're going category-by-category because we're -- of course we're weighing the broader environment. And we want to be measured in that. But I -- the message I want you to hear is we're looking at it very broadly across our portfolio. And what we're really focused on is executing by category with excellence.\nDara Mohsenian: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities.\nChris Carey: Hi everyone. So I just want to follow-up on, on that line of commentary around pricing. And then, I have a second question. So just on the pricing front, maybe just help us understand, your pricing at Glad, last time that happened it was -- caused volatility on shelf. Now you have competitors that are moving ahead of you. Can you just talk to confidence that that won't happen again this time? And then related to the pricing you did mention that lower promotions I think are going to be a part of how you're getting some net pricing. I think that's what you said. But promos are already at a pretty low level. And so do you anticipate your promotional levels going below peers? And then I have a second question. But the general framework there is, just Glad pricing risk and just -- did I hear that right that you think promo can actually be a source of pricing basically implying that maybe you're not looking at list prices in the rest of the portfolio just yet until we get well into fiscal '22? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks Chris. I'll start. So we have confidence in our brands and the strength right now and that is absolutely inclusive of Glad. And all of the investment that we put in, in terms of incremental advertising, what we put in from an innovation perspective and how consumers have turned to our brands during this time, continue to give us confidence in our ability to take pricing. I think what we're also seeing this time versus what we saw last time is a broader inflationary environment that really is pretty systemic throughout the industry and what everyone is experiencing. So as you mentioned, we've seen competitors move in categories like Glad. I think Glad in particular, I'll just highlight we have already come up with that price increase that's effective in July. But given the volatility and the increases we're seeing in the resin market, we are looking at will we take even additional pricing in Glad based on what we've seen. So again we want to be -- let the cost pressures guide us. We're doing this for the mid to long term but we're seeing extraordinary circumstances in resin right now that are helping us to go faster on Glad. What you should take away on the other brands is not that we are not looking at with price increases. We look at that -- first of all we do that annually as a company to understand our position. But right at this moment, we're looking at that. But what I want you to hear is the way that we do that across the brands needs to be holistic. So some will include those price increases, others will not. And what you'll hear us apply to every business is cost savings. You'll hear us think about how we can have margin accretive innovation across every business, but less price increases we'll be very targeted on, but again evaluating across our entire portfolio. And I think from an on-shelf and a retailer perspective, we're working on category growth plans with them. And we're lapping a very strong period of growth. And as you think about the lower promotion question, what we're trying to do is get to a more normalized state of promotion. And it's still although accelerated versus where it was in Q2, it's still well below pre-pandemic levels. And as we lap that growth there's little incentive to put a bunch of deep discounting out in the system and we're working on growth plans. So that's how we're thinking about the lower promotions in the context of the environment, is that we all have strong growth to lap. And of course, we want to make sure that consumers that we continue to lean into them and invest behind the tailwinds. And that could mean a lower promotional environment. So we're watching that closely and again it will depend on the category. But the overall sentiment would be, keeping it as rational as we can and using promotion for what it's intended for to drive trial and to get consumers to keep us curious. \nChris Carey: Thank you for that. Maybe just to close the loop, I mean the last time there was a commodity cycle pricing accounted for several hundred basis points to gross margin. Can you just comment on whether that is a sort of a realistic framework to think about go forward? And then the second question is just, I think if there was one area which surprised certainly relative to our model this quarter was the decline in professional and certainly on a sequential basis. Like I appreciate the cyclicality of the business, but there's also this underlying -- we've heard about all these partnerships that you're signing. And I guess also international came in a little bit light just relative to what we've seen from a lot of other staples companies this quarter. And so maybe I think underlying the question is just the confidence that these two businesses can be contributors to your 3% to 5% longer term growth outlook. Just maybe any puts and takes that you saw this quarter which give you confidence that those businesses can be bigger growth drivers going forward? Thanks so much for all that.\nKevin Jacobsen: Sure. Hey Chris maybe I'll start and I'll turn it over to Linda as well. On your first question in regard to the impact of pricing, I'd tell you it's too early for us to start providing perspective. We're right in the middle right now of building our plans for fiscal year 2022. And as Linda said we're going to be looking at a number of different levers in terms of how we're going to work to offset the transportation and commodity cost increases we're seeing. Pricing will certainly be one of those levers but we'll be looking at a number of others as well. So, we'll update you on that one as we get further along with our plans in August. In regard to International just a perspective of International as you may have seen volume was down. I think it's worth noting we feel very good about the progress we're making on our cleaning and disinfecting work. And as Lisa mentioned in her prepared remarks, we continue to expand the number of countries we're introducing wipes into and we've added 30 countries now. Specifically, though in the third quarter, one of the challenges we had was in Canada. While we saw growth pretty broadly across our portfolio in Canada and if you're tracking that region, you may know they are now in their third lockdown. And in the Canadian market it's a little different than the US, in their lockdowns for items that are deemed non-essential. If you go into a retail outlet, in many cases, those aisles are blocked off where you can't shop them. And so as an example in third quarter we grew our cleaning and disinfecting business in Canada, but we saw pretty significant declines in other parts of our business. Our Brita business was down over 30%. Our Burt's Bees business is also down by a similar amount because consumers are not able to shop those aisles. Now, right now the lockdown they've announced goes through May 20th. So that has some knock-on effect as we move into our fourth quarter. But we expect as we get out of that lockdown, those businesses will rebound. But by and large, we feel very good about the progress on our cleaning and disinfecting portfolio internationally. And then Linda will talk a little bit about our professional business.\nLinda Rendle: Yes. I think professional is a unique part of our portfolio because it really is tied very heavily to mobility. And if you think about this, it has to really do with the comparison period. So, last quarter three, businesses hadn't shut down by the -- in that point even though we saw consumer takeaway in the retail side for the most part businesses were open. So, we had a very strong comparison period to lap. And in contrast to that this quarter most businesses continue to remain closed. And you have to recall too we have a very established business when it comes to professional. This is not just about the new opportunities, but we've been cleaning these businesses for years and years. It's about 7% of the company before this growing strongly mid-single to high single-digits and so that really had an impact. And I think if you look broader across the professional space, not just ours, they're seeing the same trends broadly in that industry. But if you take a step back the trends continue. The partners that we've had as we brought on in the new out-of-home space continue to see the benefits of offering their guests a clean and disinfected space branded by Clorox and we continue to expand those partnerships and bring new ones on. The two-year stack on this business is up 17% so very strong growth on top of strong growth for many years. And we continue to have conviction in the long term. The reality is consumers need that reassurance that spaces are clean. We know businesses want to provide that to them so they can get back to growing again. And we have a terrific new suite of innovation that we're excited about that's coming in quarter four including expanding our electrostatic sprayer business with both new forms and chemistries. So feel really good about the long term of this business. There's a lot of noise in the short term, as most of the professional spaces out there have encountered, but no change to our outlook for the future.\nChris Carey: Okay. Well thanks. Thank you both for all that. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.\nNik Modi: Yeah. Hi, everyone. So Linda, I was hoping you can address something on disinfecting wipes, just two vectors to think about on category growth. So I look at numerators vaccinated shopper data suggest that vaccinated consumers buy rate that disinfecting wipes is dropping faster than unvaccinated consumer. So I was just -- hope you can provide some complex and thoughts around that. And then secondly on market share given this has been a supply-related issue, I mean what's the case that you can make to retailers to get back the space at a point where you feel like the supply problem no longer exists? I mean, is it going to be about marketing support, brand loyalty or basket size place? So any thoughts around that would be helpful.\nLinda Rendle: Sure Nik. Just starting with disinfecting, we continue to see really strong behavior changes from consumers. But we did anticipate to experience as people became vaccinated behavior is changing. And we did see that curve move up slightly. So as people got vaccinated, it just happened a little earlier. And frankly, vaccines happened earlier than we had anticipated. So that's normal. We expected that as we go forward. But the key takeaway is versus prepandemic levels cleaning behaviors are still significantly elevated. And we continue to expect them to be into the future. And we're hearing that from consumers. We're seeing that in their buying habits and continue to feel confident about our ability to -- for these growth areas in cleaning and disinfecting to get us to our 3% to 5% growth rate moving forward. I think as it particularly comes to market share, just to be really clear, we are not happy. Whether it be supply related et cetera, we want to grow share. And that is our goal and we want to do that over the mid- to long term. This really does have -- it's primarily driven with supply, particularly in cleaning and disinfecting. Not only did we have the weather-related issues, but as we talked about the more that we expand our supply chain, the more nodes that it has, the more risk it introduces. And that really impacted our ability to lap a very, very strong period that of course included the depletion of all the inventory across the system last quarter three. As we look forward to supply though, we're optimistic. We've made good progress and we anticipate substantial improvement in the next four months. And we plan to be in stock on most businesses in cleaning including wipes by the end of Q1. And what consumers are already experiencing is better than what they've experienced for the months premium to that. They're going to the shelf and they're finding something from Clorox which is good to see. And then we anticipate being fully in stock across our Cleaning business by the end of Q2. So that includes some things like sprays and some of the other items that are still supply constrained. When it comes to market share moving forward, supply is going to help, but the other thing is innovation. And we have a terrific suite of innovation in quarter four that retailers are really excited about. And that includes reintroducing things that we had to put on pause. Scentiva that was a large growth platform for us prior to the pandemic, we are starting to ship that again. Compostable wipes are also back in market again. And we know they had a strong start prior to the pandemic and we'd expect them to continue. And then, we're also going to be expanding our disinfecting floor mopping business that we had started right at the beginning of the pandemic. And we expect broad distribution on that. In addition, we're launching brand-new to the space innovations, including paper towel wipes, a brand-new Clorox non-bleach all-purpose cleaner, and then building off of our electrostatic business, that's already at over $100 million in sales and launching new forms and new chemistries kind of brand-new to the market. So, a great suite of innovation that we're working with retailers on and that's what we're focused on innovation and growing the category. And that's resonated really well.\nNik Modi: That's very helpful. And if I could just -- just one real quick one on vitamins. You talked about you have plans in place. Can you be specific in terms of what exactly you plan to do to kind of turn around the fortunes of that business? Because it seems like the overarching kind of backdrop of that industry is going to look much better than it would have been pre-pandemic just given everyone's focus on self-health and self-care. So any specifics around the strategy would be helpful.\nLinda Rendle: Yes. Nik, why don't I give a little bit of background too? I think that would be helpful then to talk about what we're planning to do just as a backdrop. As Kevin mentioned in his remarks, we bought a bunch of small brands through two acquisitions, three to five years ago. These were small brands very strong in the then fast-growing natural channel. And we expected them to grow consistent with what we're seeing in that broader category, high-single-digits to low-double-digit growth, and of course, getting a shorter time to synergies. The underperformance is related to what we bought. So channel headwinds have been a big component of that. Natural went from plus 8% at the time we bought it to a headwind at negative 5%. And that's only accelerated given the pandemic and what we're seeing in retail consolidation. We're also very heavily weighted in probiotics and that category has been fragmented. It slowed down given the massive amount of people who've been launching probiotics in other forms, in food, et cetera, and then certainly higher competition as people have entered that attractive space. And then, just given the size of the brands that we bought, we realize it's going to take a longer time and more investment to get there. So, what do we do looking to the future? It starts with the fact that we have really good conviction in the strength of the category and the tailwinds that we see from a consumer perspective. Those remain very strong. People are continuing to do things to take care of their health and wellness, and vitamins and supplements are absolutely part of that. So with that, I'll give you what I can talk about in the strategy at a high level and we'll welcome talking about more detail coming up in the future. But what we're really focused on is first making sure that we have the right category knowledge and we feel great about that. We have a better understanding of how the category works and how we need to operate with those small brands in it. We've hired new industry talent that has a lot of experience in this space and they've helped us to get clear on that. And we've refreshed our strategy, and particularly around our portfolio and how we win with those brands moving forward. And so with that, and I know Nik you probably want more details on that, but we'll have more to share later. We fully expect to be able to get to company accretive, sales and profit over the long-term. But we've built in a slow ramp-up period as we think about that, because it's going to take some time to do what we plan to do on these brands and get to a place where they're delivering that type of accretive growth for us as a company.\nNik Modi: Excellent. Thank you, Linda.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks, Nik.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Linda, on the Glad bag pricing comment, when should we see this flow through? I'm assuming that's fiscal 2022 consideration at this point. I'm curious because as you know it will mark about six months that your large competitor took pricing from what I understand. Is that the strategy now to recover some of that share? And any other categories that -- I appreciate that you don't want to come across as being opportunistic. And I know knowing from the benefit that you had from your strong brands and everything to come across as taking price in the middle of pandemic, but now that we are hopefully coming through high vaccination rates, so when do you think is the time to actually take some of the other categories that are also impacted by transportation cost pressures and commodities to be considered to be taking pricing? And one -- also before you can answer. But just so before the as far as I understood like you think that commentary about having the supply chain normalized and having the cleaning products by -- fully on shelf by the end of the calendar second quarter, would we expect also that international and professional the professional business will be normalized? So that's only the cleaning and you still have the work to do to recover share and capacity on these other segments? Thank you.\nLinda Rendle : Thanks. I'll take those in turn and we'll start with the Glad pricing question that you had. So we announced that price increase to the trade in March and it will be effective in July. And as I said previously, we are though looking at given the continued inflation that we're seeing with resin would we want to take an additional action on Glad. And that we're still contemplating and we don't have news to share on timing on that. But the round that we just announced will be effective in July and then it will pass through. And we'll see retailers change prices on shelf as they do that. As it relates to your broader comment on pricing that really is category specific and it has to do with the timing. These businesses have different seasonal aspects to them. They have different promotional plans. They have different innovation plans. And so I don't have any more to share on timing on any of those categories, but I just want you to take away that we are looking at it across every category. We -- but we will be doing this category-by-category and it really has to do with those dynamics that we're experiencing, and of course, the broader plan. And I also want you to take away what we are absolutely doing on every category right now is cost savings and we're going back. We're pleased to be on track to deliver our cost savings target for the year. And we're looking at what other places could we plus that up across all of our businesses. And then of course, innovation is the same. But as we have more news on pricing we'll share it. But at this point it's Glad and news that we're looking at would there be additional action we'd want to take on Glad given what we're seeing in resin. And then as your question on supply chain, professional has some shared supply chain as does a small portion of international with our US retail cleaning business, but they also have components that are completely separate. But they are largely expected to recover on the same timing that we have from retail. Although, international I would say at this point particularly with wipes given we have a dedicated supply chain, we're not at a point that we're constrained in the vast majority of our International businesses because of that dedicated supply chain.\nAndrea Teixeira : And any anticipation of like accelerating the growth into other countries? I think you mentioned I think Lisah mentioned 30 countries already. Is there any ramp up or additional places, or you'd say, right now I got the wipes which is obviously the low-hanging fruit. Now I'm going to offer them sprays or other things that may actually accelerate the international growth?\nLinda Rendle: Yes. As we spoke about at CAGNY against our goal to accelerate long-term profitable growth, and get to that 3% to 5% sales range, we anticipate stronger growth from international. And that really is behind building a global Clorox cleaning brand, which we had to start to, but we think we can help serve more consumers around the world. And the idea would be, of course, wipes is an important part of that portfolio, but really looking broadly across the set of cleaning products that we have, strengthening our innovation across the Clorox brand. And that can include things like sprays, like you mentioned that we would be able to do that. So that's exactly what we're looking at as we enter markets, what's the right product lineup and where can we leverage innovation to expand our presence in those markets behind the Clorox brand.\nAndrea Teixeira: Very useful. Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. Good morning for you guys, I suppose. A question on elasticity, obviously, there's a lot of inflation and pricing is coming through across the board. I know there's a \u2013 you've got quite a strong view and the consumer research suggests an intent for pretty structural changes of use of products in the home and at the home. To what degree, are you worried about the risk of breaking that trend, or do you feel like you have to be careful about maybe there's an opportunity that can be lost if too much pricing is taken? From a cost perspective, it makes perfect sense to take pricing to cover it. But what are you thinking about from an elasticity perspective and how that may change things?\nLinda Rendle: I'll start. When we look at the strength of our brands, we always focus on consumer value as the measure, we look at to determine the strength of our brands and our ability to take pricing, because of course consumer value is composed of the strength of the brand that we have. It's comprised of the product and how people experience that versus competitive products. And of course, pricing is a function of that as well. And we're looking at that triangle that that forms to say, what is the right mix by category by sub-segment to deliver that right value for consumers and we're always trying to optimize that. So we take that into account as we think about it. Given the fact that, we have higher consumer value than we've ever had since we began measuring it that implies, the strength of our brands that they have ability to take price. And as we strengthen our innovation program, as we've leaned in to spend 11% behind our brands this year, and keep them strong that was one of the questions we've got a lot of is, why would you invest during a time when people want your brands already? And it was about building that brand strength and equity over the long-term. So that we have ability to introduce them to new products, as they demand it, and of course take pricing as we need to. So we're taking that into account. I would say, regardless of pricing, these consumer behaviors are here to stay. Consumers have absolutely shown a willingness to pay during this time to keep themselves safe and well through, all of their behaviors whether that be cleaning, drinking more water et cetera. And also as they start to eat at home, we've seen lots of trends around consumers having meal experiences. They've invested in grills, and they've invested in that long-term behavior. So we feel really good about our ability to do both, which is continue to take advantage of the trends that we're seeing, but also price where it's appropriate to recover margin.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Hey guys. Thanks. A couple of questions for me. The first one is just, as we think about the Health and Wellness segment factoring in what you guys are seeing or envisioning as the new normal level of consumption coming out of the pandemic, as well as your improved ability to supply, I guess I'm just trying to gauge, what you think the kind of the average absolute run rate of sales in that segment is likely to be as the new base? You've obviously been running $800 million plus for the last several quarters. And then, this quarter came down below $700 million. And I'm trying to sense, do you think the -- do you think this is the new normal level of consumption? Does it bounce back and meet somewhere in the middle? Just how you're thinking about that as we go forward.\nLinda Rendle: Sure. I think, if you look -- if you -- maybe I'll take a step back and talk about what we're seeing overall and what we've seen in the past because, I think we're operating from a really strong base. I'm not sure, how clear this was in the past. If you take a step back and look at our retail cleaning business, prepandemic that was a place of strength for us. We were growing mid-single digits in both topline and bottom line in the retail cleaning business for a number of years. So if you look at the five-year CAGR prepandemic, that was mid-single digits. So we were starting from a place of strength. And we see that continuing as we move to the future and we see -- building off of that. So if that gives you an idea of what we're thinking about, it will be above the company average is what we're anticipating, given the fact that it's a place where consumer tailwinds are working, where we think innovation is going to play a really big role because consumer needs have changed. And then again, that investment and we've long been investing in the Clorox brand, but we've increased that during this pandemic. And we think it's going to be pretty solid from a behavior perspective, as we move forward as we combine all of those things.\nSteve Powers: Okay. Okay. I can work with that. I guess shifting gears to gross margin. I guess there are two things here. The depth of what I think your guidance implies for the fourth quarter is something like a 600 basis point -- 600-plus basis point contraction in the fourth quarter if my math is correct. You can correct me if it's not. I guess, what I'm -- what I -- coming that's question number one I guess of this. But the second part is just trying to gauge your sense of urgency of building that back. Obviously, you're taking pricing in Glad, looking at pricing elsewhere as you made clear. But are you -- do you would you be satisfied with kind of a more elongated Glad path of margin recovery, or is this something that you're eager to claw back as we think about the first half of '22? I'm just trying to A, size the level of contraction and then B, gauge your sense of urgency in getting it back. \nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, Steve, thanks for the question. Two things. On Q4, we don't provide quarterly guidance but what I can share with you is as we said for the full year we expect our gross margin to be down. For me that's likely about 100 bps on the full year basis. And as we mentioned back in February my expectation is it would be down to a lesser degree. As we've highlighted what's really changed for us is while transportation continues to be a challenging market for us. It's really resin that had the biggest impact really driven by the ice storm we saw back in February. When we talked back in February, during our previous earnings call, I had anticipated about 150 bps headwind from commodities in the back half of the year. I think that's going to be closer to 200 bps now in the back half. And you saw in Q3 in our attachments we provided about 170 bps in Q3. I think it will be higher in Q4. And I think it will probably peak in the front half of fiscal year '22 and then we'll start to see some softening. And so I think that's how it's going to play out this year in the near-term. And then your longer-term question on margin recovery, Linda just mentioned it. We are committed to growing EBIT margins 25 to 50 bps over the long-term. And so we're going to continue to aggressively work towards that goal. And as part of that is the actions we're talking about now as it relates to recovering these cost increases, pricing being one element of that, but we're going to be leaning into cost savings in many other areas as well. We'll work to recover margin. And then maybe last comment Steve that might be helpful. If I provide a broader perspective, if you think about our financial performance where we were before the pandemic at the end of fiscal year 2019 and where we're likely in this year on a two-year stack basis that's about a 100 bps increase in gross margin. And so we'll certainly be challenged this quarter and next quarter. If I take a long-term view we've improved the margins of the company about 100 bps over the last two years. And then as I said earlier, our goal is by the time we get to the back half of fiscal year 2022, we are delivering 3% to 5% sales growth. We're expanding margins. We're delivering earnings growth. So hopefully that gives you some perspective on our desire to quickly move through this challenging environment but make sure we're taking the necessary actions to put us on track for our long-term sales and profit goals in the back half of 2022.\nSteve Powers: No it does. I appreciate it. If I could squeeze in -- just to build on that. I don't think you specified exactly across the Glad portfolio, how impactful this announced price increase is? Is there any quantification you could offer on the actions that you have planned for July? That would be helpful. And then you did something different for Clorox and moving to an adjusted EPS quantification for fiscal 2021. I guess, there's like a -- it sounds like there's a $0.03 to $0.04 amortization charge that is in GAAP, that is not in your adjusted number. And I guess is the intention beyond fiscal 2021 to move to an adjusted, or should we think about as we think about sizing up your fiscal 2022 guidance moving back to GAAP and layering back in that $0.15 for the year? Thank you.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah. Thanks Steve. On the two questions on Glad, I'd tell you think low to mid-single digits pricing action that will take effect in July. And as Linda said we'll evaluate if additional actions are necessary. And then on an adjusted EPS as you said, we introduced it for the first time this quarter. And, Steve, the intent is we really thought this would help as we provide both on a reported GAAP basis, but we also thought adjusted would help our investors as we've had two large noncash charges now. We have the gain in Q1 from our Saudi acquisition and we have the VMS impairment. And so we think giving that additional perspective is helpful. And particularly as you go into fiscal year 2022, continue to use adjusted allows you to have a better understanding of our operational performance as you're able to look past this one-time gain or one-time charge we have this year. So you should expect us to use that going forward.\nSteve Powers: Okay. Thank you so much.\nKevin Jacobsen: Thanks Steve.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: [Technical Difficulty] versus adjusted, because being a GAAP reporter arguably has been a point of pride for the company right and something that you could also argue contributed to the stock valuation over time. And I know that's a very, very high bar to hold yourselves to. But I'm really -- I mean I get that the impairment charge is this big one-off. But if I remember back in last year's fourth quarter when you introduced the guidance and including the JV gain, you specifically talked about it as being offset by tax and FX in the full year earnings growth. And now you're asking us to switch to adjusted just when we would be looking at fiscal 2022 growth rates. So I'm struggling with really being comfortable with that ask, particularly if you believe there's so much going on with the business. It's really positive and constructive that we shouldn't need to be kind of playing these games. So Kevin, I'd really just love further perspective on that decision. \nKevin Jacobsen: Yes. Lauren, I wouldn't agree with playing games that characterization. We think that's helpful additional perspective. So to be clear, we'll continue to provide a reported GAAP basis estimate and we will provide an adjusted estimate as well. And again, we think both numbers are helpful and insightful for investors. We have a very large gain in Q1 and a large charge in Q2. We want to make sure our investors can understand our operational performance.  To your point, Lauren, there's a lot going on operationally. We want to make sure we can help investors understand that as clearly as possible. So setting those two items aside, we think is another insight to our business. It will be helpful. So that's why we introduced it and why we'll continue to use it going forward in '22. So as we look at our '22 performance, you can evaluate that versus our 2021 performance excluding these two items and really understand I think more clearly on an operational basis our performance year-over-year. \nLauren Lieberman: Okay. Thanks. That is very helpful perspective and I appreciate that. And then I did just want to follow-up one more question on market shares. And I know that Nielsen is far from perfect particularly with your strong shares in club and the quick gains you've made in e-commerce over time. But Nielsen does measure something. And when we look at Nielsen, it looks like your share in spray cleaners and in wipes is not just down this year, but is down. If I looked back pre-pandemic that your shares were down pretty considerably, particularly in the spray cleaning category.  So I just would like some further perspective there on whether or not there's been some channel prioritization dynamics, whether or not in hindsight there's a sense that maybe you could have invested more and been more proactive in cleaning historically? Because it feels to me like again just looking at the Nielsen and knowing it's imprecise there's a bit of a hole to dig out of on share that's not really related to during the pandemic supply constraints. Thanks.\nLinda Rendle: Hey, Lauren, I'll take that one. Thanks for the question and try to provide some clarity on this one because I know it's really complex. Maybe taking a step back would help on this one just to get clear on what we experienced in cleaning and what we think we drove pre-pandemic, what we're seeing now, which again we're not satisfied with. And then how we see this playing out over the coming months and years as we get to a more normalized state.  So first big picture, if we step back and look at our retail cleaning business, it's actually been a great area of strength for us. I mentioned a little earlier that, we had strong growth. So if you look at the five-year CAGR pre-pandemic, we grew that business mid-single digits both top and bottom line. And that corresponded to an overall share increase in home care of two points from fiscal year '13 through 2019. So that was something that we've been investing in. We had been really trying to expand the Clorox brand. We had a strong focus on innovation. We have launched Scentiva during that time. We had done improvements on a broad range of our portfolio. So it's been a nice area of strength for us.  I think as you dive into the individual segments, Lauren, you do get to what you said which is there are ups and downs. And sprays is an incredibly complex fragmented category. So while we were winning in a lot of the particular segments that we are strong in, it could be true that in other ones we weren't. And we have a very strong spray business to your point outside of track channels, which is about 50% of our business. So -- in aggregate. So we -- I feel like we walked into this pandemic in a strong way from a Clorox perspective. There's always work to be done in individual segments as you highlighted. But overall, we were winning in Home Care. And as we look to the future I think a lot of those elements are going to continue to resonate, but we're going to ramp them up. One, the strength of that Clorox brand. It's why we've invested so much this year behind that and increased the spending. We're on track to spend across the company another $125 million in advertising and sales promotion this year, why we've ramped up innovation. And I mentioned the innovations that are worth repeating; reintroducing Scentiva, compostable wipes are back on shelf; disinfecting floor mop costs, which is a brand-new incremental category for us to compete in; having new offerings in Clorox sprays that aren't bleach and that's a first for us as well as paper towel wipes and then broadly expanding against our new electrostatic business that we really created from nothing a number of years ago with some partnership. So I feel terrific about what we have in place to continue to meet consumer needs. I am not happy Lauren with where we are share-wise. None of us are, but we feel confident in our ability to get back into that share growth as supply continues, again which is the majority of the issue. But we're laser-focused on that consumer value metric innovation and investing behind the Clorox brand. \nLauren Lieberman: Okay. Linda, thanks. I really appreciate that.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks, Lauren.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. \nLinda Rendle: Kevin?\nKevin Grundy: A bit. But -- so for your outlook now specifically advertising and marketing still 11% of sales, including 12% in the back half of the year. I think as you guys are well aware both of those are historical highs as far as I have going back this is a decade. So on a full year basis on a six-month basis, was there any thought at all about pulling back as commodity costs move higher? I suspect the answer is not a lot given a lot of the discussion around market share, but maybe you can comment on that? And then just confidence on ROI behind the spend given a lot of the volatility that exists around consumption, et cetera. The context here understanding supply-chain constraints have been a problem and one that you're trying to address, but I'm sure the hope would be in principle that market share would be in a better place with advertising and marketing your historical levels. That's probably not going out of much of a limb. And then maybe just, sort of, tying this up longer term is 11% the right number? We don't have to go back very far. And it was 9% of sales. Is it possible this comes in it comes back to 9% which is not, sort of, permanently in the P&L. So maybe some comments there which I suspect you're not making that sort of decision in a vacuum. It's going to be where is market share and whether you're satisfied with it. But not to belabor this because I feel like we've spoken on a lot of it but anything you feel in that would be incremental, would be helpful? Thank you.\nLinda Rendle: Sure, Kevin. 11% for this year was something we had a lot of passion and conviction on given the fact that we're seeing so many people enter our brands. And we wanted to create that loyal consumer base moving forward. And we wanted to give them the right product information that they needed during such a trying time for everybody, but also give them new solutions as people had different challenges to solve. And innovation and advertising play a really important role in that. So for this year, we are on track to spend 11% as you highlighted and we have a strong spend coming up here in Q4. And that is behind the new innovations that we've launched. And I think you'll recall probably from previous conversations that our goal was to double the amount of advertising we spent on innovation this year to welcome people into those new product experiences and create loyalty and trial. As we look forward -- and let me comment on ROI, before I say we move forward. That's something that we're tracking real-time and getting information and insights on. And what I can say is the ROI continues to be very strong and that's why we continue to spend, and we're seeing it translate into results from a consumer-metric perspective. So continue to have incredibly high household penetration. We have household penetration gains across a number of our categories. We're seeing loyalty strengthen. So retention rates growing, repeat rates growing on both core users and new users. We're seeing consumers buying larger quantities more often. So all of the things that we would attribute to to long-term consumer metrics that show the health of the brand, the advertising drives, we're seeing that not only just the strong ROI but those metrics increase that are important to us to talk about loyalty. As we move forward, we don't have a prescribed number whether it be 10% 11%. But what I can say is we're committed to investing in our brands. And we'll continue to optimize what that right level of spending is depending on exactly like you highlighted market shares, depending on the innovation programs we have. But what you should hear from us is we will continue to invest in our brands. And we'll \u2013 as we update and give you a perspective for 2022 and beyond, we'll communicate what that exact number looks like. But you heard our continued commitment to advertising as a strong lever to help us get to our 3% to 5% over the long term.\nKevin Grundy: Very good. Thanks and good luck.\nLinda Rendle: Thank you.\nOperator: And your final question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. And it appears his line disconnected.\nLinda Rendle: Jason one more time. He's not there at all, operator? No? \nOperator: His line disconnected.\nLinda Rendle: Okay. That's the final question?\nOperator: Yes.\nLinda Rendle: Very good. All right. Thanks again, everyone. We look forward to speaking to you again on our next call in August. Until then, please stay well.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kevin Jacobsen",
            "content": "Thank you, Lisah, and thank you everyone for joining us today. We hope you and your families are well. Before I review our third quarter results, let me first address the non-cash impairment charge we reported today. The Better Health, Vitamins Minerals and Supplements business, represents about 4% of total company sales, comprising several small brands, we acquired in two separate transactions. Performance on this business has not delivered on our expectations. The impairment was a result of our updated valuation, which assumes lower sales and profit projections versus our initial expectations at the time of the acquisition, primarily driven by an increased level of competitive activity and the need for more investments to scale these small brands. As a result of our updated valuation, we record a pretax non-cash impairment charge of $329 to lower the carrying values of goodwill, trademarks and other assets of the Vitamin, Mineral and Supplement business unit. Net of a deferred tax benefit of $62 million associated with this impairment, we recorded a $267 million charge to net income or $2.11 per share. This represents about 27% of its initial purchase price. Going forward, we are implementing our refreshed portfolio strategy. We continue to believe in the attractiveness of the VMS space, driven by strong consumer tailwinds and the strategic fit, given our focus on health and wellness. Importantly, we fully expect that our VMS business will be a meaningful contributor to our company results over time. To ensure clarity around the underlying operating performance of our overall business, my comments on the third quarter results will exclude the impact of this non-cash impairment. In addition, my comments will exclude the impact of a onetime non-cash gain related to our Saudi joint venture acquisition. It's important to note, that while the Saudi joint venture is expected to contribute $0.45 to $0.50 to our reported EPS, it includes a $0.60 non-cash gain that we're excluding from our adjusted EPS outlook. Moving forward, in our fiscal year adjusted EPS 2021 outlook, we are continuing to include $0.10 to $0.15 charge, primarily from an ongoing intangible amortization related to the acquisition. Before I review our third quarter results, I'll comment briefly on our fiscal year outlook. As you saw in our press release, we've confirmed our fiscal year sales outlook and provided an adjusted EPS outlook, which excludes a non-cash impact from the VMS impairment in the third quarter, as well as a one-time non-cash gain of the Saudi joint venture acquisition in the first quarter. For perspective, excluding these items, help provide clarity around our underlying operational performance, which is unchanged from our previous outlook. Importantly I'm pleased we're on track to deliver another strong year for our shareholders, targeting a two-year stack of about 19% sales growth, well above our historical financial performance. Now, turning to our third quarter results. Third quarter sales were flat, in comparison to 15% growth in the year-ago quarter, when we saw the initial spike from COVID-19. Our sales results reflect a 5-point decline in organic volume, offset by 4 points of favorable price/mix and 1 point benefit from our Saudi joint venture acquisition. On an organic basis, third quarter sales declined 1%. Our sales results came in largely as expected, although there's certainly variability across our portfolio, which reflects a very dynamic environment we continue to navigate. Importantly, we grew sales in six out of our 10 businesses. Gross margin for the quarter decreased 320 basis points to 43.5%, compared to 46.7% for the year-ago quarter. Gross margin results reflect a pronounced inflationary environment, resulting in 360 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs, including temporary COVID-19 spending, as well as 170 basis points of higher commodity costs, primarily related to the rising cost of resin, partially impacted by the extreme weather events we experienced in the Southern US earlier this quarter. Gross margin also reflects 100 basis points of negative impact from lower volume in the quarter. These factors are partially offset by 140 basis points of favorable trade promotion and 110 basis points of cost savings. Selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, came in at 13.3%, compared to 15.1% in the year-ago quarter reflecting lower incentive compensation expenses, primarily related to the non-cash impairment on the VMS business. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels, as a percentage of sales, came in at 11%, reflecting continued strong investments across our portfolio, with U.S. spending at about 12% of sales, to support a robust innovation program in the back half of the fiscal year. Our third quarter effective tax rate was negative 1.4%, driven by the impairment charge we took on our VMS business. Excluding the impairment charge, our third quarter tax rate was 23%, compared to 19% in the year-ago quarter, as we lap excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation. Net of all these factors, adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter came in at $1.62 versus $1.89 in the year-ago quarter, a decline of 14%. As you also saw in our press release, year-to-date net cash provided by operations was $893 million versus $806 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 11%. Our strong cash flow was due to profitable sales growth, partially offset by higher tax payments and higher employee incentive compensation payments. Turning to our updated fiscal year outlook. We continue to anticipate fiscal year sales to grow between 10% to 13%, reflecting the strength of our first half results and our ongoing assumptions for moderating demand over the balance of the fiscal year as we move beyond the peak of the pandemic in the US and lap exceptional prior year comparisons.  Our assumptions for one point of contribution from our Saudi joint venture offset by one point of foreign exchange headwinds remain the same. On an organic sales basis, our outlook continues to assume 10% to 13% growth. We now expect fiscal year gross margin to be down due to a more pronounced headwinds from elevated commodity and transportation costs.  We now expect fiscal year selling and administrative expenses to come in below 14% of sales reflecting lower incentive compensation costs primarily due to our third quarter non-cash impairment on our VMS business.  Additionally, we continue to anticipate fiscal year advertising spending to be about 11% of sales, reflecting our ongoing assumption to spend about 12% in the back half to support our innovation program. For perspective, this fiscal year, we're planning to spend about $125 million more versus a year ago to ensure we're leaning into engaging consumers to build lifetime loyalty to our brands.  We continue to expect our fiscal year tax rate on a reported and adjusted basis to be between 21% and 22%. Net of these factors, we anticipate fiscal year adjusted EPS to be between $7.45 and $7.65 or 1% to 4% growth, reflecting the continued assumptions I mentioned last quarter, including strong top line performance partially offset by an increasingly elevated cost environment.  In closing, I'd like to note that as we transition from the peak of the pandemic in the US, we're navigating a highly dynamic operating environment with the following factors that can influence our results in the near to medium-term. First, category dynamics and consumption trends. As more people get vaccinated and become increasingly mobile in the US, although we recognize different markets are in varying stages of pandemic, we're keeping an eye on short-term changes in these trends as they could cause variability in our top line.  That said longer-term, we believe our portfolio will continue to play a meaningful role in addressing consumer megatrends that have accelerated over the last 12 months, which will contribute to higher demand for our products relative to demand levels prior to the pandemic.  Second, more pronounced cost headwinds, which we'll plan to navigate with all the tools in our toolkit including opportunities for pricing in key areas of our portfolio. And third, increased production capacity to support ongoing elevated demand. This remains a key priority for us as our teams continue to look for every opportunity to expand our production capacity, while recognizing the ongoing volatility this creates on our extended supply chain.  And finally, I'll reinforce that we're on track to deliver another strong year for our shareholders, while keeping our sights set on the long-term. As you saw in February, we raised our long-term annual sales target to 3% to 5%.  Based on the early success of our IGNITE strategy and our continued plans to lean in even further with strong investments behind our brands, people, technology, production capacity and of course, our new growth opportunities where we believe we have a right to win. These efforts are all in service of our broader ambition to accelerate profitable growth, to create long-term value for our shareholders.  And with that I'll turn it over to Linda. Hi, Dara. Sure Dara. And let me start with your first question, or as you mentioned we raised our long-term sales goal of 3% to 5% back in February. In terms of the timing that's part of our IGNITE strategy, which runs through 2025. And Dara how I see that playing out as we talked back in February and we have the same point of view, we expect our sales to be roughly flat in the back half of the year. And that's consistent with Q3. And as we get into fiscal year 2022, our expectation is we're going to be by the back half of the year back to our long-term raised sales outlook at 3% to 5%. So as you know, we've got some tough comps here for the next three quarters. But as we get through those comps by January, we were at this new elevated level. And that's really as we work through the next phase of this pandemic as we see higher vaccination rates, more mobility, we fully expect that we'll see a slowdown in demand for products that's expected. When we get to that new normalized level, we think we're back at this 3% to 5% rate going forward. Sure. Hey Chris maybe I'll start and I'll turn it over to Linda as well. On your first question in regard to the impact of pricing, I'd tell you it's too early for us to start providing perspective. We're right in the middle right now of building our plans for fiscal year 2022. And as Linda said we're going to be looking at a number of different levers in terms of how we're going to work to offset the transportation and commodity cost increases we're seeing. Pricing will certainly be one of those levers but we'll be looking at a number of others as well. So, we'll update you on that one as we get further along with our plans in August. In regard to International just a perspective of International as you may have seen volume was down. I think it's worth noting we feel very good about the progress we're making on our cleaning and disinfecting work. And as Lisa mentioned in her prepared remarks, we continue to expand the number of countries we're introducing wipes into and we've added 30 countries now. Specifically, though in the third quarter, one of the challenges we had was in Canada. While we saw growth pretty broadly across our portfolio in Canada and if you're tracking that region, you may know they are now in their third lockdown. And in the Canadian market it's a little different than the US, in their lockdowns for items that are deemed non-essential. If you go into a retail outlet, in many cases, those aisles are blocked off where you can't shop them. And so as an example in third quarter we grew our cleaning and disinfecting business in Canada, but we saw pretty significant declines in other parts of our business. Our Brita business was down over 30%. Our Burt's Bees business is also down by a similar amount because consumers are not able to shop those aisles. Now, right now the lockdown they've announced goes through May 20th. So that has some knock-on effect as we move into our fourth quarter. But we expect as we get out of that lockdown, those businesses will rebound. But by and large, we feel very good about the progress on our cleaning and disinfecting portfolio internationally. And then Linda will talk a little bit about our professional business. Yes, Steve, thanks for the question. Two things. On Q4, we don't provide quarterly guidance but what I can share with you is as we said for the full year we expect our gross margin to be down. For me that's likely about 100 bps on the full year basis. And as we mentioned back in February my expectation is it would be down to a lesser degree. As we've highlighted what's really changed for us is while transportation continues to be a challenging market for us. It's really resin that had the biggest impact really driven by the ice storm we saw back in February. When we talked back in February, during our previous earnings call, I had anticipated about 150 bps headwind from commodities in the back half of the year. I think that's going to be closer to 200 bps now in the back half. And you saw in Q3 in our attachments we provided about 170 bps in Q3. I think it will be higher in Q4. And I think it will probably peak in the front half of fiscal year '22 and then we'll start to see some softening. And so I think that's how it's going to play out this year in the near-term. And then your longer-term question on margin recovery, Linda just mentioned it. We are committed to growing EBIT margins 25 to 50 bps over the long-term. And so we're going to continue to aggressively work towards that goal. And as part of that is the actions we're talking about now as it relates to recovering these cost increases, pricing being one element of that, but we're going to be leaning into cost savings in many other areas as well. We'll work to recover margin. And then maybe last comment Steve that might be helpful. If I provide a broader perspective, if you think about our financial performance where we were before the pandemic at the end of fiscal year 2019 and where we're likely in this year on a two-year stack basis that's about a 100 bps increase in gross margin. And so we'll certainly be challenged this quarter and next quarter. If I take a long-term view we've improved the margins of the company about 100 bps over the last two years. And then as I said earlier, our goal is by the time we get to the back half of fiscal year 2022, we are delivering 3% to 5% sales growth. We're expanding margins. We're delivering earnings growth. So hopefully that gives you some perspective on our desire to quickly move through this challenging environment but make sure we're taking the necessary actions to put us on track for our long-term sales and profit goals in the back half of 2022. Yeah. Thanks Steve. On the two questions on Glad, I'd tell you think low to mid-single digits pricing action that will take effect in July. And as Linda said we'll evaluate if additional actions are necessary. And then on an adjusted EPS as you said, we introduced it for the first time this quarter. And, Steve, the intent is we really thought this would help as we provide both on a reported GAAP basis, but we also thought adjusted would help our investors as we've had two large noncash charges now. We have the gain in Q1 from our Saudi acquisition and we have the VMS impairment. And so we think giving that additional perspective is helpful. And particularly as you go into fiscal year 2022, continue to use adjusted allows you to have a better understanding of our operational performance as you're able to look past this one-time gain or one-time charge we have this year. So you should expect us to use that going forward. Thanks Steve. Yes. Lauren, I wouldn't agree with playing games that characterization. We think that's helpful additional perspective. So to be clear, we'll continue to provide a reported GAAP basis estimate and we will provide an adjusted estimate as well. And again, we think both numbers are helpful and insightful for investors. We have a very large gain in Q1 and a large charge in Q2. We want to make sure our investors can understand our operational performance.  To your point, Lauren, there's a lot going on operationally. We want to make sure we can help investors understand that as clearly as possible. So setting those two items aside, we think is another insight to our business. It will be helpful. So that's why we introduced it and why we'll continue to use it going forward in '22. So as we look at our '22 performance, you can evaluate that versus our 2021 performance excluding these two items and really understand I think more clearly on an operational basis our performance year-over-year."

            "name": "Linda Rendle",
            "content": "Thanks, Kevin. Hello, everyone and thank you for being with us today. I hope you are all well. A year ago around this time when the pandemic spiked in the US, we knew we were facing unchartered territory. And as I look back at how we've managed our business to support our consumers, retail partners and communities over the last 12 months what makes me proud is that we stayed true to three things.  We embraced our role as a health and wellness company, which helped us prioritize our actions, including ensuring the safety of our people and emphasizing our support for health care workers. We put people at the center taking care of our teammates around the world and staying the course in doing everything we could to serve public health and consumer needs. We were led by our values, with our commitment to do the right thing guiding our strategic choices and actions. Out of all of this, our purpose became clearer. We champion people to be well and thrive every single day. With this in mind, here's what's important for you to take away from today's call. First, our business is well positioned for the future. I'm grateful our consumers have rewarded our team's dedication to serving people and communities around the world. Our business is significantly larger than it was before the pandemic. People have turned to our trusted brands for support, during an incredibly tough year, and Clorox has the most trusted brands in many categories. We see this play out in strong household penetration across our portfolio, with our brands in 90% of US households. We continue to see strong repeat rates across our brands among core and new users versus last year. And as Lisah mentioned, we continue to focus on retaining this larger base of loyal consumers. And of course, this is showing up in our results, including flat sales in comparison to a very strong base in the year-ago quarter. For perspective, it's worth noting that we delivered a two-year stack of 15% total company sales growth in the third quarter. And as Kevin mentioned, we're on track to hit a two-year stack of about 19% sales growth for the fiscal year. My second message is that, we have strategic plans in place to address near-term priorities as we continue to navigate in a very dynamic environment. First, there's more work to be done on improving supply, especially after weather-related disruptions in the third quarter and higher-than-anticipated demand in certain parts of our portfolio. We're pulling every lever available to us to improve supply, including working with third-party supply sources as we continue to run flat out. I'm encouraged by our progress, but our overall supply chain remains a top priority focus for us. Next, we fully acknowledge that market shares for key brands are not where we want them to be. That said, share declines are primarily driven by recent supply challenges. And as we continue to improve supply capacity, we expect to recover market share. We feel good about seeing continued strong consumption and demand across our portfolio relative to pre-pandemic levels. And as Kevin discussed, we're facing stronger cost pressures from critical input costs and a tightening transportation market. One of the four key choices in our IGNITE strategy is to generate fuel to support growth and mitigate inflation. We're taking a holistic approach to address these cost pressures by leveraging a number of tools to support our margins, including margin accretive innovation, net revenue management, pricing through trade reduction, and less price increases and as always a relentless focus on cost savings. My last message is this. With conviction in our purpose and guided by a strategy that makes the most of our strength, we continue to have our sights set on our ambition to accelerate long-term profitable growth. In the past year, we learned that by putting people at the center our IGNITE strategy has helped us to do what we do best, serve people who count on our brands. And we continue to have an opportunity to serve even more people around the world. And as we think about our future, our strategy is proving to be particularly relevant as it leverages significant consumer megatrends that have accelerated because of the pandemic. The latest research still tells us that consumer routines and behaviors formed during the pandemic are expected to persist, including prioritizing health and hygiene, drinking more water, taking vitamins and supplements and spending more time online. What's more the role of home has changed. With many companies pursuing hybrid models for their workforce, we expect more cleaning, more meal occasions and more trash to be generated at home. Our portfolio continues to be in a unique position to play a meaningful role in people's lives and we have every intention of accelerating new growth opportunities to support these trends. Moving forward, we're leaning into our IGNITE strategy with innovation remaining core to our key areas of strength. That means; innovating in our products, especially, larger stickier innovation platforms that deliver superior consumer value and multiyear growth for our business; innovating in consumer and shopper engagement; personalizing experiences for consumers so that we get to know 100 million people by the year 2025; and partnering with our retailers on category vision and leadership to support healthy and profitable categories. The turnaround of our Kingsford business is a great example of how our focus on innovation is contributing significantly to strong category and brand growth. Innovating how we work across the organization through technology that makes us smarter, work faster and in the case of our supply chain enables us to respond more quickly to future demand spikes. And finally, innovating through an ESG lens because we believe in the strategic link between our societal impact and long-term value creation. Here are some highlights in the last quarter. We're 21% of the way toward our goal to reduce virgin plastic and fiber packaging by 50% by 2030. We've achieved 76% of our 100% goal for recyclable, reusable or compostable packaging by 2025. We're introducing a company-wide learning and development program focused on sustainability because ESG integration in our business not only means embedding it in every brand, but also rallying every person behind our efforts. And with ESG embedded into our operations, our brands are not only contributing to our corporate ESG goals, but they're also pursuing meaningful goals that matter to their consumers. As an example by 2030, Brita has a goal to provide clean water access to 0.5 million people in the US facing poor-quality tap water. This speaks to the heart of Brita's brand purpose. Before I open it up for questions, I'd like to echo the important takeaways Lisah mentioned at the beginning of the call. First, we're on track for another strong year. Second, we'll seize the opportunity before us to accelerate long-term profitable growth. Third, our IGNITE strategy has proven its relevance in the face of the pandemic by putting people at the center, emphasizing innovation and leveraging technology to lay the groundwork for the future. Operator, you may now open the line for questions. Sure. I'll take that one. I'll start maybe with the big picture on what we're seeing as definitely tailwinds for us and we mentioned some of this in the script but with a little bit more color. We're definitely seeing consumer behavior trend sticky as we look over the mid to long-term. We're seeing hygiene continue to be that cornerstone of health for folks. And even as people are getting vaccinated and mobility is starting to increase, we're seeing people embrace those new cleaning behaviors as new routines. And they're both doing that inside and out of the home. In the business case, we're still seeing the need for higher disinfection as they welcome people back. But the issue has been depending on the market you're in and certainly we're seeing that in the U.S. mobility has not really increased the point where businesses are fully at capacity yet or even open in many cases. So we're seeing that both as a long-term headwind but as a short-term impact definitely to Q3. And we're looking to the future quarters to see how mobility will improve. I think the other things that we continue to see around people taking care of their health and wellness are persisting. We have a new installed base, for example, with Brita with a lot of people who purchased pitchers over the last period and we're seeing them continue with filter sales in their quest to be healthier and you take on good habits. Digital continues to persist and we think that will be a tailwind for our business as we've invested as you well-know more in digital marketing than the average in our industry leaning into that trend already. And then, of course, our strong position in e-com that we've built over many years and we continue to see that accelerate. And that's up to 14% of our business year-to-date. And then, the role of home continues to be a tailwind. And that was above our expectations in quarter three for sure. But we're seeing people persist, even as people have more mobility, people are eating more at home. And that what hasn't really changed at all, as people who were working from home during the pandemic are continuing to work from home. So we see that in our impact whether that be on our Kingsford business, on our Hidden Valley Ranch business or our trash business there's definitely positivity to that stay-at-home trend. So I think all of those are going to be tailwinds, as we look to the coming months and in the long-term. From a headwind perspective, supply chain has continued to be a challenge. And what we've done is gone after a tremendous amount of sales. We're a much bigger company than we were pre-pandemic. And that means that we have increased the complexity in our supply chain. We have a lot more nodes. We have a lot more third parties helping us. And then, what didn't help this quarter, of course were the weather disruptions that we experienced that caused quite a few force majeures in our products. And although we were managed -- able to manage through it, and deliver our overall commitment from a quarter three perspective, it's something we're watching really closely to see any volatility we have. But the supply chain being more expanded, continues to be something that we're watching, continues to be something that could be a help or a hinder as we look forward. Absolutely, so as Kevin highlighted and Lisah highlighted in their scripts, absolutely seeing the inflationary pressure, as I think the entire ecosystem is now across our industry and from a retailer perspective as well. And what we have our sights set on is how, do we get to that long-term EBIT margin goal we have of 25 basis points to 50 basis points, from an accretion perspective. And the way we approach it, is very holistic. We're looking across a robust toolbox to address this, things like margin accretive innovation. And we have a terrific innovation program, that started at the beginning of this year and is continuing as we launch incremental innovations in Q4, net revenue management, pricing and that will include both, list price increases and trade reductions. And then, of course, our relentless focus on cost savings. So we're employing that entire toolbox right now, across all of our businesses. And we're coming from a place of strength in this. Our brands are strong right now. We have never had a higher consumer value measure. Household penetration is strong. We're seeing strong repeats. So we're feeling confident in that. And we're evaluating our ability to take price across all businesses. But I'll tell you, we will be very surgical and targeted in this. We're going category-by-category because we're -- of course we're weighing the broader environment. And we want to be measured in that. But I -- the message I want you to hear is we're looking at it very broadly across our portfolio. And what we're really focused on is executing by category with excellence. Thanks Chris. I'll start. So we have confidence in our brands and the strength right now and that is absolutely inclusive of Glad. And all of the investment that we put in, in terms of incremental advertising, what we put in from an innovation perspective and how consumers have turned to our brands during this time, continue to give us confidence in our ability to take pricing. I think what we're also seeing this time versus what we saw last time is a broader inflationary environment that really is pretty systemic throughout the industry and what everyone is experiencing. So as you mentioned, we've seen competitors move in categories like Glad. I think Glad in particular, I'll just highlight we have already come up with that price increase that's effective in July. But given the volatility and the increases we're seeing in the resin market, we are looking at will we take even additional pricing in Glad based on what we've seen. So again we want to be -- let the cost pressures guide us. We're doing this for the mid to long term but we're seeing extraordinary circumstances in resin right now that are helping us to go faster on Glad. What you should take away on the other brands is not that we are not looking at with price increases. We look at that -- first of all we do that annually as a company to understand our position. But right at this moment, we're looking at that. But what I want you to hear is the way that we do that across the brands needs to be holistic. So some will include those price increases, others will not. And what you'll hear us apply to every business is cost savings. You'll hear us think about how we can have margin accretive innovation across every business, but less price increases we'll be very targeted on, but again evaluating across our entire portfolio. And I think from an on-shelf and a retailer perspective, we're working on category growth plans with them. And we're lapping a very strong period of growth. And as you think about the lower promotion question, what we're trying to do is get to a more normalized state of promotion. And it's still although accelerated versus where it was in Q2, it's still well below pre-pandemic levels. And as we lap that growth there's little incentive to put a bunch of deep discounting out in the system and we're working on growth plans. So that's how we're thinking about the lower promotions in the context of the environment, is that we all have strong growth to lap. And of course, we want to make sure that consumers that we continue to lean into them and invest behind the tailwinds. And that could mean a lower promotional environment. So we're watching that closely and again it will depend on the category. But the overall sentiment would be, keeping it as rational as we can and using promotion for what it's intended for to drive trial and to get consumers to keep us curious. Yes. I think professional is a unique part of our portfolio because it really is tied very heavily to mobility. And if you think about this, it has to really do with the comparison period. So, last quarter three, businesses hadn't shut down by the -- in that point even though we saw consumer takeaway in the retail side for the most part businesses were open. So, we had a very strong comparison period to lap. And in contrast to that this quarter most businesses continue to remain closed. And you have to recall too we have a very established business when it comes to professional. This is not just about the new opportunities, but we've been cleaning these businesses for years and years. It's about 7% of the company before this growing strongly mid-single to high single-digits and so that really had an impact. And I think if you look broader across the professional space, not just ours, they're seeing the same trends broadly in that industry. But if you take a step back the trends continue. The partners that we've had as we brought on in the new out-of-home space continue to see the benefits of offering their guests a clean and disinfected space branded by Clorox and we continue to expand those partnerships and bring new ones on. The two-year stack on this business is up 17% so very strong growth on top of strong growth for many years. And we continue to have conviction in the long term. The reality is consumers need that reassurance that spaces are clean. We know businesses want to provide that to them so they can get back to growing again. And we have a terrific new suite of innovation that we're excited about that's coming in quarter four including expanding our electrostatic sprayer business with both new forms and chemistries. So feel really good about the long term of this business. There's a lot of noise in the short term, as most of the professional spaces out there have encountered, but no change to our outlook for the future. Sure Nik. Just starting with disinfecting, we continue to see really strong behavior changes from consumers. But we did anticipate to experience as people became vaccinated behavior is changing. And we did see that curve move up slightly. So as people got vaccinated, it just happened a little earlier. And frankly, vaccines happened earlier than we had anticipated. So that's normal. We expected that as we go forward. But the key takeaway is versus prepandemic levels cleaning behaviors are still significantly elevated. And we continue to expect them to be into the future. And we're hearing that from consumers. We're seeing that in their buying habits and continue to feel confident about our ability to -- for these growth areas in cleaning and disinfecting to get us to our 3% to 5% growth rate moving forward. I think as it particularly comes to market share, just to be really clear, we are not happy. Whether it be supply related et cetera, we want to grow share. And that is our goal and we want to do that over the mid- to long term. This really does have -- it's primarily driven with supply, particularly in cleaning and disinfecting. Not only did we have the weather-related issues, but as we talked about the more that we expand our supply chain, the more nodes that it has, the more risk it introduces. And that really impacted our ability to lap a very, very strong period that of course included the depletion of all the inventory across the system last quarter three. As we look forward to supply though, we're optimistic. We've made good progress and we anticipate substantial improvement in the next four months. And we plan to be in stock on most businesses in cleaning including wipes by the end of Q1. And what consumers are already experiencing is better than what they've experienced for the months premium to that. They're going to the shelf and they're finding something from Clorox which is good to see. And then we anticipate being fully in stock across our Cleaning business by the end of Q2. So that includes some things like sprays and some of the other items that are still supply constrained. When it comes to market share moving forward, supply is going to help, but the other thing is innovation. And we have a terrific suite of innovation in quarter four that retailers are really excited about. And that includes reintroducing things that we had to put on pause. Scentiva that was a large growth platform for us prior to the pandemic, we are starting to ship that again. Compostable wipes are also back in market again. And we know they had a strong start prior to the pandemic and we'd expect them to continue. And then, we're also going to be expanding our disinfecting floor mopping business that we had started right at the beginning of the pandemic. And we expect broad distribution on that. In addition, we're launching brand-new to the space innovations, including paper towel wipes, a brand-new Clorox non-bleach all-purpose cleaner, and then building off of our electrostatic business, that's already at over $100 million in sales and launching new forms and new chemistries kind of brand-new to the market. So, a great suite of innovation that we're working with retailers on and that's what we're focused on innovation and growing the category. And that's resonated really well. Yes. Nik, why don't I give a little bit of background too? I think that would be helpful then to talk about what we're planning to do just as a backdrop. As Kevin mentioned in his remarks, we bought a bunch of small brands through two acquisitions, three to five years ago. These were small brands very strong in the then fast-growing natural channel. And we expected them to grow consistent with what we're seeing in that broader category, high-single-digits to low-double-digit growth, and of course, getting a shorter time to synergies. The underperformance is related to what we bought. So channel headwinds have been a big component of that. Natural went from plus 8% at the time we bought it to a headwind at negative 5%. And that's only accelerated given the pandemic and what we're seeing in retail consolidation. We're also very heavily weighted in probiotics and that category has been fragmented. It slowed down given the massive amount of people who've been launching probiotics in other forms, in food, et cetera, and then certainly higher competition as people have entered that attractive space. And then, just given the size of the brands that we bought, we realize it's going to take a longer time and more investment to get there. So, what do we do looking to the future? It starts with the fact that we have really good conviction in the strength of the category and the tailwinds that we see from a consumer perspective. Those remain very strong. People are continuing to do things to take care of their health and wellness, and vitamins and supplements are absolutely part of that. So with that, I'll give you what I can talk about in the strategy at a high level and we'll welcome talking about more detail coming up in the future. But what we're really focused on is first making sure that we have the right category knowledge and we feel great about that. We have a better understanding of how the category works and how we need to operate with those small brands in it. We've hired new industry talent that has a lot of experience in this space and they've helped us to get clear on that. And we've refreshed our strategy, and particularly around our portfolio and how we win with those brands moving forward. And so with that, and I know Nik you probably want more details on that, but we'll have more to share later. We fully expect to be able to get to company accretive, sales and profit over the long-term. But we've built in a slow ramp-up period as we think about that, because it's going to take some time to do what we plan to do on these brands and get to a place where they're delivering that type of accretive growth for us as a company. Thanks, Nik. Thanks. I'll take those in turn and we'll start with the Glad pricing question that you had. So we announced that price increase to the trade in March and it will be effective in July. And as I said previously, we are though looking at given the continued inflation that we're seeing with resin would we want to take an additional action on Glad. And that we're still contemplating and we don't have news to share on timing on that. But the round that we just announced will be effective in July and then it will pass through. And we'll see retailers change prices on shelf as they do that. As it relates to your broader comment on pricing that really is category specific and it has to do with the timing. These businesses have different seasonal aspects to them. They have different promotional plans. They have different innovation plans. And so I don't have any more to share on timing on any of those categories, but I just want you to take away that we are looking at it across every category. We -- but we will be doing this category-by-category and it really has to do with those dynamics that we're experiencing, and of course, the broader plan. And I also want you to take away what we are absolutely doing on every category right now is cost savings and we're going back. We're pleased to be on track to deliver our cost savings target for the year. And we're looking at what other places could we plus that up across all of our businesses. And then of course, innovation is the same. But as we have more news on pricing we'll share it. But at this point it's Glad and news that we're looking at would there be additional action we'd want to take on Glad given what we're seeing in resin. And then as your question on supply chain, professional has some shared supply chain as does a small portion of international with our US retail cleaning business, but they also have components that are completely separate. But they are largely expected to recover on the same timing that we have from retail. Although, international I would say at this point particularly with wipes given we have a dedicated supply chain, we're not at a point that we're constrained in the vast majority of our International businesses because of that dedicated supply chain. Yes. As we spoke about at CAGNY against our goal to accelerate long-term profitable growth, and get to that 3% to 5% sales range, we anticipate stronger growth from international. And that really is behind building a global Clorox cleaning brand, which we had to start to, but we think we can help serve more consumers around the world. And the idea would be, of course, wipes is an important part of that portfolio, but really looking broadly across the set of cleaning products that we have, strengthening our innovation across the Clorox brand. And that can include things like sprays, like you mentioned that we would be able to do that. So that's exactly what we're looking at as we enter markets, what's the right product lineup and where can we leverage innovation to expand our presence in those markets behind the Clorox brand. I'll start. When we look at the strength of our brands, we always focus on consumer value as the measure, we look at to determine the strength of our brands and our ability to take pricing, because of course consumer value is composed of the strength of the brand that we have. It's comprised of the product and how people experience that versus competitive products. And of course, pricing is a function of that as well. And we're looking at that triangle that that forms to say, what is the right mix by category by sub-segment to deliver that right value for consumers and we're always trying to optimize that. So we take that into account as we think about it. Given the fact that, we have higher consumer value than we've ever had since we began measuring it that implies, the strength of our brands that they have ability to take price. And as we strengthen our innovation program, as we've leaned in to spend 11% behind our brands this year, and keep them strong that was one of the questions we've got a lot of is, why would you invest during a time when people want your brands already? And it was about building that brand strength and equity over the long-term. So that we have ability to introduce them to new products, as they demand it, and of course take pricing as we need to. So we're taking that into account. I would say, regardless of pricing, these consumer behaviors are here to stay. Consumers have absolutely shown a willingness to pay during this time to keep themselves safe and well through, all of their behaviors whether that be cleaning, drinking more water et cetera. And also as they start to eat at home, we've seen lots of trends around consumers having meal experiences. They've invested in grills, and they've invested in that long-term behavior. So we feel really good about our ability to do both, which is continue to take advantage of the trends that we're seeing, but also price where it's appropriate to recover margin. Sure. I think, if you look -- if you -- maybe I'll take a step back and talk about what we're seeing overall and what we've seen in the past because, I think we're operating from a really strong base. I'm not sure, how clear this was in the past. If you take a step back and look at our retail cleaning business, prepandemic that was a place of strength for us. We were growing mid-single digits in both topline and bottom line in the retail cleaning business for a number of years. So if you look at the five-year CAGR prepandemic, that was mid-single digits. So we were starting from a place of strength. And we see that continuing as we move to the future and we see -- building off of that. So if that gives you an idea of what we're thinking about, it will be above the company average is what we're anticipating, given the fact that it's a place where consumer tailwinds are working, where we think innovation is going to play a really big role because consumer needs have changed. And then again, that investment and we've long been investing in the Clorox brand, but we've increased that during this pandemic. And we think it's going to be pretty solid from a behavior perspective, as we move forward as we combine all of those things. Hey, Lauren, I'll take that one. Thanks for the question and try to provide some clarity on this one because I know it's really complex. Maybe taking a step back would help on this one just to get clear on what we experienced in cleaning and what we think we drove pre-pandemic, what we're seeing now, which again we're not satisfied with. And then how we see this playing out over the coming months and years as we get to a more normalized state.  So first big picture, if we step back and look at our retail cleaning business, it's actually been a great area of strength for us. I mentioned a little earlier that, we had strong growth. So if you look at the five-year CAGR pre-pandemic, we grew that business mid-single digits both top and bottom line. And that corresponded to an overall share increase in home care of two points from fiscal year '13 through 2019. So that was something that we've been investing in. We had been really trying to expand the Clorox brand. We had a strong focus on innovation. We have launched Scentiva during that time. We had done improvements on a broad range of our portfolio. So it's been a nice area of strength for us.  I think as you dive into the individual segments, Lauren, you do get to what you said which is there are ups and downs. And sprays is an incredibly complex fragmented category. So while we were winning in a lot of the particular segments that we are strong in, it could be true that in other ones we weren't. And we have a very strong spray business to your point outside of track channels, which is about 50% of our business. So -- in aggregate. So we -- I feel like we walked into this pandemic in a strong way from a Clorox perspective. There's always work to be done in individual segments as you highlighted. But overall, we were winning in Home Care. And as we look to the future I think a lot of those elements are going to continue to resonate, but we're going to ramp them up. One, the strength of that Clorox brand. It's why we've invested so much this year behind that and increased the spending. We're on track to spend across the company another $125 million in advertising and sales promotion this year, why we've ramped up innovation. And I mentioned the innovations that are worth repeating; reintroducing Scentiva, compostable wipes are back on shelf; disinfecting floor mop costs, which is a brand-new incremental category for us to compete in; having new offerings in Clorox sprays that aren't bleach and that's a first for us as well as paper towel wipes and then broadly expanding against our new electrostatic business that we really created from nothing a number of years ago with some partnership. So I feel terrific about what we have in place to continue to meet consumer needs. I am not happy Lauren with where we are share-wise. None of us are, but we feel confident in our ability to get back into that share growth as supply continues, again which is the majority of the issue. But we're laser-focused on that consumer value metric innovation and investing behind the Clorox brand. Thanks, Lauren. Kevin? Sure, Kevin. 11% for this year was something we had a lot of passion and conviction on given the fact that we're seeing so many people enter our brands. And we wanted to create that loyal consumer base moving forward. And we wanted to give them the right product information that they needed during such a trying time for everybody, but also give them new solutions as people had different challenges to solve. And innovation and advertising play a really important role in that. So for this year, we are on track to spend 11% as you highlighted and we have a strong spend coming up here in Q4. And that is behind the new innovations that we've launched. And I think you'll recall probably from previous conversations that our goal was to double the amount of advertising we spent on innovation this year to welcome people into those new product experiences and create loyalty and trial. As we look forward -- and let me comment on ROI, before I say we move forward. That's something that we're tracking real-time and getting information and insights on. And what I can say is the ROI continues to be very strong and that's why we continue to spend, and we're seeing it translate into results from a consumer-metric perspective. So continue to have incredibly high household penetration. We have household penetration gains across a number of our categories. We're seeing loyalty strengthen. So retention rates growing, repeat rates growing on both core users and new users. We're seeing consumers buying larger quantities more often. So all of the things that we would attribute to to long-term consumer metrics that show the health of the brand, the advertising drives, we're seeing that not only just the strong ROI but those metrics increase that are important to us to talk about loyalty. As we move forward, we don't have a prescribed number whether it be 10% 11%. But what I can say is we're committed to investing in our brands. And we'll continue to optimize what that right level of spending is depending on exactly like you highlighted market shares, depending on the innovation programs we have. But what you should hear from us is we will continue to invest in our brands. And we'll \u2013 as we update and give you a perspective for 2022 and beyond, we'll communicate what that exact number looks like. But you heard our continued commitment to advertising as a strong lever to help us get to our 3% to 5% over the long term. Thank you. Jason one more time. He's not there at all, operator? No? Okay. That's the final question? Very good. All right. Thanks again, everyone. We look forward to speaking to you again on our next call in August. Until then, please stay well."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference.\nLisah Burhan: Thank you, Sharon. Welcome everyone and thank you for joining us today. We hope you and your families are continuing to stay safe and well. On the call with me today are Linda Rendle, our CEO; and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. Now a few reminders before we go into results. We're broadcasting this call over the internet and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including statements related to the expected or potential impact of COVID-19. These statements are based on management's current expectation, but may differ from actual results or outcomes. In addition, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section, which identifies various factors that could affect such forward-looking statements, and the non-GAAP financial information section, including the tables that reconcile non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, both of which are located at the end of today's earnings release, which has also been posted on our website and filed with the SEC. I'll start by covering our usual top-line commentary with highlights from each of our segments. Kevin will then address our total company results, as well as our FY 2021 outlook. Finally, Linda will offer her perspective and we'll close with Q&A. For the total company, Q2 sales increased 27% with growth in every reportable segment. It reflects about 1 point of net benefit from the July acquisition that gives us a majority share in our Saudi Arabia joint venture and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. On an organic basis, Q2 sales grew 26%. I will now go through our results by segment. In our Health and Wellness segment, Q2 sales were up 42% reflecting double digits increases in two of three businesses. Our Cleaning business had double digit sales growth behind strong ongoing demand across our portfolio. Consumption remains high and importantly we're continuing to see increases in household penetration and repeat rates among existing and new users driven by new routines developed from the prolonged pandemic as well as strategic brand investments. While we expect tough comparisons as we let these very high growth rates, we'll continue to work to retain the larger base of loyal consumers we've built for our cleaning and disinfecting products even after a critical mass of the population has been vaccinated. We're continuing to make progress on our supply expansion, including a new line of wipes plant coming online this quarter. We're also continuing to identify new sources of supply for other products experiencing constraints, including our disinfecting spray products. As we're able to better meet consumer demands for our base products, we're looking forward to bringing back our Clorox compostable wipes along with a stream of exciting innovation in the coming months. Our professional products business had another quarter of double-digit sales growth behind continued high demand for our cleaning and disinfecting products. It's worth noting though that while demand from businesses such as healthcare facilities has remained high. We've seen softer demand from businesses negatively impacted by ongoing mobility restrictions like commercial cleaning and food service institutions. That's why we're leaning into other out-of-home spaces through strategic alliances and are encouraged by our progress. While not yet a meaningful contributor in Q2, our out-of-home partnerships are expanding. We're excited to announce a new multi-year deal with the NBA and existing partner. Lastly, within this segment, our sales in vitamins, minerals and supplements business decreased in Q2. This is a business where results have not been consistent and we clearly have more work to do. As you remember, we relaunched RenewLife last fall. While we've seen improvements in all outlet consumption, it is not yet delivering the consistent results we want. With more than half American consumers saying they intend to continue taking vitamins and supplements, we continue to believe in the attractiveness of this category. Now turning to Household segment. Quarterly sales were up 20% with growth in all three businesses for a third consecutive quarter. Grilling sales were up double digits driven by continued strong consumption, which reflects the dramatic rise in in-home meal occasion as people continue to spend more time at home. Behind our strategic collaboration with retailers, we've been able to grow household penetration for a third consecutive quarter including among millennials and low income consumers. As we begin planning for the next grilling season, we're building on our innovation through expanded distribution of our new Kingsford pellets and bringing new flavors to our Kingsford product lineup. With consumer spending more on their backyards and backyards and grills, we feel optimistic about the future of this business. Cat Litter sales were up by double digits in Q2 supported by innovation and continued strong performance online. Our Fresh Step with Gain Original Scented Litter with the power of Febreze as well as our Fresh Step Clean Paws Litter continued to perform very well and we're supporting them through a new advertising campaign. A record number of people have become pet parents since the onset of the pandemic in 2020. Making this yet another example of how our diverse portfolio is particularly suited to the times. Glad sales increased in Q2 behind strong demands across our portfolio of trash bags, wraps and food bags as people continue to spend more time at home. Our latest innovation Glad ForceFlex with Clorox trash bags launched in September and is building distribution quickly earning positive reviews. In our lifestyle segment, Q2 sales were up 9% with double digit growth in two of three businesses. Brita sales were up by double digits for a fourth consecutive quarter behind continued strong shipments of pitchers as well as filters. Just as with wipes and sprays, we're continuing to work through supply chain constraints in our Brita business, which has been impacting our shares. We feel good about the long-term prospects of this business especially since once people buy a Brita pitcher, they tend to stay in our franchise with continued purchases of filters. Importantly, as household penetration for Brita keeps growing, we're building brand loyalty among these consumers. The food business had double digit sales increase for a third straight quarter behind ongoing strong consumption of our Hidden Valley Ranch products, particularly dry seasoning and bottle dressings. With more and more people eating at home during the pandemic, household penetration has grown to an all-time high, including above average growth among millennials. We're building on this momentum with a stream of innovation, including Hidden Valley secret sauces, and most recently Hidden Valley Plant based Ranch dressing, which has been supported by strong advertising investments. Burt's Bees sales decreased by double digits as the business continued to be impacted by mobility restrictions as well as changes to consumer shopping and usage habits as a result of the pandemic. This quarter unseasonably warm weather also impacted lip balm sales. Despite these challenges, we're making progress in the fast-growing online channel where the brand had double digit growth in Q2, and we remain confident in the long-term trajectory of this business. Lastly, in international, Q2 sales grew 23% driven by double digit shipment growth in all major regions. The growth reflects about 9 points of benefit from the Saudi acquisition and about 4 points of unfavorable foreign currency headwinds. Organic sales grew 18%. The recent investment we made to create a dedicated international supply chain for Clorox disinfecting wipes is starting to pay off giving us the ability to not only meet ongoing elevated demand in existing markets, but also to expand to new countries. This is a strategic growth platform for the company and we're supporting it through additional advertising investments. Now, I'll turn it over to Kevin, who will discuss Q2 results as well as updated outlook for FY 2021.\nKevin Jacobsen: Thank you, Lisah, and thank you everyone for joining us today. We hope you and your families are well. Our sales growth for the second quarter was broad-based resulting in double digit growth in each reporting segment for the first half of our fiscal year. Additionally, this led to profitable growth for the first half, which enables us to capitalize on momentum and continue investing behind our global portfolio to strengthen our competitive advantage. As you saw in our press release, we've raised our fiscal year 2021 outlook given the strength of our first half results and our expectation for continued strong demand across our global portfolio over the balance of the year. Turning to our second quarter results, second quarter sales were up 27%, driven by 23 points of organic volume growth, 3 points of favorable price mix and 1 point of net benefit from requiring majority control of our Saudi joint venture partially offset by FX headwinds. On an organic basis, sales grew 26%. Gross margin for the quarter increased 130 basis points to 45.4% compared to 44.1% in the year ago quarter. Second quarter gross margin included the benefit of strong volume growth, as well as 160 basis points of cost savings and 140 basis points of favorable mix. These factors were partially offset by 420 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs, which were similar to last quarter, included temporary COVID-19 spending. Second quarter gross margin results also reflect about 50 basis points of negative impact from higher commodity costs, primarily from resin. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales came in at 14.6% compared to 14.5% in the year ago quarter. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels as a percentage of sales came in at about 10%. We're spending for our U.S. retail business coming in at 11% of sales. This reflect higher investments across our portfolio, strengthening our value proposition to support higher levels of household penetration and lasting brand loyalty among new and existing consumers. Our second quarter effective tax rate was 21%, which was equal to the year ago quarter. Net of these factors we delivered diluted net earnings per share of $2.03 versus $1.46 in the year ago quarter, increase of 39%. As you also saw in our press release year-to-date net cash provided by operations was $629 million versus $498 million in the year ago period, an increase of 26%. Turning to our fiscal year outlook; we now anticipate fiscal year sales to grow between 10% to 13%; reflecting the strength of our first half results and higher expectations for the back-half. With our overall demand for our products remaining quite strong, we now expect back-half sales to be about flat on top of 19% growth in a year ago period. We also anticipate about one point of contribution from our Saudi joint venture, offset by one point of foreign exchange headwinds. On an organic sales basis, our outlook assumes 10% to 13% growth. We now expect fiscal year gross margin to be down slightly, reflecting higher commodity and manufacturing logistics costs as well as temporary costs related to COVID-19. These factors are expected to be partially offset by higher sales. As a reminder, we expect gross margin contraction over the balance of the fiscal year. Primarily from two factors; first, we're lapping very strong operating leverage from robust shipment growth during the initial phase of the pandemic. And second we're facing commodity headwinds this year versus last year's commodity tailwinds. As reminder, our gross margin expanded 250 basis points in the back-half of this year 2020. We continue to expect fiscal year selling and administrative expenses to be about 14% of sales, reflecting ongoing aggressive investments and long-term profitable growth initiatives and incentive compensation costs consistent with our pay for performance philosophy. Additionally, we continue to anticipate fiscal year advertising spending to be about 11% of sales. We spent about 10% in the front half of the year and continue to anticipate about 12% in the back-half in support of our robust innovation program. We continue to expect our fiscal year tax rate to be between 21% to 22%. Net of these factors we now expect fiscal year 2021 diluted EPS to increase between $8.05 and $8.25 or 9% to 12% growth reflecting strong top line performance, partially offset by a rising cost environment. We now anticipate fiscal year diluted EPS outlook to include a contribution of $0.45 to $0.50 from our increased stake in our Saudi Arabia joint venture, primarily driven by a one-time non-cash gain. I'm pleased we've raised our fiscal year 2021 outlook. Of course, it's important to note we continue to operate in a highly dynamic environment and our monitoring headwinds that could result in impacts moving forward. In closing, I'm also pleased with our broad-based strong results in the first half, which enables us to continue investing in our brands, capabilities and new growth opportunities, all in support of our ambition to accelerate long-term profitable growth for our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to Linda.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks, Kevin. Hello everyone, and thank you for being with us today. I hope you and your families are well. It's great to be here today sharing Clorox's results for the first half of our fiscal year. My messages this quarter are largely reinforced what we discussed in Q1 with the most important point being that our global portfolio of leading brands continues to play a critical role in people's everyday lives. My first message is that our first half results are rooted in purpose driven growth. Our purpose as a company is to champion people to be well and thrive every single day. And our portfolio of leading brands is the bedrock of our ability to deliver on that promise. Our first half results reinforce the important role our brands play in addressing people's everyday needs. We continue to see broad-based strength in our portfolio with double-digit sales growth for most of our businesses. Clorox disinfecting products continue to be in high demand among consumers, businesses, and healthcare settings. And as people spend more time at home, we're continuing to see strong performance in other parts of our portfolio. Kingsford is a great example. As Lisah mentioned, our Grilling business delivered double-digit sales growth in the quarter, and with a recharge strategy emphasizing innovation. I'm optimistic about the long-term prospects of this business. Before I move on to my second message, I want to thank the Clorox team around the world who shows up every day to live our purpose. They understand that more than ever people and communities need us. I'm so grateful for their passion and commitment. My second message is that Clorox will stay in the driver's seat, continuing our posture of 100% offense to make the most of the opportunities in front of us, while navigating an ongoing dynamic environment. There's no question Clorox has built significant momentum over the last year, and we have every intention of extending that longer term. Our brand portfolio is especially relevant for this environment and for the consumer trends I mentioned last quarter, which we expect to persist beyond the pandemic. Prioritizing hygiene and health and wellness, caring for pets and accelerating digital behaviors related to practically every aspect of their lives. More than ever as homes where the hardest, it's also where consumers are directing their investments. We are spending across many categories to support quality of in-home experiences. This certainly bodes well for our portfolio. We continue to see strong levels of household penetration. Importantly, what we mentioned last quarter about repeat rates across our portfolio is playing out. We're accelerating purchase frequency and repeat users are the source of most of our sales growth across our portfolio. In addition, our strategic investments are creating a virtuous cycle around engaging and retaining new and existing users resulting in a consumer retention rate of nearly 90%. As I mentioned, 100% offense will help us extend this momentum, which as a reminder includes investing more across our portfolio to retain the millions of people buying our brands. Expanding our public health support to more out of home spaces, increase in capital spending for immediate and future production capacity, including wipes expansion in the international, and partnering with our retailers to grow our category. Given the dynamic environment we continue to face, 100% offense also means actively planning for challenges and disruptions in the near and long-term, including an inflationary cost environment, elevated competition in light of category tailwinds and accelerating advancements in digital technology that we expect to impact all areas of our business. What's important is we'll continue to make strategic choices that position us to achieve our ambition to accelerate long-term profitable growth. And finally, my third message is this. As we continue to address immediate priorities related to unprecedented demand, we're also accelerating our progress against our strategy to deliver long-term shareholder value. Our IGNITE strategy continues to put people at the center of everything we do, and helps us make the most of our strategic advantage in the near and long-term. Addressing unprecedented consumer demand for much of our portfolio continues to be an immediate priority. We continue to make progress on a number of businesses. We're bringing in more third party supply sources and launching our new wipes line in our Atlanta facility in the third quarter. Importantly, simplification is our mantra and we're seeing the benefit of focusing on fewer skews, which we expect to continue beyond the pandemic. As I mentioned earlier, we're going Clorox's disinfecting wipes international supported by a dedicated supply chain. Our expansion plans are going very well, and we expect to double the number of countries where Clorox wipes are sold. Another immediate priority is to continue supporting people's safety when they're outside their homes through strategic alliances to support public health. We're expanding our programs with Uber Technologies and Enterprise Holdings. We recently established a multi-year deal with the NBA and look forward to pursuing similar opportunities with other organizations. And as the pandemic continues to take a toll on the economy, we know that far too many people feel financial pressure from unemployment and less discretionary spending. We're mindful of the role we can play to support those who are particularly value sensitive and we'll continue to deliver superior value through meaningful innovation. Importantly, we're also making progress in laying the foundation for long-term growth. We will continue to invest strongly in our global portfolio of leading brands, particularly behind robust innovation that differentiates our products and deliver superior value. We will continue to re-imagine how we work to ensure a strong culture with a highly engaged team that works simpler and faster on strategic priorities. I'm proud of how we've been operating during the pandemic, including accelerating our speed-to-market. And finally, as we said before we view ESG as a contributor to competitive advantage, which is why it's embedded in our business. Achievements this quarter include being included in the 2021 Bloomberg gender equality index, achieving 100% renewable electricity in the U.S. and Canada four years early. Signing on to the energy buyer, federal clean energy policy statement, which calls for a 100% clean energy power sector and donating $1 million to Cleveland Clinic to establish the Clorox public health research grant in support of science-based public health research. We are grateful to play a role in supporting people and communities as we continue to navigate the global pandemic. It only strengthens our resolve in pursuing purpose driven growth, ensuring a strategic link between our impact on the world and long-term value creation for our shareholders. Operator, you may now open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Andrea Teixeira with J.P. Morgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. And I hope you and your families are doing well. So I was hoping if you can give us an idea of the shipments, I guess consumption into the second half [indiscernible] to replenishing the trade or if the fuel rates have normalized at this point. I've remember Linda you mentioned that in the last call. And asking a different way, how much more capacity including third parties you mentioned in the call, have you added in the second half against the second half of the last fiscal? So it seems around 25% by my math in the U.S. which implies that you could still grow volumes in the low-single digits in this upcoming second half of fiscal, if demand remained strong. I understand that obviously you're giving us a flat top line for the second half because you're embedding some deceleration. So how we should be thinking of that and conversely, if you're regaining share, because you lost some share, given the stockouts how we should be thinking of your capacity and fulfillment into the second half? Thank you.\nKevin Jacobsen: Andrea, this is Kevin. I can start and Linda can jump in as well. Maybe I'll start with the question on retail inventory levels, and I might broaden it to talk about both inventory levels and the extent of supply chain, both in our warehouse as well as retailers. What I'd tell you is we think we've made pretty good progress over the first half of this fiscal year. And I'd say by and large, we feel pretty good about retail inventory levels with some notable exceptions, there's still portions of our home care portfolio particularly our disinfecting wipes and portions of our disinfecting spray trigger products that we're still not at a point where we can fully meet demand. And in the other area, we still have work to do to catch-up as an Brita. That business continues to perform quite well. We've had four straight quarters of double digit growth, and so we're still not in a position where we can fully support demand on that product. But with the exception of those businesses, I think generally I feel pretty good about retail inventory levels and additionally feel pretty good about inventory levels in our facilities. I would say on Brita, I think we've got a couple more quarters before we think we can catch up. I think by the end of this fiscal year, we'll be in a better position in terms of meeting retail demand. And then I think particularly on our wipes business, it's going to take a while, likely the end of this calendar year we'll be in a position to fully service demand. And then on capacity, you had a question on capacity, Andrea? As Linda said in her prepared remarks, we are starting up our second line at our Georgia wipes facility and that's happening this quarter. And you'll see that start to ramp-up over the next several quarters. Our expectation is by the end of the fiscal year, we'll have more than doubled our wipes capacity from where we were before the pandemic started. And that's a combination of bringing on our facility that's happening now, as well as we continue to bring on additional contract manufacturers. And in Q2, we added more contract manufacturers as well. So we're working both with self manufacturing, as well as third-party manufacturing. That work will continue, well past this fiscal year.\nLinda Rendle: Andrea, I'll just add on the shared question, which I think you were connecting this to, which is exactly what we're watching closely. You started to see our share improvement in quarter two. So we're up as a total company, eight-tenths of a point that's up from 52 weeks share of being up a half a point, but what's really encouraging to us as if we dive deeper into the businesses that we have gotten back to an in-stock position on. So starting outside of cleaning, if you look at our Hidden Valley ranch business, cat litter and Kingsford all of them growing share, as we've gotten supplied back up to a place where we can meet demand. And then really encouragingly, if you look at our cleaning business, although we have a ways to go until we can fully meet demand in places where we've been able to improve, we're seeing significant share gains to our Clorox clean-up business, which is a spray, is up eight share points in the spray business in Q2. Clorox Manual Toilet Bowl Cleaner up four points, our Pine-Sol business up 2.5 points, and that corresponds with strong plans we have in place, but also our ability to supply.\nAndrea Teixeira: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi.\nWendy Nicholson: Hi. My first question is regarding gross margin. The 420 basis points pressure that you called out for manufacturing and logistics costs. How much of that specifically was related to COVID and how much longer do you think that will be with us? What I'm trying to get a handle on is kind of gross margin as we look into 2022, what's the right run rate? And is there opportunity for margins to recover as we go into the next fiscal year?\nKevin Jacobsen: Hi, Wendy. Yes, as it relates to the impact of COVID in Q2 was about 90 basis points. What we believe is on a full year basis, it's probably 50 basis point to 75 basis point hit to gross margin. It was higher going forward. We think over time we'll be able to step out of these costs. They're really in two buckets, we continue to expedite transportation and that comes at a higher cost as we're trying to fulfill retail orders as quickly as we can in our supply challenge environment. So there's some increased costs there, as well as the increased spending we're doing with our production team to make sure we're keeping folks safe with increased hygiene activity, as well as enhanced benefits. I think over time as we get through the pandemic and that may push you into fiscal year 2022 for us, but as we move through the pandemic, we'll be able to step out of a good portion of those charges going forward.\nWendy Nicholson: Got it. And this \u2013 the shipments of wipes into the international markets, I assume that's going to be great over the long-term and there's probably even lower household penetration of wipes overseas than there is in the U.S. But I assume you're sourcing that \u2013 are you sourcing that from a third parties? I'm wondering if I know it's a small number, but is that accretive or dilutive to margins over the next 12 months to 18 months?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes. Wendy, on wipes it's as we've mentioned, we've stood up a dedicated supply chain internationally. We used to supply our international wipes out of the U.S. so it had a very long supply chain and that came at an increased cost. We've now stood up a supply chain much closer to our markets we're serving. And so I think over time, that's going to be a nice addition to that international portfolio as we build out that, that business. It really just started in Q2. We saw some really nice performance in the second quarter. I think this is a long-term growth runway for us. So you'll see that continue to build through the balance of this year and frankly, that'll continue to build for the next several years.\nWendy Nicholson: Fantastic. And then I don't mean to be a hog, but I just want to sneak in one for Linda. The VMS business, I get why it fits in with sort of the strategy and mission of the company health and wellness focus. And I get that the category itself is attractive, but I'm still not totally convinced that it belongs in your portfolio, that Clorox has the core competencies to make the VMS business a success? So can you talk about that, maybe your willingness to throw in the towel and not focus on that business anymore?\nLinda Rendle: Hi, Wendy. Thanks for the question. I'll just start with, and you said it, our results have been inconsistent and I'm not satisfied with that, and that is full stop. But if you look at the thesis and you started to talk about this, we really do see these categories being a long-term growth runway for us. And that's why we got into these businesses to start because we see it a nice fit in our overall journey to help people be well and thrive. What we've learned over the last few years as we've operated these is, we made the choice to buy some small brands in a very large $12 billion space. And it's certainly been a hotbed for competition and the lesson we've learned is the ramp-up for the brands is just longer than we thought it was going to be. We see pockets of encouraging results in our renew life relaunch for example in our magnesium supplement business, but there are other places where we're not as satisfied. So, if I take a long-term view to this, we still think these categories are attractive. We still see our ability to innovate, brand build really meaningful in a slew of a lot of things that are going on in therapy. Good claims, good science, but I think the perspective is VMS still only represents about 4% of our business and it's going to take a while before it's a meaningful contributor and we're going to be patients. But I still feel conviction that these are attractive categories too compete.\nWendy Nicholson: Fair enough. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Next question comes from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.\nNik Modi: Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. So I just wanted to touch on the trash bag business. If you could just kind of give us a state of the union in terms of what's going on in terms of shelf space. I understand there's been some pricing taken on the category. And Linda, last quarter you indicated, you were hesitant to take pricing during a pandemic, but just wanted to get a sense of how you're thinking about it now, given you're starting to see inflation happen at a much more meaningful rate? Thank you.\nLinda Rendle: Nik, thanks for the question. So Q2 was another strong quarter for Glad. It grew nicely behind continued strong demand from consumers. We're seeing really good signs of brand health. So our household penetration, up almost a point and a half increased by our retention rates. We're growing repeat rates on the Glad business. So the fundamentals of that business continue to be very strong. You're seeing price gaps where we'd want them to be. And I think what continues to be the differentiator for glad is innovation. It's working really well in the market for us, whether that be our experiential trash bag or if that is our new skew Glad or selects with Clorox are all doing really well. And so as we've said, this is a business where you have to innovate, where you have to bring new benefits to the category and that continues to work well for us. I think if you take a step back and maybe this is a comment agnostic of Glad if you just take your pricing comment and total you're right, we had said we would not take pricing in the height of a pandemic and I still believe that was the right call as we got through the height of it. But as we look forward and as we see the pressure from the cost environment and we see pressure on gross margin, we're going to look to the broad toolbox that we have against our long-term goal of growing EBIT margin. And that toolbox includes things like on the revenue side, managing promotions and ensuring that we can add value through innovation and premiumization, but we will also consider pricing as part of that. And as we look forward, we will see what the right mix is by brands. And we feel given the fact that our portfolio has very high consumer value, the highest we have on record that we're in a position if we need to take pricing to do just that.\nNik Modi: Super helpful. Thank you, Linda.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks, Nik.\nOperator: Next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo.\nChris Carey: Hi. So just one question on the wipes business. So right, like you've lost about 1,200 basis points of market share there since, over the past year and all of that has effectively come from Lysol and other manufacturers who have seen big increases in market share. And I guess the question is you've obviously been underperforming a category that has delivered really significant growth and shelf is now occupied by a litany of other brands. And so, how sticky do you think that shelf space is in wipes from those new entrance? Maybe said another way, do you think you can get back this share that you've lost in the business, because if so, if you have manufacturing capacity coming online, that would imply that you might, but maybe \u2013 maybe these shelf gains from other competitors are going to last indefinitely? So I wonder if you could just comment on that.\nLinda Rendle: Sure, Chris. Wipes is obviously a very important and strategic business for us. One category that we created 20 years ago and we'll continue to be aggressive as we think about expanding this business and helping to serve consumers. I think maybe it'd be good to take a broader view of wipes because we're looking at a narrow universe of track channels, but if you look more broadly, the share loss that you're seeing in track channels is not reflective of the fact that we've prioritized our healthcare business to ensure that we have the right supply there. And that our professional business has always had a strong wipes business as well as untracked channels that are very strong. So the broader perspective to be clear; we don't like to lose share anywhere \u2013 anywhere and our goal is to always be growing it over the long-term. But the broader perspective with wipes business is in better shape than you might see in track data. But then even if you look at track data, the only people growing share right now are non-branded or new entrant competitors that are very small. There is no major manufacturer as we all try to ramp up the support. And I think what's going to happen is we're already seeing retailers think about simplification as we move forward, and there's going to be no desire on their part to add 10, 12 whatever a brand sit on the shelf right now that are filling the need. They're going to want to make sure that they're with leading brands, who are innovating and we know that we'll be with Clorox. We feel great about the innovation pipeline we have on the business. We feel great about the fact that our supply is ramping up and we're getting to the place where we'll have double the supply by the end of the year. So I think you're going to start to see as we bring supply back on, share will go in the other direction. Similar to how I highlighted in other businesses, Clorox clean-up eight share points once we brought that back on from a supply perspective; Pine-Sol up 2.5 share points. So this is very much correlated to supply. We think the long-term trends are behind us. And I think the most important part is we have not let up on the innovation and investments, so that as we bring that supply up, we'll be in a terrific place to get back to growing share.\nChris Carey: Okay. Thanks. That's very helpful. And then just one follow-up, maybe for Kevin, just on phasing for gross margins in the back half [indiscernible] that manufacturing and logistics impacted gross margin really ramped up in the June quarter last year. It would imply that you're going to start lapping that in the June quarter of this year. But obviously we've seen manufacturing and logistics inflation accelerate in recent months. So do you expect that to remain as significant an impact as we get through the entire year or is there any phasing that we should be keeping in mind there? Thanks so much.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, Chris. As it relates to phasing, as we've updated our expectations for gross margin, as you heard, we now think we're going to be down slightly. One of the biggest changes we're seeing as our expectations for commodities, and we've talked about it, we're clearly an inflationary cycle. If you go back to November, we'd anticipated about 100 basis points of cost headwinds throughout the back half of this fiscal year. We've updated that expectation now where they're going to be closer to 150 basis points hit primarily driven by increasing costs of resin, and I expect that to be pretty consistent through the back half of the year.\nChris Carey: Thank you.\nKevin Jacobsen: Sure.\nOperator: Next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning or good afternoon; sorry. I was curious a little bit about the international plans. And I was just hoping one to maybe get a little bit more specificity on countries, of course, maybe you can discuss countries you have not yet entered, but those where you've already started to invest in and establish the supply chain? And then secondly, I think just historically Clorox has kind of been, I guess maybe I can say in and out of quote international was sort of some changes and is going back over 20 plus years of making a go-forward in Brazil as an example, or debating, should we really go, try to do something in China or not. And the impediment has often been the question of how do you establish the Clorox brand to mean something with consumers that just may not be familiar with it; the way that it dominates here in the U.S. So can you just talk about how your perspective on that part of the question. Because the wipes form is something that others can do under different brand names in international markets. And so I'm just curious why \u2013 what you're going to do to really drive that Clorox brand in particular, to make this a more successful endeavor than it was kind of in the case in the past? Thanks.\nLinda Rendle: Sure. Thanks Lauren. In the case of international, we were pleased to see the strong volume driven organic sales growth, which was really broad based across the portfolio including cleaning and disinfecting Glad, Brita, Litter. And what was encouraging is the early contribution from our wipes expansion is about 20% of the growth we experienced in the quarter. So good early signals that it's working. If we think about the countries, we compete in over 100 countries around the world today, broadly with our portfolio. And the very first priority we have is to expand our presence in our cleaning and disinfecting portfolio in more of those countries. So to your good point, not having to introduce them to the brand in a brand new fashion, but actually just expanding the portfolio we have with those consumers to the offer them the benefit that a wipe brings them. And we've seen that successful so far and, early consumption looks good in those markets. And then, as we think about more broadly, the avenues that we have to introduce our brands to consumers have expanded. E-comm is now away that you can enter into a market, learn more about the consumer in a low cost way that allows us to get early insights and decide if we want to build more of an infrastructure behind in the international business to expand. So I think, what Lauren you're going to see from us is a very disciplined approach in this. We want to be fast, which is why we stood up dedicated supply chain, but we want to continue to be disciplined. And we want to see a strong return on the markets that we enter, and the very first proof points are the fact that we're entering markets. We are already in with an expanded portfolio.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay. That's super helpful. And then I was also curious about A&P spend; your spending is already back towards historic levels. Obviously talking about increasing in the second half of the year further? As you look further out, Linda and arguably with competitive dynamics in your categories only getting more intense, right, is there's more attention being paid to them particularly core cleaning. How do you think about the right level of A&P be it in dollars or percentage of sales, kind of versus where you're targeted to spend in 2021? Does the competitive dynamics change with the elevated attention to the categories that you're anticipating not just now, but on the other side of the pandemic?\nLinda Rendle: Yes. I think on average over the long-term 10% to 11% is in the right ballpark. And what will vary of course, and you bring up a good point of competition is exactly what a quarter or a year looks like. Well, depend on the level of competitive activity. We see the amount of innovation we have. And as you know the 12% we plan to spend in the back half is really dedicated to the fact that we have a great innovation lineup. Two thirds of our innovation will be launched then. And we really see the opportunity to introduce consumers to that innovation to drive trial and then to benefit from the fact that we have very strong repeats right now \u2013 repeat rates right now across the portfolio. So we think about as you know A&SP as a strategic long-term investment. We're always looking at whether we think the right level is, but we are not hesitant to invest when we see strong returns and we're seeing that right now on the base business and strong returns as we start to spend behind innovation. So we'll continue to keep you updated, Lauren, if we have any change to that thinking, but very consistent with what we've said in the past.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay, great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Hi. Great, thanks. So as you start to lap the outsized growth of late last year next few quarters, can you talk a little bit of \u2013 just a little bit more nuances to how you expect your various segments to hold up relative to one another? I guess my question is, do you expect more resiliency in the Health and Wellness business just given lingering demand for disinfecting and it could conversely be far from the other segments, or do you think that performance will be more even across the entire portfolio?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes. Hi, Steve. I can answer that one. And what I can share with you is our perspective on the back half. And Steve you'll recall back in November, our expectation was in the back half. We'd see our sales declined mid-single digits. With our updated outlook today, it implies our expectation that the back half will be flattish. And if I think about our portfolio in three buckets, I can kind of talk about how we see this playing out. If you think about our U.S. Cleaning business, which includes both our retail and our B2B business, we now think that this is going to continue to grow in the back half of this fiscal year in low single digits. Back in November, our expectation was it would be about flat and keep in mind we're lapping about 40% growth in the back half of last year, so a really strong prior period and we think that business will continue to grow for all the reasons we've been talking about today. On our International business, back in November, we thought that business would grow low single digits. We're now taking that expectation up. We now think we'll grow high single digits in the back half of the year. We're seeing really good results for some of the work we're doing on extending our wipes business. And that will continue to add value over the back half of the year. And then what we call our home essentials business, which is a little less than 50% of our total sales. We've updated our assumption there as well. Originally, we thought that business would decline high single digits. We now think it will grow or \u2013 excuse me, will decline mid single digits. And in all cases, those three segments, all grew double digits in the prior period. And so that \u2013 if you do that math, that gets us to about flat year-over-year in the back half. I'd say importantly though if you take a longer-term perspective and you look at our performance say versus fiscal year 2019, a pre-pandemic environment that would suggest we'll grow somewhere in the 15% to 20% range in the back half of this year. And so I think that the takeaway Steve I just \u2013 I'd offer is this is not just about increasing strength within our disinfecting portfolio. We're seeing performance broadly across our portfolio. We saw that in Q1 and Q2. And it's our expectation going forward what could you see broad strength across the portfolio.\nSteve Powers: Okay. Okay, thank you. I guess \u2013 and I don't know Linda or Kevin, if you maybe both want to weigh on this, but just as Linda you talked about pricing as a potential lever specifically \u2013 I think specifically on Glad, just given the rise in inflation that you've pointed out. In the past that's been a point of volatility for Clorox. You've gotten the pricing through, but it's often come with volatility in market share and volume as competitors respond or don't respond to various degrees. I guess can you just frame your relative confidence going into this inflationary cycle around how \u2013 just around your confidence taking that pricing and avoiding that volatility this time around. Thank you.\nLinda Rendle: Sure, Steve. If I think about what pricing does and how we approach this, it's really about managing over the mid to long-term. We don't want to take pricing over short term inflationary and we use trade bonds and we have for Glad in particular over a number of years to manage through those short-term impacts. But as we see a progressing cost environment coming up here, pricing is something we absolutely will consider across our portfolio where it makes sense. And, I think, it's safe to say pricing isn't something that is an easy thing to go execute. It takes a lot to do with excellence. And it comes with ensuring that we partner with retailers to have plans that grow their categories. And I feel like we are better positioned than we have been in a very long time on that. We have a terrific slate of innovation across our portfolio and particularly for Glad. We are spending against our brands, which retailers can appreciate in an incredible way right now because we're bringing people to the physical or digital shelf. And our portfolio is at the best place it's ever been from a consumer value measure perspective. So more people deem our portfolio, a percentage of our portfolio is superior than ever before. So I think with all of that, we're well positioned to do it. And what I wouldn't say is, I don't have a perfect crystal ball. Pricing is always something that we have to go out and we're dedicated to executing with excellence, but we would expect there are little bumps here and there, but we'll manage through them. And over the long-term we know that it's a good thing for us to do and it's right for the category. So again, no plans at this point on any of our brands, but we'll look at it as we head into the remainder of the year and next year as an option for us to expand margins.\nSteve Powers: Great. Thank you. If I could sneak in one more at the risk of being greedy just on Burt's, clearly there are challenges associated with the COVID backdrop on that business. I guess I'm just curious a little bit as to if this moment has changed at all, how you think about managing that business over time. Clearly, I'm sure you're investing, doubling down, tripling down on e-commerce and digital. But I'm thinking more about some like the portfolio of products that reside underneath the Burt's Bees brand umbrella as there's any shift in \u2013 into where within that Burt's portfolio you might be leading in and investing further versus maybe pulling back versus how you're thinking about going into the COVID situation? Thank you.\nLinda Rendle: Sure. And absolutely the environment has been bumpy for businesses in this space, and that's absolutely the case for Burt's Bees, but we have very strong conviction in the long-term portfolio as it stands today. And I think a couple of things jump out Steve and you've touched on a couple of them. The first is accelerating our progress in e-commerce and we have done that and leaned in over the last couple of quarters with very good results on the Burt's Bees business. The second is innovation and innovating in spaces where the consumer is particularly apt to be transitioning today as we're seeing that in skincare, we're seeing that in the healthcare space in general, and with that we have launched a new line of naturally clean hand products that helped to meet that need. And then obviously very strong conviction and continued conviction in our lip care business. We're still the market share leader in lip balm. And although we've had some weather issues that have impacted the overall category still feel really good about that business and our ability to innovate there. So overall, from a Burt's perspective, we'll continue to make tweaks as we learn from the consumer. But I think this is a brand where more than ever people are going to want things that they feel care for them and care for them using the power of nature.\nSteve Powers: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.\nJason English: Hi, folks. Hope all is well, thank you very much for spotting me in, two questions. Kevin, this time last year, I know you were providing insight your 8-K breakout [indiscernible] bridges, so the headwind from higher trade spend. Can you give us what if any magnitude of tailwind you've had through the first and then the second quarter from lower trade spend?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes. Jason, as it relates to trade spend particularly in Q2, if you look at our price mixes favorable three points in the second quarter, about half of that was favorable price, but half of that was favorable mix. On the price side, a little bit of pricing international, but the bulk of that was reduced trade spending because of the reduced promotional environment. So we've seen that pretty consistently for the front half of this year.\nJason English: Would you expect that to turn the other way on the other side of this? So this time next year, would you expect that to be in a headwind? Or do you think the industry and you can settle out at a lower trade level than pre-COVID?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, I might separate my answer, Jason, in terms of the industry and what the impact will be for us. I do expect the industry will move back to a more normalized level of promotional spending as everyone gets more back in supply, I think that's to be expected. And then at the same issue for us our promotional spending is down specifically as a Clorox, not necessarily industry because many products we just can't promote right now because of the limited supply capacity we have. So I expect to see increased promotional spending for Clorox when we get back to promoting some of these products that we just haven't been able to promote for the last six months.\nJason English: Yes, that makes sense. And I'm going to stretch on this. I'm not sure what you'd be able to answer and what you can't. But you referenced fiscal 2019 in looking at the back half of year and you said back half expect to grow 15% to 20% off of the same period of fiscal 2019. Clearly in the back half of this year, we're still deep in the midst of a pandemic. What would be, if at all \u2013 how if at all could you hazard a guess as to on the other side of the pandemic what that growth may look like off from fiscal 2019?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes. That's thanks for asking the question, Jason, I'm sure you can appreciate, we're not ready to talk about plans beyond fiscal year 2021. We're in the process of developing those plans right now, but maybe just big picture what I leave you with to think about is our intent has accelerated the profitable growth rate of this company. As a result of the pandemic, we've talked \u2013 we have millions of new consumers coming into our franchise using our products. We're investing behind that. We have a number of new growth runways we've talked about both in out-of-home, as well as international expansion. And so we see these as long-term opportunities for the company that we're clearly investing in this year that we think generate long-term value. So again, we want to talk about our specific growth rates going forward, but we believe that sets us up nicely to be able to accelerate the long-term growth rate of the company. But in the near term there is going to be lots of noise as you compare quarters, pre- or post-pandemic. There's going to be a lot of noise for a number of quarters. I think when you get past all that, there's long-term opportunity for the company and we're investing behind that.\nJason English: For sure. Lots of noise and lots of debate, thanks a lot. I will pass it on.\nKevin Jacobsen: Thanks, Jason.\nOperator: Next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. A couple for me. I'll try to be brief here, because I know we're late in the call. The first one is going to be for Linda on pricing I wanted to revisit that. Second one for Kevin on capital deployment and share buyback. So, first one, Linda, just given the importance of pricing here, not just for Clorox, but of course more broadly for consumer staples with commodity inflation, so the willingness to take pricing I think is going to be well received and welcome given past commentary that the company was not going to do that during a pandemic. So I think that folks would generally agree that. That's certainly a good thing, but a couple of questions here. A, can you give us a sense of retailer's receptivity to price increases at this point, based on the current commodity environment and state of consumer? I mean, from a Clorox perspective, one could take the view that some of your categories have arguably never been more important to them than they are right now. And then secondarily, you touched on this, but I want to see if we can get a little bit more specific. How quickly can you put through the price increases? I guess what would be the hesitancy \u2013 excuse me, to doing that? Are you looking for more permanence in commodity costs inflation? Just to an earlier question, maybe a little bit of uncertainty in terms of what the competition is going to do. I guess what would be the hesitancy now based on what you're staring down, which is pretty significant commodity costs inflation to taking pricing? And then I have a follow-up for Kevin on buybacks. Thanks.\nLinda Rendle: Sure. Thanks, Kevin. Again, let's maybe step back and talk about pricing as a strategic lever and really what we're trying to do overall. And as you know, we're trying to expand our EBIT margins 25 to 50 basis points over the long run. And what we always look at is the broad set of tools that we have in our toolbox to manage cost wherever they may be. And one critical element of how we've done that over the short-term is cost savings, for example, and we had another robust savings this quarter and we expect to continue that. And I think as part of our IGNITE strategy, we put additional levers in place thinking about the role of technology and the role of sustainability could play and helping us do that over the long-term. So we're very much focused on managing as many of the short-term cost inflation increases that we see through those types of levers. What we're looking at right now is over the mid- to long-term based off of the outlook what role could pricing play. And that has to play a broader role in the category plans that we have. It's not something in isolation. So what we're focused on right now is strong innovation, strong brand investments, ensuring that we have the right assortment on shelves with retailers to match the fact that consumers\u2019 behaviors and needs have changed. And that is really the single highest priority we had in addition to supply over the last many months and continues to be over the next few months. So that would be why I would answer we're not ready to announce any type of pricing action at this moment because what we're focused on is serving consumers, what we're focused on is growing our categories, getting back to supply and we're focused on a terrific innovation agenda we have for the back half. And if we can do that with excellence, we will get to a place where as Kevin said, it's a very nice back half as you look back and take a broader view compared to fiscal year 2019. What gives us conviction though in the strategic \u2013 our strategic ability to take pricing again is the health of our brands, and the fact that we have been investing, the fact that we do have an innovation portfolio that strong, the fact that we have been partnering openly and transparently with retailers on how we get through the last 9 to 10 months together. So as we make those decisions, we feel confident in that overall suite of activity that we have that can help the categories. We'll continue to evaluate when the right time might be to do that. But for now we are really focused on investing in those brands, getting capacity back to 100% and innovation.\nKevin Grundy: Got it. Thanks for the comments, Linda. Quickly, Kevin, just on capital deployment. As you know, company is carrying a higher than usual cash balance. The debt leverage looks pretty low relative to historically what you've carried about 1.2 times net debt-to-EBITDA, roughly, so understanding that you\u2019re, look, addressing some capacity needs for the business. But given the cash balance, given the pretty strong balance sheet, and the fact that, look, your socks off again today what was a pretty strong quarter. And the group is trading at relative lows versus the market that we haven't seen since the global financial crisis, really. And you have about $1.5 billion in board authorization. What would be the argument against leaning in a little bit more heavily on share repurchases at this point in time? And I'll pass it on. Thank you.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, thanks, Kevin. For us, as it relates to our capital deployment priorities, as you know, Kevin, no change in the priorities we've talked about for quite a while. Now we'll continue to prioritize investing in our base business and you folks see us doing it this year. Kevin, as you mentioned, we're increasing capital spending to increase our production capacity. We're also increasing investments in our brands in terms of advertising R&D and technology. So that'll continue to be job one. We'll also continue to pursue strategic M&A. We want to expand our portfolio, particularly in the health and wellness space. We have a number of areas we're interested in. So we'll continue to evaluate those and look for opportunities to do that. And as you mentioned, we have a very strong balance sheet right now, where we're carrying a little under $800 million on the balance sheet that is elevated. And so, as we've said, if we don't have a need for that cash, we will look for ways to get it back to our shareholders. If you think about this year, I expect over the balance of the year, we're going to return about a $1 billion to our shareholders, about half of that through our dividend, the other half through share repurchases, that's up pretty significantly. We were somewhere around $780 million or so we returned last year. So we've stepped it up this year. And then as we develop our plans for fiscal year 2022 and beyond, we'll continue to evaluate the best opportunities to invest that cash. And as I said, again, if we don't have a good use for it, we're not going to keep it on the balance sheet. We'll look for ways to get that back to folks.\nKevin Grundy: Got it. Thank you both. I appreciate it. Good luck.\nKevin Jacobsen: Thanks, Kevin.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks, Kevin.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] I have a question from Olivia Tong with Bank of America.\nOlivia Tong: Great, thanks. Most of my questions have been asked, but just one for you. It's just around your conversations with your retailers and just thinking about the categories that you participate in going forward, not necessarily just now or even 6 to 12 months from now, but how they're thinking about shelf space allocation, level of promotion necessary to drive the category in cleaning, and not only just in cleaning and disinfecting, but also your other big categories. And again, this is sort of thinking two to three years down the line with allocation to shelf space and how to think about running the categories post-pandemic. Thanks.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks, Olivia. You're hitting on exactly what we're talking to retailers about right now and we're partnering with them on is what is the long-term for these categories as we get through what's been an incredibly unprecedented, I think we can never underestimate or overuse that word unprecedented. And we're really turning to what does the future look like. What will the habits and behaviors that have started today that we believe will be very sticky in the future mean for the assortment that's needed, for the type of promotion that's needed for the shelf space. And what I would say is that varies depending on the category. And our categories have always been different at shelf, what's required from an assortment perspective, how much is merchandise et cetera. So we\u2019re working with them on those individual plans. We're bringing them consumer insights and what we're seeing in the changing behaviors. So for example, the fact that people are cleaning and disinfecting more, and we expect that to continue. They're cleaning different surfaces. They're thinking about the fact that when they leave the house, they're thinking about those surfaces around them in a different way, and we're helping them to plan for that. And then I think really importantly, what we've talked to them about is the innovation needed in order to address those needs and how we ensure we introduce that innovation in a quick manner that we get it on the physical or digital shelf and that we get the right trial behind that. And retailers are really receptive to hearing that right now. And in fact, are loving the fact that we're coming with so much innovation despite all of the craziness over the last nine months. So without getting into specific category details, that's exactly what we're doing. And retailers will begin to make those first moves as supply gets to the place where we're able to fully meet it and you'll start to see what it looks like online. I think a couple of themes, the first is simplification. We've taken the opportunity to simplify our portfolio, to help us run faster and many of our businesses, and that's panned out really well for us. I'm actually really well for retailers and so they're going to continue to drive simplification. We win in that environment being a number one and number two share brands. And then the second thing is omnichannel, making sure that a consumer has access to the right products depending on where they are and where they're shopping. And we're focused on that with retailers and ensuring that they have all of those right levers in place depending on where consumers are entering into their store.\nOlivia Tong: Great, thank you.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks, Olivia.\nOperator: And this concludes the question-and-answer session. Ms. Rendle, I would now like to turn the program back over to you.\nLinda Rendle: Thank you, everyone. I'm happy with our first half results and look forward to strong execution of our plans in the back half. We'll speak again on our next call in May. Please stay well.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kevin Jacobsen",
            "content": "Thank you, Lisah, and thank you everyone for joining us today. We hope you and your families are well. Our sales growth for the second quarter was broad-based resulting in double digit growth in each reporting segment for the first half of our fiscal year. Additionally, this led to profitable growth for the first half, which enables us to capitalize on momentum and continue investing behind our global portfolio to strengthen our competitive advantage. As you saw in our press release, we've raised our fiscal year 2021 outlook given the strength of our first half results and our expectation for continued strong demand across our global portfolio over the balance of the year. Turning to our second quarter results, second quarter sales were up 27%, driven by 23 points of organic volume growth, 3 points of favorable price mix and 1 point of net benefit from requiring majority control of our Saudi joint venture partially offset by FX headwinds. On an organic basis, sales grew 26%. Gross margin for the quarter increased 130 basis points to 45.4% compared to 44.1% in the year ago quarter. Second quarter gross margin included the benefit of strong volume growth, as well as 160 basis points of cost savings and 140 basis points of favorable mix. These factors were partially offset by 420 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs, which were similar to last quarter, included temporary COVID-19 spending. Second quarter gross margin results also reflect about 50 basis points of negative impact from higher commodity costs, primarily from resin. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales came in at 14.6% compared to 14.5% in the year ago quarter. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels as a percentage of sales came in at about 10%. We're spending for our U.S. retail business coming in at 11% of sales. This reflect higher investments across our portfolio, strengthening our value proposition to support higher levels of household penetration and lasting brand loyalty among new and existing consumers. Our second quarter effective tax rate was 21%, which was equal to the year ago quarter. Net of these factors we delivered diluted net earnings per share of $2.03 versus $1.46 in the year ago quarter, increase of 39%. As you also saw in our press release year-to-date net cash provided by operations was $629 million versus $498 million in the year ago period, an increase of 26%. Turning to our fiscal year outlook; we now anticipate fiscal year sales to grow between 10% to 13%; reflecting the strength of our first half results and higher expectations for the back-half. With our overall demand for our products remaining quite strong, we now expect back-half sales to be about flat on top of 19% growth in a year ago period. We also anticipate about one point of contribution from our Saudi joint venture, offset by one point of foreign exchange headwinds. On an organic sales basis, our outlook assumes 10% to 13% growth. We now expect fiscal year gross margin to be down slightly, reflecting higher commodity and manufacturing logistics costs as well as temporary costs related to COVID-19. These factors are expected to be partially offset by higher sales. As a reminder, we expect gross margin contraction over the balance of the fiscal year. Primarily from two factors; first, we're lapping very strong operating leverage from robust shipment growth during the initial phase of the pandemic. And second we're facing commodity headwinds this year versus last year's commodity tailwinds. As reminder, our gross margin expanded 250 basis points in the back-half of this year 2020. We continue to expect fiscal year selling and administrative expenses to be about 14% of sales, reflecting ongoing aggressive investments and long-term profitable growth initiatives and incentive compensation costs consistent with our pay for performance philosophy. Additionally, we continue to anticipate fiscal year advertising spending to be about 11% of sales. We spent about 10% in the front half of the year and continue to anticipate about 12% in the back-half in support of our robust innovation program. We continue to expect our fiscal year tax rate to be between 21% to 22%. Net of these factors we now expect fiscal year 2021 diluted EPS to increase between $8.05 and $8.25 or 9% to 12% growth reflecting strong top line performance, partially offset by a rising cost environment. We now anticipate fiscal year diluted EPS outlook to include a contribution of $0.45 to $0.50 from our increased stake in our Saudi Arabia joint venture, primarily driven by a one-time non-cash gain. I'm pleased we've raised our fiscal year 2021 outlook. Of course, it's important to note we continue to operate in a highly dynamic environment and our monitoring headwinds that could result in impacts moving forward. In closing, I'm also pleased with our broad-based strong results in the first half, which enables us to continue investing in our brands, capabilities and new growth opportunities, all in support of our ambition to accelerate long-term profitable growth for our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to Linda. Andrea, this is Kevin. I can start and Linda can jump in as well. Maybe I'll start with the question on retail inventory levels, and I might broaden it to talk about both inventory levels and the extent of supply chain, both in our warehouse as well as retailers. What I'd tell you is we think we've made pretty good progress over the first half of this fiscal year. And I'd say by and large, we feel pretty good about retail inventory levels with some notable exceptions, there's still portions of our home care portfolio particularly our disinfecting wipes and portions of our disinfecting spray trigger products that we're still not at a point where we can fully meet demand. And in the other area, we still have work to do to catch-up as an Brita. That business continues to perform quite well. We've had four straight quarters of double digit growth, and so we're still not in a position where we can fully support demand on that product. But with the exception of those businesses, I think generally I feel pretty good about retail inventory levels and additionally feel pretty good about inventory levels in our facilities. I would say on Brita, I think we've got a couple more quarters before we think we can catch up. I think by the end of this fiscal year, we'll be in a better position in terms of meeting retail demand. And then I think particularly on our wipes business, it's going to take a while, likely the end of this calendar year we'll be in a position to fully service demand. And then on capacity, you had a question on capacity, Andrea? As Linda said in her prepared remarks, we are starting up our second line at our Georgia wipes facility and that's happening this quarter. And you'll see that start to ramp-up over the next several quarters. Our expectation is by the end of the fiscal year, we'll have more than doubled our wipes capacity from where we were before the pandemic started. And that's a combination of bringing on our facility that's happening now, as well as we continue to bring on additional contract manufacturers. And in Q2, we added more contract manufacturers as well. So we're working both with self manufacturing, as well as third-party manufacturing. That work will continue, well past this fiscal year. Hi, Wendy. Yes, as it relates to the impact of COVID in Q2 was about 90 basis points. What we believe is on a full year basis, it's probably 50 basis point to 75 basis point hit to gross margin. It was higher going forward. We think over time we'll be able to step out of these costs. They're really in two buckets, we continue to expedite transportation and that comes at a higher cost as we're trying to fulfill retail orders as quickly as we can in our supply challenge environment. So there's some increased costs there, as well as the increased spending we're doing with our production team to make sure we're keeping folks safe with increased hygiene activity, as well as enhanced benefits. I think over time as we get through the pandemic and that may push you into fiscal year 2022 for us, but as we move through the pandemic, we'll be able to step out of a good portion of those charges going forward. Yes. Wendy, on wipes it's as we've mentioned, we've stood up a dedicated supply chain internationally. We used to supply our international wipes out of the U.S. so it had a very long supply chain and that came at an increased cost. We've now stood up a supply chain much closer to our markets we're serving. And so I think over time, that's going to be a nice addition to that international portfolio as we build out that, that business. It really just started in Q2. We saw some really nice performance in the second quarter. I think this is a long-term growth runway for us. So you'll see that continue to build through the balance of this year and frankly, that'll continue to build for the next several years. Yes, Chris. As it relates to phasing, as we've updated our expectations for gross margin, as you heard, we now think we're going to be down slightly. One of the biggest changes we're seeing as our expectations for commodities, and we've talked about it, we're clearly an inflationary cycle. If you go back to November, we'd anticipated about 100 basis points of cost headwinds throughout the back half of this fiscal year. We've updated that expectation now where they're going to be closer to 150 basis points hit primarily driven by increasing costs of resin, and I expect that to be pretty consistent through the back half of the year. Sure. Yes. Hi, Steve. I can answer that one. And what I can share with you is our perspective on the back half. And Steve you'll recall back in November, our expectation was in the back half. We'd see our sales declined mid-single digits. With our updated outlook today, it implies our expectation that the back half will be flattish. And if I think about our portfolio in three buckets, I can kind of talk about how we see this playing out. If you think about our U.S. Cleaning business, which includes both our retail and our B2B business, we now think that this is going to continue to grow in the back half of this fiscal year in low single digits. Back in November, our expectation was it would be about flat and keep in mind we're lapping about 40% growth in the back half of last year, so a really strong prior period and we think that business will continue to grow for all the reasons we've been talking about today. On our International business, back in November, we thought that business would grow low single digits. We're now taking that expectation up. We now think we'll grow high single digits in the back half of the year. We're seeing really good results for some of the work we're doing on extending our wipes business. And that will continue to add value over the back half of the year. And then what we call our home essentials business, which is a little less than 50% of our total sales. We've updated our assumption there as well. Originally, we thought that business would decline high single digits. We now think it will grow or \u2013 excuse me, will decline mid single digits. And in all cases, those three segments, all grew double digits in the prior period. And so that \u2013 if you do that math, that gets us to about flat year-over-year in the back half. I'd say importantly though if you take a longer-term perspective and you look at our performance say versus fiscal year 2019, a pre-pandemic environment that would suggest we'll grow somewhere in the 15% to 20% range in the back half of this year. And so I think that the takeaway Steve I just \u2013 I'd offer is this is not just about increasing strength within our disinfecting portfolio. We're seeing performance broadly across our portfolio. We saw that in Q1 and Q2. And it's our expectation going forward what could you see broad strength across the portfolio. Yes. Jason, as it relates to trade spend particularly in Q2, if you look at our price mixes favorable three points in the second quarter, about half of that was favorable price, but half of that was favorable mix. On the price side, a little bit of pricing international, but the bulk of that was reduced trade spending because of the reduced promotional environment. So we've seen that pretty consistently for the front half of this year. Yes, I might separate my answer, Jason, in terms of the industry and what the impact will be for us. I do expect the industry will move back to a more normalized level of promotional spending as everyone gets more back in supply, I think that's to be expected. And then at the same issue for us our promotional spending is down specifically as a Clorox, not necessarily industry because many products we just can't promote right now because of the limited supply capacity we have. So I expect to see increased promotional spending for Clorox when we get back to promoting some of these products that we just haven't been able to promote for the last six months. Yes. That's thanks for asking the question, Jason, I'm sure you can appreciate, we're not ready to talk about plans beyond fiscal year 2021. We're in the process of developing those plans right now, but maybe just big picture what I leave you with to think about is our intent has accelerated the profitable growth rate of this company. As a result of the pandemic, we've talked \u2013 we have millions of new consumers coming into our franchise using our products. We're investing behind that. We have a number of new growth runways we've talked about both in out-of-home, as well as international expansion. And so we see these as long-term opportunities for the company that we're clearly investing in this year that we think generate long-term value. So again, we want to talk about our specific growth rates going forward, but we believe that sets us up nicely to be able to accelerate the long-term growth rate of the company. But in the near term there is going to be lots of noise as you compare quarters, pre- or post-pandemic. There's going to be a lot of noise for a number of quarters. I think when you get past all that, there's long-term opportunity for the company and we're investing behind that. Thanks, Jason. Yes, thanks, Kevin. For us, as it relates to our capital deployment priorities, as you know, Kevin, no change in the priorities we've talked about for quite a while. Now we'll continue to prioritize investing in our base business and you folks see us doing it this year. Kevin, as you mentioned, we're increasing capital spending to increase our production capacity. We're also increasing investments in our brands in terms of advertising R&D and technology. So that'll continue to be job one. We'll also continue to pursue strategic M&A. We want to expand our portfolio, particularly in the health and wellness space. We have a number of areas we're interested in. So we'll continue to evaluate those and look for opportunities to do that. And as you mentioned, we have a very strong balance sheet right now, where we're carrying a little under $800 million on the balance sheet that is elevated. And so, as we've said, if we don't have a need for that cash, we will look for ways to get it back to our shareholders. If you think about this year, I expect over the balance of the year, we're going to return about a $1 billion to our shareholders, about half of that through our dividend, the other half through share repurchases, that's up pretty significantly. We were somewhere around $780 million or so we returned last year. So we've stepped it up this year. And then as we develop our plans for fiscal year 2022 and beyond, we'll continue to evaluate the best opportunities to invest that cash. And as I said, again, if we don't have a good use for it, we're not going to keep it on the balance sheet. We'll look for ways to get that back to folks. Thanks, Kevin."

            "content": "Thanks, Kevin. Hello everyone, and thank you for being with us today. I hope you and your families are well. It's great to be here today sharing Clorox's results for the first half of our fiscal year. My messages this quarter are largely reinforced what we discussed in Q1 with the most important point being that our global portfolio of leading brands continues to play a critical role in people's everyday lives. My first message is that our first half results are rooted in purpose driven growth. Our purpose as a company is to champion people to be well and thrive every single day. And our portfolio of leading brands is the bedrock of our ability to deliver on that promise. Our first half results reinforce the important role our brands play in addressing people's everyday needs. We continue to see broad-based strength in our portfolio with double-digit sales growth for most of our businesses. Clorox disinfecting products continue to be in high demand among consumers, businesses, and healthcare settings. And as people spend more time at home, we're continuing to see strong performance in other parts of our portfolio. Kingsford is a great example. As Lisah mentioned, our Grilling business delivered double-digit sales growth in the quarter, and with a recharge strategy emphasizing innovation. I'm optimistic about the long-term prospects of this business. Before I move on to my second message, I want to thank the Clorox team around the world who shows up every day to live our purpose. They understand that more than ever people and communities need us. I'm so grateful for their passion and commitment. My second message is that Clorox will stay in the driver's seat, continuing our posture of 100% offense to make the most of the opportunities in front of us, while navigating an ongoing dynamic environment. There's no question Clorox has built significant momentum over the last year, and we have every intention of extending that longer term. Our brand portfolio is especially relevant for this environment and for the consumer trends I mentioned last quarter, which we expect to persist beyond the pandemic. Prioritizing hygiene and health and wellness, caring for pets and accelerating digital behaviors related to practically every aspect of their lives. More than ever as homes where the hardest, it's also where consumers are directing their investments. We are spending across many categories to support quality of in-home experiences. This certainly bodes well for our portfolio. We continue to see strong levels of household penetration. Importantly, what we mentioned last quarter about repeat rates across our portfolio is playing out. We're accelerating purchase frequency and repeat users are the source of most of our sales growth across our portfolio. In addition, our strategic investments are creating a virtuous cycle around engaging and retaining new and existing users resulting in a consumer retention rate of nearly 90%. As I mentioned, 100% offense will help us extend this momentum, which as a reminder includes investing more across our portfolio to retain the millions of people buying our brands. Expanding our public health support to more out of home spaces, increase in capital spending for immediate and future production capacity, including wipes expansion in the international, and partnering with our retailers to grow our category. Given the dynamic environment we continue to face, 100% offense also means actively planning for challenges and disruptions in the near and long-term, including an inflationary cost environment, elevated competition in light of category tailwinds and accelerating advancements in digital technology that we expect to impact all areas of our business. What's important is we'll continue to make strategic choices that position us to achieve our ambition to accelerate long-term profitable growth. And finally, my third message is this. As we continue to address immediate priorities related to unprecedented demand, we're also accelerating our progress against our strategy to deliver long-term shareholder value. Our IGNITE strategy continues to put people at the center of everything we do, and helps us make the most of our strategic advantage in the near and long-term. Addressing unprecedented consumer demand for much of our portfolio continues to be an immediate priority. We continue to make progress on a number of businesses. We're bringing in more third party supply sources and launching our new wipes line in our Atlanta facility in the third quarter. Importantly, simplification is our mantra and we're seeing the benefit of focusing on fewer skews, which we expect to continue beyond the pandemic. As I mentioned earlier, we're going Clorox's disinfecting wipes international supported by a dedicated supply chain. Our expansion plans are going very well, and we expect to double the number of countries where Clorox wipes are sold. Another immediate priority is to continue supporting people's safety when they're outside their homes through strategic alliances to support public health. We're expanding our programs with Uber Technologies and Enterprise Holdings. We recently established a multi-year deal with the NBA and look forward to pursuing similar opportunities with other organizations. And as the pandemic continues to take a toll on the economy, we know that far too many people feel financial pressure from unemployment and less discretionary spending. We're mindful of the role we can play to support those who are particularly value sensitive and we'll continue to deliver superior value through meaningful innovation. Importantly, we're also making progress in laying the foundation for long-term growth. We will continue to invest strongly in our global portfolio of leading brands, particularly behind robust innovation that differentiates our products and deliver superior value. We will continue to re-imagine how we work to ensure a strong culture with a highly engaged team that works simpler and faster on strategic priorities. I'm proud of how we've been operating during the pandemic, including accelerating our speed-to-market. And finally, as we said before we view ESG as a contributor to competitive advantage, which is why it's embedded in our business. Achievements this quarter include being included in the 2021 Bloomberg gender equality index, achieving 100% renewable electricity in the U.S. and Canada four years early. Signing on to the energy buyer, federal clean energy policy statement, which calls for a 100% clean energy power sector and donating $1 million to Cleveland Clinic to establish the Clorox public health research grant in support of science-based public health research. We are grateful to play a role in supporting people and communities as we continue to navigate the global pandemic. It only strengthens our resolve in pursuing purpose driven growth, ensuring a strategic link between our impact on the world and long-term value creation for our shareholders. Operator, you may now open the line for questions. Andrea, I'll just add on the shared question, which I think you were connecting this to, which is exactly what we're watching closely. You started to see our share improvement in quarter two. So we're up as a total company, eight-tenths of a point that's up from 52 weeks share of being up a half a point, but what's really encouraging to us as if we dive deeper into the businesses that we have gotten back to an in-stock position on. So starting outside of cleaning, if you look at our Hidden Valley ranch business, cat litter and Kingsford all of them growing share, as we've gotten supplied back up to a place where we can meet demand. And then really encouragingly, if you look at our cleaning business, although we have a ways to go until we can fully meet demand in places where we've been able to improve, we're seeing significant share gains to our Clorox clean-up business, which is a spray, is up eight share points in the spray business in Q2. Clorox Manual Toilet Bowl Cleaner up four points, our Pine-Sol business up 2.5 points, and that corresponds with strong plans we have in place, but also our ability to supply. Hi, Wendy. Thanks for the question. I'll just start with, and you said it, our results have been inconsistent and I'm not satisfied with that, and that is full stop. But if you look at the thesis and you started to talk about this, we really do see these categories being a long-term growth runway for us. And that's why we got into these businesses to start because we see it a nice fit in our overall journey to help people be well and thrive. What we've learned over the last few years as we've operated these is, we made the choice to buy some small brands in a very large $12 billion space. And it's certainly been a hotbed for competition and the lesson we've learned is the ramp-up for the brands is just longer than we thought it was going to be. We see pockets of encouraging results in our renew life relaunch for example in our magnesium supplement business, but there are other places where we're not as satisfied. So, if I take a long-term view to this, we still think these categories are attractive. We still see our ability to innovate, brand build really meaningful in a slew of a lot of things that are going on in therapy. Good claims, good science, but I think the perspective is VMS still only represents about 4% of our business and it's going to take a while before it's a meaningful contributor and we're going to be patients. But I still feel conviction that these are attractive categories too compete. Nik, thanks for the question. So Q2 was another strong quarter for Glad. It grew nicely behind continued strong demand from consumers. We're seeing really good signs of brand health. So our household penetration, up almost a point and a half increased by our retention rates. We're growing repeat rates on the Glad business. So the fundamentals of that business continue to be very strong. You're seeing price gaps where we'd want them to be. And I think what continues to be the differentiator for glad is innovation. It's working really well in the market for us, whether that be our experiential trash bag or if that is our new skew Glad or selects with Clorox are all doing really well. And so as we've said, this is a business where you have to innovate, where you have to bring new benefits to the category and that continues to work well for us. I think if you take a step back and maybe this is a comment agnostic of Glad if you just take your pricing comment and total you're right, we had said we would not take pricing in the height of a pandemic and I still believe that was the right call as we got through the height of it. But as we look forward and as we see the pressure from the cost environment and we see pressure on gross margin, we're going to look to the broad toolbox that we have against our long-term goal of growing EBIT margin. And that toolbox includes things like on the revenue side, managing promotions and ensuring that we can add value through innovation and premiumization, but we will also consider pricing as part of that. And as we look forward, we will see what the right mix is by brands. And we feel given the fact that our portfolio has very high consumer value, the highest we have on record that we're in a position if we need to take pricing to do just that. Thanks, Nik. Sure, Chris. Wipes is obviously a very important and strategic business for us. One category that we created 20 years ago and we'll continue to be aggressive as we think about expanding this business and helping to serve consumers. I think maybe it'd be good to take a broader view of wipes because we're looking at a narrow universe of track channels, but if you look more broadly, the share loss that you're seeing in track channels is not reflective of the fact that we've prioritized our healthcare business to ensure that we have the right supply there. And that our professional business has always had a strong wipes business as well as untracked channels that are very strong. So the broader perspective to be clear; we don't like to lose share anywhere \u2013 anywhere and our goal is to always be growing it over the long-term. But the broader perspective with wipes business is in better shape than you might see in track data. But then even if you look at track data, the only people growing share right now are non-branded or new entrant competitors that are very small. There is no major manufacturer as we all try to ramp up the support. And I think what's going to happen is we're already seeing retailers think about simplification as we move forward, and there's going to be no desire on their part to add 10, 12 whatever a brand sit on the shelf right now that are filling the need. They're going to want to make sure that they're with leading brands, who are innovating and we know that we'll be with Clorox. We feel great about the innovation pipeline we have on the business. We feel great about the fact that our supply is ramping up and we're getting to the place where we'll have double the supply by the end of the year. So I think you're going to start to see as we bring supply back on, share will go in the other direction. Similar to how I highlighted in other businesses, Clorox clean-up eight share points once we brought that back on from a supply perspective; Pine-Sol up 2.5 share points. So this is very much correlated to supply. We think the long-term trends are behind us. And I think the most important part is we have not let up on the innovation and investments, so that as we bring that supply up, we'll be in a terrific place to get back to growing share. Sure. Thanks Lauren. In the case of international, we were pleased to see the strong volume driven organic sales growth, which was really broad based across the portfolio including cleaning and disinfecting Glad, Brita, Litter. And what was encouraging is the early contribution from our wipes expansion is about 20% of the growth we experienced in the quarter. So good early signals that it's working. If we think about the countries, we compete in over 100 countries around the world today, broadly with our portfolio. And the very first priority we have is to expand our presence in our cleaning and disinfecting portfolio in more of those countries. So to your good point, not having to introduce them to the brand in a brand new fashion, but actually just expanding the portfolio we have with those consumers to the offer them the benefit that a wipe brings them. And we've seen that successful so far and, early consumption looks good in those markets. And then, as we think about more broadly, the avenues that we have to introduce our brands to consumers have expanded. E-comm is now away that you can enter into a market, learn more about the consumer in a low cost way that allows us to get early insights and decide if we want to build more of an infrastructure behind in the international business to expand. So I think, what Lauren you're going to see from us is a very disciplined approach in this. We want to be fast, which is why we stood up dedicated supply chain, but we want to continue to be disciplined. And we want to see a strong return on the markets that we enter, and the very first proof points are the fact that we're entering markets. We are already in with an expanded portfolio. Yes. I think on average over the long-term 10% to 11% is in the right ballpark. And what will vary of course, and you bring up a good point of competition is exactly what a quarter or a year looks like. Well, depend on the level of competitive activity. We see the amount of innovation we have. And as you know the 12% we plan to spend in the back half is really dedicated to the fact that we have a great innovation lineup. Two thirds of our innovation will be launched then. And we really see the opportunity to introduce consumers to that innovation to drive trial and then to benefit from the fact that we have very strong repeats right now \u2013 repeat rates right now across the portfolio. So we think about as you know A&SP as a strategic long-term investment. We're always looking at whether we think the right level is, but we are not hesitant to invest when we see strong returns and we're seeing that right now on the base business and strong returns as we start to spend behind innovation. So we'll continue to keep you updated, Lauren, if we have any change to that thinking, but very consistent with what we've said in the past. Sure, Steve. If I think about what pricing does and how we approach this, it's really about managing over the mid to long-term. We don't want to take pricing over short term inflationary and we use trade bonds and we have for Glad in particular over a number of years to manage through those short-term impacts. But as we see a progressing cost environment coming up here, pricing is something we absolutely will consider across our portfolio where it makes sense. And, I think, it's safe to say pricing isn't something that is an easy thing to go execute. It takes a lot to do with excellence. And it comes with ensuring that we partner with retailers to have plans that grow their categories. And I feel like we are better positioned than we have been in a very long time on that. We have a terrific slate of innovation across our portfolio and particularly for Glad. We are spending against our brands, which retailers can appreciate in an incredible way right now because we're bringing people to the physical or digital shelf. And our portfolio is at the best place it's ever been from a consumer value measure perspective. So more people deem our portfolio, a percentage of our portfolio is superior than ever before. So I think with all of that, we're well positioned to do it. And what I wouldn't say is, I don't have a perfect crystal ball. Pricing is always something that we have to go out and we're dedicated to executing with excellence, but we would expect there are little bumps here and there, but we'll manage through them. And over the long-term we know that it's a good thing for us to do and it's right for the category. So again, no plans at this point on any of our brands, but we'll look at it as we head into the remainder of the year and next year as an option for us to expand margins. Sure. And absolutely the environment has been bumpy for businesses in this space, and that's absolutely the case for Burt's Bees, but we have very strong conviction in the long-term portfolio as it stands today. And I think a couple of things jump out Steve and you've touched on a couple of them. The first is accelerating our progress in e-commerce and we have done that and leaned in over the last couple of quarters with very good results on the Burt's Bees business. The second is innovation and innovating in spaces where the consumer is particularly apt to be transitioning today as we're seeing that in skincare, we're seeing that in the healthcare space in general, and with that we have launched a new line of naturally clean hand products that helped to meet that need. And then obviously very strong conviction and continued conviction in our lip care business. We're still the market share leader in lip balm. And although we've had some weather issues that have impacted the overall category still feel really good about that business and our ability to innovate there. So overall, from a Burt's perspective, we'll continue to make tweaks as we learn from the consumer. But I think this is a brand where more than ever people are going to want things that they feel care for them and care for them using the power of nature. Sure. Thanks, Kevin. Again, let's maybe step back and talk about pricing as a strategic lever and really what we're trying to do overall. And as you know, we're trying to expand our EBIT margins 25 to 50 basis points over the long run. And what we always look at is the broad set of tools that we have in our toolbox to manage cost wherever they may be. And one critical element of how we've done that over the short-term is cost savings, for example, and we had another robust savings this quarter and we expect to continue that. And I think as part of our IGNITE strategy, we put additional levers in place thinking about the role of technology and the role of sustainability could play and helping us do that over the long-term. So we're very much focused on managing as many of the short-term cost inflation increases that we see through those types of levers. What we're looking at right now is over the mid- to long-term based off of the outlook what role could pricing play. And that has to play a broader role in the category plans that we have. It's not something in isolation. So what we're focused on right now is strong innovation, strong brand investments, ensuring that we have the right assortment on shelves with retailers to match the fact that consumers' behaviors and needs have changed. And that is really the single highest priority we had in addition to supply over the last many months and continues to be over the next few months. So that would be why I would answer we're not ready to announce any type of pricing action at this moment because what we're focused on is serving consumers, what we're focused on is growing our categories, getting back to supply and we're focused on a terrific innovation agenda we have for the back half. And if we can do that with excellence, we will get to a place where as Kevin said, it's a very nice back half as you look back and take a broader view compared to fiscal year 2019. What gives us conviction though in the strategic \u2013 our strategic ability to take pricing again is the health of our brands, and the fact that we have been investing, the fact that we do have an innovation portfolio that strong, the fact that we have been partnering openly and transparently with retailers on how we get through the last 9 to 10 months together. So as we make those decisions, we feel confident in that overall suite of activity that we have that can help the categories. We'll continue to evaluate when the right time might be to do that. But for now we are really focused on investing in those brands, getting capacity back to 100% and innovation. Thanks, Kevin. Thanks, Olivia. You're hitting on exactly what we're talking to retailers about right now and we're partnering with them on is what is the long-term for these categories as we get through what's been an incredibly unprecedented, I think we can never underestimate or overuse that word unprecedented. And we're really turning to what does the future look like. What will the habits and behaviors that have started today that we believe will be very sticky in the future mean for the assortment that's needed, for the type of promotion that's needed for the shelf space. And what I would say is that varies depending on the category. And our categories have always been different at shelf, what's required from an assortment perspective, how much is merchandise et cetera. So we're working with them on those individual plans. We're bringing them consumer insights and what we're seeing in the changing behaviors. So for example, the fact that people are cleaning and disinfecting more, and we expect that to continue. They're cleaning different surfaces. They're thinking about the fact that when they leave the house, they're thinking about those surfaces around them in a different way, and we're helping them to plan for that. And then I think really importantly, what we've talked to them about is the innovation needed in order to address those needs and how we ensure we introduce that innovation in a quick manner that we get it on the physical or digital shelf and that we get the right trial behind that. And retailers are really receptive to hearing that right now. And in fact, are loving the fact that we're coming with so much innovation despite all of the craziness over the last nine months. So without getting into specific category details, that's exactly what we're doing. And retailers will begin to make those first moves as supply gets to the place where we're able to fully meet it and you'll start to see what it looks like online. I think a couple of themes, the first is simplification. We've taken the opportunity to simplify our portfolio, to help us run faster and many of our businesses, and that's panned out really well for us. I'm actually really well for retailers and so they're going to continue to drive simplification. We win in that environment being a number one and number two share brands. And then the second thing is omnichannel, making sure that a consumer has access to the right products depending on where they are and where they're shopping. And we're focused on that with retailers and ensuring that they have all of those right levers in place depending on where consumers are entering into their store. Thanks, Olivia. Thank you, everyone. I'm happy with our first half results and look forward to strong execution of our plans in the back half. We'll speak again on our next call in May. Please stay well."

            "content": "Thank you, Sharon. Welcome everyone and thank you for joining us today. We hope you and your families are continuing to stay safe and well. On the call with me today are Linda Rendle, our CEO; and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. Now a few reminders before we go into results. We're broadcasting this call over the internet and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including statements related to the expected or potential impact of COVID-19. These statements are based on management's current expectation, but may differ from actual results or outcomes. In addition, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section, which identifies various factors that could affect such forward-looking statements, and the non-GAAP financial information section, including the tables that reconcile non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, both of which are located at the end of today's earnings release, which has also been posted on our website and filed with the SEC. I'll start by covering our usual top-line commentary with highlights from each of our segments. Kevin will then address our total company results, as well as our FY 2021 outlook. Finally, Linda will offer her perspective and we'll close with Q&A. For the total company, Q2 sales increased 27% with growth in every reportable segment. It reflects about 1 point of net benefit from the July acquisition that gives us a majority share in our Saudi Arabia joint venture and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. On an organic basis, Q2 sales grew 26%. I will now go through our results by segment. In our Health and Wellness segment, Q2 sales were up 42% reflecting double digits increases in two of three businesses. Our Cleaning business had double digit sales growth behind strong ongoing demand across our portfolio. Consumption remains high and importantly we're continuing to see increases in household penetration and repeat rates among existing and new users driven by new routines developed from the prolonged pandemic as well as strategic brand investments. While we expect tough comparisons as we let these very high growth rates, we'll continue to work to retain the larger base of loyal consumers we've built for our cleaning and disinfecting products even after a critical mass of the population has been vaccinated. We're continuing to make progress on our supply expansion, including a new line of wipes plant coming online this quarter. We're also continuing to identify new sources of supply for other products experiencing constraints, including our disinfecting spray products. As we're able to better meet consumer demands for our base products, we're looking forward to bringing back our Clorox compostable wipes along with a stream of exciting innovation in the coming months. Our professional products business had another quarter of double-digit sales growth behind continued high demand for our cleaning and disinfecting products. It's worth noting though that while demand from businesses such as healthcare facilities has remained high. We've seen softer demand from businesses negatively impacted by ongoing mobility restrictions like commercial cleaning and food service institutions. That's why we're leaning into other out-of-home spaces through strategic alliances and are encouraged by our progress. While not yet a meaningful contributor in Q2, our out-of-home partnerships are expanding. We're excited to announce a new multi-year deal with the NBA and existing partner. Lastly, within this segment, our sales in vitamins, minerals and supplements business decreased in Q2. This is a business where results have not been consistent and we clearly have more work to do. As you remember, we relaunched RenewLife last fall. While we've seen improvements in all outlet consumption, it is not yet delivering the consistent results we want. With more than half American consumers saying they intend to continue taking vitamins and supplements, we continue to believe in the attractiveness of this category. Now turning to Household segment. Quarterly sales were up 20% with growth in all three businesses for a third consecutive quarter. Grilling sales were up double digits driven by continued strong consumption, which reflects the dramatic rise in in-home meal occasion as people continue to spend more time at home. Behind our strategic collaboration with retailers, we've been able to grow household penetration for a third consecutive quarter including among millennials and low income consumers. As we begin planning for the next grilling season, we're building on our innovation through expanded distribution of our new Kingsford pellets and bringing new flavors to our Kingsford product lineup. With consumer spending more on their backyards and backyards and grills, we feel optimistic about the future of this business. Cat Litter sales were up by double digits in Q2 supported by innovation and continued strong performance online. Our Fresh Step with Gain Original Scented Litter with the power of Febreze as well as our Fresh Step Clean Paws Litter continued to perform very well and we're supporting them through a new advertising campaign. A record number of people have become pet parents since the onset of the pandemic in 2020. Making this yet another example of how our diverse portfolio is particularly suited to the times. Glad sales increased in Q2 behind strong demands across our portfolio of trash bags, wraps and food bags as people continue to spend more time at home. Our latest innovation Glad ForceFlex with Clorox trash bags launched in September and is building distribution quickly earning positive reviews. In our lifestyle segment, Q2 sales were up 9% with double digit growth in two of three businesses. Brita sales were up by double digits for a fourth consecutive quarter behind continued strong shipments of pitchers as well as filters. Just as with wipes and sprays, we're continuing to work through supply chain constraints in our Brita business, which has been impacting our shares. We feel good about the long-term prospects of this business especially since once people buy a Brita pitcher, they tend to stay in our franchise with continued purchases of filters. Importantly, as household penetration for Brita keeps growing, we're building brand loyalty among these consumers. The food business had double digit sales increase for a third straight quarter behind ongoing strong consumption of our Hidden Valley Ranch products, particularly dry seasoning and bottle dressings. With more and more people eating at home during the pandemic, household penetration has grown to an all-time high, including above average growth among millennials. We're building on this momentum with a stream of innovation, including Hidden Valley secret sauces, and most recently Hidden Valley Plant based Ranch dressing, which has been supported by strong advertising investments. Burt's Bees sales decreased by double digits as the business continued to be impacted by mobility restrictions as well as changes to consumer shopping and usage habits as a result of the pandemic. This quarter unseasonably warm weather also impacted lip balm sales. Despite these challenges, we're making progress in the fast-growing online channel where the brand had double digit growth in Q2, and we remain confident in the long-term trajectory of this business. Lastly, in international, Q2 sales grew 23% driven by double digit shipment growth in all major regions. The growth reflects about 9 points of benefit from the Saudi acquisition and about 4 points of unfavorable foreign currency headwinds. Organic sales grew 18%. The recent investment we made to create a dedicated international supply chain for Clorox disinfecting wipes is starting to pay off giving us the ability to not only meet ongoing elevated demand in existing markets, but also to expand to new countries. This is a strategic growth platform for the company and we're supporting it through additional advertising investments. Now, I'll turn it over to Kevin, who will discuss Q2 results as well as updated outlook for FY 2021."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference.\nLisah Burhan: Thank you, Sharon. Welcome, everyone and thank you for joining us. We certainly hope you and your family continue to remain safe and healthy in what remains a challenging environment. As usual, we have a few reminders before we go into results. We are broadcasting this call over the Internet and a replay of the call will be available for 7 days at our website, at cloroxcompany.com. Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements, including statements related to the expected or potential impact of COVID-19. These statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations, but may differ from actual results or outcomes. In addition, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures.

Turning to today\u2019s discussion of our results, I will start by covering our usual top line commentary with highlights in each of our segments. Kevin will then address our total company results, as well as our FY \u201821 outlook. Finally, Linda will offer her perspective and we\u2019ll close with Q&A. For the total company, Q1 sales increased 27%, reflecting about a point of benefit from the acquisition of majority interest in our joint venture in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and about a point of headwinds from unfavorable foreign exchange impact. This quarter\u2019s 27% organic sales growth is supported by double digit sales growth in eight of our 10 businesses. I will now go through our results by segment. In our Health and Wellness segment, Q1 sales were up 28%, reflecting double digit growth in all three businesses. Our Cleaning business had another quarter of double digit growth behind continued strong demand, for our disinfecting products. While we continue to make progress expanding supply, we\u2019re still not at a point where we can fully meet ongoing elevated demand. Despite those constraints, our Clorox brand continues to see increases in both household penetration and repeat rates. We\u2019ve been investing behind this momentum to convert new users to loyal consumers, and we\u2019ve been seeing very strong return on our investment. On the innovation front, our bleach complexion effort is now complete. The Clorox fabric sanitizer platform and Clorox disinfecting wet mopping cloth both continue to show strong growth. On a related note, our wet mopping cloth, along with our Clorox and Clorox Scentiva branded disinfecting wipes and Pine-Sol multi-surface cleaner, all recently received approval from the EPA, for kill claims against the virus that causes COVID-19 on hard non-porous surfaces. Our professional products business also had double-digit sales growth behind strong shipments across all of our disinfecting product lines. A key driver of growth this quarter was the total Clorox Total 360 system, which uses an electrostatic technology to deliver disinfectants to large, hard to reach areas. To support sales and continued momentum in this business, we\u2019re bringing online, new production capacity this month, for the disinfectant used in these devices. In addition, we\u2019ve created a dedicated out of home team, that focuses on growth opportunities in new channels and spaces, to further build on strategic alliances with already established, with Uber Technologies, United Airlines, AMC Theaters and Cleveland Clinic. Lastly, within this segment, our Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements business grew sales by double digits this quarter. This strong growth was driven by shipments to replenish retail inventories, following the recent supply disruptions, and by shipments in support of our RenewLife brand re-launch. Our priorities this year are to continue to improve service levels, in order to capture the strong consumption trend, execute the RenewLife brand re-launch with excellence, and deliver consumer meaningful innovation. Turning to the Household segment, Q1 sales were up 39% with growth in all three businesses. Grilling sales more than doubled this quarter, due mainly to strong consumption behind the grilling occasions and increased household penetration. Sales growth this quarter was also driven partly by customer replenishment of inventory. We\u2019ve been very pleased to see the strong turnaround of this business, reflected in our continued share growth, strong collaboration with the retailers, and successful entry into the pellet category, with our Kingsford pellets continuing to build distribution and share. With recent increases in grilling occasions and new households, including millennials, we\u2019re optimistic about the prospects of this business, and will invest behind this momentum to drive long-term profitable category growth. Glad sales were up by double-digits in Q1, behind ongoing strong demand for our products, as consumers continue to spend more time at home. We\u2019re building on this momentum with a consistent stream of innovation, including our new Glad ForceFlex with Clorox trash bags, which launched in September. This product eliminates Food and bacterial odors throughout the trash bags, and has already earned more than 1,000 five star ratings online from consumers. Our Glad ForceFlex trash bags with unique fragrances and colors, which launched in Q3, also continue to perform well, and are among top selling new items at major retailers. Cat Litter sales grew in Q1, driven mainly by strong online shipments in innovation, supported by higher advertising investments. We\u2019re encouraged by our return to share growth in Fresh Step, behind the continued strong performance of Fresh Step Clean Paws innovation platform and the strong start of Fresh Step with Gain Original Scented Litter with the power of Febreze. In our Lifestyle segment, Q1 sales increased 17% with double-digit growth in two of three businesses. Brita sales were up by double-digits for the third consecutive quarter. The growth is driven by \u2013 mainly by continued strong consumption, especially in larger sized systems and long last systems and filters. Sales growth was also driven partly by customer replenishment of inventory, an effort our team has been very focused on. Household penetration for Brita continues to grow, which gives us more reason to invest further. We\u2019ll be introducing a new and improved LongLast Plus filter that allows water to flow faster and captures more contaminants, along with a new pitcher. The Food business also saw double-digit sales growth, behind ongoing strong consumption of our Hidden Valley Ranch products, which continues to benefit from more at-home eating occasions. This is another business where we\u2019re seeing household penetration growth. We will continue to invest in innovation, and are encouraged to see a strong start to our new Hidden Valley Ranch secret sauce dressing. Finally Burt\u2019s Bees sales decreased this quarter. As the business continued to be impacted by lower store traffic, especially in parts of the store, where Burt\u2019s Bees products are typically found. We have since accelerated our online strategy and strengthened our presence in the fast growing cough and cold category, with the launch of a new line of Rescue Balm with turmeric. While we expect the category-wide challenges to persist in the short term, we have strong confidence in the Burt\u2019s Bees brand and its long-term growth prospects, supported by a robust innovation platform. Now turning to International, Q1 sales grew 18%, driven by ongoing elevated demand for our products, disinfecting products, and essential household products, across nearly every geography. Organic sales grew 17%, reflecting about 9 points of benefit from the Saudi JV acquisition and about 8 points of unfavorable foreign currency headwinds. Our international business has very strong momentum and we are looking to build on that through investments that accelerate our IGNITE Strategy. Increasing the stake in our Saudi JV is just an example of that. Another example is the international expansion of our Clorox disinfecting wipes, which are now being supported by a dedicated supply chain, separate from that in the U.S. This will allow us to better meet ongoing elevated demand in our existing international markets where we currently offer wipes, and to launch this consumer preferred form into new geographies. Now, I will turn it over to Kevin, who will discuss Q1 performance, as well as our updated outlook for FY \u201821.\nKevin Jacobsen: Thank you, Lisa and thank you everyone for joining us today. I sincerely hope you and your families are well. I am pleased with our very strong start to the fiscal year, reflecting broad-based strength across our portfolio, with double-digit volume, sales and profit growth in each of our reporting segments. Additionally, each reporting segment delivered gross margin expansion, contributing to our eighth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion for the company. As you saw in our press release, we raised our fiscal year \u201821 outlook, given the strength of our Q1 results and our expectations for a higher top line growth over the balance of the fiscal year. Turning to our first quarter results, first quarter sales were up 27%, driven by 22 points of organic volume growth and 5 points of favorable price mix. Sales results also included one point of growth from acquiring majority control of our Saudi joint venture, offset by one point of FX headwinds. On an organic basis, sales grew 27%. Gross margin for the quarter increased 400 basis points to 48% compared to 44% in the year ago quarter. First quarter gross margin included the benefit of strong volume growth, as well as 170 basis points of cost savings and 150 basis points of favorable mix. These factors were partially offset by 300 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs, which were similar to last quarter, included temporary COVID-19 spending. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales came in at 12% compared to 14% in the year ago quarter. Primarily from increased operating leverage. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels as a percentage of sales, came in at about 9%, equal to the year ago quarter. We\u2019re spending for our U.S. retail business coming in at 11% of sales. Importantly, this represented about a 30% increase in advertising support this quarter, compared to the year ago period, reflecting stronger investments to support our ambition to accelerate long-term profitable growth. Our first quarter effective tax rate was 21%, compared to 22% in the year ago quarter, primarily driven by the impact of our increased ownership of our Saudi joint venture. Net of all these factors, we delivered diluted net earnings per share of $3.22 versus $1.59 in the year ago quarter, an increase of 103%. Excluding the contribution from our Saudi joint venture acquisition, Q1 diluted EPS grew 66%. As you also saw in our press release, Q1 net cash provided by operations was $383 million versus $271 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 41%. Our strong cash flow was due to profitable sales growth, partially offset by higher employee incentive compensation payments made in the first quarter, which were related to our fiscal year \u201820 performance. Turning to our fiscal year outlook, we now anticipate fiscal year sales to grow between 5% to 9%, reflecting our strong Q1 results as well as our raised expectations for the balance of the fiscal year, including double-digit growth in Q2. And as we noted last quarter, we continue to anticipate deceleration in the back half of fiscal year \u201821, as we lap double-digit growth in the same period in fiscal year \u201820, when we saw the initial spike in COVID-19. Importantly we continue to assume or back half sales results will be significantly stronger relative to pre-pandemic sales levels. We also continue to anticipate about 1 point of contribution from our Saudi joint venture, offset by one point of foreign exchange headwinds. On an organic sales basis, our outlook assumes 5% to 9% growth. We expect fiscal year gross margin to be about flat, reflecting the benefit of strong cost savings and higher sales, offset by rising commodity and transportation costs, as well as temporary costs related to COVID-19. For perspective, we expect gross margin expansion in the front half, followed by a contraction over the balance of the fiscal year, as we lap gross margin expansion of 250 basis points delivered in the back half of fiscal year \u201820, driven by strong operating leverage from robust shipment growth during the initial phase of the pandemic. We continue to expect fiscal year selling and administrative expenses to be about 14% of sales, as we continue to invest aggressively in long-term growth initiatives. Additionally, we continue to anticipate fiscal year advertising spending to be about 11% of sales, spending closer to 10% in the front half of the year and 12% in the back half, in support of our robust innovation program. We now expect our fiscal year tax rate to be between 21% to 22%. Net of these factors, we now expect fiscal year \u201821 diluted EPS to increase between 5% to 8%, or $7.70 to $7.95 reflecting our assumption for stronger top line performance, partially offset by a rising cost environment. As we shared last quarter, our fiscal year diluted EPS outlook continues to include a contribution of $0.45 to $0.53 from our increased stake in our Saudi Arabia joint venture, primarily driven by a one-time non-cash gain. Excluding the impact of the Saudi acquisition, our fiscal year diluted EPS reflects strong investments behind the robust momentum we\u2019re seeing broadly in our portfolio. We\u2019re engaging new consumers, supporting back half innovation plans and expanding our portfolio into new channels and markets, all in support of our ambition to accelerate long-term profitable growth. In closing, I am pleased with our very strong start to fiscal year \u201821, both top and bottom line performance across our reporting segments. This provides a strong foundation for a continued momentum, which we plan to drive through aggressive investments in our IGNITE Strategy, in support of creating long-term shareholder value. And with that, I will turn it over to Linda.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks, Kevin. Hello everyone and thank you for being with us today. I hope you are well and in good spirits, as we continue to navigate this pandemic. It\u2019s great to be joining you on my first call as CEO, especially after the tremendous first quarter we delivered. Our results show what Clorox does best. We serve people who count on our brands, especially during a time when they need to feel safe, and when their home is the center of their world. This reinforces my first message, our outstanding results are a reflection of our team\u2019s dedication to serving consumers and communities. I am incredibly proud to see the broad based strength in our portfolio, with double-digit sales and profit growth in all reporting segments. In the last 8 months, all eyes have been on Clorox disinfecting products, and our brands delivered once again this quarter, with double-digit sales growth in our Cleaning and Professional Products businesses, reflecting continued higher usage of products in homes, businesses and healthcare settings. And now, we\u2019re also shining a brighter light on the terrific performance delivered by other parts of our portfolio, with double-digit sales growth in eight of 10 businesses, demonstrating the important role our brands play in addressing people\u2019s everyday needs. It\u2019s particularly gratifying to see great results from our Grilling and Glad businesses, as the team has been relentless in driving progress on our business plans, including meaningful innovation. Based on double-digit top line increases and significant margin expansion in our first quarter, we delivered very strong earnings growth for our shareholders and I\u2019m happy we were able to raise our fiscal year outlook. These results would not be possible without the passion and commitment of our Clorox teammates around the world. I\u2019m thankful and proud of how they live by our values, and take to heart our role, in supporting consumers and communities. While I feel good about our financial performance for the quarter, there is one thing that continues to keep me up at night. Our ongoing focus to meet unprecedented demand for much of our portfolio, we are certainly encouraged by the progress we\u2019re making in a number of businesses, including having Clorox Bleach mostly back on store shelves, but there is more work to be done. I can assure you that our teams are leaving no stone unturned across all businesses experiencing elevated demand. We\u2019re continuing to focus on products that can be made faster, and investing significantly in third party supply sources in an effort to expedite our products to retailers. Our consumers, retail partners and communities are counting on us, and I want people to know that maximizing supply continues to be top priority. Next the Clorox team and I will play 1% offense behind our strong portfolio of leading brands consumers love, in support of our ambition to accelerate long-term profitable growth. I feel privileged to be CEO of this special company and I have my sights set on extending our momentum longer term. In this uncertain environment, people are turning to brands they trust, and we\u2019re proud to have trusted brands in our categories. We\u2019re seeing this play out in strong helpful penetration, not just in our disinfecting products, but in many parts of our portfolio. For perspective, the percentage of our total portfolio was stable or growing household penetration has more than doubled year-over-year, and as I look beyond the pandemic and try to answer the question of whether or not we can sustain our strong results, I\u2019m encouraged by the trends we\u2019re seeing, particularly consumer behaviors formed during the last seven months. They are good indicators our brands will continue to play a meaningful role in people\u2019s daily life. For example, people are prioritizing Health and Wellness, drinking more water and taking vitamins and supplements, focusing on safety and hygiene, cleaning and disinfecting, in and out of their homes. Staying home more, including cooking, grilling, spending time with family and adopting a pet. Spending more time online with about 90% of people saying they\u2019ve shopped online since the pandemic. There are strong signs these behaviors will stick over the long term, as people have been building these habits for three times longer than it normally takes routines to form. And while early, we are encouraged by the strong repeat rates we are seeing across our portfolio, among core and new consumers. This is the time for 100% offense and that means investing significantly behind our global portfolio, including through advertising and market leading innovation. Increasing capital spending to expand production capacity in the near and long term and partnering with retailers, to enhance shopping experiences and grow our categories. With the strength of our global portfolio, the sustained consumer behaviors we are seeing and our significant investments to drive growth, Clorox is in a great position to keep winning with consumers. And finally, the defining opportunity for Clorox is simple, to serve even more people around the world, with the strategy that helps us make the most of who we are and where we have strategic advantage. Our IGNITE Strategy puts people at the center of everything we do, and fundamentally we will address consumer needs and follow them in the most meaningful ways we can. Here is what I would highlight Clorox is a health and wellness company at heart. With the strength of our brands and capabilities in disinfecting, we\u2019re in a great position to extend our role in public health. We will continue to lean into the strategic alliances we\u2019ve established with leading brands to keep their customers safe and we will certainly pursue more of these types of relationships with other organizations, to increase our support for people outside of their homes. I am also excited about expanding Clorox disinfecting wipes in International, supported by a dedicated supply chain that will allow us to scale this business in our existing markets and enter new geographies. More than ever, people are online and we believe digital behavior is here to stay. Clorox has leaned into e-commerce and digital marketing early, so that people can engage with our brands, in a more personal and relevant way. As people navigate a tough economy with pressures from unemployment and less discretionary spending, they\u2019ll continue to turn to brands they trust, and we\u2019ll continue to earn their trust and loyalty by focusing on superior value. And what\u2019s also important to me, is that we continue to be committed to growing the right way, guided by our values and with ESG embedded into our business. It\u2019s how we help our people our communities and our planet thrive now and in the future. Operator, you may now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Hi, thank you and congrats everybody for the results. Linda, I was just following up from your comments and also Kevin on, kind of the momentum of the portfolio, and obviously you raised your guide for organic. But it does look like your EPS could have some room here. I was just trying to see if you can help us like gauge the level of investment, or perhaps some of the mix effect that we should be seeing, so that you kept your EPS relatively under control, given the gain that you had just to kind of parse out what part of it is investment in promo or just a mix effect? Thank you.\nKevin Jacobsen: Hi Andrea, this is Kevin. I can talk about our EPS, as you think about the balance of the year. So as you mentioned, we\u2019ve raised our expectations for the year 5% to 8% off to a very strong start to the year. If you think about the impact of the balance of the year, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve done the math, we are projecting we will be down in the back half of the year on our EPS year-over-year, that\u2019s primarily driven by the impact of the prior year. If you recall, we grew EPS, about 30% in the back half of fiscal year \u201820. So from the initial impact of COVID-19, the pantry loading, very strong results in the back half of the year. We have to lap that and in addition to lapping that, as we\u2019ve spoken in the last couple of calls, we are leaning in and investing behind the additional growth opportunities we see in front of us. And you may have heard in my prepared remarks, we think that advertising investment will be back-half loaded. So we would expect to be spending about 12% of sales in the back half. One, supporting a very robust innovation program we have teed up for the back half of the year, as well as pursuing a number of new growth initiatives, both our partnerships and some of the international opportunities we are spending behind. And maybe just a last comment I\u2019d make, Andrea, and I think you know this about us. We are certainly not looking to maximize one quarter, but making sure we\u2019re taking the right investments that generate long-term value. And so, we think there is a good opportunity for us to do that, and we will certainly do it in the back half of the year.\nAndrea Teixeira: That\u2019s fair. And if I can just ask about Professional, where do you think this business can become, as you are progressing with all these investments and new partnerships?\nLinda Rendle: Yes. Professional has been a strong part of our portfolio for a number of years, with high-single digit increases up to this point, and we continue to see a long runway for the business, both in the businesses that are established well today, in the Healthcare and Industrial customer setting, but also we\u2019re setting our sights on expanding the reach this business can have, as consumers start to leave their home and we can create environments, partnering with businesses to keep them safe. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on right now, is investing in the people to support that future growth, investing in the innovation to support that future growth, and of course investing in the brand, so that people continue to turn to the most trusted cleaning disinfecting brand with Clorox.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you, both.\nOperator: Next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi.\nWendy Nicholson: Hi, my first question is just sort of a follow-up to that, totally get the difficult comparison year-over-year in the March and June quarters, a 100%. But I also heard you call out higher commodities, and may be freight. And I just wanted to ask what your thoughts were on pricing, whether you plan to take price increases to offset some of those commodity increases, or whether you feel like the market is tentative and shaky enough, where it\u2019s better to potentially hold off on pricing?\nLinda Rendle: Yes, Wendy. Thanks for the question. We are committed to not taking pricing during the pandemic, it\u2019s to do the right thing and we want to make sure consumers have our products at the right value. And so what we\u2019re focused on right now, is a continued lean into our aggressive cost savings program that we\u2019ve had for a number of years, to ensure that we have the fuel to manage the investments that we have and of course to manage any bumpiness we expect in commodities. But we do expect cost increases through the back half as you said, and we\u2019re monitoring that environment closely. But again we are committed to ensuring that consumers have our brand during a recessionary time at the right value, not taking pricing during a pandemic and leveraging our cost savings program to manage through short-terms up and down.\nWendy Nicholson: Got it. And that actually leads into my second question, which is kind of thinking sort of strategically, but also very much with an eye toward the dollars that you\u2019re investing in capacity. I mean clearly, there is a surge right now and the fact that you are signing so many agreements with the airlines or whatever, I mean clearly there is just a huge demand for disinfecting products and wipes in particular. But there will be a day when that passes. I\u2019m kind of curious just as you think about capital spending, are you hurrying to build capital to support demand that is I think going to be huge for some time to come, but is eventually going to fade. How do you think about that conceptually, so that you don\u2019t end up with a lot of capital, but ends up not being needed two years or three years down the road?\nLinda Rendle: Got it, Wendy. I think it would be helpful to step back and just talk a little bit about what we\u2019re seeing in the macro environment, and why we have strong belief that we\u2019re going to see a lot of these behaviors continue well into the future. We\u2019re seeing consumers in the U.S. and around the world, cleaning much more frequently, cleaning new surfaces and of course cleaning both in and outside of the home and that is true for business customers as well, where they\u2019re having to welcome people back to their businesses, with safe environment. From our research with consumers, they are telling us that they expect many of these behaviors to stick, regardless of whether or not, there is a vaccine or how long COVID goes on, because it\u2019s a way to reassure their health and wellness and for them to feel safe. So we\u2019re hearing from consumers that this is here to stay and we\u2019ve seen evidence of that in past pandemics, as well as just bad cold and flu seasons, where people have adopted new behaviors. The other thing I would tell you, in addition to capacity supporting just that change in behavior, we also see significant growth opportunities that are brand new to our business. Expanding Clorox Disinfecting Wipes and international, if you step back, we\u2019re in about 100 countries around the world with very little presence in disinfecting wipes. That\u2019s a big opportunity for us, complete white space that as we built capacity, we can lean into that even further. And the other thing that I would talk about is, in the industrial space, there\u2019s new technologies that we have, and we think those cleaning behaviors will need to change on a more permanent basis, to reassure people that it\u2019s safe to enter those businesses. And so that\u2019s the other thing I would just put in perspective. We can shift supply to the opportunities that are most poignant at the moment, as we move forward. And then of course Wendy, as you always know we\u2019re really good at balancing and spending capital in a disciplined way, and we can make adjustments to our network, whether that be through in-housing or working with third party manufacturers as we move forward, and we\u2019ve been very balanced in how we\u2019ve approached this, so that we can do just that.\nWendy Nicholson: Great, thanks. Sounds terrific.\nOperator: Next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone and congrats on a really strong result. Just kind of building on Wendy\u2019s question a little bit. I wanted to kind of dig into the organic sales growth guidance. So not expecting think it\u2019s a wide range, but understandably so, up 5% to 9% core sales coming up from what was previously flat to up low-single digits in August. So can you dimension for us a bit, what\u2019s changed since early August? This is \u2013 retail is carrying higher inventory levels now in some of the higher demand category, an extremely strong quarter that was not anticipated in early August, with Kingsford as an example. Maybe just dimension for us, because the magnitude of the upward revision is noteworthy. Maybe just kind of dimensionalize for us a bit, what\u2019s driving the more bullish outlook? And then I have a follow-up for Kevin, on cash flow.\nKevin Jacobsen: Hey Kevin, this is Kevin. I can take your first question as well, as it relates to sales. And to your point, we\u2019ve taken up our expectation for the balance of the year pretty materially. I think there is a number of things we are seeing that\u2019s giving us even more confidence for this year. The first is, we continue to see growing household penetration. So we are now three quarters into the pandemic in Q1, and it continued to grow. Additionally, we\u2019re seeing increased repeat purchase rates with both new and existing consumers, and so growing household penetration, accelerating repurchase rates, both giving us more confidence, and as you know, we\u2019ve been exploring a number of additional growth opportunities, both our partnerships, as well as expanding our disinfecting portfolio outside the U.S., and we\u2019re seeing more and more opportunity in both those spaces, that will start to contribute in the back half of the year. And then maybe the last time I\u2019d mentioned is, while we knew, we\u2019d have a very strong year as it relates to our disinfecting portfolio, we\u2019re seeing very strong results outside of disinfectant. I mean you clearly saw our results in our Household segment. Again, we\u2019re seeing users, more users coming into those categories, they\u2019re increasing their frequency of usage, and we think that\u2019s going to continue through the balance of the fiscal year. So I\u2019d say those are the key drivers that led to us taking up the outlook for the full year.\nKevin Grundy: Got it. Alright, thanks Kevin. That\u2019s helpful. I have a number of questions, but I\u2019ll \u2013 just one more if I may. Just on with respect to balance sheet and cash flow, so through the cash balance is higher than you are normally carrying and the business typically needs, from a working capital perspective. Understanding is a lot the business is considering now with respect to additional capacity and so forth, but between the higher than normal cash balances, the business is throwing off a significant amount of cash from operations. Talk a little bit about if you were, just in terms of intentions with respect to capex and is there any intention to return to share buybacks as well, something that the company has kind of gotten away from a little bit in recent quarters, but now as we sort of move through the pandemic and there is greater visibility, it could be something that\u2019s potentially on the table. So, thanks for all that and I will pass it on.\nKevin Jacobsen: Sure. Happy to, Kevin, talk about cash. And as you mentioned, Kevin, we are seeing a pretty significant acceleration in the cash we are generating. Last year, our cash provided by operations was up about 56%. In Q1, it was up about 40%. We\u2019re sitting on just a little under $900 million of cash on the balance sheet, which to your point is more than we typically hold. That really gives us quite a bit of financial flexibility. So for Lind and I, job one will be to continue to look for opportunities to invest in our base business. We know that\u2019s where we can continue to create very strong returns for our shareholders. So we will do that, including investing more in capacity to the extent we think that\u2019s required. Additionally, we will continue to look for targeted M&A. We still have an interest in pursuing strategic acquisitions. The good news is, they don\u2019t feel like we have to do it to be successful, we got plenty of cash to pursue acquisitions to the extent we find a good opportunity. And then Kevin, you mentioned about share buybacks, we actually restart our share buybacks very modestly in the fourth quarter toward the end of the quarter, and in this quarter, we returned about $240 million to shareholders, combination of our dividend, plus about $100 million in share buybacks, that we assigned all to our dilution management program. So we are back in the market, I do expect that to continue. I expect this year, we will return around $900 million to shareholders, both in the form of our dividend, and our share repurchase program. But I think the key takeaway you should have is, the company continued to generate a significant amount of cash, and that gives us a lot of financial flexibility to pursue growth, both organically and inorganically.\nKevin Grundy: Got it. Very helpful. Good luck.\nKevin Jacobsen: Thanks, Kevin.\nOperator: Next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.\nJason English: Hey, good afternoon folks. Thank you so much for spotting me in, very much appreciate it. A couple of quick questions. First, based on your prepared remarks, it sounds like you\u2019re still running behind demand in Health and Wellness, effectively selling everything you can make. In that context, the $800 million revenue you\u2019ve been able to reduce to and sell to the last few quarters, any reason to believe that would drop off, as we go into the second quarter?\nKevin Jacobsen: Jason, this is Kevin. We expect to still continue to have very strong Q2. As you heard, we think we will be up double-digits. The one thing I\u2019d point to you is if you look at our Q1, we delivered 27% revenue growth. About 2 to 3 points was related to rebuilding retailer inventories. That was on Kingsford, our vitamins, minerals and supplements, as well as our Clorox liquid bleach. We\u2019ve made pretty good progress on catching up with demand on Clorox bleach, and so we rebuilt some capacity in Q1. So I\u2019d expect to have some impact on Q2. But beyond that I expect to see continued very strong performance in our cleaning portfolio, and that\u2019s \u2013 my comment is a global comment, not just in the U.S., but globally.\nJason English: Got it. So maybe not, but we are probably not too far off is what I heard. Your full year guidance, from a reinvestment perspective, suggests that, if I look at A&P, and I just compare it sort of a clean year in fiscal \u201819, you\u2019re looking to spend roughly $180 million more in A&P than you did two years ago, and SG&A is expected to be up around $150 million than it was two years ago. As we think forward, how much of those costs do you expect to stick, and how many of them do you think you\u2019ll have the flexibility to retract, when and if demand begins to subside?\nLinda Rendle: Yes. Thanks Jason. I\u2019ll start with that. You know these investment levels are not a mandate in our business, they are a choice. And we\u2019re choosing to lean into the momentum we see in our portfolio right now, behind some of what Kevin covered. Household penetration has more than doubled the amount of our portfolio that\u2019s stable or growing. We have the highest ever consumer value measures, so \u2013 the percentage of people deem our products as superior. We are seeing people enter our categories at rates we\u2019ve never seen before, and we are seeing repeat, although it\u2019s early, strong. And so what we are trying to do by increasing our advertising and sales promotion spending, by increasing our admin spending, is about accelerating the long-term performance of the company, and that is what we are aspiring to do. And so it\u2019s a choice, it\u2019s not something that we have to do or that\u2019s dictated by the market, and we think it\u2019s a smart choice, because what it allows us to do, is hold on to new households and you know the customer acquisition is one of the toughest things we do in established categories that have high share. So we want to make sure that we\u2019re doing that. We see additional places where we can grow household penetration in the U.S. and beyond in our categories, and we want to ensure we\u2019re doing that. And then we want to support the behavior change that we see with consumers, whether it be in Health and Wellness, the fact that they\u2019re drinking more water or taking more supplements. In hygiene, the fact that they are cleaning more, the fact that they are cleaning new surfaces and they are doing it and inside and outside of the home, supporting behaviors, as people stay at home. So people have been delighted by the fact they get to cook and they are actually enjoying more time around the family meal table and they are able to use different methods of cooking, like grilling, during the week, not just on the weekend or a special occasion. So we think of this investment in both administrative spending and in A&SP, support keeping those new consumers in, bringing additional people into our franchise, in hopes that we can accelerate the long-term performance. But I just want to be clear, it\u2019s a choice, and it\u2019s always a choice that we can revisit, if these behaviors are not as sticky, and we can optimize. One other fact I\u2019d give you, Jason, because I think it\u2019s important. We went back and looked at our spending. Recall that we put about $70 million of incremental spending in the back half of fiscal year \u201820, and the return on investment was extremely strong, and it gave us confidence to lean in, in fiscal year \u201821, that this is both a good short term spend and long-term spend.\nJason English: Super helpful. Thank you so much.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks Jason.\nOperator: Next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America.\nOlivia Tong: Thanks. Good afternoon. My first question is around the impact of volume growth and mix to gross margin that you called out because of volume growth. Could you talk about why it was such an outsized contributor this quarter versus last? Because volume was strong obviously, but only a point different versus Q4, and then on mix, I understand the aggregate benefit, but I suspect you saw gross margin improvement in each of your segments as well. So can you talk a little bit about promotion, whether that was a factor or lack thereof was a factor?\nKevin Jacobsen: Hi Olivia. Yes, I can talk about those questions. Let me start with benefit of volume to gross margin. It was more impactful in Q1 as you said versus Q4. We got a little over 400 basis points of benefit to margin in the Q1. If you go back to Q4, it is about 350 basis points of benefit. And so, as we have seen our volume continue to grow, we delivered about 22% volume growth last quarter, and were up stronger this quarter. So we are seeing a little bit incremental benefit. And then on the mix side, the mix was really driven by business unit mix, as we shared with you in our prepared remarks. We saw a very strong growth from our Household segment, and that tends to have a higher revenue and higher margin, in those businesses, relative to the average for the company. So we have five points of favorable price mix. It was mostly all mix, and it was mostly driven by the strength of certain ones of our businesses growing at an accelerated rate.\nOlivia Tong: That\u2019s helpful. And then on consumption trends in your key categories, obviously like to moving parts we see still catch up to demand, in the Health and Wellness segment. But then, you are obviously going to have some volatile comps in household, but specific to household, can you just talk about the drivers of the acceleration there, because the comp was easier, but it was two points easier versus Q4 and you accelerated growth by over 20 points. So how much of this is related to exogenous factors like COVID and more time at home or an active outdoor season, versus attracting new consumers to the categories of your brands. And what do you think is sort of a sustainable growth rate for the household business going forward?\nLinda Rendle: Olivia, I will highlight two businesses. I will highlight Grilling and Glad as good examples of what we have done, and what our expectations are moving forward. So grilling more than doubled sales, as we talked about, and this was due mainly to strong consumption. We did see some inventory replenishment, but that was about a third of what we saw from a sales growth perspective. And what\u2019s going on, are two factors that are coming together really nicely. We spoke about in our Investor Day in October, the fact that we were rebuilding our business plan on Grilling from the ground up. And that was based on business plans that we are in partnership with retailers to grow categories, and fundamentally reinventing our innovation program on grilling. And that has worked very well. You combine that with new behaviors we are seeing in the grilling category and that\u2019s really where we got to the place, where we experienced double-digit sales growth. And what we are seeing from consumers is this, about three quarters of people, even as mobility has increased in the U.S., are continuing to cook at home and expect to continue to cook at home, as they move forward. We are seeing 50% of charcoal grillers, grill more during COVID, and the vast majority of those, expect to continue to grill more, regardless of whether or not COVID is around in the near future, or farther ahead. And the most exciting thing for us, is we are seeing grilling occasions become everyday meal occasions. So before, most of the time when people were grilling, it was for the weekends, gatherings outside for holidays, and now we are seeing the grill being used for everyday occasions, and we expect that trend to continue. So those two things coming together, a revival of our business plans, having the right merchandising plans in place, and there was very little price discounting during this entire period of COVID, and we still saw the volumes hold steady and the sales increase that we experienced. So we think that behavior is here to stay, and based on the innovation we have planned over the coming years, we anticipate that we will be able to meet these consumer behavior change needs and continue to grow the grilling category. And if we look at Glad, it\u2019s a similar story. We were back focusing on the fundamentals of price gaps, innovation, ensuring that we have the right distribution, and that has paid off for us in addition to the consumer trends we\u2019re seeing. So up digital double digits behind strong consumer demand, and this is really about consumer staying home more and cooking more. So what we have heard, is people are using more trash bags, because they\u2019re generating more trash. So purchase frequency is up for Glad in particular, and about a third of households claim to be using, at least one full bag of kitchen trash per week. And as people have told us, they continue to cook at home, in the future, we expect that to continue. The other thing I would call out on Glad, is the innovation that supporting people through this time, as Lisah highlighted in her prepared comments, we launched Glad ForceFlex with Clorox and that\u2019s doing extremely well. It\u2019s early days, but we\u2019re seeing really good consumer acceptance, as well as the Glad bags we launched in Q3, that are experiential with both [indiscernible] and color, those continue to have very strong velocities and are supporting consumers during this time. One other thing I would call out, which I think is exciting for this business, is we have seen household penetration increases in Glad, and we\u2019ve seen higher household pen increases from low-income consumers. So we are offering them the right value at the right time, as they stay home. And if we look to the future and we think about what these businesses can do, we certainly see additional room for us, to grow household penetration, and for us to continue to retain those consumers, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re leaning in and investing in innovation and leaning in and investing in advertising. But what we would expect in the back half, as we lap a strong comp is, we would see that growth rate come down, but if you compare this period versus pre-COVID, say fiscal year \u201819 we\u2019re still experiencing very strong growth.\nOlivia Tong: Thanks. Congrats on a great quarter.\nOperator: Next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Yes. Hey, thanks. A couple of quick follow-ups, if I could and then I actually really want to ask about the international supply chain in wipes, but just to clean up what you were just talking about to Olivia? The Household and Lifestyle, you mentioned the inventory catch-up, can you just confirm whether those inventories were back in balance actually in the quarter, or whether there are any lingering pockets of dislocation we should be aware of?\nLinda Rendle: For Grilling, we have mainly gotten back to a point where we are in supply, and given this is the smaller quarter for Kingsford coming up, just given seasonality, we think we are in a good position moving forward. We still have some work to do on Glad, and still have additional work to do on Vitamins Minerals and Supplements and Brita. So we are not out of the woods yet and what we will say is, it will be a staggered recovery across those businesses that we have remaining over the next two quarters.\nSteve Powers: Okay. That helps. And then on the international supply chain in wipes, can you give us a little bit more detail us to what that looks like as we stand here today? How expensive it is? How much is in-sourced versus, I presume, most of it outsourced, but just some color there? And then how is that may be likely to change over time, as you build out against the opportunities that you spotlighted?\nLinda Rendle: Happy to. Yes, this supply chain was incredibly important for us to build it local, in-market, so that we could react to the opportunities we saw quickly, and we stood the supply chain up in just a matter of months, and we already have product shipping into countries today. We do have locations around the world, where we are supplying, because again we have business in Latin America and Asia, and so we are thinking about that expansion, ensuring that we have a distribution availability in that market. We also have designed this product from the ground up as well specifically for the consumer in those markets. So the needs can be a little bit different, depending on the country that you are in, the size of the wipe, the way that they want the lotion to feel. So again, did that within a matter of months and stood it up. We will continue to be flexible. Just as we have built this business in the U.S. over the last 20 years, as we expand in International, we will have all of those things under consideration, how much makes sense for us to have in-house, how much it makes sense to have with third-party suppliers. But the good news about this is, we find the supply chain to be scalable, and will lean in and pursue this opportunity aggressively, because we think our products can help so many more people around the world.\nSteve Powers: Okay. Thanks Linda. Appreciate it. I will leave it there.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks.\nOperator: Next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Jonathan, your line is open. [Operator Instructions] We have a question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thank you. I guess I wanted first off I wanted to talk about untracked channel dynamics, because you were helpful in sharing that about two to three points of the sales growth this quarter was related to restocking retail inventories. But there is still kind of even outside of that, a number of these businesses that really don\u2019t tie to what\u2019s showing up in Nielsen. So I was curious, I guess, if there is new distribution, we should be aware of for Glad or for Kingsford, in particular, and if not just you know is the performance offline dramatically different \u2013 sorry, on track, dramatically different than tracked?\nLinda Rendle: Sure Lauren. Happy to start on that one. So I think it\u2019s safe to say that the relationship in our performance in tracked channels and on track is going to be less linear over time, and is certainly less linear in Q1. But I think it would be helpful to back up and just set the backdrop for what we\u2019ve seen in fiscal year \u201820 and then specifically get into Q1 and then our expectations on this one moving forward. So if you back up in fiscal year \u201820 tracked channels for us as a total company, including international and our professional products business, represented about 60% of total company sales. 80% of total U.S. retail is in tracked channels. And what happened this quarter is, we had strong growth in professional products in international and that accounts for about a quarter of our sales growth, which of course is not accounted for in Nielsen as you highlighted. But if you looked at tracked and non-tracked channels, those growth rates were about the same at about 20%, and that makes sense, because we have been on allocation for a number of our businesses, so you would expect to see both of those at about the same rate. But as you mentioned, Kevin called out inventory, and as we started to replenish inventory and businesses like Kingsford, Brita, Bleach and Vitamins. Minerals and Supplements, that accounted for about two to three points this quarter of the disconnect. We also had a year ago inventory effect, if you think about grilling, because last year we had the inventory, this year we have low inventory and heavy sales that we were replenishing that consumption, and you saw a disconnect in Grilling. And then the one other thing I would call out for you Lauren is promotional periods versus year ago, and I would really caution everybody against using narrow time periods like a week or four weeks, because those periods have changed year-over-year and it causes noise in the data, as well as the fact that we were not merchandising anything in our cleaning and disinfecting portfolio, given our supply. So those two factors both inventory and promotional also contributed. And then going forward, we\u2019d expect this disconnect to continue, because we expect strong growth from international, strong growth from professional products. And then as more consumers move online, more of that will be on track.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay, that\u2019s super helpful. And then the other question that was a little bit longer term. So historically, right, a key kind of mantra for Clorox was big share brands in mid-sized categories, right, and that\u2019s still in your investor slide deck and still kind of how you talked about your business. The thing though, is that, your previously mid-sized categories are becoming really big categories, where everybody wants to participate. So I guess, Linda, wanted to talk a little bit about how you may be factoring that change in, whether it\u2019s competitive dynamics, overall category size, attention being paid to these businesses where you\u2019ve kind of been able to operate at a very high level, but arguably with a bit less competitive intensity historically, then may be the case going forward?\nLinda Rendle: Sure Lauren. Let me try to take that in a couple of buckets, and start first with just your portfolio question. And I feel terrific about our portfolio. If you look at the broad-based growth we had, eight out of 10 businesses with double-digit sales growth, growing most businesses expansion and household penetration, strong consumer value measure across those businesses. I think our portfolio is in a terrific place to be competitive. And then if I answer your question around big share brands in mid-sized categories, I do think that\u2019s what we are still about. And these categories, even though there is a lot of attractiveness, are still relatively small to some of the categories in store, and even with the growth rates we have been experiencing, we would still consider them to be mid-sized. And then if I think about competition, maybe I would disagree a little bit, Lauren. I think our categories have been competitive for quite a long time. We have had national players, if you think about Cleaning, in that businesses, certainly internationally for a long time, people have entered in our space and wipes before several times. So I think that\u2019s going to continue to be competitive, and to your point, will be more competitive in the near future, because it\u2019s a very attractive place to play right now. And what we turn back to, is really what separates us and how we think we can win, and that starts with having strong brands that consumers love, and that they are loyal to. And as I highlighted at the beginning, those factors around the health of the portfolio, our household penetration, our consumer value measure scores, how we\u2019re seeing people enter our categories give us reassurance that we have the right brands to win in that space. And then Ignite really elevates the role of innovation, and I think that\u2019s going to be critical for us to win in the future in these categories. People\u2019s needs are changing. Their behaviors are changing, and we need to innovate to meet those new needs and we\u2019re feeling terrific about the innovation program we have in place now. About the innovation, you can expect to see in the back half of fiscal year \u201821 and then well beyond that, we\u2019re feeling great about that. So for us, again that moment is about investing right now and leaning into the strength of those brands, knowing it\u2019s going to be more competitive, focusing relentlessly on superior consumer value, and ensuring that people know that our brands offer them the very best, when it comes to meeting their needs today as they deal with COVID, and staying home more. Does that help answer your question Lauren?\nLauren Lieberman: It does. Yes, thank you so much Linda.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] I have a question from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Feeney: Hey thanks for fitting me, and sorry about that. I had some technical difficulties, pretty more than the usual, great quarter. Just \u2013 and I apologize if this has been asked, does your 27% organic sales gain in your opinion represent any data you have, a share gain on a weighted basis versus your categories? Because I am trying to figure out where you stand, particularly in cleaning but broadly, and then as a related question, what\u2019s your current share of sales right now in e-commerce, which would probably be your fastest growing and highest contributive non-measured sales? Thanks very much.\nLinda Rendle: Sure. Jonathan, I think we can\u2019t answer the question of folks, we have categories that don\u2019t have relevant track share data that we can quantify so Professional Products is a good example and international. But I think if you look at all outlets, we are in a place where share is about flat right now and most of that is due to supply constraints and we would anticipate, if we were in a position to better supply across those categories, to see improvement on that, and I know you know that we hold all of our businesses accountable to growing share. So that\u2019s what I would say about the first part of your question. And then, what I think about moving forward, and how we are anticipating looking at that we are trying to see, is in the very narrow buckets that we compete in, whether that be online or out of home, how are we doing in that individual space, because it\u2019s hard to aggregate this and understand what we\u2019re doing broadly. So we\u2019re looking country by country. We are looking at specific channels in our professional business to see how we are doing, and then we are looking at online. Online specifically about two-thirds of our brands are number one share online, which lines up nicely with the rest of our portfolio, and we\u2019re doing very well there. And that has to do with the early investments we made in e-commerce. We were one of the first to stand up a fully dedicated team on e-commerce pure play customers, as well as standing up integrated teams on our brick and click customers. So we\u2019re in a very good position online, as consumers continue to move online, we will continue to invest there. And you know, the one other thing I would point out is, we have been spending over 60% of our dollars online for a number of years. So we are where shoppers are today, and that has helped contribute to that share expansion.\nJonathan Feeney: Okay, thank you very much.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And this concludes the question-and-answer session. Ms. Rendle, I would now like to turn the program back over to you.\nLinda Rendle: Thank you so much, Sharon. I feel great about our strong start to fiscal year \u201821 and look forward to another year of delivering value to all our stakeholders. Thank you so much everyone, and we will speak again on our next call in February. We hope you all stay well. Take care.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Jacobsen",
            "content": "Thank you, Lisa and thank you everyone for joining us today. I sincerely hope you and your families are well. I am pleased with our very strong start to the fiscal year, reflecting broad-based strength across our portfolio, with double-digit volume, sales and profit growth in each of our reporting segments. Additionally, each reporting segment delivered gross margin expansion, contributing to our eighth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion for the company. As you saw in our press release, we raised our fiscal year \u201821 outlook, given the strength of our Q1 results and our expectations for a higher top line growth over the balance of the fiscal year. Turning to our first quarter results, first quarter sales were up 27%, driven by 22 points of organic volume growth and 5 points of favorable price mix. Sales results also included one point of growth from acquiring majority control of our Saudi joint venture, offset by one point of FX headwinds. On an organic basis, sales grew 27%. Gross margin for the quarter increased 400 basis points to 48% compared to 44% in the year ago quarter. First quarter gross margin included the benefit of strong volume growth, as well as 170 basis points of cost savings and 150 basis points of favorable mix. These factors were partially offset by 300 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs, which were similar to last quarter, included temporary COVID-19 spending. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales came in at 12% compared to 14% in the year ago quarter. Primarily from increased operating leverage. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels as a percentage of sales, came in at about 9%, equal to the year ago quarter. We're spending for our U.S. retail business coming in at 11% of sales. Importantly, this represented about a 30% increase in advertising support this quarter, compared to the year ago period, reflecting stronger investments to support our ambition to accelerate long-term profitable growth. Our first quarter effective tax rate was 21%, compared to 22% in the year ago quarter, primarily driven by the impact of our increased ownership of our Saudi joint venture. Net of all these factors, we delivered diluted net earnings per share of $3.22 versus $1.59 in the year ago quarter, an increase of 103%. Excluding the contribution from our Saudi joint venture acquisition, Q1 diluted EPS grew 66%. As you also saw in our press release, Q1 net cash provided by operations was $383 million versus $271 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 41%. Our strong cash flow was due to profitable sales growth, partially offset by higher employee incentive compensation payments made in the first quarter, which were related to our fiscal year \u201820 performance. Turning to our fiscal year outlook, we now anticipate fiscal year sales to grow between 5% to 9%, reflecting our strong Q1 results as well as our raised expectations for the balance of the fiscal year, including double-digit growth in Q2. And as we noted last quarter, we continue to anticipate deceleration in the back half of fiscal year \u201821, as we lap double-digit growth in the same period in fiscal year \u201820, when we saw the initial spike in COVID-19. Importantly we continue to assume or back half sales results will be significantly stronger relative to pre-pandemic sales levels. We also continue to anticipate about 1 point of contribution from our Saudi joint venture, offset by one point of foreign exchange headwinds. On an organic sales basis, our outlook assumes 5% to 9% growth. We expect fiscal year gross margin to be about flat, reflecting the benefit of strong cost savings and higher sales, offset by rising commodity and transportation costs, as well as temporary costs related to COVID-19. For perspective, we expect gross margin expansion in the front half, followed by a contraction over the balance of the fiscal year, as we lap gross margin expansion of 250 basis points delivered in the back half of fiscal year \u201820, driven by strong operating leverage from robust shipment growth during the initial phase of the pandemic. We continue to expect fiscal year selling and administrative expenses to be about 14% of sales, as we continue to invest aggressively in long-term growth initiatives. Additionally, we continue to anticipate fiscal year advertising spending to be about 11% of sales, spending closer to 10% in the front half of the year and 12% in the back half, in support of our robust innovation program. We now expect our fiscal year tax rate to be between 21% to 22%. Net of these factors, we now expect fiscal year \u201821 diluted EPS to increase between 5% to 8%, or $7.70 to $7.95 reflecting our assumption for stronger top line performance, partially offset by a rising cost environment. As we shared last quarter, our fiscal year diluted EPS outlook continues to include a contribution of $0.45 to $0.53 from our increased stake in our Saudi Arabia joint venture, primarily driven by a one-time non-cash gain. Excluding the impact of the Saudi acquisition, our fiscal year diluted EPS reflects strong investments behind the robust momentum we're seeing broadly in our portfolio. We're engaging new consumers, supporting back half innovation plans and expanding our portfolio into new channels and markets, all in support of our ambition to accelerate long-term profitable growth. In closing, I am pleased with our very strong start to fiscal year \u201821, both top and bottom line performance across our reporting segments. This provides a strong foundation for a continued momentum, which we plan to drive through aggressive investments in our IGNITE Strategy, in support of creating long-term shareholder value. And with that, I will turn it over to Linda. Hi Andrea, this is Kevin. I can talk about our EPS, as you think about the balance of the year. So as you mentioned, we've raised our expectations for the year 5% to 8% off to a very strong start to the year. If you think about the impact of the balance of the year, as I'm sure you've done the math, we are projecting we will be down in the back half of the year on our EPS year-over-year, that's primarily driven by the impact of the prior year. If you recall, we grew EPS, about 30% in the back half of fiscal year \u201820. So from the initial impact of COVID-19, the pantry loading, very strong results in the back half of the year. We have to lap that and in addition to lapping that, as we've spoken in the last couple of calls, we are leaning in and investing behind the additional growth opportunities we see in front of us. And you may have heard in my prepared remarks, we think that advertising investment will be back-half loaded. So we would expect to be spending about 12% of sales in the back half. One, supporting a very robust innovation program we have teed up for the back half of the year, as well as pursuing a number of new growth initiatives, both our partnerships and some of the international opportunities we are spending behind. And maybe just a last comment I'd make, Andrea, and I think you know this about us. We are certainly not looking to maximize one quarter, but making sure we're taking the right investments that generate long-term value. And so, we think there is a good opportunity for us to do that, and we will certainly do it in the back half of the year. Hey Kevin, this is Kevin. I can take your first question as well, as it relates to sales. And to your point, we've taken up our expectation for the balance of the year pretty materially. I think there is a number of things we are seeing that's giving us even more confidence for this year. The first is, we continue to see growing household penetration. So we are now three quarters into the pandemic in Q1, and it continued to grow. Additionally, we're seeing increased repeat purchase rates with both new and existing consumers, and so growing household penetration, accelerating repurchase rates, both giving us more confidence, and as you know, we've been exploring a number of additional growth opportunities, both our partnerships, as well as expanding our disinfecting portfolio outside the U.S., and we're seeing more and more opportunity in both those spaces, that will start to contribute in the back half of the year. And then maybe the last time I'd mentioned is, while we knew, we'd have a very strong year as it relates to our disinfecting portfolio, we're seeing very strong results outside of disinfectant. I mean you clearly saw our results in our Household segment. Again, we're seeing users, more users coming into those categories, they're increasing their frequency of usage, and we think that's going to continue through the balance of the fiscal year. So I'd say those are the key drivers that led to us taking up the outlook for the full year. Sure. Happy to, Kevin, talk about cash. And as you mentioned, Kevin, we are seeing a pretty significant acceleration in the cash we are generating. Last year, our cash provided by operations was up about 56%. In Q1, it was up about 40%. We're sitting on just a little under $900 million of cash on the balance sheet, which to your point is more than we typically hold. That really gives us quite a bit of financial flexibility. So for Lind and I, job one will be to continue to look for opportunities to invest in our base business. We know that's where we can continue to create very strong returns for our shareholders. So we will do that, including investing more in capacity to the extent we think that's required. Additionally, we will continue to look for targeted M&A. We still have an interest in pursuing strategic acquisitions. The good news is, they don't feel like we have to do it to be successful, we got plenty of cash to pursue acquisitions to the extent we find a good opportunity. And then Kevin, you mentioned about share buybacks, we actually restart our share buybacks very modestly in the fourth quarter toward the end of the quarter, and in this quarter, we returned about $240 million to shareholders, combination of our dividend, plus about $100 million in share buybacks, that we assigned all to our dilution management program. So we are back in the market, I do expect that to continue. I expect this year, we will return around $900 million to shareholders, both in the form of our dividend, and our share repurchase program. But I think the key takeaway you should have is, the company continued to generate a significant amount of cash, and that gives us a lot of financial flexibility to pursue growth, both organically and inorganically. Thanks, Kevin. Jason, this is Kevin. We expect to still continue to have very strong Q2. As you heard, we think we will be up double-digits. The one thing I'd point to you is if you look at our Q1, we delivered 27% revenue growth. About 2 to 3 points was related to rebuilding retailer inventories. That was on Kingsford, our vitamins, minerals and supplements, as well as our Clorox liquid bleach. We've made pretty good progress on catching up with demand on Clorox bleach, and so we rebuilt some capacity in Q1. So I'd expect to have some impact on Q2. But beyond that I expect to see continued very strong performance in our cleaning portfolio, and that's \u2013 my comment is a global comment, not just in the U.S., but globally. Hi Olivia. Yes, I can talk about those questions. Let me start with benefit of volume to gross margin. It was more impactful in Q1 as you said versus Q4. We got a little over 400 basis points of benefit to margin in the Q1. If you go back to Q4, it is about 350 basis points of benefit. And so, as we have seen our volume continue to grow, we delivered about 22% volume growth last quarter, and were up stronger this quarter. So we are seeing a little bit incremental benefit. And then on the mix side, the mix was really driven by business unit mix, as we shared with you in our prepared remarks. We saw a very strong growth from our Household segment, and that tends to have a higher revenue and higher margin, in those businesses, relative to the average for the company. So we have five points of favorable price mix. It was mostly all mix, and it was mostly driven by the strength of certain ones of our businesses growing at an accelerated rate."

            "content": "Thanks, Kevin. Hello everyone and thank you for being with us today. I hope you are well and in good spirits, as we continue to navigate this pandemic. It's great to be joining you on my first call as CEO, especially after the tremendous first quarter we delivered. Our results show what Clorox does best. We serve people who count on our brands, especially during a time when they need to feel safe, and when their home is the center of their world. This reinforces my first message, our outstanding results are a reflection of our team's dedication to serving consumers and communities. I am incredibly proud to see the broad based strength in our portfolio, with double-digit sales and profit growth in all reporting segments. In the last 8 months, all eyes have been on Clorox disinfecting products, and our brands delivered once again this quarter, with double-digit sales growth in our Cleaning and Professional Products businesses, reflecting continued higher usage of products in homes, businesses and healthcare settings. And now, we're also shining a brighter light on the terrific performance delivered by other parts of our portfolio, with double-digit sales growth in eight of 10 businesses, demonstrating the important role our brands play in addressing people's everyday needs. It's particularly gratifying to see great results from our Grilling and Glad businesses, as the team has been relentless in driving progress on our business plans, including meaningful innovation. Based on double-digit top line increases and significant margin expansion in our first quarter, we delivered very strong earnings growth for our shareholders and I'm happy we were able to raise our fiscal year outlook. These results would not be possible without the passion and commitment of our Clorox teammates around the world. I'm thankful and proud of how they live by our values, and take to heart our role, in supporting consumers and communities. While I feel good about our financial performance for the quarter, there is one thing that continues to keep me up at night. Our ongoing focus to meet unprecedented demand for much of our portfolio, we are certainly encouraged by the progress we're making in a number of businesses, including having Clorox Bleach mostly back on store shelves, but there is more work to be done. I can assure you that our teams are leaving no stone unturned across all businesses experiencing elevated demand. We're continuing to focus on products that can be made faster, and investing significantly in third party supply sources in an effort to expedite our products to retailers. Our consumers, retail partners and communities are counting on us, and I want people to know that maximizing supply continues to be top priority. Next the Clorox team and I will play 1% offense behind our strong portfolio of leading brands consumers love, in support of our ambition to accelerate long-term profitable growth. I feel privileged to be CEO of this special company and I have my sights set on extending our momentum longer term. In this uncertain environment, people are turning to brands they trust, and we're proud to have trusted brands in our categories. We're seeing this play out in strong helpful penetration, not just in our disinfecting products, but in many parts of our portfolio. For perspective, the percentage of our total portfolio was stable or growing household penetration has more than doubled year-over-year, and as I look beyond the pandemic and try to answer the question of whether or not we can sustain our strong results, I'm encouraged by the trends we're seeing, particularly consumer behaviors formed during the last seven months. They are good indicators our brands will continue to play a meaningful role in people's daily life. For example, people are prioritizing Health and Wellness, drinking more water and taking vitamins and supplements, focusing on safety and hygiene, cleaning and disinfecting, in and out of their homes. Staying home more, including cooking, grilling, spending time with family and adopting a pet. Spending more time online with about 90% of people saying they've shopped online since the pandemic. There are strong signs these behaviors will stick over the long term, as people have been building these habits for three times longer than it normally takes routines to form. And while early, we are encouraged by the strong repeat rates we are seeing across our portfolio, among core and new consumers. This is the time for 100% offense and that means investing significantly behind our global portfolio, including through advertising and market leading innovation. Increasing capital spending to expand production capacity in the near and long term and partnering with retailers, to enhance shopping experiences and grow our categories. With the strength of our global portfolio, the sustained consumer behaviors we are seeing and our significant investments to drive growth, Clorox is in a great position to keep winning with consumers. And finally, the defining opportunity for Clorox is simple, to serve even more people around the world, with the strategy that helps us make the most of who we are and where we have strategic advantage. Our IGNITE Strategy puts people at the center of everything we do, and fundamentally we will address consumer needs and follow them in the most meaningful ways we can. Here is what I would highlight Clorox is a health and wellness company at heart. With the strength of our brands and capabilities in disinfecting, we're in a great position to extend our role in public health. We will continue to lean into the strategic alliances we've established with leading brands to keep their customers safe and we will certainly pursue more of these types of relationships with other organizations, to increase our support for people outside of their homes. I am also excited about expanding Clorox disinfecting wipes in International, supported by a dedicated supply chain that will allow us to scale this business in our existing markets and enter new geographies. More than ever, people are online and we believe digital behavior is here to stay. Clorox has leaned into e-commerce and digital marketing early, so that people can engage with our brands, in a more personal and relevant way. As people navigate a tough economy with pressures from unemployment and less discretionary spending, they'll continue to turn to brands they trust, and we'll continue to earn their trust and loyalty by focusing on superior value. And what's also important to me, is that we continue to be committed to growing the right way, guided by our values and with ESG embedded into our business. It's how we help our people our communities and our planet thrive now and in the future. Operator, you may now open up the line for questions. Yes. Professional has been a strong part of our portfolio for a number of years, with high-single digit increases up to this point, and we continue to see a long runway for the business, both in the businesses that are established well today, in the Healthcare and Industrial customer setting, but also we're setting our sights on expanding the reach this business can have, as consumers start to leave their home and we can create environments, partnering with businesses to keep them safe. So that's what we're focused on right now, is investing in the people to support that future growth, investing in the innovation to support that future growth, and of course investing in the brand, so that people continue to turn to the most trusted cleaning disinfecting brand with Clorox. Yes, Wendy. Thanks for the question. We are committed to not taking pricing during the pandemic, it's to do the right thing and we want to make sure consumers have our products at the right value. And so what we're focused on right now, is a continued lean into our aggressive cost savings program that we've had for a number of years, to ensure that we have the fuel to manage the investments that we have and of course to manage any bumpiness we expect in commodities. But we do expect cost increases through the back half as you said, and we're monitoring that environment closely. But again we are committed to ensuring that consumers have our brand during a recessionary time at the right value, not taking pricing during a pandemic and leveraging our cost savings program to manage through short-terms up and down. Got it, Wendy. I think it would be helpful to step back and just talk a little bit about what we're seeing in the macro environment, and why we have strong belief that we're going to see a lot of these behaviors continue well into the future. We're seeing consumers in the U.S. and around the world, cleaning much more frequently, cleaning new surfaces and of course cleaning both in and outside of the home and that is true for business customers as well, where they're having to welcome people back to their businesses, with safe environment. From our research with consumers, they are telling us that they expect many of these behaviors to stick, regardless of whether or not, there is a vaccine or how long COVID goes on, because it's a way to reassure their health and wellness and for them to feel safe. So we're hearing from consumers that this is here to stay and we've seen evidence of that in past pandemics, as well as just bad cold and flu seasons, where people have adopted new behaviors. The other thing I would tell you, in addition to capacity supporting just that change in behavior, we also see significant growth opportunities that are brand new to our business. Expanding Clorox Disinfecting Wipes and international, if you step back, we're in about 100 countries around the world with very little presence in disinfecting wipes. That's a big opportunity for us, complete white space that as we built capacity, we can lean into that even further. And the other thing that I would talk about is, in the industrial space, there's new technologies that we have, and we think those cleaning behaviors will need to change on a more permanent basis, to reassure people that it's safe to enter those businesses. And so that's the other thing I would just put in perspective. We can shift supply to the opportunities that are most poignant at the moment, as we move forward. And then of course Wendy, as you always know we're really good at balancing and spending capital in a disciplined way, and we can make adjustments to our network, whether that be through in-housing or working with third party manufacturers as we move forward, and we've been very balanced in how we've approached this, so that we can do just that. Yes. Thanks Jason. I'll start with that. You know these investment levels are not a mandate in our business, they are a choice. And we're choosing to lean into the momentum we see in our portfolio right now, behind some of what Kevin covered. Household penetration has more than doubled the amount of our portfolio that's stable or growing. We have the highest ever consumer value measures, so \u2013 the percentage of people deem our products as superior. We are seeing people enter our categories at rates we've never seen before, and we are seeing repeat, although it's early, strong. And so what we are trying to do by increasing our advertising and sales promotion spending, by increasing our admin spending, is about accelerating the long-term performance of the company, and that is what we are aspiring to do. And so it's a choice, it's not something that we have to do or that's dictated by the market, and we think it's a smart choice, because what it allows us to do, is hold on to new households and you know the customer acquisition is one of the toughest things we do in established categories that have high share. So we want to make sure that we're doing that. We see additional places where we can grow household penetration in the U.S. and beyond in our categories, and we want to ensure we're doing that. And then we want to support the behavior change that we see with consumers, whether it be in Health and Wellness, the fact that they're drinking more water or taking more supplements. In hygiene, the fact that they are cleaning more, the fact that they are cleaning new surfaces and they are doing it and inside and outside of the home, supporting behaviors, as people stay at home. So people have been delighted by the fact they get to cook and they are actually enjoying more time around the family meal table and they are able to use different methods of cooking, like grilling, during the week, not just on the weekend or a special occasion. So we think of this investment in both administrative spending and in A&SP, support keeping those new consumers in, bringing additional people into our franchise, in hopes that we can accelerate the long-term performance. But I just want to be clear, it's a choice, and it's always a choice that we can revisit, if these behaviors are not as sticky, and we can optimize. One other fact I'd give you, Jason, because I think it's important. We went back and looked at our spending. Recall that we put about $70 million of incremental spending in the back half of fiscal year \u201820, and the return on investment was extremely strong, and it gave us confidence to lean in, in fiscal year \u201821, that this is both a good short term spend and long-term spend. Thanks Jason. Olivia, I will highlight two businesses. I will highlight Grilling and Glad as good examples of what we have done, and what our expectations are moving forward. So grilling more than doubled sales, as we talked about, and this was due mainly to strong consumption. We did see some inventory replenishment, but that was about a third of what we saw from a sales growth perspective. And what's going on, are two factors that are coming together really nicely. We spoke about in our Investor Day in October, the fact that we were rebuilding our business plan on Grilling from the ground up. And that was based on business plans that we are in partnership with retailers to grow categories, and fundamentally reinventing our innovation program on grilling. And that has worked very well. You combine that with new behaviors we are seeing in the grilling category and that's really where we got to the place, where we experienced double-digit sales growth. And what we are seeing from consumers is this, about three quarters of people, even as mobility has increased in the U.S., are continuing to cook at home and expect to continue to cook at home, as they move forward. We are seeing 50% of charcoal grillers, grill more during COVID, and the vast majority of those, expect to continue to grill more, regardless of whether or not COVID is around in the near future, or farther ahead. And the most exciting thing for us, is we are seeing grilling occasions become everyday meal occasions. So before, most of the time when people were grilling, it was for the weekends, gatherings outside for holidays, and now we are seeing the grill being used for everyday occasions, and we expect that trend to continue. So those two things coming together, a revival of our business plans, having the right merchandising plans in place, and there was very little price discounting during this entire period of COVID, and we still saw the volumes hold steady and the sales increase that we experienced. So we think that behavior is here to stay, and based on the innovation we have planned over the coming years, we anticipate that we will be able to meet these consumer behavior change needs and continue to grow the grilling category. And if we look at Glad, it's a similar story. We were back focusing on the fundamentals of price gaps, innovation, ensuring that we have the right distribution, and that has paid off for us in addition to the consumer trends we're seeing. So up digital double digits behind strong consumer demand, and this is really about consumer staying home more and cooking more. So what we have heard, is people are using more trash bags, because they're generating more trash. So purchase frequency is up for Glad in particular, and about a third of households claim to be using, at least one full bag of kitchen trash per week. And as people have told us, they continue to cook at home, in the future, we expect that to continue. The other thing I would call out on Glad, is the innovation that supporting people through this time, as Lisah highlighted in her prepared comments, we launched Glad ForceFlex with Clorox and that's doing extremely well. It's early days, but we're seeing really good consumer acceptance, as well as the Glad bags we launched in Q3, that are experiential with both [indiscernible] and color, those continue to have very strong velocities and are supporting consumers during this time. One other thing I would call out, which I think is exciting for this business, is we have seen household penetration increases in Glad, and we've seen higher household pen increases from low-income consumers. So we are offering them the right value at the right time, as they stay home. And if we look to the future and we think about what these businesses can do, we certainly see additional room for us, to grow household penetration, and for us to continue to retain those consumers, and that's why we're leaning in and investing in innovation and leaning in and investing in advertising. But what we would expect in the back half, as we lap a strong comp is, we would see that growth rate come down, but if you compare this period versus pre-COVID, say fiscal year \u201819 we're still experiencing very strong growth. For Grilling, we have mainly gotten back to a point where we are in supply, and given this is the smaller quarter for Kingsford coming up, just given seasonality, we think we are in a good position moving forward. We still have some work to do on Glad, and still have additional work to do on Vitamins Minerals and Supplements and Brita. So we are not out of the woods yet and what we will say is, it will be a staggered recovery across those businesses that we have remaining over the next two quarters. Happy to. Yes, this supply chain was incredibly important for us to build it local, in-market, so that we could react to the opportunities we saw quickly, and we stood the supply chain up in just a matter of months, and we already have product shipping into countries today. We do have locations around the world, where we are supplying, because again we have business in Latin America and Asia, and so we are thinking about that expansion, ensuring that we have a distribution availability in that market. We also have designed this product from the ground up as well specifically for the consumer in those markets. So the needs can be a little bit different, depending on the country that you are in, the size of the wipe, the way that they want the lotion to feel. So again, did that within a matter of months and stood it up. We will continue to be flexible. Just as we have built this business in the U.S. over the last 20 years, as we expand in International, we will have all of those things under consideration, how much makes sense for us to have in-house, how much it makes sense to have with third-party suppliers. But the good news about this is, we find the supply chain to be scalable, and will lean in and pursue this opportunity aggressively, because we think our products can help so many more people around the world. Thanks. Sure Lauren. Happy to start on that one. So I think it's safe to say that the relationship in our performance in tracked channels and on track is going to be less linear over time, and is certainly less linear in Q1. But I think it would be helpful to back up and just set the backdrop for what we've seen in fiscal year \u201820 and then specifically get into Q1 and then our expectations on this one moving forward. So if you back up in fiscal year \u201820 tracked channels for us as a total company, including international and our professional products business, represented about 60% of total company sales. 80% of total U.S. retail is in tracked channels. And what happened this quarter is, we had strong growth in professional products in international and that accounts for about a quarter of our sales growth, which of course is not accounted for in Nielsen as you highlighted. But if you looked at tracked and non-tracked channels, those growth rates were about the same at about 20%, and that makes sense, because we have been on allocation for a number of our businesses, so you would expect to see both of those at about the same rate. But as you mentioned, Kevin called out inventory, and as we started to replenish inventory and businesses like Kingsford, Brita, Bleach and Vitamins. Minerals and Supplements, that accounted for about two to three points this quarter of the disconnect. We also had a year ago inventory effect, if you think about grilling, because last year we had the inventory, this year we have low inventory and heavy sales that we were replenishing that consumption, and you saw a disconnect in Grilling. And then the one other thing I would call out for you Lauren is promotional periods versus year ago, and I would really caution everybody against using narrow time periods like a week or four weeks, because those periods have changed year-over-year and it causes noise in the data, as well as the fact that we were not merchandising anything in our cleaning and disinfecting portfolio, given our supply. So those two factors both inventory and promotional also contributed. And then going forward, we'd expect this disconnect to continue, because we expect strong growth from international, strong growth from professional products. And then as more consumers move online, more of that will be on track. Sure Lauren. Let me try to take that in a couple of buckets, and start first with just your portfolio question. And I feel terrific about our portfolio. If you look at the broad-based growth we had, eight out of 10 businesses with double-digit sales growth, growing most businesses expansion and household penetration, strong consumer value measure across those businesses. I think our portfolio is in a terrific place to be competitive. And then if I answer your question around big share brands in mid-sized categories, I do think that's what we are still about. And these categories, even though there is a lot of attractiveness, are still relatively small to some of the categories in store, and even with the growth rates we have been experiencing, we would still consider them to be mid-sized. And then if I think about competition, maybe I would disagree a little bit, Lauren. I think our categories have been competitive for quite a long time. We have had national players, if you think about Cleaning, in that businesses, certainly internationally for a long time, people have entered in our space and wipes before several times. So I think that's going to continue to be competitive, and to your point, will be more competitive in the near future, because it's a very attractive place to play right now. And what we turn back to, is really what separates us and how we think we can win, and that starts with having strong brands that consumers love, and that they are loyal to. And as I highlighted at the beginning, those factors around the health of the portfolio, our household penetration, our consumer value measure scores, how we're seeing people enter our categories give us reassurance that we have the right brands to win in that space. And then Ignite really elevates the role of innovation, and I think that's going to be critical for us to win in the future in these categories. People's needs are changing. Their behaviors are changing, and we need to innovate to meet those new needs and we're feeling terrific about the innovation program we have in place now. About the innovation, you can expect to see in the back half of fiscal year \u201821 and then well beyond that, we're feeling great about that. So for us, again that moment is about investing right now and leaning into the strength of those brands, knowing it's going to be more competitive, focusing relentlessly on superior consumer value, and ensuring that people know that our brands offer them the very best, when it comes to meeting their needs today as they deal with COVID, and staying home more. Does that help answer your question Lauren? Thanks. Sure. Jonathan, I think we can't answer the question of folks, we have categories that don't have relevant track share data that we can quantify so Professional Products is a good example and international. But I think if you look at all outlets, we are in a place where share is about flat right now and most of that is due to supply constraints and we would anticipate, if we were in a position to better supply across those categories, to see improvement on that, and I know you know that we hold all of our businesses accountable to growing share. So that's what I would say about the first part of your question. And then, what I think about moving forward, and how we are anticipating looking at that we are trying to see, is in the very narrow buckets that we compete in, whether that be online or out of home, how are we doing in that individual space, because it's hard to aggregate this and understand what we're doing broadly. So we're looking country by country. We are looking at specific channels in our professional business to see how we are doing, and then we are looking at online. Online specifically about two-thirds of our brands are number one share online, which lines up nicely with the rest of our portfolio, and we're doing very well there. And that has to do with the early investments we made in e-commerce. We were one of the first to stand up a fully dedicated team on e-commerce pure play customers, as well as standing up integrated teams on our brick and click customers. So we're in a very good position online, as consumers continue to move online, we will continue to invest there. And you know, the one other thing I would point out is, we have been spending over 60% of our dollars online for a number of years. So we are where shoppers are today, and that has helped contribute to that share expansion. Thank you so much, Sharon. I feel great about our strong start to fiscal year \u201821 and look forward to another year of delivering value to all our stakeholders. Thank you so much everyone, and we will speak again on our next call in February. We hope you all stay well. Take care."

We are broadcasting this call over the Internet and a replay of the call will be available for 7 days at our website, at cloroxcompany.com. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including statements related to the expected or potential impact of COVID-19. These statements are based on management's current expectations, but may differ from actual results or outcomes. In addition, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section, which identifies various factors that could affect such forward-looking statements and the non-GAAP financial information section, which includes the table that reconciles non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, both of which are located at the end of today's earnings release, which has also been posted on our website and filed with the SEC. Turning to today's discussion of our results, I will start by covering our usual top line commentary with highlights in each of our segments. Kevin will then address our total company results, as well as our FY \u201821 outlook. Finally, Linda will offer her perspective and we'll close with Q&A. For the total company, Q1 sales increased 27%, reflecting about a point of benefit from the acquisition of majority interest in our joint venture in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and about a point of headwinds from unfavorable foreign exchange impact. This quarter's 27% organic sales growth is supported by double digit sales growth in eight of our 10 businesses. I will now go through our results by segment. In our Health and Wellness segment, Q1 sales were up 28%, reflecting double digit growth in all three businesses. Our Cleaning business had another quarter of double digit growth behind continued strong demand, for our disinfecting products. While we continue to make progress expanding supply, we're still not at a point where we can fully meet ongoing elevated demand. Despite those constraints, our Clorox brand continues to see increases in both household penetration and repeat rates. We've been investing behind this momentum to convert new users to loyal consumers, and we've been seeing very strong return on our investment. On the innovation front, our bleach complexion effort is now complete. The Clorox fabric sanitizer platform and Clorox disinfecting wet mopping cloth both continue to show strong growth. On a related note, our wet mopping cloth, along with our Clorox and Clorox Scentiva branded disinfecting wipes and Pine-Sol multi-surface cleaner, all recently received approval from the EPA, for kill claims against the virus that causes COVID-19 on hard non-porous surfaces. Our professional products business also had double-digit sales growth behind strong shipments across all of our disinfecting product lines. A key driver of growth this quarter was the total Clorox Total 360 system, which uses an electrostatic technology to deliver disinfectants to large, hard to reach areas. To support sales and continued momentum in this business, we're bringing online, new production capacity this month, for the disinfectant used in these devices. In addition, we've created a dedicated out of home team, that focuses on growth opportunities in new channels and spaces, to further build on strategic alliances with already established, with Uber Technologies, United Airlines, AMC Theaters and Cleveland Clinic. Lastly, within this segment, our Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements business grew sales by double digits this quarter. This strong growth was driven by shipments to replenish retail inventories, following the recent supply disruptions, and by shipments in support of our RenewLife brand re-launch. Our priorities this year are to continue to improve service levels, in order to capture the strong consumption trend, execute the RenewLife brand re-launch with excellence, and deliver consumer meaningful innovation. Turning to the Household segment, Q1 sales were up 39% with growth in all three businesses. Grilling sales more than doubled this quarter, due mainly to strong consumption behind the grilling occasions and increased household penetration. Sales growth this quarter was also driven partly by customer replenishment of inventory. We've been very pleased to see the strong turnaround of this business, reflected in our continued share growth, strong collaboration with the retailers, and successful entry into the pellet category, with our Kingsford pellets continuing to build distribution and share. With recent increases in grilling occasions and new households, including millennials, we're optimistic about the prospects of this business, and will invest behind this momentum to drive long-term profitable category growth. Glad sales were up by double-digits in Q1, behind ongoing strong demand for our products, as consumers continue to spend more time at home. We're building on this momentum with a consistent stream of innovation, including our new Glad ForceFlex with Clorox trash bags, which launched in September. This product eliminates Food and bacterial odors throughout the trash bags, and has already earned more than 1,000 five star ratings online from consumers. Our Glad ForceFlex trash bags with unique fragrances and colors, which launched in Q3, also continue to perform well, and are among top selling new items at major retailers. Cat Litter sales grew in Q1, driven mainly by strong online shipments in innovation, supported by higher advertising investments. We're encouraged by our return to share growth in Fresh Step, behind the continued strong performance of Fresh Step Clean Paws innovation platform and the strong start of Fresh Step with Gain Original Scented Litter with the power of Febreze. In our Lifestyle segment, Q1 sales increased 17% with double-digit growth in two of three businesses. Brita sales were up by double-digits for the third consecutive quarter. The growth is driven by \u2013 mainly by continued strong consumption, especially in larger sized systems and long last systems and filters. Sales growth was also driven partly by customer replenishment of inventory, an effort our team has been very focused on. Household penetration for Brita continues to grow, which gives us more reason to invest further. We'll be introducing a new and improved LongLast Plus filter that allows water to flow faster and captures more contaminants, along with a new pitcher. The Food business also saw double-digit sales growth, behind ongoing strong consumption of our Hidden Valley Ranch products, which continues to benefit from more at-home eating occasions. This is another business where we're seeing household penetration growth. We will continue to invest in innovation, and are encouraged to see a strong start to our new Hidden Valley Ranch secret sauce dressing. Finally Burt's Bees sales decreased this quarter. As the business continued to be impacted by lower store traffic, especially in parts of the store, where Burt's Bees products are typically found. We have since accelerated our online strategy and strengthened our presence in the fast growing cough and cold category, with the launch of a new line of Rescue Balm with turmeric. While we expect the category-wide challenges to persist in the short term, we have strong confidence in the Burt's Bees brand and its long-term growth prospects, supported by a robust innovation platform. Now turning to International, Q1 sales grew 18%, driven by ongoing elevated demand for our products, disinfecting products, and essential household products, across nearly every geography. Organic sales grew 17%, reflecting about 9 points of benefit from the Saudi JV acquisition and about 8 points of unfavorable foreign currency headwinds. Our international business has very strong momentum and we are looking to build on that through investments that accelerate our IGNITE Strategy. Increasing the stake in our Saudi JV is just an example of that. Another example is the international expansion of our Clorox disinfecting wipes, which are now being supported by a dedicated supply chain, separate from that in the U.S. This will allow us to better meet ongoing elevated demand in our existing international markets where we currently offer wipes, and to launch this consumer preferred form into new geographies. Now, I will turn it over to Kevin, who will discuss Q1 performance, as well as our updated outlook for FY \u201821."

At this time, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question and answer session. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I'd now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference.\nLisah Burhan: Thanks Paul. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Linda Rendle, our CEO and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. I hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website. In just a moment, Linda will share a few opening comments and then we will take your questions. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements, including about our fiscal 2023 outlook. These statements are based on management's current expectations, but may differ from actual results or outcomes. In addition, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statement section, which identify various factors that could affect any such forward-looking statements, which has been filed with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the non-GAAP Financial Information section in our earnings release and the supplemental financial schedules in the Investor Relations section of our website for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Now I'll turn it over to Linda.\nLinda Rendle: Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us. Our fiscal 2022 results reflect a very challenging operating environment, including record-high input cost inflation and ongoing pandemic-driven volatility. We navigated this environment by taking a broad set of actions within our control to rebuild margin while continuing to invest in innovation and our portfolio of trusted brands to position Clorox for long-term success. This allowed us to deliver results in line with our outlook, including another quarter of sequential gross margin improvement. While we look forward to a return to our more normalized environment, we are not there yet. We expect the environment to remain difficult in fiscal '23, as we lap COVID impacts on our business, demand continues to normalize, particularly in our cleaning and disinfecting portfolio and factors like input cost inflation and supply chain disruptions persist. We'll keep addressing these challenges head on through actions that include revenue management, further pricing, ongoing cost management and supply chain optimization, our digital transformation and the streamline operating model. We announced today. At the same time, we're committed to maintaining our category leadership and delivering superior consumer value. I'm confident that our Ignite strategy continues to position us well for the future. We remain committed to delivering on our 3% to 5% sales growth target over the long term and are on the right path to drive consistent profitable growth over time and create shareholder value. With that. Kevin and I will open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] And our first question comes from Peter Grom of UBS. Your line is open.\nPeter Grom: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. So I guess I just kind of wanted to start with a pretty broad question. On the initial guidance, just kind of given where it all landed versus expectations, I would be curious like Linda or Kevin, would you characterize this outlook as conservative? Is it prudent? Just trying to understand the comfort and the range at this point, just given what we've seen over the past year.\nKevin Jacobsen: Hi, Peter. Thanks for the question. Yeah, let me talk about our guidance and maybe a few thoughts. The first is we view this guidance as balanced, but certainly balance in what we see today. As you saw in our outlook, we provided a wider range, both on the top and bottom line. And I think what that really indicates is we believe we continue to operate in an environment of heightened volatility and I'll be the first to admit, I don't think we've done a particularly good job of estimating the cost environment. And so, as we look forward, we're projecting about $400 million worth of cost inflation or supply chain. We think that's a balanced approach to take at this point, but I'll acknowledge there's a lot of variability there. We're going to watch that very closely and obviously update folks as we progress through the year. But we think to start the year, this is the right outlook. And again, the wider ranges speak to the heightened volatility we're dealing with.\nPeter Grom: Thanks. And then maybe just following up on just the organic sales outlook, but just trying to understand the confidence around the continued strength across the rest of the rest of the portfolio, you highlighted the release and to prepare remarks that organic sales growth, excluding cleaning was -- I think was up mid-single digit. So is that kind of the expectation moving forward? And if so, what kind of gives you confidence that you won't see the moderation in some of these other categories looking ahead?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah, Peter, we feel very good about our portfolio overall. As you saw in our prepared remarks, if we set aside the health and wellness sector, and if you start with Q4, for the rest of our portfolio, our household essentials, our international business, we about 5% organic growth feel very good about the strength of that portfolio. When you think about health and wellness, I would say pricing is playing out very much as we expected. Elasticities continue to be below historical levels, but we've got a couple additional dynamics going on in that segment. As we mentioned, we had inventory reductions that are retailers we saw in April and May, and that had a bit of a drag in the quarter, as well as we continue to see demand moderation in cleaning and disinfecting behaviors with consumers. And we think that's going to continue. And so if you look at what we saw in Q4, as we project forward at fiscal or '23, we continue to expect to play out somewhat similar. As we look forward, we feel very good about household essentials and international. I think our pricing will continue to perform well now, I think it's worth noting, we have assumed in our most recent price increase, we took in July, we've assumed elasticities revert back to what we saw historically, which means more negative than we've seen over the previous two price increases, and we just think that's a prudent assumption to make given the pressure consumers have been under and we expect it'll continue to be under going forward. But overall I'd expect on the bulk of our portfolio. You'll see favourable price mix in the high single digit range and volume down likely low single digits, similar to what we saw in Q4. And then I think in the health and wellness segment again, feel very good about our pricing actions. I feel very good about the health of that business. If you look at our home care portfolio, we continue to grow share. We grew share last year. If you look particularly our wipes business, I think we've grown share for the last six quarters and so the business itself is very healthy, but we have to recognize, we expect to continue to see some moderation and share behavior and that'll play out in the category. So we expect that category to be down but our business is quite healthy within this category.\nPeter Grom: Thanks so much. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira - JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good afternoon. So I want to go back to the assumptions of the minus future plus three organic growth and I know I appreciate that you had to be to provide a wide range. So you just discussed now that the pricing that is embedded and I'm assuming that is a fixed part a price mix would be about high single. So it implies that you'd think at the bottom of the range that you have, a minus 6%-ish if you will, like 5%, 6% in volumes and then conversely, a more healthy environment on the top range. So just to kind of pause here and think what are you embedding there? It's still mostly on the health and wellness, the cleaning division that you expect that to be down, or you're also embedding declines in the other component. And I have a follow up on the cost side, the $400 million that you were expecting, is that based on spot or you're also using the curve as you normally do?\nKevin Jacobsen: Hi Andrea and thanks for the question. In regard to our sales outlook on organic sales growth of minus 3% to plus 3%, that assumes very similar to what Peter and I were talking about, good solid performance on our household essentials and international portfolio that I expect positive sales growth there. I do expect our health and wellness segment to be down for the year. And that's primarily driven by the demand moderation we expect particularly including disinfecting. And folks you have to remember if you think about the lapse we have this year, last year in both Q1 and to a lesser extent, Q3, we had both the Delta and Omicron variant spreading in the US, and we had very strong performance in the prior year. So we have to lap that in addition to some moderating consumer behaviors, and as a result of that we think the health and wellness segment will be down in sales for the year, but that's really driven by the category much less. So based on the strength of our business. Just Andrea, as as an example, if you think about Q1 last year, very strong performance for cleaning and disinfecting business. And in fact, our wipess business on a unit basis, that business was up over 50% in Q1 of last year. So we have to lap that, and you may have seen my prepared remarks as a result of that, we think our, our cleaning and disinfecting business will be down double digits in Q1, and why we think overall sales for the company will be down high single digits. It's really driven by the lap of Q1 in the previous year and then we expect to see stronger performance as we move forward. And then on the $400 million worth of input costs, we're projecting this year we base that on what we expect not just on spot rates, but looking forward where we expect commodities to migrate over the course of the year. And as we think about how that will phase into our results, we expect cost inflation, be the highest at the beginning of the year, and then moderate as we move through the year.\nAndrea Teixeira: That's super helpful. Just a follow up on that like, what is your visibility, as you said, like we use forward curves, but you have some visibility into the first half, correct?\nKevin Jacobsen: We do. Yes.\nAndrea Teixeira: So the only thing that's really more forward is more the second half.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah. I'd be careful that we, we have visibility to forward curves for many of our commodities, but keep in mind the level of volatility that we continue to see while there's many outside resources, that project commodity inflation and, and forward curves, I have found in this environment, they are difficult to use as certainty. We've seen quite a bit of variability on, on the services we use, and I think that's true for most folks. And so we have visibility to what we believe how com will play out over the course of the year, but I'm a bit cautious with suggesting that we have certain in the first six months.\nAndrea Teixeira: Yeah, that's fair. Thank you. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo and Company. Your line is open.\nChris Carey: Hey everyone. Can I just confirm that just the commentary around sales that you expect the health and wellness business, sales to be down for the year, but the rest of the business is to be up. So, I just wanted to confirm these prior lines of questioning. And then, just from a gross margin perspective, you've given some good detail around the makings of the bridge for fiscal '23. Kevin, I wonder if you could perhaps provide a bit more context on the contributing factors between pricing, volume deleverage, you noted $400 million of cost inflation. Is that all commodities or are there other non-commodity cost buckets within that? Any promotional activity, transportation, logistics, you see what I'm getting at? I wonder if you could just maybe contextualize some of these key buckets and where you see the most risk or not.\nKevin Jacobsen: Hi, Chris. Yeah. Happy to provide some additional insights into the -- where we see the cost inflation occurring and our plans to grow margin. On your sales question, though you are correct, our expectations to help and wellness segment will decline this year offset by growth over the rest of our portfolio. And again, as I mentioned, feel very good about the overall health of our business, but recognize as both lapping the strong performance we had last year, plus the moderating demand by consumers and cleaning disinfecting that that'll have a negative impact on the category for the year. In regard to the cost inflation the $400 million I mentioned is cost inflation across the entire supply chain. That includes commodities, transportation, wage inflation. We are expecting broad based inflation across the entire supply chain, and in regards to what we're doing to offset that is, as you folks know, and we've talked quite a bit about this, our commitment remains that we intend to get back to a pre-pandemic level of gross margin. We lost about 800 basis points last year. And our goal is to build that back over time. As we've said, I think very clearly we don't expect to do that in one year, but we expect to make progress this year and then we'll continue to work at that. We are pulling every lever available to us. And so Chris, you think about the areas that we're pursuing that will drive that benefit this year for us, the, the biggest lever we're pulling is pricing. We have executed now three pricing actions. Two went into effect last year. The third price increase just went into effect last month, that'll have the biggest benefit we expect on our cost structure this year in the 500 to 600 basis point range. We expect to get a benefit this year. A little higher in the front half as that pricing build and as we start to lapse on the actions we took last year, it'll start to dissipate a bit. We're also driving our cost savings program. And we expect to have a very strong year this year. It's been more difficult over the past two years, given the work we've been doing to try to keep up with demand. As demand is moderating and we've been working on our supply chain, we have more opportunity to drive cost savings within our supply chain. So I expect to have a very strong year this year in that 150 basis point to 175 basis points range. And so those would be the two biggest drivers of helping us rebuild margins. And then that's going to be offset by ongoing cost inflation, both in commodities, manufacturing, logistics, and then you may have seen it Chris and our prepared remarks. But the other item I point out is while we expect to improve gross margins, we're talking about 200 basis points this year, I think you'll see that build as we move through the year. We're gonna be most challenged in Q1 given the decline in the top line, and that has an operating de-leveraging impact on margins and to expect our gross margins to be about 35% in the first quarter, but they not expect to build as we move through the year with the expectation we're going to be approaching about 40 basis points by the time we get to the end of the year. And for perspective, we've lost about eight margin points last year, our run rate, as we get through the year, we think we'll put about half of that back on as we move into fiscal year 24. And again, we may remain committed to continue to pursue margin expansion beyond this year.\nChris Carey: Thank you very much for that, Kevin. This should be a quick one, but the health and wellness declines you're expecting, can you just offer a quick comment on the professional business clearly, quite challenged this year, are you expecting that to continue or as we've normalized, the sales base you expect that business to get back to growth next year. So thanks for all that.\nKevin Jacobsen: Sure. Chris, on our professional products division, I'd say overall, we expect modest growth. I think that'll build as we move through the era as we get past some of the comps and we get back to sort of a new level of performance. And particularly as you think about occupancies and professional environments starting to pick up, we think over time, we'll get back to growing that business and likely in the back half of this year and then growing overall for the year.\nChris Carey: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Thank you everybody. Can you talk a bit more about the streamlining program and maybe more specifically, what you'll be doing differently how we should be thinking about what impact it may or may not have in the short run on, on top line. And when we think about you raising your long term algorithm to 3% to 5% on the top line in the context of what we're now seeing, is there something we should be just thinking about in terms of your ability to achieve that over the long run?\nLinda Rendle: Sure. Hi Kaumil, I'll start with the streamlining. So, this is our next step in one of our strategic choices connected to our ignite strategy, which is to reimagine work. And back when we released our strategy in 2019, we articulated that we wanted to be a faster and simpler company, and this is the next evolution in that. We're already a pretty efficient company, but we think we can be even more efficient. And these changes will help us meet that algorithm, that sales growth target of 3% to 5% and growing profitably over time as we return margins back to their pre-pandemic state. And what we're really trying to do through this model is get closer to the customer and closer to the consumer so that we can anticipate their needs better, move more quickly and have the entire organization focused on the business unit priorities and having end to end visibility. We expect to implement this beginning in fiscal year 23 coming up here in the end of Q1. We expect to save $75 million to a $100 million over the two years that we'll implement this, that will be an annual savings once we have it fully implemented. And we, over time, the combination of this with our digital transformation will really set us up for that goal of having an organization that moves much faster, much more simple and will support getting, we're targeting about 13% as a percent of sales from an S&A perspective with those two initiatives combined over time.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Got it. And this is separate from your typical productivity savings. I'm sorry about that. But, in your gross margin bridge, you often give the benefit of savings. This is separate and additional correct.\nLinda Rendle: That's right, Kaumil. This is incremental to that. You want to move to the question on long term on 3% to 5%. So, on the 3% to 5%, we still remain committed to that and we see line of sight to that, but it's not going to be linear to get there and Kevin did a good job articulating what some of the factors are that we're dealing with in the short term. And it really has to do with demand, normalization and lapping COVID impact. Back a year ago, we thought that COVID was that the worst of it was behind us before we entered fiscal year '22. We thought inflation was transitory. And that has turned out to be a much longer headwind that we're facing. And if you look at what we experienced from COVID last year, as Kevin said, we had two of the biggest COVID waves, both Delta and Omicron impacting our business. So we have to lap that and get to a more normalized state. We expect that to happen over the course of fiscal year '23, we have some other businesses that are doing some normalization. Kingsford is a good example. It's one of our fastest growing businesses and that's normalizing. But really health and wellness is the biggest portion of that. And as Kevin articulated, we expect the broad portfolio to be growing. And we expect health and wellness to be down next year as a result of this normalization. But as we look at what we delivered, for example, in Q4 our businesses from our organic sales growth perspective, X the health and wellness segment grew 5% so well within our algorithm. If you take a step back and look at the last three years, our business is in aggregate averaged 5% CAGR over that period of time from a growth. So we are in a period of normalization, that's the biggest factor, but we remain confident in our ability to deliver the 3% to 5% and are really happy with the strength of our brands right now 75% of our portfolio deems superior by consumers pricing is going as planned. And we anticipate that it will continue to go as planned in the early insights that we have as we've implemented our third round in July. And what we're just watching really closely is the consumer and watching this environment for them and we will make adjustments to our plans as needed, but we're heading into the period with strong brands, rebuilding margins, so that we can continue to invest and we're just gonna be as nimble as we can to react to a, a really volatile changing environment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJason English: Hey folks, thanks for slot me. Kevin, the $400 million of incremental cost pressure, I think you said is not just commodities, but it's supply chain as well. A, can you confirm that? And, and B yeah, I think many of us myself included were expecting to see a very big offset come as you in-sourced a lot of the product. Does that $400 million include that offset or is that offset captured somewhere else?\nKevin Jacobsen: Hi, Jason. Yeah. Thanks for the question. The $400 million does include supply chain inflation broadly across the entire supply chain, not just commodities. And so that will be, we're looking at increased transportation cost, increased wage cost. We have built in the savings as we've exited these contract manufacturing agreements. We've now stepped out of all the agreements that we intend to step out of. It is contributing to our growing gross, our plan to grow gross margins this year. And so really our pricing actions, our cost savings, plus stepping outta these, these arrangements are all contributing to offsetting the cost inflation we're dealing with beyond the cost inflation though, the other item impacting manufacturing logistics is volume de-leveraging. So as we're taking quite a bit of pricing volume will be down for the year that does have some negative impact on manufacturing, logistics, but it's being offset to a certain degree by the exiting of those co back agreements. So that has all included in our bridge.\nJason English: Understood. That's helpful. And I have a lot of questions, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to burn one on, on a simple modeling math question, because I've loaded up my model here and I'm still having a hard time getting down to your EPS that you've guided to despite seemingly getting like the gross margin, the other spend levels, right. Interest expense is the last variable. Like what are you assuming on interest expense and do you have a sharp uptick coming with maybe with the higher rates?\nKevin Jacobsen: We don't Jason, we just recently refinanced debt maturities coming due over the next several years. And so this last quarter we called $1.1 billion in debt refinanced that at a slightly lower interest rate, a, a modest savings in terms of interest expense. The other thing I might point to on a reported basis, if you look at other income and expense, typically we have about $30 million to $40 million worth of charges related to intangible amortization. And then related to the operating model redesign we talked about today we baked in about $35 million worth of restructuring charges that will show up in other income and expense as well. It's about $0.20 as our estimate. So that may be something else you'll look at in your model.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] And we have a question from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nDara Mohsenian: Can you talk a little bit about pricing from here? Obviously you've implemented some pricing this summer that hasn't been realized through the P&L yet, so that's to come, but as you look going forward, are there plans for any incremental pricing, just given the gross margin aggression over a three year period, even with the rebound expected in the upcoming fiscal year. And how do you think about that line item going forward in terms of price increases versus maybe mix pack, size changes, etcetera?\nLinda Rendle: Sure. Just a reminder for everyone. We just implemented our third significant round of pricing in July, and that is flowing through now to your point and is on track to our expectations. And that was our largest price increase of the three that we have taken over the last 12 months. And, and it's on track. We do anticipate taking additional pricing as part of our plan and that will come in different forms, whether that be truckload increases or price pack architecture, which will start to begin in more earnest in fiscal year '23, as we've discussed before. And what we're watching right now is the reaction to July. It's too early to tell that is just hitting the market now and, and we'd want to get through a purchase cycle with the consumer to see how they're reacting. And as Kevin highlighted, we had seen our historical price elasticities, not play out over this last year. They were slightly better than that historical elasticity that we had experienced, but we're expecting that to return in fiscal year '23. So elasticity slightly worse and better in line with what we saw pre-COVID given the level of pricing and given what's going on with the consumer. So we'd anticipate they will, they will continue to be on track. Our categories remain healthy, but we're gonna watch that very closely and we will adjust any plans that we have as needed to address that. But, largely we expect to continue to use pricing as a lever to grow gross margin, not only through July, but through the course of the year.\nDara Mohsenian: Okay. Thanks. And then just a detailed question, the streamlined operating model, how much savings do you have embedded in guidance in fiscal '23? Is that savings more likely to play out in fiscal '24 or is there a decent chunk of it in fiscal '23?\nKevin Jacobsen: Hi Dara, as you may have seen, we are projecting $75 million to a $100 million of savings over the next 18 months to 24 months. We are expecting about $25 million worth of savings this year as we begin the program. And then that'll continue in fiscal year '24. And in terms of, as you're sort of modeling it as you're modeling both the onetime restructuring charge, typically those charges come first. So I expect more restructuring charges in the front half the year, and then the savings start to occur in the back half of the year and then continue into next year.\nOperator: We have a question from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nKevin Grundy: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to pick up on, on trade down risk Linda, I think you mentioned a handful of times about how the consumer is behaving and then, and we see that right. And increasingly I think across the categories, as we look at the syndicated data for Clorox, we're seeing private label pickup share across all of your key categories, trash bags, bleach wipes, salad, dressing, charcoal etcetera. I think a notable nuance with this has also been the price gaps have narrowed given some of the timing in terms of when you have moved versus private label as well. So we've seen some of the share loss or share gains for private label while, while price gaps have narrowed for Clorox versus private label, which is a bit perverse. And I think Kevin, you're also made the comment, that you expect, with some of this pricing that the price gaps will return to more normal levels. So, so that is to suggest that the price gaps will, will widen, which then, in theory for more, more price conscious consumer could, could perpetuate, some of the share issues that you've seen in your portfolio. So that's all sort of a big wind up Linda, I guess, for how worried, how did you contemplate what you're seeing with the consumer and some of these dynamics as you pulled together the outlook, maybe just comment, updated thoughts on trade down risk, where you are with price gaps, where you think you're gonna land et cetera. Thank you.\nLinda Rendle: Sure. Kevin, thanks for the question. So maybe we start with your private label share question and, and talk a little bit about what we're seeing there and we can get into the broader piece around, what does that mean and what are we seeing more broadly in trade down? So as we've spoken about before the dynamics. As you look at any time period in scanner data, right now, it's difficult to parse out because you have many factors depending on the category. Normalization, the timing of pricing, which you already hit on, which is exactly right. Supply normalization, etcetera. So I would caution that looking at any small portion of time to get to a conclusion one way or the other, have to get in to a bit of the nuances. As it relates to private label and our categories, a good portion of that is the timing gap in pricing. So we've seen private label go a little faster in some of our categories. You call that out and it's true in trash and bleach in particular. In wipes, it is more about normalization and so wipes in that time period for Q4 private label grew five share points, we grew six. So it's not coming from us. And if you look at charcoal, another example where there's a different nuance, we grew share all outlets as consumers move to some channels and bought some larger sizes even though we were down slightly in Lulo. So I think again, just speaks to the dynamic nature of what we're experiencing right now, and you're right, as we return our price gaps to more normalized levels, which we continue to expect. And as we implement our July price increase, that is in market now. And again, as a reminder is our largest price increase. We do expect to be back to more normalized price gaps, and you'll start to see that flow through and share. Right now we have very strong volume shares for example, and we expect that to translate to dollar share as that flows through. And then, your larger question on trade down, we are not seeing any significant trade down as it relates to trading into private label. Given the dynamics I just covered, I think that's clear that there's some other things going on there, but we are seeing some trade down within our own portfolio, for example, and we would've anticipated and expected this, and we're working this as part of our sales plan. So for example, we're seeing consumers move to some opening price points. They still want the branded player, but they are, don't have a lot of out of pocket and so they're buying a smaller size. We're also seeing consumers trade up to larger sizes to get the very best price per ounce. And we're working with retailers to ensure our assortment is right to capture that. We've seen that in other times of in inflation and recession and so we've been proactive about addressing that with our retailer partners to ensure that we have the right distribution. And of course, as we are widely distributed across all channels who are ready as consumers move and ensure that that they have their right level of value. So at this moment, what I would say is, we are seeing some change in consumer behavior. It's largely what we would anticipate. We are not seeing a big change into private label at this moment. Again, we're focusing on the things that we can control here. Ensuring our innovation program continues to activate in the market. We continue to spend on our brands, we'll spend 10% of sales on advertising and sales promotion next year. And we're proactively working with our retailers on tailored shopper plans to ensure that we're offering the right value for the moment, depending on where the consumer is. And it's something, again, we'll watch very closely and we'll adjust our plans as needed if it, it starts to go in a different direction.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays Investment Bank. Your line is open.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks so much. Thank you. I had two sets of questions. The first thing is just on the SG&A and as you're talking about targeting a lower ratio over time and this kind of restructuring program that you're initiating. It strikes me that if anything, it has felt like perhaps Clorox has been more on the side of underinvested, not overinvested. The company's been, made a hallmark of running lean go lean was a program and that's been an approach. And so if anything, and maybe I'm off base on this, it's felt like part of the problem has been being too lean that hasn't afforded you, the visibility you've needed, the flexibility you've needed. And yet part of this plan going forward is to get more lean on SG&A. So I would just be curious on, on reactions to that and then I have a question on cash flow. Thanks.\nLinda Rendle: Sure. Hi Lauren. So, as we think about just our investment and, and how this fits into the overall picture that we're trying to drive with Ignite, we were really clear and Ignite that we needed to be simpler and faster. That was a key choice that we made under the headline of reimagined work. And we also said we needed to invest strongly in our business. And we took that another step further when we announced the technology transformation that we're undergoing and the $500 million investment we're making in that program over the next several years, in addition, we've continued to invest strongly linear brands. We've invested in innovation and innovation as a larger contributor than it was in the prior strategy period. So I feel like we were making all of the right investments to ensure that we have strong brands with our consumers, and that is playing out in our consumer value measure. And we expect to play out over the mid to long term and share, certainly this quarter, wasn't the share performance we want to deliver, but we feel like we're headed in the right direction, but when it comes to this piece and what we want to do with the operating model, we want to make sure that we are always operating as efficiently as we can and putting the dollars where they matter in our business to ensure that we can grow our brands. And we believe very strongly that we can be more simple and fast, and that will help support that 3% to 5% growth rate that we have and restoring margins. We want to cut down on decision time. We wanna ensure that the technology we put in place through our digital transformation is supported by a structure that enables it and uses it as fast as we possibly can to ensure that we're closer to the customer and closer to the consumer. So I think when you step back and take a balanced view, we are making investments in the right spots where we think they have the highest ROI. And we are ensuring that we take all of the necessary actions to reduce costs where we think that ROI is lower and we can operate more efficiently. And I just want to be really clear, I think on your point on Go Lean. Go Lean was not a company initiative, that was an international initiative, and that was very effective for international to ensure that we are reestablished the cost base of international to get to the appropriate level, to grow off of. And you can look at our international performance was very strong this year and that was supported by getting that right structure underneath the business in order for it to grow. So again, as I step back Lauren, I think we have investments in the right place and we are doing everything that we can to restore margins in places where we have a, a lower return on that investment.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay, great. Thank you. That's excellent color. My next question was just on, on cash flow. So I was curious if there's any, Kevin cash flow metrics you could articulate that you're targeting for '23. And just in terms of in inventory, right because inventory days are still quite and I'm just curious, as you think through, obviously a lot of this is going to be tied to cleaning. A lot of this is tied to exiting those, the external supply contracts, but how should we be thinking about inventory days? And, what's the right level, right? You're still in the kind of low sixties and that's significantly higher than where you were pre-COVID. So just how that flows into the gross margin recovery story and '23 or beyond. Thanks.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah. Thanks Lauren. For the question, maybe I'll start with inventory then I'll get back to cash flow and our expectations this year. As it relates to inventory I feel good about the progress we are making. If you look at the fourth quarter, we were able to reduce inventory sequentially about 50 million from where we landed in Q3. Now, part of that was what we talked about earlier as we exited these third party manufacturing agreements. And in many cases, we maintained raw materials or finished goods of these facilities. We're able to consolidate those manufacturing nodes and reduce our overall inventory levels and so we made good progress there. I expect this year, we'll continue to make progress on inventory. Now that assumes that we see more normalization in supply chain. Lauren, as we've talked in the past, we've had to hold higher inventory levels to prepare for the ongoing disruptions. We're dealing with our expectations as supply chain will still be challenged, but certainly not to the degree we've experienced over the last 12, 18 months. So as a result, we're gonna be able to pull down our inventory levels broadly across the enterprise. And so I'd expect us to continue to make progress. I like the progress I saw in Q4. I expect that to continue in fiscal '23, which it contribute to reducing our overall working capital. And then I think more broadly about cash. Lauren, I think this year very similar last year, I think in terms of cash provided by operations, we'll be in that $700 million to $900 million range. Now before our margins were under pressure, we were January about a $1 billion. And so I do expect it to be lower than our historical levels because of the reduced profitability we're expecting this year. And then as it relates to CapEx, as we target three to 4% per year. Now we've been a little above that in previous years that we've been making some investments to in increase our, our production capacity for the most part we're through those investments. We have one last plant we're working on where, as you may know, we're preparing to open up a second litter facility, which we'll bring online this year. So we've got a little bit more capital spending there, but I expect we'll be in that three to 4% this year and probably about the midpoint of that range. And so that means is you think about our free cash flow goal. We target 11% to 13%. I expect this year will be below, will be below that goal, probably high single digits as we've got some reduced profitability. And then over our time, I expect to build that back as we improve profitability.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay. The great, thanks so much for all the detail.\nKevin Jacobsen: Sure. Thanks Lauren.\nOperator: We have a question from Olivia Tong of Raymond James. Your line is open.\nOlivia Tong: You have mentioned earlier that price elasticities have continued to come in better than you expected, but your outlook assumes that, that doesn't continue that they go back to the circle level. So to the extent that you do have some favorability there versus expectations. How do you think about what you do with that? Does it flow through to the P&L? Or is there -- are there projects that you want to do to drive some return free and funds to return to spending? And then just on the gross margin overall, 200 basis points expected for next year, so quarter of the way back, it sounds like you were expecting another quarter in fiscal '24. So is that the way that we should be thinking about the mechanics to get back to where you were before, just sort of like ratably fourth or fourth or fourth or fourth?\nLinda Rendle: Sure. I'll start with your question on price elasticity. So if we were to experience better than what we expect, which again is more normalized price elasticities to historical pre-COVID then that would be something that we would first look to flow through. And of course, that's because we've made all the investments that we feel we need to make at this time in the year. We're investing in advertising. We have the right promotional spending from what we can see. And of course, if there was anything that were to change that we needed to address, then we would consider that, but we would leverage that in a way to flow through. And I just want to make sure I'm really clear on that. But we'll, of course, have to see given the environment is so volatile if there was anything else to come up, we would correct but that would be the first thing we would look to do.\nKevin Jacobsen: And then, Olivia, on your question on gross margin and the pace of the margin recovery, as you mentioned, our expectation is we're going to improve gross margin by 200 basis points. I think important, though, is we expect that to build as we move through the year. And as I said earlier, our expectation is we're going to be close to a 40% gross margin when we end the year. So on a run rate basis, I expect to make fairly good progress this year and be in a position we've recovered a good portion of that margin decline. And then I expect that obviously to continue to '24 where the actions we'll take. Now part of the timing of our pace of margin recovery will be dictated by inflation. I would tell you, we are not waiting for cost deflation is our path to margin recovery. We're pulling every lever available to us between pricing, cost savings, the operating model changes we talked about today, and we'll continue to do that going forward. But obviously, what the direction inflation goes could either accelerate or decelerate that margin recovery. In this environment, it's hard to look beyond this year. with a strong perspective on where costs will be next year. And so that's something we'll probably have to see how it plays out a bit this year to make that call. So I think we're making solid progress this year on our commitment to rebuild margins. We're pulling every lever available to us. And I think it's a bit difficult to pick the exact time period. We'll build it back. I think some of that will be influenced by the external cost environment. As we move through the year, we'll certainly update you as we're thinking about the pace of that change.\nOlivia Tong: Got it. And then my follow-up is on your thoughts around your trajectory on market share. Perhaps could you talk a little bit about what private label capacity looks like? And specifically in the health and wellness businesses. Obviously, a lot of pretty aggressive pricing and consequently a fair degree of volume degradation associated with that. So to the extent that consumers can first and foremost, stomach this much in terms of pricing, just kind of curious how you how private label capacity and their ability to step in looks as you consider these pricing and what that you're taking?\nLinda Rendle: Olivia, I can't speak to capacity outside of our own network. I don't think there's a capacity limiter in our categories. That's not as we have spoken about in terms offer. But what I would really return to is what we're seeing in terms of the performance, it was down slightly versus a year ago. We made sequential improvement from Q3 to Q4. And again, I highlighted a few of those area that were due to pricing timing and then some other factors where we grew very strongly, for example, in wipes and private label did as well we were up 6 points, they were up five points from a share perspective. So I don't see any health issue at this point in our home care categories or our cleaning categories. Elasticities, again, are playing out as we define. And I think really, as we look to this, we will expect demand normalization to be the biggest contributing factor and the elasticities will largely play out as we expect. Again, we'll watch that very closely. But this is more about demand normalization than it is about any trade down to private label at this point.\nOperator: And we have a question from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nSteve Powers: I guess, picking up on that thread of demand normalization, Linda. I guess I'm curious as to how you actually go about or have gone about defining what renormalized demand looks like in categories like wipes or cleaning and disinfecting more broadly and maybe how that compares to prepandemic levels? And as you talk about that, maybe you could, if possible, elaborate a bit more on the expected pacing to get there embedded in the outlook? I get the base year comparisons are going to create a lot of year-over-year volatility, but is the normalization process that you're envisioning, is that something that happens all the way through '23? Does it happen faster such that the headwinds are skewed heavily to the first half and the back half is more normal? Just how should we think about that?\nLinda Rendle: Yes, Steve. On demand normalization we certainly are lapping impacts from COVID, but we're seeing changes in more normal behavior coming from consumers, and we're trying to understand when are we at a new normal. -- and it's more about lapse versus we're at that new normalization state. We saw, as Kevin and I said a couple of times, we're lapping delta right now where wipes were up from a unit base is 50% in our last Q1 and we did see a bump in Q3 as well. And so both of those will be left that we'll have to get through. So we're talking through fiscal year '23, we would expect that normalization. We are still seeing consumer behaviors, if you look at buy rate, et cetera, enhanced, and we're still seeing people care about cleaning and disinfecting elevated, but definitely lower than it was at the height of the pandemic, but higher than it was pre-COVID. So what we're trying to gauge is when does that new consumption pattern align to that desire from consumers who have a heightened state of awareness of cleaning and disinfecting and get into a more normalized routine. The other thing we're going to see how this plays out is cold and flu. Consumers have not experienced a normal cold and flu season since COVID started. So how will that reinforce consumer behaviors, and we'll experience that at the end of Q2 and through Q3. So we'll be watching that very closely. And then, of course, we're in a COVID wave right now. And so we're watching that dynamic as we lap last year's Delta Wave. So I would say we are watching this throughout the year, and we'll give indicators of when we start to see that more normalized demand, but we're looking something between where we were pre-COVID, which we continue to be above that. and what it looks like in a more normalized state when people are more aware and have a heightened concern but yet are getting into a new set of habits and routines. And we'll keep you updated as we see that and when we anticipate being in a more normalized state. But as you can imagine, given what's going on with COVID, et cetera, it is difficult to pinpoint exactly when that will occur.\nSteve Powers: Yes. Okay. That's all fair. Just one other question, if I could. Going back to the new operating model. I guess I was just curious for a little history on when the initiatives that you've you're rolling out here in '23 and into '24, when those were -- when those began to be contemplated? Just a little bit of history on how these decisions were made? And has this been planned for a while? Is this something that is more of a recent initiative? Just a little color there would be helpful.\nLinda Rendle: Sure, Steve. This really relates back to the strategic choice we made in Ignite to reimagine work, and we wanted to be simpler and faster. And we always contemplated ways, as you would expect, you expect us to operate efficiently and be removing costs wherever we can. They were always looking at the choices across the ecosystem to say, are we getting the best return on our investment? Are there ways to do things more effectively and efficiently? We did that as we unveiled our digital transformation program. which we really needed to accelerate given the increase in digital behavior behind the pandemics, we moved that up. And as we evaluated the environment that we see now, we want to accelerate the progress we wanted to make on reimagine work by making a more structural change. So that I would say it's at this moment that we think it's the right time to do that. We've got to a bit more of a steady state when it comes to supply chain, still very challenged. We're still having force majeures, etcetera, but it's more manageable. And we think this is the right time to take it on, but it's really a continuation of that vision we laid out in 2019 to be faster and.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. Ms. Rendle, I would now like to turn the program back to you.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks again, everyone, for joining us. I look forward to speaking with you again on our next call in November. Until then, please stay well.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending.",

On the initial guidance, just kind of given where it all landed versus expectations, I would be curious like Linda or Kevin, would you characterize this outlook as conservative? Is it prudent? Just trying to understand the comfort and the range at this point, just given what we've seen over the past year. Thanks. And then maybe just following up on just the organic sales outlook, but just trying to understand the confidence around the continued strength across the rest of the rest of the portfolio, you highlighted the release and to prepare remarks that organic sales growth, excluding cleaning was -- I think was up mid-single digit. So is that kind of the expectation moving forward? And if so, what kind of gives you confidence that you won't see the moderation in some of these other categories looking ahead? Thanks so much.

            "name": "Linda Rendle",
            "content": "Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us. Our fiscal 2022 results reflect a very challenging operating environment, including record-high input cost inflation and ongoing pandemic-driven volatility. We navigated this environment by taking a broad set of actions within our control to rebuild margin while continuing to invest in innovation and our portfolio of trusted brands to position Clorox for long-term success. This allowed us to deliver results in line with our outlook, including another quarter of sequential gross margin improvement. While we look forward to a return to our more normalized environment, we are not there yet. We expect the environment to remain difficult in fiscal '23, as we lap COVID impacts on our business, demand continues to normalize, particularly in our cleaning and disinfecting portfolio and factors like input cost inflation and supply chain disruptions persist. We'll keep addressing these challenges head on through actions that include revenue management, further pricing, ongoing cost management and supply chain optimization, our digital transformation and the streamline operating model. We announced today. At the same time, we're committed to maintaining our category leadership and delivering superior consumer value. I'm confident that our Ignite strategy continues to position us well for the future. We remain committed to delivering on our 3% to 5% sales growth target over the long term and are on the right path to drive consistent profitable growth over time and create shareholder value. With that. Kevin and I will open the line for questions. Sure. Hi Kaumil, I'll start with the streamlining. So, this is our next step in one of our strategic choices connected to our ignite strategy, which is to reimagine work. And back when we released our strategy in 2019, we articulated that we wanted to be a faster and simpler company, and this is the next evolution in that. We're already a pretty efficient company, but we think we can be even more efficient. And these changes will help us meet that algorithm, that sales growth target of 3% to 5% and growing profitably over time as we return margins back to their pre-pandemic state. And what we're really trying to do through this model is get closer to the customer and closer to the consumer so that we can anticipate their needs better, move more quickly and have the entire organization focused on the business unit priorities and having end to end visibility. We expect to implement this beginning in fiscal year 23 coming up here in the end of Q1. We expect to save $75 million to a $100 million over the two years that we'll implement this, that will be an annual savings once we have it fully implemented. And we, over time, the combination of this with our digital transformation will really set us up for that goal of having an organization that moves much faster, much more simple and will support getting, we're targeting about 13% as a percent of sales from an S&A perspective with those two initiatives combined over time. That's right, Kaumil. This is incremental to that. You want to move to the question on long term on 3% to 5%. So, on the 3% to 5%, we still remain committed to that and we see line of sight to that, but it's not going to be linear to get there and Kevin did a good job articulating what some of the factors are that we're dealing with in the short term. And it really has to do with demand, normalization and lapping COVID impact. Back a year ago, we thought that COVID was that the worst of it was behind us before we entered fiscal year '22. We thought inflation was transitory. And that has turned out to be a much longer headwind that we're facing. And if you look at what we experienced from COVID last year, as Kevin said, we had two of the biggest COVID waves, both Delta and Omicron impacting our business. So we have to lap that and get to a more normalized state. We expect that to happen over the course of fiscal year '23, we have some other businesses that are doing some normalization. Kingsford is a good example. It's one of our fastest growing businesses and that's normalizing. But really health and wellness is the biggest portion of that. And as Kevin articulated, we expect the broad portfolio to be growing. And we expect health and wellness to be down next year as a result of this normalization. But as we look at what we delivered, for example, in Q4 our businesses from our organic sales growth perspective, X the health and wellness segment grew 5% so well within our algorithm. If you take a step back and look at the last three years, our business is in aggregate averaged 5% CAGR over that period of time from a growth. So we are in a period of normalization, that's the biggest factor, but we remain confident in our ability to deliver the 3% to 5% and are really happy with the strength of our brands right now 75% of our portfolio deems superior by consumers pricing is going as planned. And we anticipate that it will continue to go as planned in the early insights that we have as we've implemented our third round in July. And what we're just watching really closely is the consumer and watching this environment for them and we will make adjustments to our plans as needed, but we're heading into the period with strong brands, rebuilding margins, so that we can continue to invest and we're just gonna be as nimble as we can to react to a, a really volatile changing environment. Sure. Just a reminder for everyone. We just implemented our third significant round of pricing in July, and that is flowing through now to your point and is on track to our expectations. And that was our largest price increase of the three that we have taken over the last 12 months. And, and it's on track. We do anticipate taking additional pricing as part of our plan and that will come in different forms, whether that be truckload increases or price pack architecture, which will start to begin in more earnest in fiscal year '23, as we've discussed before. And what we're watching right now is the reaction to July. It's too early to tell that is just hitting the market now and, and we'd want to get through a purchase cycle with the consumer to see how they're reacting. And as Kevin highlighted, we had seen our historical price elasticities, not play out over this last year. They were slightly better than that historical elasticity that we had experienced, but we're expecting that to return in fiscal year '23. So elasticity slightly worse and better in line with what we saw pre-COVID given the level of pricing and given what's going on with the consumer. So we'd anticipate they will, they will continue to be on track. Our categories remain healthy, but we're gonna watch that very closely and we will adjust any plans that we have as needed to address that. But, largely we expect to continue to use pricing as a lever to grow gross margin, not only through July, but through the course of the year. Sure. Kevin, thanks for the question. So maybe we start with your private label share question and, and talk a little bit about what we're seeing there and we can get into the broader piece around, what does that mean and what are we seeing more broadly in trade down? So as we've spoken about before the dynamics. As you look at any time period in scanner data, right now, it's difficult to parse out because you have many factors depending on the category. Normalization, the timing of pricing, which you already hit on, which is exactly right. Supply normalization, etcetera. So I would caution that looking at any small portion of time to get to a conclusion one way or the other, have to get in to a bit of the nuances. As it relates to private label and our categories, a good portion of that is the timing gap in pricing. So we've seen private label go a little faster in some of our categories. You call that out and it's true in trash and bleach in particular. In wipes, it is more about normalization and so wipes in that time period for Q4 private label grew five share points, we grew six. So it's not coming from us. And if you look at charcoal, another example where there's a different nuance, we grew share all outlets as consumers move to some channels and bought some larger sizes even though we were down slightly in Lulo. So I think again, just speaks to the dynamic nature of what we're experiencing right now, and you're right, as we return our price gaps to more normalized levels, which we continue to expect. And as we implement our July price increase, that is in market now. And again, as a reminder is our largest price increase. We do expect to be back to more normalized price gaps, and you'll start to see that flow through and share. Right now we have very strong volume shares for example, and we expect that to translate to dollar share as that flows through. And then, your larger question on trade down, we are not seeing any significant trade down as it relates to trading into private label. Given the dynamics I just covered, I think that's clear that there's some other things going on there, but we are seeing some trade down within our own portfolio, for example, and we would've anticipated and expected this, and we're working this as part of our sales plan. So for example, we're seeing consumers move to some opening price points. They still want the branded player, but they are, don't have a lot of out of pocket and so they're buying a smaller size. We're also seeing consumers trade up to larger sizes to get the very best price per ounce. And we're working with retailers to ensure our assortment is right to capture that. We've seen that in other times of in inflation and recession and so we've been proactive about addressing that with our retailer partners to ensure that we have the right distribution. And of course, as we are widely distributed across all channels who are ready as consumers move and ensure that that they have their right level of value. So at this moment, what I would say is, we are seeing some change in consumer behavior. It's largely what we would anticipate. We are not seeing a big change into private label at this moment. Again, we're focusing on the things that we can control here. Ensuring our innovation program continues to activate in the market. We continue to spend on our brands, we'll spend 10% of sales on advertising and sales promotion next year. And we're proactively working with our retailers on tailored shopper plans to ensure that we're offering the right value for the moment, depending on where the consumer is. And it's something, again, we'll watch very closely and we'll adjust our plans as needed if it, it starts to go in a different direction. Sure. Hi Lauren. So, as we think about just our investment and, and how this fits into the overall picture that we're trying to drive with Ignite, we were really clear and Ignite that we needed to be simpler and faster. That was a key choice that we made under the headline of reimagined work. And we also said we needed to invest strongly in our business. And we took that another step further when we announced the technology transformation that we're undergoing and the $500 million investment we're making in that program over the next several years, in addition, we've continued to invest strongly linear brands. We've invested in innovation and innovation as a larger contributor than it was in the prior strategy period. So I feel like we were making all of the right investments to ensure that we have strong brands with our consumers, and that is playing out in our consumer value measure. And we expect to play out over the mid to long term and share, certainly this quarter, wasn't the share performance we want to deliver, but we feel like we're headed in the right direction, but when it comes to this piece and what we want to do with the operating model, we want to make sure that we are always operating as efficiently as we can and putting the dollars where they matter in our business to ensure that we can grow our brands. And we believe very strongly that we can be more simple and fast, and that will help support that 3% to 5% growth rate that we have and restoring margins. We want to cut down on decision time. We wanna ensure that the technology we put in place through our digital transformation is supported by a structure that enables it and uses it as fast as we possibly can to ensure that we're closer to the customer and closer to the consumer. So I think when you step back and take a balanced view, we are making investments in the right spots where we think they have the highest ROI. And we are ensuring that we take all of the necessary actions to reduce costs where we think that ROI is lower and we can operate more efficiently. And I just want to be really clear, I think on your point on Go Lean. Go Lean was not a company initiative, that was an international initiative, and that was very effective for international to ensure that we are reestablished the cost base of international to get to the appropriate level, to grow off of. And you can look at our international performance was very strong this year and that was supported by getting that right structure underneath the business in order for it to grow. So again, as I step back Lauren, I think we have investments in the right place and we are doing everything that we can to restore margins in places where we have a, a lower return on that investment. Sure. I'll start with your question on price elasticity. So if we were to experience better than what we expect, which again is more normalized price elasticities to historical pre-COVID then that would be something that we would first look to flow through. And of course, that's because we've made all the investments that we feel we need to make at this time in the year. We're investing in advertising. We have the right promotional spending from what we can see. And of course, if there was anything that were to change that we needed to address, then we would consider that, but we would leverage that in a way to flow through. And I just want to make sure I'm really clear on that. But we'll, of course, have to see given the environment is so volatile if there was anything else to come up, we would correct but that would be the first thing we would look to do. Olivia, I can't speak to capacity outside of our own network. I don't think there's a capacity limiter in our categories. That's not as we have spoken about in terms offer. But what I would really return to is what we're seeing in terms of the performance, it was down slightly versus a year ago. We made sequential improvement from Q3 to Q4. And again, I highlighted a few of those area that were due to pricing timing and then some other factors where we grew very strongly, for example, in wipes and private label did as well we were up 6 points, they were up five points from a share perspective. So I don't see any health issue at this point in our home care categories or our cleaning categories. Elasticities, again, are playing out as we define. And I think really, as we look to this, we will expect demand normalization to be the biggest contributing factor and the elasticities will largely play out as we expect. Again, we'll watch that very closely. But this is more about demand normalization than it is about any trade down to private label at this point. Yes, Steve. On demand normalization we certainly are lapping impacts from COVID, but we're seeing changes in more normal behavior coming from consumers, and we're trying to understand when are we at a new normal. -- and it's more about lapse versus we're at that new normalization state. We saw, as Kevin and I said a couple of times, we're lapping delta right now where wipes were up from a unit base is 50% in our last Q1 and we did see a bump in Q3 as well. And so both of those will be left that we'll have to get through. So we're talking through fiscal year '23, we would expect that normalization. We are still seeing consumer behaviors, if you look at buy rate, et cetera, enhanced, and we're still seeing people care about cleaning and disinfecting elevated, but definitely lower than it was at the height of the pandemic, but higher than it was pre-COVID. So what we're trying to gauge is when does that new consumption pattern align to that desire from consumers who have a heightened state of awareness of cleaning and disinfecting and get into a more normalized routine. The other thing we're going to see how this plays out is cold and flu. Consumers have not experienced a normal cold and flu season since COVID started. So how will that reinforce consumer behaviors, and we'll experience that at the end of Q2 and through Q3. So we'll be watching that very closely. And then, of course, we're in a COVID wave right now. And so we're watching that dynamic as we lap last year's Delta Wave. So I would say we are watching this throughout the year, and we'll give indicators of when we start to see that more normalized demand, but we're looking something between where we were pre-COVID, which we continue to be above that. and what it looks like in a more normalized state when people are more aware and have a heightened concern but yet are getting into a new set of habits and routines. And we'll keep you updated as we see that and when we anticipate being in a more normalized state. But as you can imagine, given what's going on with COVID, et cetera, it is difficult to pinpoint exactly when that will occur. Sure, Steve. This really relates back to the strategic choice we made in Ignite to reimagine work, and we wanted to be simpler and faster. And we always contemplated ways, as you would expect, you expect us to operate efficiently and be removing costs wherever we can. They were always looking at the choices across the ecosystem to say, are we getting the best return on our investment? Are there ways to do things more effectively and efficiently?

So that I would say it's at this moment that we think it's the right time to do that. We've got to a bit more of a steady state when it comes to supply chain, still very challenged. We're still having force majeures, etcetera, but it's more manageable. And we think this is the right time to take it on, but it's really a continuation of that vision we laid out in 2019 to be faster and. Thanks again, everyone, for joining us. I look forward to speaking with you again on our next call in November. Until then, please stay well."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference.\nLisah Burhan: Thank you, Erica. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Linda Rendle, our CEO and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. I hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website. In just a moment, Linda will share a few opening comments and then we will take your questions. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements, including about our fiscal year 2022 outlook and the potential impact of COVID-19 pandemic on our business. These statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations, but may differ from actual results or outcomes. In addition, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section, which identifies various factors that could affect such forward-looking statements and the non-GAAP financial information section, including the tables that reconcile non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, both of which are located at the end of today\u2019s earnings release, which has also been filed with the SEC. Now, I will turn it over to Linda.\nLinda Rendle: Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I hope you and your families are well. Hopefully, you found our prepared remarks helpful. I am encouraged that we continue to see strong consumer demand for our brands and made progress on our near-term and long-term strategic plans in the third quarter amid a highly dynamic and challenging environment. Importantly, we delivered on our commitment to drive sequential gross margin improvement. We executed well on the factors under our control, leveraging the strength of our brands to grow share, sustain top line momentum and begin to rebuild margin. We continue to drive our innovation pipeline, deliver cost savings, generate operational improvements across our supply chain, and take additional inflation-driven pricing actions, all while keeping our eye on the long-term. There is no question that it\u2019s a volatile operating environment. The rising cost inflation we are experiencing is reflected in our updated fiscal 2022 outlook. That considered I am confident that our fundamentals are strong and that the actions we are taking and the progress we have made put us on the right trajectory to drive long-term profitable growth and create shareholder value. With that, Kevin and I will open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, Ms. Linda. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, guys. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned summer price increases. Can you just give us a bit more detail on which categories you have announced pricing in the magnitude? And what percent of your portfolio will have multiple rounds of price increases in by the summer? And then just taking a step back as we look out longer-term, obviously, some sequential gross margin recovery in fiscal Q3, it sounds like you are expecting more in fiscal Q4 in the prepared remarks. Can you just discuss conceptually with this new cost outlook, with the pricing going into place, how quickly you expect to rebuild gross margins over the next few years just relative to the pronounced pressure you are expecting this year? Thanks.\nLinda Rendle: Sounds good. I will start with where we are on pricing. So as you recall, we announced a round of pricing, our first round in the fall that was fairly broad across our portfolio. We have since taken a subsequent round that was effective this month in April and we are starting to see that flow through in the marketplace. And then we have an additional round of pricing scheduled for July that is also broad across our portfolio and we are actually going deeper than we had intended to go when we first announced the price increase given what we are seeing from the impact on Ukraine. So, we made that decision shortly after we saw the impacts. In total, the vast majority of our portfolio will be priced. And the majority of the portfolio will also have multiple rounds across all three of those time periods by the time we get to July. Kevin can talk a bit about what that means for gross margin and sequential improvement.\nKevin Jacobsen: Hey, Dara. On gross margin, no change to our longer-term expectations, what we\u2019ve been talking about for the last couple of quarters. What I would say is that you folks saw in our prepared remarks, we are really pleased with the progress we made in Q3. We sequentially improved margins, a little under 300 basis points. It\u2019s going to be more challenging for us in Q4. We have rolled in the increased energy prices as a result of the war in Ukraine and we think that\u2019s going to be about a $30 million headwind in Q4. As a result of that, I think it could be more modest progress sequentially in Q4. And then we continue to build our plans to ensure that we continue that progress in fiscal year \u201823. I will hold off, but I am sure you can appreciate giving an exact outlook right now. We will do that in August. But the plans we are building would keep us on track to keep building, rebuilding margins in fiscal year \u201823. And then I would say for us, beyond that, nothing else has really changed with the exception that we have got increased cost headwinds. And importantly, we think we are taking the right actions to address those. As Linda just mentioned, we have increased the pricing that we have already announced, they go in effect in July. So we think we are taking the right actions to address this next round of inflation we are dealing with. But as is typical, there is going to be a lag here. We will take a bit more of a hit in Q4. And then the actions we are taking, we will see start in our Q1 fiscal year \u201823.\nDara Mohsenian: Okay, great. And then can you talk a little bit about the price gaps versus competition? And with the actions you are taking, if you have seen competitors move already and where that leaves you? And perhaps the demand elasticity you are seeing from the price increases you already took from a consumer standpoint?\nLinda Rendle: Sure. As it relates to price gaps, we said it would be dynamic and it certainly is. We take pricing and then the rest of the category continues to do that. So we are seeing some price gaps in line and others where we are a bit behind. But we expect where July pricing goes into effect that the price gaps will be about what they were pre-pandemic. We don\u2019t intend to change price gaps through this action, but that\u2019s going to take a little while and a little noise to play out coming here as we take these next two increases, this one this month and, of course, the one in July. And then as we look forward into what we would experience coming into inflation from a consumer perspective, also with pricing, that\u2019s something that we are watching really closely from a category perspective. I think it\u2019s important to note that given the price gap dynamics too, we are also looking very closely at merchandising and what\u2019s happening. That still continues to be lower than it was pre-pandemic, but we have seen levels increase. But I would say, on average, it\u2019s been very rational. We have seen private label and other branded players move, but we continue to watch it closely and again, do not expect price gaps to be any different when this all nets out in July.\nDara Mohsenian: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. So I wanted to just follow-up on the pricing. So you announced, I am assuming this additional pricing, I am not sure if you were \u2013 it was on the plan for the month that you initiated now in April, of course, July is extra and goes into fiscal \u201823. But I was hoping to see you didn\u2019t change at the end. You didn\u2019t change the guidance much for the top line. So I am assuming you are embedding some sort of elasticity. Just going back to the point earlier, are you assuming elasticities come back to normal or you are seeing still below trend? And then just drilling down on the additional pricing you are taking, what are the categories that you are \u2013 I am assuming bags and charcoal would be \u2013 sorry and also latter would be the ones that you are taking additional pricing?\nLinda Rendle: Sure. So, we had always planned to take an April price increase, which of course is in market now. July, we had intended to take, but we are going broader and deeper in that pricing given what we are seeing as impacts from the war in Ukraine. But we keep \u2013 we are keeping that timing in July and you are right that will impact mostly as we look forward into fiscal year \u201823, but April will start to help in Q4. As it relates to the categories that we are pricing, this is pretty broad pricing in April and July. You mentioned bags, bags will be part of both of those increases happened in April, will happen again in July given what we are seeing in the resin market, but we will be very broad across the rest of our portfolio as well. And we would expect given what we are seeing across the pricing, across our competitors that, that will be true for the remainder of the category: competitors, private label and branded. As we look at what we expect to see beyond that, it\u2019s \u2013 I think it\u2019s going to depend on what we see for energy for the remainder of the year, what we see in commodities, but we feel like we have taken the right amount of pricing based on what we are announcing in July in order to deal with the environment that we are seeing right now.\nAndrea Teixeira: And any additional distribution that is embedded getting out of the quarter and into the fourth quarter that you regained given your service levels improved that you would highlight?\nLinda Rendle: Yes. So, we did see an increase in total distribution points and share of assortment in this latest quarter, which was great to see. So, total distribution points were up 10%. And we grew share of assortment by a full point and that is a number of things. One, of course, you highlight, which is the fact that we are back into supply in many of our categories and service levels are improving, but importantly, too, this is the good work our sales and marketing teams are doing on category growth plans with our retailers. And of course, the innovation that we have in market that\u2019s performing really well and we are seeing strong distribution results behind all of that. So in total, in a very good place from a distribution perspective and we would continue to expect to make progress in Q4 based on what we know our plans to be in the coming couple of months.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you, Linda. I will pass it on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Grom with UBS.\nPeter Grom: Hey, good afternoon everyone. Hope you are doing well. So I just wanted to ask about the company\u2019s updated organic sales outlook and I could be clearly over-thinking this. But if you go back through the last few quarterly releases, each provided some comment around the return to the company\u2019s long-term organic sales algorithm of 3% to 5%? And maybe I missed it today, but I didn\u2019t see. One, it really just could be implied in the comment around sequential improvement, but a 3-point range for the full year implies a pretty wide gap for 4Q. So just how are you thinking about organic sales growth in the fourth quarter? And how does that inform your view on returning to the algorithm long-term? Thanks.\nKevin Jacobsen: Hey, Peter, thanks for the question. In regard to our outlook, it is, and we talked about this before, it is wider than what we would typically have this time of year, and we think that\u2019s appropriate for the environment we\u2019re operating in. Having said that, we feel very good about sales expectations in the fourth quarter. As we said, we expect sequential improvements from where we landed in Q3 at 2%. But I think the items we\u2019re also thoughtful about that widens our range. Keep in mind, we\u2019re taking another round of pricing that went into the market in April. As Linda just mentioned, our expectation, similar to our previous round is that elasticities will be slightly better than what we\u2019ve seen historically. So that\u2019s embedded in the outlook as well. And then also keep in mind, competition has taken quite a bit of pricing right now at the same time. And while we don\u2019t know what they are doing nor should we, if they go before us, after us, the amounts they go will create some variability in our results as well. So with all that in mind, we think it\u2019s appropriate to have a bit wider range, but having said that, nothing has changed since we spoke last quarter. We\u2019re very much on track for the top line for the full year. And again, I expect sequential improvement from where we landed in Q3, but the range is a bit wider for the reasons I mentioned.\nPeter Grom: Okay. That\u2019s super helpful. And then maybe just one point of clarification, Linda, I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that you transitioned external manufacturing from a large group to just a few strategic suppliers. And just going back to last quarter, that was widely discussed as a key driver of the gross margin pressure you were dealing with. So can you maybe unpack that comment? Is that just related to the number of suppliers you were using or are you kind of now closer to that 80-20 mix in terms of in-house versus outsourced and manufacturing? Thanks.\nLinda Rendle: Sure. Yes. As we discussed, we used a broad range of external partners during the height of the pandemic to ensure that we could meet consumer demand. And we built that very intentionally so that we could ensure that we\u2019ve built an optimized network once we got into more of an endemic phase of the pandemic. And as we head into that, we\u2019ve done just that. We\u2019ve been able to consolidate and narrow the external manufacturer portfolio we have to strategic partners. We\u2019ve been able to in-house, and we\u2019re working through that in Q3 and Q4. We expect the vast majority of that benefit to begin hitting in fiscal year \u201823. But we are well on track to doing what we talked about in terms of that supply chain optimization.\nPeter Grom: Great. Thank you. Best of luck.\nLinda Rendle: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo.\nChris Carey: Hi, everyone.\nLinda Rendle: Hi, Chris.\nChris Carey: So \u2013 hey, how are you? I just wanted to follow-up on the question around manufacturing and logistics, that\u2019s great to hear, obviously, commodities getting worse in fiscal Q4. I mean, would you expect the manufacturing and logistics line to get materially better sequentially from here starting in fiscal Q4 and going into next year? As you have some of these easier comps, maybe it even turns into a net positive as you\u2019ve started to unwind this owned versus co-man network that you have? Is that a reasonable assumption going forward?\nKevin Jacobsen: Hey, Chris, what I\u2019d say as it relates to manufacturing and logistics and commodities is, I do expect \u2013 maybe I\u2019ll start with manufacturing and logistics. I do expect to see some sequential improvement as we move now through the end of this year, so just this last quarter. And there is a couple of areas I\u2019d point to. The first is what Linda talked about. We\u2019re making good progress, as we said we would, on optimizing our supply chain and stepping out of these third-party contract manufacturers. We\u2019re also seeing some, I would say, pullback in transportation in the spot rates. I think you\u2019ve heard us talk about that for the last couple of quarters. We\u2019ve seen a significant increase in the cost of carriers in the spot market. That premium is starting to come down a bit, which is a little bit of a benefit in the third quarter. And I\u2019d like to believe we\u2019re going to see that continue to go forward. So that should certainly help as well. And then we continue to optimize our supply chain beyond just the contract manufacturers. If you recall, as part of the work we did during the pandemic, we significantly extended our supply chain to ensure we had backup suppliers given all the disruptions we are facing. As that supply chain starts to level out, and we\u2019re able to step out of some of those relationships with material suppliers, that also should reduce our cost. I mean if you can imagine, we were sourcing product from Asia. We had to deal with the freight to get that product here as we can step out of some of those and get back to our core suppliers, there is more opportunity there. So this has clearly been an opportunity for us. As we\u2019ve talked going forward, how we will rebuild margins is really in three buckets: it first starts with our cost savings program. We\u2019re also going after the supply chain costs that we built up over the pandemic that we\u2019re in the process of taking out. And then it\u2019s the pricing actions that we talked about. And as those three levers, we\u2019re going to keep pulling on that we think put us in a position to sequentially keep improving margins. And I\u2019d expect to see some of that benefit flow through this quarter and then continue next year as well.\nChris Carey: Okay, thanks so much for that perspective. And then one quick follow-up, just on SG&A, a little bit better versus prior expectations. How much of what you\u2019re doing this fiscal year is something sustainable that you think can carry into next year versus things that might be a bit more point in time like lower variable compensation or anything else that might reverse back into SG&A next year with the adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales running pretty low relative to historicals? So, thanks again.\nKevin Jacobsen: Sure. And Chris, maybe two points of view on SG&A. One issue is unreal, the structural changes. In our Q3, our SG&A was about a point lower than we had projected. We have a pension program and the ability for our employees to defer compensation that they invest in the stock market. As you know, the stock market was down in the third quarter, so that reduces our liabilities to our employees. That reduced it by 1 point. That has no impact on EPS. That\u2019s offset in other income and expense because the value of the portfolio went down to us by an equal and offsetting them out. So that\u2019s a bit of noise on the P&L, that was about a 1 point reduction. But your comment on structural changes, we continues to make progress in admin we\u2019re on track to deliver our cost savings commitment this year, 175 basis points of EBIT margin expansion. And what you\u2019ll see is a nice amount of that coming from admin. Typically, product supply, we delivered the largest source of value of that 175 basis point goal. That will be true this year as well, but I\u2019d say a little bit more coming out of admin than typical and that should be structural that we can carry forward.\nChris Carey: Okay, thank you both.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, thanks, Chris.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hi, everybody. Maybe a follow-up to Chris\u2019s question, but more specific on ad spend. It looks like ad spend maybe came off a little bit or maybe it was a little bit lower more than plan. You obviously gave us some guide on where it\u2019s expected to be. Can you just talk about how you\u2019re thinking about that line?\nLinda Rendle: Sure. We\u2019re still on track for 10% to the year, which is exactly our commitment. And I think you know how strong we feel about advertising as a strategic lever to build our brands and ensure we have superior value. So in this quarter, just timing and on track for 10% for the year.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Okay. Great. And then on, I guess, trade spend and the impact on revenue, it looks like trade spend is up quite a bit, has a bit of a mix effect. As you\u2019re discussing pricing and incremental price increases. Can you just give us a context on how much of that maybe will be offset by \u2013 it sounds like promo activity is increasing and such?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes. Maybe a couple of thoughts on I\u2019ll talk price mix and the impact of trade spend within price/mix. If you saw our results in Q3, two points of volume growth, we had four points of benefit from pricing. And then we had four points of unfavorable mix and higher trade spending. And we\u2019ve talked about that the last couple of quarters. We had a temporary benefit during the pandemic as we went down to smaller sizes to increase throughput from our plants as well as there is effectively no promotional activity on several of our categories, where there is a lack of product availability. We had about a four-point price/mix benefit for about four straight quarters during the pandemic. That was a temporary benefit that we knew would unwind. It has been unwinding for several quarters. Q3 was the last quarter, we\u2019ve now lapped that. And so that drag in Q3 should no longer occur as we move forward. So that 4 point hit of increased mix and trade was really just unwinding the temporary benefit we had during the pandemic. And so I expect to see a greater benefit from price/mix going forward as we\u2019re getting the full benefit from pricing and no longer lapping that temporary benefit.\nKaumil Gajrawala: That\u2019s useful, thank you.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.\nJason English: Hey, good afternoon folks. Thanks for taking my question. So, I think you partially answered this with the pension benefit this quarter. But your guidance, historically, your EBIT margins step up nicely in the fourth quarter from your third quarter, but your guidance implies that you\u2019re not going to see that historical progression. In fact, it suggests that you\u2019re going to see fairly sizable degradation operating margins from the third to the fourth quarter. So I appreciate that you have sequential improvement in gross margin. But what\u2019s driving the substantial dip in EBIT margins and your outlook from 3Q to 4Q?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, Jason, thanks for the question. And you\u2019re right, we do expect that to be the case. As you mentioned, we expect sequential improvement on the top line. And we do think we will make some very modest sequential improvement in gross margin in Q4. But what\u2019s offsetting that is two items: first is on admin, you\u2019ll see an increased spending in admin in Q4, I suspect we will be somewhere in the 15% to 16% of sales, and that\u2019s really the timing on the investments we\u2019re making in our digital transformation efforts; they really start to ramp up in the fourth quarter. So about 40% of the total spend you\u2019ll see in Q4 and so with a rate sort of in that 15% to 16%. And then Linda just mentioned on advertising, we\u2019re not concerned about the investments by quarter. We managed the year. And so we\u2019re still targeting 10%. So you\u2019ll see an elevated level of advertising investment in Q4 relative to Q3 that keeps us on track for 10% for the year.\nJason English: And were you referring to your pro forma numbers or your GAAP numbers?\nKevin Jacobsen: Those are GAAP numbers.\nJason English: So I\u2019m just doing all in pro forma. You\u2019ve got a massive drop in your pro forma guidance for fourth quarter. So I assume that, that isn\u2019t actually related to the digital transformation since you guys are excluding that. Am I correct?\nKevin Jacobsen: That\u2019s correct, yes.\nJason English: Okay. Is there something else to...\nKevin Jacobsen: So, what you will see is \u2013 no, you will see the increased advertising would be the primary item. As we step, it will be nicely over 10%, I suspect that gives us the 10% for the full year.\nJason English: Got it. And on SG&A, is it incentive comp, should we expect to reload that next year?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, we should. We are a pay-for-performance company and we are below our goal this year. So, we are paying out less than a percent, and an expectation, we had reset that to our plans in fiscal year \u201823. So, it would step up to a targeted 100% payout.\nJason English: Okay. I will follow-up offline to trying get the quantum on that. Thank you very much.\nKevin Jacobsen: Okay. Thanks Jason.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. So Linda, my question pertains to private label. And more broadly, just trade down risk and how you see this playing out given the state of the consumer, so as we look at the Nielsen data, and everyone has been sort of very much watching that to see trade down within categories, is private label gaining share? More broadly, as you know, since the start of the pandemic, that\u2019s not been the case. We have seen a little tick up more recently. But I think it stands out because it\u2019s been in some of your categories and particularly those that even historically have been more exposed to private label. So, that being bleach, charcoal wipes. So, you mentioned that you have seen private label move on price as well. Maybe just comment on how you are thinking about this now competitively? And how you see this playing out? That is, is the state of the consumer and potential risk there trade down in your categories. And maybe just sort of comment on some of the share gains that we have seen in private label more recently in the syndicated data. Thanks.\nLinda Rendle: Sure. Hi Kevin. What we are continuing to see is consumers choosing trusted brands and you highlighted it well. We definitely saw, during the pandemic, people in our categories, choosing brands they could trust given what was going on in their lives and that continues. We have seen, over the last quarter, a marginal improvement in private label share, pretty minimal and we think that\u2019s mainly related to getting distribution back in line to pre-pandemic levels, but no meaningful share gains and still lower than pre-pandemic. If you also look at kind of more leading indicators, household penetration also did not keep pace for private label during this time and we expect that to continue to have an impact as we move forward. And as we head into this period, consumers are absolutely under a lot of stress, but we are seeing what we expect in our categories at this point. Private label has taken pricing as we have taken pricing and competitors have. We are seeing pretty rational behavior there. And from a consumer perspective, we continue to see what we expect, so elasticity is in line, slightly better across our categories, meaning, of course, we are seeing volume decline, but a little less than we had anticipated. And we are seeing that across the category. We are going to watch it really closely, but we think we are very well positioned based off of the superior value of our brands. And I know, Kevin, we have mentioned this before, but 75% of our portfolio at this time is deemed superior by consumers. Of course, that\u2019s a combination of not only price, but brand and the product experience we deliver, and we continue to be laser-focused on that. So, continuing our investment in our brands, continuing on innovation, ensuring we have the right price pack architecture to ensure we cover all ranges of value for the consumer. But we feel really good about where we are. We are seeing no signs of abnormal stress with consumers in our categories, but we are going to watch it very closely as we head into this period.\nKevin Grundy: That\u2019s great. Thank you and I appreciate it. Good luck.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks Kevin.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Hey everybody. Good afternoon. First, just a follow-up on the July price increase, I guess the question I am left with after the prior discussion is just, is that price increase meant to fully offset the inflation you have seen build since February, or as we think about the broader gross margin rebuild, we have to lean a bit more on productivity and other levers to help that gross margin along. I just wasn\u2019t clear on the prior commentary.\nKevin Jacobsen: Hi Steve. As it relates to pricing, what I would say is it\u2019s really requires to lean in on all the levers we have available. So, it\u2019s leaning into our cost savings program. It\u2019s working to take costs out of our supply chain and it\u2019s taking pricing. We believe we \u2013 across all three of those activities that puts us in a position to continue to rebuild margins. But pricing alone would not put us in a position to do that.\nSteve Powers: Okay. Fair enough. And then I guess you touched a little bit upon it with your \u2013 just a commentary broadly on the supply chain. But could you just give us a bit of perspective as to where your service levels sits exiting the third quarter? Where you feel like you have restored service levels to where you would like them to be? Where there is still some more work in the portfolio to do on upfront? Just that would be helpful.\nLinda Rendle: Sure. We have seen service levels improve, which is terrific news and really my hats off to our combined team, who is working hard because at the same time, we have had to increase the portion of our portfolio that was on allocation during this time. And that\u2019s really due to two things. One, we have seen stronger demand in portions of our portfolio and then some material constraints and labor shortages across the supply chain that are impacting our ability to get raw materials. But I would say our team is handling that, working really closely with our retailer partners, really closely with our logistics partners, and so as a result, service is improving, and we expect continued improvement in Q4.\nSteve Powers: Okay. And lastly, if I could just kind of building on the conversation you are having with Kevin around the consumer being under stress. Does it change at all the influence the way that you approach R&D and new products prioritization as you think about fiscal Q3 and beyond? Just the way you are thinking about R&D, are you focused more than you might normally be on hitting value price points or is it \u2013 are we not at that stage?\nLinda Rendle: I think it\u2019s important for us to pull all value levers and that\u2019s going to continue to be true. So, our innovation pipeline always focuses on doing the base work that you would expect us to do product improvements, claims work, ensuring that we are communicating to people why our products work better than competition and why they can trust us and they issued us. So, that good work is always going on in good times and in tougher times for the consumer, and we will continue to leverage that. Importantly, though, consumers are continuing to look for innovative products that give them new experiences, so we will focus on the basics, but we will not take the foot off the pedal when it comes to introducing new experiences to them that help them do things better. For example, in the cleaning category, we just launched a premium line of Clorox Disinfecting Misters. They are off to a very strong start in the market. There is \u2013 it\u2019s a refill model, so it also helps people reduce their waste at home and really a great experience. And that\u2019s a premium-priced product, but we think it helps them get the job done at a better value at home, and we expect that to continue to do really well as we head into this period. So, I would say we are always focused on that base work, but we will not take the foot off the gas on continuing to expand the presence our brands have and continue to give people new innovative solutions in our categories.\nSteve Powers: Okay. Thanks for the perspective.\nLinda Rendle: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about expectations for the promotional environment? As incremental pricing comes in, we have heard some other companies start to talk about the inevitable building of pressure on consumer wallets and an expectation that promotions could kick up in the second half of the year. So, I was just curious on your perspective on that, so I will start there.\nLinda Rendle: Sure. Hi Lauren. What we are seeing now is promos are definitely above a year ago, but still below pre-pandemic levels. And as you know, for our categories, price promotion is actually a very small portion of the volume that we sell. It\u2019s less than 10% of the volume that we do on average is on price promotions. But we are watching that carefully because you are right, in times of recession that can be a lever that people pull and will pull to the degree needed to introduce new items to consumers to ensure that we are getting them at the right pulp periods of the year. But at this point, we don\u2019t see anything abnormal in our categories, something again that we will watch carefully, particularly as these next rounds of pricing go in. And we will use it as a lever if we need to, as we always do, but very strategically and how we target the consumer.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay. Great. And then I can probably take this offline with Lisah, but I did just want to throw this out on gross margins. I feel like, Kevin, your comments on sequential improvement in 4Q being there, but being not nearly as significant as you just saw Q2 to Q3. But I think to tie to gross margins down 800 basis points for the year, gross margins have to be significantly better sequentially. So, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s an obvious thing that jumps out? If it\u2019s GAAP versus non-GAAP, there is something I am not aware of? Yes. So, anything that seems stands out to you or I can follow-up with Lisah if it\u2019s better for that for offline?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes. Lauren, maybe just I will give you a perspective. But yes, please follow-up with Lisah, if this doesn\u2019t answer your question. When we started last quarter, our expectations was gross margin to be in the high-30s is I think I described it for Q4. With the war in Ukraine, we are building in about $30 million of additional costs, and most of that\u2019s going to hit in Q4, just the way it flows through our inventory than onto our P&L. So, $30 million hit in the fourth quarter is going to add about 150 basis points to 200 basis points of additional drag on margin, above what we thought when we were talking last quarter. When you do that math, you get down to, I would say, modest sequential improvement versus where we landed in Q3. So, we landed at about 36%. We are going to absorb another $30 million in Q4, and the team is working very hard to continue to expand margins in spite of the additional $30 million we are going to deal with. But it should put you then to get to the numbers we are talking about, should put you are just slightly above the Q3 level, which was just under 36%.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay. It was the absolute level in the quarter, not the year-over-year change that\u2026?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes. I am sorry, Lauren, you are exactly correct.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes. Sequential improvement from where we landed in Q3.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay. That clarified it. Okay, great. Thank you so much.\nKevin Jacobsen: Sure. Thanks Lauren.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thanks so much for the follow-up. I had a similar question to Lauren\u2019s. But now, on the operating income, if I am not mistaken, I heard 170 basis points, I am trying to go back to the notes. Did you give some sort of a guide for the operating income margin?\nKevin Jacobsen: No, Andrea. We were talking about our cost savings goal of 175 basis points of EBIT margin expansion each year, and we are on track to deliver that this year.\nAndrea Teixeira: Okay. And that\u2019s embedded in the bridge that you gave out on the others, right?\nKevin Jacobsen: It is.\nAndrea Teixeira: Correct. Okay. Perfect. Thank you.\nKevin Jacobsen: Sure.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. Ms. Rendle, I will now turn the podium back over to you.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks Erica. Thanks again to everyone on the call. I look forward to speaking to you again on our next call in August. Until then, please stay well.\nOperator: This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kevin Jacobsen",
            "content": "Hey, Dara. On gross margin, no change to our longer-term expectations, what we've been talking about for the last couple of quarters. What I would say is that you folks saw in our prepared remarks, we are really pleased with the progress we made in Q3. We sequentially improved margins, a little under 300 basis points. It's going to be more challenging for us in Q4. We have rolled in the increased energy prices as a result of the war in Ukraine and we think that's going to be about a $30 million headwind in Q4. As a result of that, I think it could be more modest progress sequentially in Q4. And then we continue to build our plans to ensure that we continue that progress in fiscal year \u201823. I will hold off, but I am sure you can appreciate giving an exact outlook right now. We will do that in August. But the plans we are building would keep us on track to keep building, rebuilding margins in fiscal year \u201823. And then I would say for us, beyond that, nothing else has really changed with the exception that we have got increased cost headwinds. And importantly, we think we are taking the right actions to address those. As Linda just mentioned, we have increased the pricing that we have already announced, they go in effect in July. So we think we are taking the right actions to address this next round of inflation we are dealing with. But as is typical, there is going to be a lag here. We will take a bit more of a hit in Q4. And then the actions we are taking, we will see start in our Q1 fiscal year \u201823. Hey, Peter, thanks for the question. In regard to our outlook, it is, and we talked about this before, it is wider than what we would typically have this time of year, and we think that's appropriate for the environment we're operating in. Having said that, we feel very good about sales expectations in the fourth quarter. As we said, we expect sequential improvements from where we landed in Q3 at 2%. But I think the items we're also thoughtful about that widens our range. Keep in mind, we're taking another round of pricing that went into the market in April. As Linda just mentioned, our expectation, similar to our previous round is that elasticities will be slightly better than what we've seen historically. So that's embedded in the outlook as well. And then also keep in mind, competition has taken quite a bit of pricing right now at the same time. And while we don't know what they are doing nor should we, if they go before us, after us, the amounts they go will create some variability in our results as well. So with all that in mind, we think it's appropriate to have a bit wider range, but having said that, nothing has changed since we spoke last quarter. We're very much on track for the top line for the full year. And again, I expect sequential improvement from where we landed in Q3, but the range is a bit wider for the reasons I mentioned. Hey, Chris, what I'd say as it relates to manufacturing and logistics and commodities is, I do expect \u2013 maybe I'll start with manufacturing and logistics. I do expect to see some sequential improvement as we move now through the end of this year, so just this last quarter. And there is a couple of areas I'd point to. The first is what Linda talked about. We're making good progress, as we said we would, on optimizing our supply chain and stepping out of these third-party contract manufacturers. We're also seeing some, I would say, pullback in transportation in the spot rates. I think you've heard us talk about that for the last couple of quarters. We've seen a significant increase in the cost of carriers in the spot market. That premium is starting to come down a bit, which is a little bit of a benefit in the third quarter. And I'd like to believe we're going to see that continue to go forward. So that should certainly help as well. And then we continue to optimize our supply chain beyond just the contract manufacturers. If you recall, as part of the work we did during the pandemic, we significantly extended our supply chain to ensure we had backup suppliers given all the disruptions we are facing. As that supply chain starts to level out, and we're able to step out of some of those relationships with material suppliers, that also should reduce our cost. I mean if you can imagine, we were sourcing product from Asia. We had to deal with the freight to get that product here as we can step out of some of those and get back to our core suppliers, there is more opportunity there. So this has clearly been an opportunity for us. As we've talked going forward, how we will rebuild margins is really in three buckets: it first starts with our cost savings program. We're also going after the supply chain costs that we built up over the pandemic that we're in the process of taking out. And then it's the pricing actions that we talked about. And as those three levers, we're going to keep pulling on that we think put us in a position to sequentially keep improving margins. And I'd expect to see some of that benefit flow through this quarter and then continue next year as well. Sure. And Chris, maybe two points of view on SG&A. One issue is unreal, the structural changes. In our Q3, our SG&A was about a point lower than we had projected. We have a pension program and the ability for our employees to defer compensation that they invest in the stock market. As you know, the stock market was down in the third quarter, so that reduces our liabilities to our employees. That reduced it by 1 point. That has no impact on EPS. That's offset in other income and expense because the value of the portfolio went down to us by an equal and offsetting them out. So that's a bit of noise on the P&L, that was about a 1 point reduction. But your comment on structural changes, we continues to make progress in admin we're on track to deliver our cost savings commitment this year, 175 basis points of EBIT margin expansion. And what you'll see is a nice amount of that coming from admin. Typically, product supply, we delivered the largest source of value of that 175 basis point goal. That will be true this year as well, but I'd say a little bit more coming out of admin than typical and that should be structural that we can carry forward. Yes, thanks, Chris. Yes. Maybe a couple of thoughts on I'll talk price mix and the impact of trade spend within price/mix. If you saw our results in Q3, two points of volume growth, we had four points of benefit from pricing. And then we had four points of unfavorable mix and higher trade spending. And we've talked about that the last couple of quarters. We had a temporary benefit during the pandemic as we went down to smaller sizes to increase throughput from our plants as well as there is effectively no promotional activity on several of our categories, where there is a lack of product availability. We had about a four-point price/mix benefit for about four straight quarters during the pandemic. That was a temporary benefit that we knew would unwind. It has been unwinding for several quarters. Q3 was the last quarter, we've now lapped that. And so that drag in Q3 should no longer occur as we move forward. So that 4 point hit of increased mix and trade was really just unwinding the temporary benefit we had during the pandemic. And so I expect to see a greater benefit from price/mix going forward as we're getting the full benefit from pricing and no longer lapping that temporary benefit. Yes. Yes, Jason, thanks for the question. And you're right, we do expect that to be the case. As you mentioned, we expect sequential improvement on the top line. And we do think we will make some very modest sequential improvement in gross margin in Q4. But what's offsetting that is two items: first is on admin, you'll see an increased spending in admin in Q4, I suspect we will be somewhere in the 15% to 16% of sales, and that's really the timing on the investments we're making in our digital transformation efforts; they really start to ramp up in the fourth quarter. So about 40% of the total spend you'll see in Q4 and so with a rate sort of in that 15% to 16%. And then Linda just mentioned on advertising, we're not concerned about the investments by quarter. We managed the year. And so we're still targeting 10%. So you'll see an elevated level of advertising investment in Q4 relative to Q3 that keeps us on track for 10% for the year. Those are GAAP numbers. That's correct, yes. So, what you will see is \u2013 no, you will see the increased advertising would be the primary item. As we step, it will be nicely over 10%, I suspect that gives us the 10% for the full year. Yes, we should. We are a pay-for-performance company and we are below our goal this year. So, we are paying out less than a percent, and an expectation, we had reset that to our plans in fiscal year \u201823. So, it would step up to a targeted 100% payout. Okay. Thanks Jason. Hi Steve. As it relates to pricing, what I would say is it's really requires to lean in on all the levers we have available. So, it's leaning into our cost savings program. It's working to take costs out of our supply chain and it's taking pricing. We believe we \u2013 across all three of those activities that puts us in a position to continue to rebuild margins. But pricing alone would not put us in a position to do that. Yes. Lauren, maybe just I will give you a perspective. But yes, please follow-up with Lisah, if this doesn't answer your question. When we started last quarter, our expectations was gross margin to be in the high-30s is I think I described it for Q4. With the war in Ukraine, we are building in about $30 million of additional costs, and most of that's going to hit in Q4, just the way it flows through our inventory than onto our P&L. So, $30 million hit in the fourth quarter is going to add about 150 basis points to 200 basis points of additional drag on margin, above what we thought when we were talking last quarter. When you do that math, you get down to, I would say, modest sequential improvement versus where we landed in Q3. So, we landed at about 36%. We are going to absorb another $30 million in Q4, and the team is working very hard to continue to expand margins in spite of the additional $30 million we are going to deal with. But it should put you then to get to the numbers we are talking about, should put you are just slightly above the Q3 level, which was just under 36%. Yes. I am sorry, Lauren, you are exactly correct. Yes. Sequential improvement from where we landed in Q3. Sure. Thanks Lauren. No, Andrea. We were talking about our cost savings goal of 175 basis points of EBIT margin expansion each year, and we are on track to deliver that this year. It is. Sure."

            "name": "Linda Rendle",
            "content": "Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I hope you and your families are well. Hopefully, you found our prepared remarks helpful. I am encouraged that we continue to see strong consumer demand for our brands and made progress on our near-term and long-term strategic plans in the third quarter amid a highly dynamic and challenging environment. Importantly, we delivered on our commitment to drive sequential gross margin improvement. We executed well on the factors under our control, leveraging the strength of our brands to grow share, sustain top line momentum and begin to rebuild margin. We continue to drive our innovation pipeline, deliver cost savings, generate operational improvements across our supply chain, and take additional inflation-driven pricing actions, all while keeping our eye on the long-term. There is no question that it's a volatile operating environment. The rising cost inflation we are experiencing is reflected in our updated fiscal 2022 outlook. That considered I am confident that our fundamentals are strong and that the actions we are taking and the progress we have made put us on the right trajectory to drive long-term profitable growth and create shareholder value. With that, Kevin and I will open the line for questions. Sounds good. I will start with where we are on pricing. So as you recall, we announced a round of pricing, our first round in the fall that was fairly broad across our portfolio. We have since taken a subsequent round that was effective this month in April and we are starting to see that flow through in the marketplace. And then we have an additional round of pricing scheduled for July that is also broad across our portfolio and we are actually going deeper than we had intended to go when we first announced the price increase given what we are seeing from the impact on Ukraine. So, we made that decision shortly after we saw the impacts. In total, the vast majority of our portfolio will be priced. And the majority of the portfolio will also have multiple rounds across all three of those time periods by the time we get to July. Kevin can talk a bit about what that means for gross margin and sequential improvement. Sure. As it relates to price gaps, we said it would be dynamic and it certainly is. We take pricing and then the rest of the category continues to do that. So we are seeing some price gaps in line and others where we are a bit behind. But we expect where July pricing goes into effect that the price gaps will be about what they were pre-pandemic. We don't intend to change price gaps through this action, but that's going to take a little while and a little noise to play out coming here as we take these next two increases, this one this month and, of course, the one in July. And then as we look forward into what we would experience coming into inflation from a consumer perspective, also with pricing, that's something that we are watching really closely from a category perspective. I think it's important to note that given the price gap dynamics too, we are also looking very closely at merchandising and what's happening. That still continues to be lower than it was pre-pandemic, but we have seen levels increase. But I would say, on average, it's been very rational. We have seen private label and other branded players move, but we continue to watch it closely and again, do not expect price gaps to be any different when this all nets out in July. Sure. So, we had always planned to take an April price increase, which of course is in market now. July, we had intended to take, but we are going broader and deeper in that pricing given what we are seeing as impacts from the war in Ukraine. But we keep \u2013 we are keeping that timing in July and you are right that will impact mostly as we look forward into fiscal year \u201823, but April will start to help in Q4. As it relates to the categories that we are pricing, this is pretty broad pricing in April and July. You mentioned bags, bags will be part of both of those increases happened in April, will happen again in July given what we are seeing in the resin market, but we will be very broad across the rest of our portfolio as well. And we would expect given what we are seeing across the pricing, across our competitors that, that will be true for the remainder of the category: competitors, private label and branded. As we look at what we expect to see beyond that, it's \u2013 I think it's going to depend on what we see for energy for the remainder of the year, what we see in commodities, but we feel like we have taken the right amount of pricing based on what we are announcing in July in order to deal with the environment that we are seeing right now. Yes. So, we did see an increase in total distribution points and share of assortment in this latest quarter, which was great to see. So, total distribution points were up 10%. And we grew share of assortment by a full point and that is a number of things. One, of course, you highlight, which is the fact that we are back into supply in many of our categories and service levels are improving, but importantly, too, this is the good work our sales and marketing teams are doing on category growth plans with our retailers. And of course, the innovation that we have in market that's performing really well and we are seeing strong distribution results behind all of that. So in total, in a very good place from a distribution perspective and we would continue to expect to make progress in Q4 based on what we know our plans to be in the coming couple of months. Sure. Yes. As we discussed, we used a broad range of external partners during the height of the pandemic to ensure that we could meet consumer demand. And we built that very intentionally so that we could ensure that we've built an optimized network once we got into more of an endemic phase of the pandemic. And as we head into that, we've done just that. We've been able to consolidate and narrow the external manufacturer portfolio we have to strategic partners. We've been able to in-house, and we're working through that in Q3 and Q4. We expect the vast majority of that benefit to begin hitting in fiscal year \u201823. But we are well on track to doing what we talked about in terms of that supply chain optimization. Thank you. Hi, Chris. Sure. We're still on track for 10% to the year, which is exactly our commitment. And I think you know how strong we feel about advertising as a strategic lever to build our brands and ensure we have superior value. So in this quarter, just timing and on track for 10% for the year. Sure. Hi Kevin. What we are continuing to see is consumers choosing trusted brands and you highlighted it well. We definitely saw, during the pandemic, people in our categories, choosing brands they could trust given what was going on in their lives and that continues. We have seen, over the last quarter, a marginal improvement in private label share, pretty minimal and we think that's mainly related to getting distribution back in line to pre-pandemic levels, but no meaningful share gains and still lower than pre-pandemic. If you also look at kind of more leading indicators, household penetration also did not keep pace for private label during this time and we expect that to continue to have an impact as we move forward. And as we head into this period, consumers are absolutely under a lot of stress, but we are seeing what we expect in our categories at this point. Private label has taken pricing as we have taken pricing and competitors have. We are seeing pretty rational behavior there. And from a consumer perspective, we continue to see what we expect, so elasticity is in line, slightly better across our categories, meaning, of course, we are seeing volume decline, but a little less than we had anticipated. And we are seeing that across the category. We are going to watch it really closely, but we think we are very well positioned based off of the superior value of our brands. And I know, Kevin, we have mentioned this before, but 75% of our portfolio at this time is deemed superior by consumers. Of course, that's a combination of not only price, but brand and the product experience we deliver, and we continue to be laser-focused on that. So, continuing our investment in our brands, continuing on innovation, ensuring we have the right price pack architecture to ensure we cover all ranges of value for the consumer. But we feel really good about where we are. We are seeing no signs of abnormal stress with consumers in our categories, but we are going to watch it very closely as we head into this period. Thanks Kevin. Sure. We have seen service levels improve, which is terrific news and really my hats off to our combined team, who is working hard because at the same time, we have had to increase the portion of our portfolio that was on allocation during this time. And that's really due to two things. One, we have seen stronger demand in portions of our portfolio and then some material constraints and labor shortages across the supply chain that are impacting our ability to get raw materials. But I would say our team is handling that, working really closely with our retailer partners, really closely with our logistics partners, and so as a result, service is improving, and we expect continued improvement in Q4. I think it's important for us to pull all value levers and that's going to continue to be true. So, our innovation pipeline always focuses on doing the base work that you would expect us to do product improvements, claims work, ensuring that we are communicating to people why our products work better than competition and why they can trust us and they issued us. So, that good work is always going on in good times and in tougher times for the consumer, and we will continue to leverage that. Importantly, though, consumers are continuing to look for innovative products that give them new experiences, so we will focus on the basics, but we will not take the foot off the pedal when it comes to introducing new experiences to them that help them do things better. For example, in the cleaning category, we just launched a premium line of Clorox Disinfecting Misters. They are off to a very strong start in the market. There is \u2013 it's a refill model, so it also helps people reduce their waste at home and really a great experience. And that's a premium-priced product, but we think it helps them get the job done at a better value at home, and we expect that to continue to do really well as we head into this period. So, I would say we are always focused on that base work, but we will not take the foot off the gas on continuing to expand the presence our brands have and continue to give people new innovative solutions in our categories. Thank you. Sure. Hi Lauren. What we are seeing now is promos are definitely above a year ago, but still below pre-pandemic levels. And as you know, for our categories, price promotion is actually a very small portion of the volume that we sell. It's less than 10% of the volume that we do on average is on price promotions. But we are watching that carefully because you are right, in times of recession that can be a lever that people pull and will pull to the degree needed to introduce new items to consumers to ensure that we are getting them at the right pulp periods of the year. But at this point, we don't see anything abnormal in our categories, something again that we will watch carefully, particularly as these next rounds of pricing go in. And we will use it as a lever if we need to, as we always do, but very strategically and how we target the consumer. Thanks Erica. Thanks again to everyone on the call. I look forward to speaking to you again on our next call in August. Until then, please stay well."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference.\nLisah Burhan: Thanks, Michelle. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Linda Rendle, our CEO; and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. I hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website. In addition, we've posted a transcript of the pre-recorded remarks. In just a moment, Linda will share a few opening comments, and then we'll take your questions. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements about our fiscal year 2022 outlook and the potential impact of COVID-19 pandemic on our business. These statements are based on management's current expectations but may differ from actual results or outcomes. In addition, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section, which identify various factors that could affect such forward-looking statements and the non-GAAP financial information section, including the tables that reconcile non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, both of which are located at the end of today's earnings release, which has also been filed with the SEC. Now I'll turn it over to Linda.\nLinda Rendle: Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I hope you and your families are well. Hopefully, you found our prepared remarks helpful. We faced significant cost headwinds in a volatile operating environment in Q2, but despite these challenging conditions, we executed well on those factors under our control. This includes taking strategic pricing actions and driving cost savings, while restoring supply, serving our customers and advancing our consumer-centric innovation pipeline. Demand remains robust across our portfolio, and our brand superiority results are better than during the height of the pandemic. We have a portfolio of strong, trusted brands exposed to demand-driven tailwinds, and we will continue to invest in them, which we expect will fuel long-term growth for our business. While we anticipate this highly dynamic and challenging environment to persist over the near term and adjusted our fiscal 2022 outlook as a result, we are confident that we're taking the appropriate actions to navigate this period, deliver profitable growth over time and build a stronger, more resilient company. With that, Kevin and I will open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, Ms. Rendle. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: So a couple of questions on gross margins. Just given the magnitude of declines now expected this year, can you discuss conceptually how long do you think it takes to try to recover these cost pressures from a pricing standpoint? Originally, it sounds like you're hoping to make a lot of progress next year, at least based on the exit rate in Q4. But you run the arithmetic now and it require -- it would require a mid-teens corporate price increase, even if you assume no demand elasticity just to recover this year's gross margin compression. So clearly, not realistic to take that much pricing in 1 year.  So just any thoughts on how long it might take to try to recover the gross margin pressure? Is it a multiyear endeavor? And how do you think about pricing offset relative to potential impact on share? And then second, just any thoughts around if there's an ability maybe to more aggressively consider your SG&A structure and more aggressively consider ways to lower your fixed cost base just in light of what now appears to be a structurally different cost level in terms of commodities and other cost factors?\nKevin Jacobsen: Dara, this is Kevin. I appreciate the question. Let me start with the expectations for gross margin. And I'm sure, as you can appreciate, I won't provide a specific outlook beyond this year. But I can give you some perspective in terms of what we're seeing. And if you look at the work we're doing, we believe we're taking the right actions primarily through our pricing efforts and our cost savings program that we continue to be in a position that we can recover costs and rebuild margins over time. Now I do think that's going to take some time given the level of inflation we're dealing with. And I think you're hearing from us and a lot of peers. This is a unique environment with an extreme level of cost inflation. But we do think we've got the right plans in place to be able to rebuild margins. Now for us, that continue -- we continue to believe that's going to start this year. We think by the fourth quarter, we're in a position when we start that process of rebuilding margins and then fully expect that to continue next year. If I look at our history, this is the fourth inflationary cycle we've gone through in the last 10 years. If you look at the 3 previous times we've done this, we've been able to fully price and drive our cost savings program to offset the cost inflation, rebuild margins. It historically has taken us about 12 to 18 months to do that. I would tell you though in this case, because of the extreme level of inflation we're dealing with, I expect it to take longer. So we'll have to see exactly how that plays out. And what will also influence the timing, to a certain extent, is how the inflationary market plays out. That could either extend the time line or accelerate if we get any tailwinds or further headwinds on cost inflation. But I do think it's going to take several years for us to rebuild margin. And what's important for us is while we are committed to rebuilding margins, at the same time, we want to make sure we continue to invest in the business to maintain the top line momentum. We have very good momentum on the top line. As you know, we're expecting 3% to 5% going forward. And we want to continue to invest to maintain that momentum. So we think the way we maximize the value of this company is we invest to maintain that momentum. And then at the appropriate price -- pace, we rebuild margins, which we're committed to doing. And then in regard to fixed costs and choices we can make. One thing I'd tell you, and we've talked about this a little bit in the past. As you know, we have significantly extended our supply chain through this pandemic, both to increase supply availability as well as to be able to increase our ability to meet this elevated demand. That is an opportunity for us. And so as demand continues to moderate, we're going to be able to go after those fixed costs in our supply chain and take those out. And that's another reason that gives us confidence that we're going to be able to rebuild margins.\nDara Mohsenian: Great. And then any opportunities from an SG&A standpoint you're looking at given the higher commodity levels here in terms of leverage you can perhaps pull on to have greater cost savings and offset some of this gross margin pressure as you look out?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, we're going to continue to drive our admin productivity program. We've been doing that for years, and we'll continue to rely on that to help offset the cost inflation. We're on track to have another very good year from a cost savings perspective, and you'll see both benefits to cost of goods, but we also drive admin productivity, and you'll see us continue to do that going forward. But that will certainly be a key component of our work as we go.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: I hope all of you are well. Are there some take-or-pay third-party contracts that you will anniversary and potentially online already this calendar year? Or there is more like a consideration in calendar 2023? I think, Kevin, you alluded to that supply and supply chain consideration just now to -- in response to Dara's question. Or is that something that you still want to keep that cushion of supply even now with more capacity and demand have normalized? And on the amount of inflation, just as a follow-up, that you're calling now, we are hearing a lot of the peers saying that because it's broad-based and it's mostly logistics and transportation, that could represent even more than half of the pressure? While the other commodities revenues and which they have peeked and have improved. But -- is that something that you're seeing more secular now? And therefore, it might take those 12 to 18 months that you called out, is that the way we should be thinking?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, Andrea, thanks for the question. As it relates to take-or-pay agreements and as we've talked about this in the past, because of the tremendous increase in demand for our products, we quickly started expanding our supplier base, including the use of third-party manufacturers so we get more product out to meet demand. That came at a higher cost, but we thought that was a smart choice to make because we did not want to overinvest in our capacity. And then as demand moderated, we'd end up over capacitized and underutilizing our facilities.  And so we made that decision. We have increased the number of third-party manufacturers we work with. As demand moderates, as we expect it would, we are going to start stepping out of those agreements. I would expect that to start this fiscal year. In the back half of the year, we'll start stepping out in some of these agreements. And then the pace as we go will really be driven by consumer demand. As we watch demand play out, we will pull back on the capacity we've built up over time to match that demand moderation. But everything we're looking at suggests will start this year. And I think how you'll see that play out in our performance is what will start is you'll start to see our inventory levels come down. Because we've increased the number of manufacturing nodes we have in the network, that just means we're holding higher inventory levels as we have inventory in all these different facilities.  So I think by the end of the year, you'll start to see our inventory levels come down. And then I would think in fiscal year '23, you'll start seeing the real benefit of bringing that production back in-house, utilizing our facilities rather than these third-party manufacturers. And then on inflation, very similar to what you've heard from our peers, we are seeing inflation broadly across all the inputs within the supply chain. We're calling out commodities and transportation because, by far, that's the biggest amount of inflation we're dealing with. For us, commodity is still about 2/3 of the inflation, about 1/3 transportation, and resin, obviously, is the biggest component of the commodity inflation. And then on transportation for us, I think your question was, is it structural or not. Where we're seeing it, we're seeing it really in 2 areas. One, we're clearly seeing higher rates broadly across the transportation market. But the other challenge we're seeing is our use of spot carriers. As we see elevated demand for trucks and driver shortage is continuing, it's forcing us to move to the spot market at a greater pace than we've done historically. And we're seeing the premiums of spot market continue to increase. They're running 50% to 75% higher than primary carriers.  I think over time, if you assume demand for goods moderates over time, you're going to see us be able to move away from those spot carriers back to our primary carriers, and that should significantly reduce our transportation costs. And so while there will be inflation in the market, it is a significant upcharge for us using these spot carriers. And that ability to move back will be a nice savings for us over time. And I would expect to see that as demand settles out.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities.\nChris Carey : I guess I'm trying to understand just a little bit better. I hear you on the outlook for gross margins for the full year. I guess I'm just trying to understand maybe like the moving pieces for the back half. I guess if I look at this quarter, productivity still coming in a bit light, pricing is going to be building, raw materials probably weren't materially worse than what you thought this quarter and manufacturing and logistics definitely worse, and operating deleverage probably worse sequentially worse, too. And I guess, to really get comfortable with how negative gross margins are going to be in the back half, I suppose you have to assume that productivity remains fairly muted, that raw materials obviously remain negative as you just said. But you're also dealing with some pretty significant operating deleverage and maybe that's a nod to the fixed cost base, I'm not sure. But I guess is that -- is the way to think about that bridge kind of fair? And then maybe -- and sorry for the long question, but just as far as mix goes, obviously, mix normalizing is a big part of the story this year, as pricing is building, you're going to be pricing on 85% of the portfolio now? And so how does that factor in here? I guess what I'm getting at is just -- I hear you have the gross margin pressure, but you have to assume certain things stay pretty bad, and I just want to make sure I'm thinking about that correctly.\nKevin Jacobsen: Sure. Thanks, Chris, for the question. Let me talk a little bit about how we see gross margin progressing through the year. So we expected last quarter, and we continue to expect now, that Q2 is going to be our most challenging quarter in terms of margin pressure. And you saw that with our margins down about 33%. We continue to expect sequential improvement as we move throughout the balance of the year. And we continue to expect by Q4, we are in a position where we start to rebuild margins, and then we'd expect that to continue into fiscal year '23. Now to your question about what are the drivers in the back half of the year that will drive that sequential improvement. I'd point to a few. The first is pricing. Pricing will continue to build in terms of the value it generates for us as we move through the year. In Q1, it was fairly limited. It was about 50 basis points of benefit to margin. This last quarter is about 100 basis points. I think by Q3, it's starting to approach 200. It's probably still a little bit south of 200. And by the fourth quarter, I think the benefit will be well over 200 bps to gross margin. So you're going to see that building value from the pricing actions we have taken are the additional ones we announced today that will take over the back half of the year. In addition, when you think about our cost savings program, we're on track to have another very good year, but you will see that phasing in a little bit more back half weighted. And so in the front half of the year, we generated about 80 to 90 bps of benefit. You should see that north of 100 bps in the back half of the year, and that's just the timing of the projects, how they happen to play out this year. And then the other item I'd point to is, as you look at the cost inflation we're dealing with, Q2 was the most challenging quarter from a year-over-year perspective. As we get to the back half of the year, while we're still operating in an inflationary environment, the year-over-year change is much smaller because we really started to see a run up in commodities at the beginning of calendar year '21 with the ice storm in Texas. And so on a sequential basis in Q3 and Q4, those increases in both commodities, transportation, in manufacturing, there will be a lower hit to margin as we move through the quarters. And then finally, Chris, to your last comment, which is spot on as it relates to mix, we've talked about this for the last few quarters. We had a temporary benefit during the pandemic when we significantly reduced the number of products we offer to increase supply. As we are reintroducing our full line of products, including multipacks, that does have a mix yet. There will be about 4 quarters of that unwinding that temporary benefit, which will go through Q3, the current quarter end. And by the fourth quarter, we've lapped that, and we should not see a mix drag to margins as well. So we'll get that benefit. And then the last one is, as you mentioned, deleveraging. With volumes down in the front half of this year, there was some deleveraging that impacted margins. But in the back half of the year, we expect volumes to be flat, if not up. And so we should not expect that drag either. And so those are the elements of how we move through the year and why we expect to see margins building as we move through Q4.\nChris Carey : And if I could just squeeze one more in. You talked about like $500 million of commodity and transportation expense versus the prior $350 million. With the incremental pricing, you're going to get some offset, but the earnings is coming down more. Just what's -- is it just everything else in there and just the deleveraging on cost and just all these other things that are harder to track beyond those 2 items that you called out. I'm just trying to, I guess, quantitatively complete the grid.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes. So I'd say on the $350 million to $500 million, maybe just a couple of thoughts. So as we've talked, that's the increase we're seeing in commodities and transportation. While that's not the entire inflation we're dealing with, that's the bulk of it. That's the areas we're seeing the biggest year-over-year increase. But as I said, we're seeing inflation broadly across the portfolio. As it relates to pricing, as we've moved from planning to price 70% of our portfolio to now pricing 85%. And keep in mind, it's not just pricing 85%. We're also going back and taking multiple rounds of pricing for several of those brands within that 85%, but there tends to be a lag to that. And so we're going to incur that extra cost this year, now $500 million we're projecting. The pricing benefit will be modest as those pricing actions go into effect in the back half, and that's really setting ourselves up to get more benefit as we move into fiscal year '23.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse.\nKaumil Gajrawala: A couple of questions, I guess. Shifting to sales rather than margin. It looks like it's coming in a little bit better than expected. Can you maybe unpack that a bit? Is it a little bit more pricing is coming through than you had planned? Maybe the elasticity is lower than you thought? Or is it just that demand isn't really moderating at the rate that you might have expected?\nLinda Rendle: Kaumil, happy to get started on that one. We did see a strong quarter -- hi, Kaumil. We did see a strong quarter from a top line perspective, and really that continues to be the strength of our brands with our consumers. And we're seeing this broad-based across our categories where they continue to turn to our cleaning and disinfecting brands, our household essentials. And if you look across our 2-year stacks across all of our segments, we're in the strong double digits from a Q2 perspective. So what we're seeing, if you look at share, we're up in the majority of our business units. Our consumer value measure, which measures the amount of our portfolio that consumers deem superior, as an all-time high of 75%. So all of those investments we've made in advertising and sales promotion, innovation, executing against distribution as we got supply back in place are paying off, and demand remains robust. As we move forward, we're continuing to see long-term tailwinds that will continue from a portfolio perspective, which gives us confidence in getting to that 3% to 5% growth goal that we've spoken about in returning to that in the fourth quarter. And I would note some of the businesses in our household essentials were up even after a strong Q2 a year ago. So if you look at our Brita business, Food business, Glad, all off of a strong quarter a year ago. And again, it's behind the fundamentals, innovation and the fact that consumers continue to turn to trusted brands.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Okay. Great. And then to clarify maybe a comment, Kevin. It takes 12 -- I think you said, it takes 12 to 18 months to offset cost inflation in this instance because it's so much more profound, it's likely to take several years. Is that -- is that several years to get back to kind of your run rate of the mid-40s on gross margins? Or were you maybe suggesting something else?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes. Kaumil, I'll be a little cautious about providing an outlook beyond this year. But as Linda and I have said in the past, we are committed to rebuilding margins and getting back to that sort of mid-40s range we were before the pandemic began. And as I said, I do think it's going to take longer than what we've historically been able to do in terms of timing to recover margins at 12 to 18 months, just because of the sheer magnitude of the inflation we're dealing with. It's 3 to 5 times any previous inflationary cycle. So I would expect that time line to be extended. But again, keep in mind, there's a number of items we don't control that will impact the timing of how quickly we recover margins. We're going to just have to see how that plays out. I think we're going to be in a better position to estimate that. I'd like to get a few more quarters in our belt and see how the inflationary environment plays out. But I think as we prepare for fiscal year '23, we'll be in a better position to provide a perspective on the timing of that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman from Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. I wanted to just talk a little bit about working through inventory because last quarter, I think we had talked about the cash flow was weak in the inventory and finished goods in particular, was up, and that's kind of how we came to this, all of us, the realization around the external supply and estimating what was going to happen in terms of consumer demand.  Inventories grew again and sequentially. So you talked about volumes. You're hoping you get to up volumes by the end of the year. But I just want to talk about how you're thinking about working through inventory if there's particular categories where the overcapacity is more or less severe because, to Linda's point, there are businesses that are growing year-over-year in volume. And the degree to which some of these external supply contracts, it's easy to exit versus being contracted for certain amounts of supply for a given amount of time?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes. Lauren, thanks for the question. Let me talk a little bit about inventory and where we're at and then where I see that going over the next several quarters. We ended the second quarter with about 65 days of inventory in hand across our enterprise. Typically, before the pandemic, we were carrying about 55 days. And so we have built inventories. We built inventories for 2 primary reasons. First, we have taken up inventory levels broadly across our portfolio to try to help us manage through the ongoing supply chain disruption. This helps ensure if we have disruptions on our ability to secure transportation or we have suppliers go down for any number of reasons that they're going down, we have inventories in the system where we continue to ship and meet demand. And so we think it's smart in the near term to invest some additional working capital to have higher inventories across the network. We do think, at some point, as the supply disruptions start to work themselves out, we're going to be able to take that down. The other area that we built up inventory as it relates to extending our supply chain through additional third-party manufacturers. As I just mentioned, as you add more nodes to our network, we are holding inventory in many of those locations. And so we have a number of additional locations throughout the world where we're storing and accounting for inventory. How I think this will play out, as I just mentioned, we will start stepping out of some of these supply agreements the back half of this year as demand is moderating and we set these up that we could step out these and we felt it was the right time to do that. We will start stepping out of those this year. And as I said, I expect by the end of this year, you'll start to see inventory levels come down as we start consolidating our manufacturing base. As it relates to taking inventory levels down that we have right now to manage the supply disruptions, much of that's going to be driven based on when we feel comfortable that we can count on the supply chain, and then we can count on trucks arriving when we need them, material being available when we need it. So we're going to have to see how that plays out. But I expect to start making progress this year. And then I expect, over time, in '23, we'll continue to make progress.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay. That's great. And if I can sneak in one more. Linda, you commented on market -- I don't know if it was Linda, it was in your remarks, I apologize -- about market share improvement, where your on-shelf availability has improved. And that's certainly true in categories year-over-year, but there are certainly also categories where shares, at least as far as we can see in Nielsen, are down versus where you were in 2018, 2019. So I'm just curious, to be more constructive and you kind of look further out, what's the bogey? How do you think about where you want to be in terms of share? What's the right gauge of kind of success in reclaiming share positions because certainly, year-over-year progress is important. But if you kind of look back a little bit further, shares are still soft in certain categories on a multiyear basis?\nLinda Rendle: Lauren, yes, thank you. I'll build on that. So overall, I would say, from a market share perspective, we're feeling good about where we are returning to pre-pandemic share levels in aggregates and then growing in the majority of our businesses and continuing to make progress. Even if you look at the last 4 to 5 weeks, stronger share growth than we even experienced in the first half of the year. But that being said, we absolutely need to continue to make progress. And our goal is to grow share, and I've been super clear about that, and we continue to be focused on that. We want to win. We want to win in our categories. That doesn't mean we'll always win in every category at all times. There will be ups and downs as there's competitive spending, innovation launches and timing. But in aggregate, we're focused on growing market share in our categories, winning with our brands. And although we've made great progress, I'd point to Glad as a great example, growing Glad Trash's share after a long time of being flat to slightly down, but our innovation is working, pricing is working, et cetera. We're going to continue to make progress against the portfolio, and we intend to grow market share.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Two questions for me. Kevin, I'm sorry, I'm going to beat a dead horse here, but I'm going to come back to gross margin but attack it a little bit differently. I guess, like others on the call, I'm kind of wrestling a little bit with some of the commentary around the recovery as sort of as clear as our crystal ball may be today. But a little bit more structural. And I guess where I'm coming from with this, when we chatted in November, you sounded pretty good about an 18- to 24-month recovery. So what has changed dramatically over the past 3 months to make you a lot more cautious on the cadence of that recovery? And I guess, as I'm kind of looking at the quarter, and I think this was an earlier comment. I mean, the commodity piece certainly dire, but maybe not drastically more dire than we had modeled. The manufacturing logistics certainly worse. So just taking those pieces together, I'm just -- what has changed in your mind? What has changed internally for the company that makes you significantly more cautious on the pace of the recovery, the ability to price and offset it with productivity?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes. Thanks, Kevin. A couple of thoughts on the ability to price. I feel very confident in our ability to price. We've executed pricing on 50% of our portfolio quite successfully through the second quarter. We still have some work to do over the balance of the year to get to that 85%. But many of those conversations with retailers have already occurred. So I feel very good about the work of the team and our ability to take the necessary pricing. And Kevin, as I mentioned earlier, we feel very good about the work we're doing on cost savings. We'll have another good year. What we are seeing, though, just broadly, inflation is getting more difficult. Sitting here today, we now think there's $500 million worth of cost inflation. 3 months ago, we thought that was $350 million. So I think seeing that level of inflation that we're continuing to deal with, that just means we've got more work to do on pricing, cost savings, and we'll have to see how long that takes. I think it's prudent to think about the time to do that, and I expect it to be longer than what we've done historically. And so I just think it's driven by an increasing inflationary environment we're dealing with and knowing that's going to take some time to work through. And I think, Kevin, as I said earlier, what I think is most important is make sure we continue to stay balanced. We have top line momentum. We're going to continue to invest to maintain that momentum. And then we're going to rebuild margins at the appropriate pace that allows us to do both. And so we're going to continue to be very focused on doing both and doing both well, and we think that's how we're going to maximize the value of the company. And so I think looking out a couple of years and expecting recovery over that period of time seems reasonable. But obviously, I think over the next few quarters, we'll get more visibility to be able to update you as we learn more.\nKevin Grundy: Okay. And just a quick follow-up for Linda. Can you just comment on expectations or potential risk around trade down in your categories, given this level of pricing and the handful of categories where you have higher private label exposure? And then I'll pass it on.\nLinda Rendle: Sure, Kevin. Generally, if you look at our categories, we don't really have very high private label exposure. It's concentrated in a few categories. And in those categories, we have a very strong share position and have for many years. And I just turn to the facts on the strength of our brands. So I spoke about earlier the fact that our superiority rating by consumers is at the highest it's ever been. So 75% of our portfolio is deemed superior by consumers. If you look at the trends on private label through the pandemic, private label continues to not make progress on share. Consumers are turning to a trusted brand. During this entire time, we've been investing in those brands through advertising and sales promotion and a really terrific innovation program that's -- we're continuing to see the benefits of all of the innovations we've launched are off to a strong start, and we launched new innovations this quarter with more coming in the back half.  So when I think about where we are, our brands are in a better position than they were pre-pandemic and really been even at the height of the pandemic. And so we feel confident in our ability to take pricing. We are watching very closely the impacts that inflation will have on consumers. I think there's a lot of unknowns in that. But if you look back at how we've performed during times of economic stress for consumers, given the fact that we're in household essentials categories, we tend to fare pretty well, our categories fare well, and we would expect that to continue. The other thing I would note is that we are seeing pricing generally in line with what we've taken in the category. So private label is moving as well, and we expect our price gaps to be about what they were pre-pandemic and pre-pricing, and that will also help us as we move forward. So I feel as confident as I can given the strength of our brands and our ability to execute these price increases. Again, we're going to watch consumers carefully as we go through this period. But we think we're in a good position to pass through these price increases and continue our momentum on top line.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.\nJason English: A couple of quick questions. The gross margin contribution from price, a little north of 200 bps in the fourth quarter. Is that going to reflect like sort of full price? Are you going to have all the price increases in the fourth quarter? Or are there more to come as we get out to fiscal '23?\nKevin Jacobsen: Jason, on pricing, and I won't comment on pricing in fiscal year '23. Let me just talk about our plans this year. As I -- as we said, we've implemented 50%. We've got some more work to do. Some of that will go into effect this quarter, Q3, but we have some additional pricing actions that go in place in Q4. And so as I said, north of 200 bps in the fourth quarter would not be the full value because you won't have the full Q4 impact from some of those pricing actions, which would suggest, as we get into fiscal year '23, you'll see that continue to build. And then we're going to remain open so we're going to continue to evaluate the cost environment. We stand prepared to take more pricing, if necessary, if that's what's required to recover margin. I'd say it's too early to make that call. We want to see how we think inflation is going to play out as we get through this fiscal year. And then based on that, we'll make decisions on '23 pricing. But that's something we'll certainly consider.\nJason English: Understood. And Linda, pre-COVID, there were a number of your business lines that were suffering from some market share losses, whether it be from some branded competitors or private label. It's obviously encouraging to see the recovery and the growth that you're now experiencing. But it's coming on a much more subdued rate of price than we've seen in most of your other categories. In other words, it's coming on price gaps going down. So your value proposition is improving, and your market share is getting better. You mentioned trash bag, it's a great example. You can see it. How much of your market share do you think is coming from that? And is part of what's happened here a bit of a permanent rebase in your pricing architecture and therefore, permanent rebasing in margin structure?\nLinda Rendle: Jason, I think what's true in the data and what will be true over the coming months as pricing settles out in the categories is there's definitely going to be variability in terms of price gaps, et cetera. But what we have not seen is a material change in our price gaps in aggregate in the categories. There's some pluses and minuses depending on pricing implementation timing. But that really isn't what we're seeing driving the strengths in our brand. The majority is attributed to good execution. We're seeing distribution increases, return to merch, although lower than pre-COVID levels, as well as our strong innovation plans taking hold. So as we look at the drivers, we're seeing the majority of that share driven by factors that are within our control versus price gaps, et cetera.  Again, this is going to play out over the next few months, but we do not expect price gaps to be a driver of our performance moving forward. We expect for them to be about what they were pre-COVID. That's not what our intent is. Our intent is to win through innovation. Our intent is to win through brand building and continued spending on advertising and sales promotion and investing in our categories.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Peter Grom of UBS.\nPeter Grom: So I guess by my bigger question is just do you feel like you've embedded enough flex in this guidance that gives you comfort or should give investors comfort that this is really it in terms of negative revisions? And then I guess just following up on the commentary on phasing on purchase margin in the back half of the year. I know you mentioned a few -- 4Q up and sequential improvement in Q3. But can you maybe help us directionally in terms of how much improvement in Q3 because down 1,200 basis points is quite a bit. And then Kevin, I think previously, as we exited the year, it was a return to the low 40s in terms of gross margin. So just like any thought around the rate of improvement that we should be expecting now as we exit the year.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes. Thanks, Peter. Let me talk about -- your question was on the plan. Overall, I think we have a balanced outlook for this year. I feel very good about the areas we directly control, whether that's our pricing actions, our cost savings efforts or the work we're doing in innovation. But I also recognize we are operating in an environment that is much more volatile. And so not knowing exactly how inflation will play out, consumer demand, I think the outlook we provided is appropriate. You'll also see that our outlook ranges are a bit wider than we might normally provide this time of year. We also think that's appropriate given the level of volatility in some of those areas we don't directly control. So overall, I feel like we provide a good balanced outlook for the year that allows for some variability across a number of different drivers. And then as it relates to phasing, I would expect, as I said, progression through the year, starting in Q3. Right now, we're looking at Q3 margins probably in the mid-30s, building on where we land in Q2. And then previously, we had anticipated we'd be in the low 40s. I expect with the increased level of inflation, we'll likely finish the year in the high 30s, and then we would look to build on that as we move into fiscal year '23.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Linda Bolton-Weiser with D.A. Davidson.\nLinda Bolton-Weiser: So I actually have a question that's not on gross margin. I was just wondering in your Brita business, have you experienced any issues with the EPA labeling your competitor, Helen of Troy had to halt shipments so they could redo some labeling as per EPA regulation changes. Are you experiencing that? Or do you expect to experience that in your Brita business?\nLinda Rendle: Linda, no, we do not have that issue. And maybe I'll just take an opportunity to point to what's going on in Brita right now because I think it's a really great story. Brita has been a terrific success over this pandemic as people have turned to filtered water to meet their needs. And I think it's twofold. One, people are spending more time worried about their health and wellness, and drinking more water is important. And second, they're thinking about their impact on the planet through sustainability.  So Brita has been a business that has very, very strong double-digit growth. We've grown share 5 points in the last quarter. And if you look at our household penetration, it's the highest it's been in 8 years. So feel really good about the future of this business. Our innovation pipeline is strong, and it's one that we plan to continue to accelerate moving forward. But we don't have any of those issues holding us back from an EPA perspective.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. Ms. Rendle, I will now like to turn the program back to you.\nLinda Rendle: Great. Thank you. Thanks, everyone. We look forward to speaking to you again on our next call in May. And until then, please stay well.\nOperator: And this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Jacobsen",
            "content": "Dara, this is Kevin. I appreciate the question. Let me start with the expectations for gross margin. And I'm sure, as you can appreciate, I won't provide a specific outlook beyond this year. But I can give you some perspective in terms of what we're seeing. And if you look at the work we're doing, we believe we're taking the right actions primarily through our pricing efforts and our cost savings program that we continue to be in a position that we can recover costs and rebuild margins over time. Now I do think that's going to take some time given the level of inflation we're dealing with. And I think you're hearing from us and a lot of peers. This is a unique environment with an extreme level of cost inflation. But we do think we've got the right plans in place to be able to rebuild margins. Now for us, that continue -- we continue to believe that's going to start this year. We think by the fourth quarter, we're in a position when we start that process of rebuilding margins and then fully expect that to continue next year. If I look at our history, this is the fourth inflationary cycle we've gone through in the last 10 years. If you look at the 3 previous times we've done this, we've been able to fully price and drive our cost savings program to offset the cost inflation, rebuild margins. It historically has taken us about 12 to 18 months to do that. I would tell you though in this case, because of the extreme level of inflation we're dealing with, I expect it to take longer. So we'll have to see exactly how that plays out. And what will also influence the timing, to a certain extent, is how the inflationary market plays out. That could either extend the time line or accelerate if we get any tailwinds or further headwinds on cost inflation. But I do think it's going to take several years for us to rebuild margin. And what's important for us is while we are committed to rebuilding margins, at the same time, we want to make sure we continue to invest in the business to maintain the top line momentum. We have very good momentum on the top line. As you know, we're expecting 3% to 5% going forward. And we want to continue to invest to maintain that momentum. So we think the way we maximize the value of this company is we invest to maintain that momentum. And then at the appropriate price -- pace, we rebuild margins, which we're committed to doing. And then in regard to fixed costs and choices we can make. One thing I'd tell you, and we've talked about this a little bit in the past. As you know, we have significantly extended our supply chain through this pandemic, both to increase supply availability as well as to be able to increase our ability to meet this elevated demand. That is an opportunity for us. And so as demand continues to moderate, we're going to be able to go after those fixed costs in our supply chain and take those out. And that's another reason that gives us confidence that we're going to be able to rebuild margins. Yes, we're going to continue to drive our admin productivity program. We've been doing that for years, and we'll continue to rely on that to help offset the cost inflation. We're on track to have another very good year from a cost savings perspective, and you'll see both benefits to cost of goods, but we also drive admin productivity, and you'll see us continue to do that going forward. But that will certainly be a key component of our work as we go. Yes, Andrea, thanks for the question. As it relates to take-or-pay agreements and as we've talked about this in the past, because of the tremendous increase in demand for our products, we quickly started expanding our supplier base, including the use of third-party manufacturers so we get more product out to meet demand. That came at a higher cost, but we thought that was a smart choice to make because we did not want to overinvest in our capacity. And then as demand moderated, we'd end up over capacitized and underutilizing our facilities.  And so we made that decision. We have increased the number of third-party manufacturers we work with. As demand moderates, as we expect it would, we are going to start stepping out of those agreements. I would expect that to start this fiscal year. In the back half of the year, we'll start stepping out in some of these agreements. And then the pace as we go will really be driven by consumer demand. As we watch demand play out, we will pull back on the capacity we've built up over time to match that demand moderation. But everything we're looking at suggests will start this year. And I think how you'll see that play out in our performance is what will start is you'll start to see our inventory levels come down. Because we've increased the number of manufacturing nodes we have in the network, that just means we're holding higher inventory levels as we have inventory in all these different facilities.  So I think by the end of the year, you'll start to see our inventory levels come down. And then I would think in fiscal year '23, you'll start seeing the real benefit of bringing that production back in-house, utilizing our facilities rather than these third-party manufacturers. And then on inflation, very similar to what you've heard from our peers, we are seeing inflation broadly across all the inputs within the supply chain. We're calling out commodities and transportation because, by far, that's the biggest amount of inflation we're dealing with. For us, commodity is still about 2/3 of the inflation, about 1/3 transportation, and resin, obviously, is the biggest component of the commodity inflation. And then on transportation for us, I think your question was, is it structural or not. Where we're seeing it, we're seeing it really in 2 areas. One, we're clearly seeing higher rates broadly across the transportation market. But the other challenge we're seeing is our use of spot carriers. As we see elevated demand for trucks and driver shortage is continuing, it's forcing us to move to the spot market at a greater pace than we've done historically. And we're seeing the premiums of spot market continue to increase. They're running 50% to 75% higher than primary carriers.  I think over time, if you assume demand for goods moderates over time, you're going to see us be able to move away from those spot carriers back to our primary carriers, and that should significantly reduce our transportation costs. And so while there will be inflation in the market, it is a significant upcharge for us using these spot carriers. And that ability to move back will be a nice savings for us over time. And I would expect to see that as demand settles out. Sure. Thanks, Chris, for the question. Let me talk a little bit about how we see gross margin progressing through the year. So we expected last quarter, and we continue to expect now, that Q2 is going to be our most challenging quarter in terms of margin pressure. And you saw that with our margins down about 33%. We continue to expect sequential improvement as we move throughout the balance of the year. And we continue to expect by Q4, we are in a position where we start to rebuild margins, and then we'd expect that to continue into fiscal year '23. Now to your question about what are the drivers in the back half of the year that will drive that sequential improvement. I'd point to a few. The first is pricing. Pricing will continue to build in terms of the value it generates for us as we move through the year. In Q1, it was fairly limited. It was about 50 basis points of benefit to margin. This last quarter is about 100 basis points. I think by Q3, it's starting to approach 200. It's probably still a little bit south of 200. And by the fourth quarter, I think the benefit will be well over 200 bps to gross margin. So you're going to see that building value from the pricing actions we have taken are the additional ones we announced today that will take over the back half of the year. In addition, when you think about our cost savings program, we're on track to have another very good year, but you will see that phasing in a little bit more back half weighted. And so in the front half of the year, we generated about 80 to 90 bps of benefit. You should see that north of 100 bps in the back half of the year, and that's just the timing of the projects, how they happen to play out this year. And then the other item I'd point to is, as you look at the cost inflation we're dealing with, Q2 was the most challenging quarter from a year-over-year perspective. As we get to the back half of the year, while we're still operating in an inflationary environment, the year-over-year change is much smaller because we really started to see a run up in commodities at the beginning of calendar year '21 with the ice storm in Texas. And so on a sequential basis in Q3 and Q4, those increases in both commodities, transportation, in manufacturing, there will be a lower hit to margin as we move through the quarters. And then finally, Chris, to your last comment, which is spot on as it relates to mix, we've talked about this for the last few quarters. We had a temporary benefit during the pandemic when we significantly reduced the number of products we offer to increase supply. As we are reintroducing our full line of products, including multipacks, that does have a mix yet. There will be about 4 quarters of that unwinding that temporary benefit, which will go through Q3, the current quarter end. And by the fourth quarter, we've lapped that, and we should not see a mix drag to margins as well. So we'll get that benefit. And then the last one is, as you mentioned, deleveraging. With volumes down in the front half of this year, there was some deleveraging that impacted margins. But in the back half of the year, we expect volumes to be flat, if not up. And so we should not expect that drag either. And so those are the elements of how we move through the year and why we expect to see margins building as we move through Q4. Yes. So I'd say on the $350 million to $500 million, maybe just a couple of thoughts. So as we've talked, that's the increase we're seeing in commodities and transportation. While that's not the entire inflation we're dealing with, that's the bulk of it. That's the areas we're seeing the biggest year-over-year increase. But as I said, we're seeing inflation broadly across the portfolio. As it relates to pricing, as we've moved from planning to price 70% of our portfolio to now pricing 85%. And keep in mind, it's not just pricing 85%. We're also going back and taking multiple rounds of pricing for several of those brands within that 85%, but there tends to be a lag to that. And so we're going to incur that extra cost this year, now $500 million we're projecting. The pricing benefit will be modest as those pricing actions go into effect in the back half, and that's really setting ourselves up to get more benefit as we move into fiscal year '23. Yes. Kaumil, I'll be a little cautious about providing an outlook beyond this year. But as Linda and I have said in the past, we are committed to rebuilding margins and getting back to that sort of mid-40s range we were before the pandemic began. And as I said, I do think it's going to take longer than what we've historically been able to do in terms of timing to recover margins at 12 to 18 months, just because of the sheer magnitude of the inflation we're dealing with. It's 3 to 5 times any previous inflationary cycle. So I would expect that time line to be extended. But again, keep in mind, there's a number of items we don't control that will impact the timing of how quickly we recover margins. We're going to just have to see how that plays out. I think we're going to be in a better position to estimate that. I'd like to get a few more quarters in our belt and see how the inflationary environment plays out. But I think as we prepare for fiscal year '23, we'll be in a better position to provide a perspective on the timing of that. Yes. Lauren, thanks for the question. Let me talk a little bit about inventory and where we're at and then where I see that going over the next several quarters. We ended the second quarter with about 65 days of inventory in hand across our enterprise. Typically, before the pandemic, we were carrying about 55 days. And so we have built inventories. We built inventories for 2 primary reasons. First, we have taken up inventory levels broadly across our portfolio to try to help us manage through the ongoing supply chain disruption. This helps ensure if we have disruptions on our ability to secure transportation or we have suppliers go down for any number of reasons that they're going down, we have inventories in the system where we continue to ship and meet demand. And so we think it's smart in the near term to invest some additional working capital to have higher inventories across the network. We do think, at some point, as the supply disruptions start to work themselves out, we're going to be able to take that down. The other area that we built up inventory as it relates to extending our supply chain through additional third-party manufacturers. As I just mentioned, as you add more nodes to our network, we are holding inventory in many of those locations. And so we have a number of additional locations throughout the world where we're storing and accounting for inventory. How I think this will play out, as I just mentioned, we will start stepping out of some of these supply agreements the back half of this year as demand is moderating and we set these up that we could step out these and we felt it was the right time to do that. We will start stepping out of those this year. And as I said, I expect by the end of this year, you'll start to see inventory levels come down as we start consolidating our manufacturing base. As it relates to taking inventory levels down that we have right now to manage the supply disruptions, much of that's going to be driven based on when we feel comfortable that we can count on the supply chain, and then we can count on trucks arriving when we need them, material being available when we need it. So we're going to have to see how that plays out. But I expect to start making progress this year. And then I expect, over time, in '23, we'll continue to make progress. Yes. Thanks, Kevin. A couple of thoughts on the ability to price. I feel very confident in our ability to price. We've executed pricing on 50% of our portfolio quite successfully through the second quarter. We still have some work to do over the balance of the year to get to that 85%. But many of those conversations with retailers have already occurred. So I feel very good about the work of the team and our ability to take the necessary pricing. And Kevin, as I mentioned earlier, we feel very good about the work we're doing on cost savings. We'll have another good year. What we are seeing, though, just broadly, inflation is getting more difficult. Sitting here today, we now think there's $500 million worth of cost inflation. 3 months ago, we thought that was $350 million. So I think seeing that level of inflation that we're continuing to deal with, that just means we've got more work to do on pricing, cost savings, and we'll have to see how long that takes. I think it's prudent to think about the time to do that, and I expect it to be longer than what we've done historically. And so I just think it's driven by an increasing inflationary environment we're dealing with and knowing that's going to take some time to work through. And I think, Kevin, as I said earlier, what I think is most important is make sure we continue to stay balanced. We have top line momentum. We're going to continue to invest to maintain that momentum. And then we're going to rebuild margins at the appropriate pace that allows us to do both. And so we're going to continue to be very focused on doing both and doing both well, and we think that's how we're going to maximize the value of the company. And so I think looking out a couple of years and expecting recovery over that period of time seems reasonable. But obviously, I think over the next few quarters, we'll get more visibility to be able to update you as we learn more. Jason, on pricing, and I won't comment on pricing in fiscal year '23. Let me just talk about our plans this year. As I -- as we said, we've implemented 50%. We've got some more work to do. Some of that will go into effect this quarter, Q3, but we have some additional pricing actions that go in place in Q4. And so as I said, north of 200 bps in the fourth quarter would not be the full value because you won't have the full Q4 impact from some of those pricing actions, which would suggest, as we get into fiscal year '23, you'll see that continue to build. And then we're going to remain open so we're going to continue to evaluate the cost environment. We stand prepared to take more pricing, if necessary, if that's what's required to recover margin. I'd say it's too early to make that call. We want to see how we think inflation is going to play out as we get through this fiscal year. And then based on that, we'll make decisions on '23 pricing. But that's something we'll certainly consider. Yes. Thanks, Peter. Let me talk about -- your question was on the plan. Overall, I think we have a balanced outlook for this year. I feel very good about the areas we directly control, whether that's our pricing actions, our cost savings efforts or the work we're doing in innovation. But I also recognize we are operating in an environment that is much more volatile. And so not knowing exactly how inflation will play out, consumer demand, I think the outlook we provided is appropriate. You'll also see that our outlook ranges are a bit wider than we might normally provide this time of year. We also think that's appropriate given the level of volatility in some of those areas we don't directly control. So overall, I feel like we provide a good balanced outlook for the year that allows for some variability across a number of different drivers. And then as it relates to phasing, I would expect, as I said, progression through the year, starting in Q3. Right now, we're looking at Q3 margins probably in the mid-30s, building on where we land in Q2. And then previously, we had anticipated we'd be in the low 40s. I expect with the increased level of inflation, we'll likely finish the year in the high 30s, and then we would look to build on that as we move into fiscal year '23."

            "content": "Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I hope you and your families are well. Hopefully, you found our prepared remarks helpful. We faced significant cost headwinds in a volatile operating environment in Q2, but despite these challenging conditions, we executed well on those factors under our control. This includes taking strategic pricing actions and driving cost savings, while restoring supply, serving our customers and advancing our consumer-centric innovation pipeline. Demand remains robust across our portfolio, and our brand superiority results are better than during the height of the pandemic. We have a portfolio of strong, trusted brands exposed to demand-driven tailwinds, and we will continue to invest in them, which we expect will fuel long-term growth for our business. While we anticipate this highly dynamic and challenging environment to persist over the near term and adjusted our fiscal 2022 outlook as a result, we are confident that we're taking the appropriate actions to navigate this period, deliver profitable growth over time and build a stronger, more resilient company. With that, Kevin and I will open the line for questions. Kaumil, happy to get started on that one. We did see a strong quarter -- hi, Kaumil. We did see a strong quarter from a top line perspective, and really that continues to be the strength of our brands with our consumers. And we're seeing this broad-based across our categories where they continue to turn to our cleaning and disinfecting brands, our household essentials. And if you look across our 2-year stacks across all of our segments, we're in the strong double digits from a Q2 perspective. So what we're seeing, if you look at share, we're up in the majority of our business units. Our consumer value measure, which measures the amount of our portfolio that consumers deem superior, as an all-time high of 75%. So all of those investments we've made in advertising and sales promotion, innovation, executing against distribution as we got supply back in place are paying off, and demand remains robust. As we move forward, we're continuing to see long-term tailwinds that will continue from a portfolio perspective, which gives us confidence in getting to that 3% to 5% growth goal that we've spoken about in returning to that in the fourth quarter. And I would note some of the businesses in our household essentials were up even after a strong Q2 a year ago. So if you look at our Brita business, Food business, Glad, all off of a strong quarter a year ago. And again, it's behind the fundamentals, innovation and the fact that consumers continue to turn to trusted brands. Lauren, yes, thank you. I'll build on that. So overall, I would say, from a market share perspective, we're feeling good about where we are returning to pre-pandemic share levels in aggregates and then growing in the majority of our businesses and continuing to make progress. Even if you look at the last 4 to 5 weeks, stronger share growth than we even experienced in the first half of the year. But that being said, we absolutely need to continue to make progress. And our goal is to grow share, and I've been super clear about that, and we continue to be focused on that. We want to win. We want to win in our categories. That doesn't mean we'll always win in every category at all times. There will be ups and downs as there's competitive spending, innovation launches and timing. But in aggregate, we're focused on growing market share in our categories, winning with our brands. And although we've made great progress, I'd point to Glad as a great example, growing Glad Trash's share after a long time of being flat to slightly down, but our innovation is working, pricing is working, et cetera. We're going to continue to make progress against the portfolio, and we intend to grow market share. Sure, Kevin. Generally, if you look at our categories, we don't really have very high private label exposure. It's concentrated in a few categories. And in those categories, we have a very strong share position and have for many years. And I just turn to the facts on the strength of our brands. So I spoke about earlier the fact that our superiority rating by consumers is at the highest it's ever been. So 75% of our portfolio is deemed superior by consumers. If you look at the trends on private label through the pandemic, private label continues to not make progress on share. Consumers are turning to a trusted brand. During this entire time, we've been investing in those brands through advertising and sales promotion and a really terrific innovation program that's -- we're continuing to see the benefits of all of the innovations we've launched are off to a strong start, and we launched new innovations this quarter with more coming in the back half.  So when I think about where we are, our brands are in a better position than they were pre-pandemic and really been even at the height of the pandemic. And so we feel confident in our ability to take pricing. We are watching very closely the impacts that inflation will have on consumers. I think there's a lot of unknowns in that. But if you look back at how we've performed during times of economic stress for consumers, given the fact that we're in household essentials categories, we tend to fare pretty well, our categories fare well, and we would expect that to continue. The other thing I would note is that we are seeing pricing generally in line with what we've taken in the category. So private label is moving as well, and we expect our price gaps to be about what they were pre-pandemic and pre-pricing, and that will also help us as we move forward. So I feel as confident as I can given the strength of our brands and our ability to execute these price increases. Again, we're going to watch consumers carefully as we go through this period. But we think we're in a good position to pass through these price increases and continue our momentum on top line. Jason, I think what's true in the data and what will be true over the coming months as pricing settles out in the categories is there's definitely going to be variability in terms of price gaps, et cetera. But what we have not seen is a material change in our price gaps in aggregate in the categories. There's some pluses and minuses depending on pricing implementation timing. But that really isn't what we're seeing driving the strengths in our brand. The majority is attributed to good execution. We're seeing distribution increases, return to merch, although lower than pre-COVID levels, as well as our strong innovation plans taking hold. So as we look at the drivers, we're seeing the majority of that share driven by factors that are within our control versus price gaps, et cetera.  Again, this is going to play out over the next few months, but we do not expect price gaps to be a driver of our performance moving forward. We expect for them to be about what they were pre-COVID. That's not what our intent is. Our intent is to win through innovation. Our intent is to win through brand building and continued spending on advertising and sales promotion and investing in our categories. Linda, no, we do not have that issue. And maybe I'll just take an opportunity to point to what's going on in Brita right now because I think it's a really great story. Brita has been a terrific success over this pandemic as people have turned to filtered water to meet their needs. And I think it's twofold. One, people are spending more time worried about their health and wellness, and drinking more water is important. And second, they're thinking about their impact on the planet through sustainability.  So Brita has been a business that has very, very strong double-digit growth. We've grown share 5 points in the last quarter. And if you look at our household penetration, it's the highest it's been in 8 years. So feel really good about the future of this business. Our innovation pipeline is strong, and it's one that we plan to continue to accelerate moving forward. But we don't have any of those issues holding us back from an EPA perspective. Great. Thank you. Thanks, everyone. We look forward to speaking to you again on our next call in May. And until then, please stay well."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. \n I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin. \nLisah Burhan: Thank you, Michelle. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. On the call today with me are Linda Rendle, our CEO; and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. I hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website. In just a moment, Linda will share a few opening comments, and then we'll take your questions. \n During this call, we may make forward-looking statements, including about our fiscal 2022 outlook and the potential impact of COVID-19 pandemic on our business. These statements are based on management's current expectations but may differ from actual results or outcomes.\n In addition, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section, which identifies various factors that could affect such forward-looking statements and the non-GAAP financial information section, including the tables that reconcile non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, both of which are located at the end of today's earnings release, which also has been filed with the SEC.\n Now I'll turn it over to Linda. \nLinda Rendle: Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I hope you and your families are well. Hopefully, you found our prepared remarks and this new earnings format helpful. \n We're off to a solid start to fiscal 2022 with stronger-than-anticipated demand across our portfolio and focused execution in a challenging operating environment. We've made meaningful progress on our strategic priorities this quarter, including restoring supply across much of our portfolio, which has enabled us to hold or gain market share in the vast majority of our businesses. We are proactively addressing the inflationary and cost headwinds that are impacting our margins through pricing and cost reduction initiatives. And at the same time, we're making important investments in our business to strengthen our competitive advantages and position the company for long-term success, including advancing our innovation pipeline, deploying our targeted advertising and sales promotion strategy and investing in critical digital capabilities.\n Given our Q1 performance and the actions we are taking, we are reiterating our fiscal '22 outlook. \n With that, Kevin and I would like to open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. \nAndrea Teixeira: So -- and thank you for the new format. Linda, I wanted to touch base on your commentary. I think obviously, it came in better than tiered of your low double digits when you closed the fourth quarter of last year -- of last fiscal year. So I wanted to kind of break down what you think is driven by -- how much you think was driven by the Delta variant coming back? Or how do you see tracking now in the second quarter in terms of demand? And if you can also touch on -- obviously, you put some pricing in place. How do you think pricing can come in? And if you have that price mix impact as mix has been normalized, and then I have a follow-up on the COGS on the cost side. \nLinda Rendle: Okay. I'll start with the demand piece, and I'll get into pricing and Kevin can talk about mix. So on the demand side, as we articulated back in Q4, we definitely expected it to be bumpy this year as it came to consumer behavior, et cetera. But the good news is this quarter, given our strong position on supply, what we saw as a very successful return to merchandising with our back-to-school program and, of course, Delta impacts, demand was stronger than we anticipated across the vast majority of our portfolio. So that wasn't just in our cleaning businesses, but really across the board.\n We generally saw consumer mobility continue to be strong. So we haven't seen as big of an impact as people were in shelter in place before. Delta really didn't have that same impact and yet we did continue to see strong demand as people chose to stay at home more, are self continuing to work from home and are continuing to prioritize health and wellness habits, whether that be cleaning and disinfecting, taking vitamins, minerals and supplements, drinking water. We did see a little bit, Andrea, of timing shifts from Q2 when it comes to merch and a little bit of inventory, but that wasn't the majority of what we saw from an improvement perspective, it really was based consumer demand.\n I'll switch to pricing now. As we spoke about in the release, we have announced pricing on 50% of our portfolio. That sell-in continues to go well, and we're seeing execution hit market now in many of the businesses. Given the incremental costs that we're experiencing, we're taking additional action and now pricing a total of 70% of the portfolio this year. And we are beginning to implement many of those as we speak with additional actions that we're taking in the back half to be talked about at that time.\n And I would say, generally, given the environment that we're experiencing across the industry, the conversations are very productive. People understand the environment and largely our peers are going as well for our categories are increasing in pricing. But no surprises. Our brands are really strong. At this point, we have the strongest consumer value score that we've ever had since we began measuring it. Our household penetration continues to look strong. Increased repeat rates, increased buy rates. So our brands are healthy. Shares are growing as a result of that, and we feel really well positioned to execute pricing on 70% of the portfolio this year. \nKevin Jacobsen: And Andrea -- no, please go ahead. \nAndrea Teixeira: Oh, sorry. I wanted to say just on that comment, Linda, thank you for explaining the pricing. So going to the 70%, is that related mostly for the resin or the chlorine that went up recently? So is that applied to mostly bags or that's for the disinfecting franchise? \nLinda Rendle: 70% of the portfolio is going to encompass a broad range, but it is in relation to 3 things that we're really seeing pressure on. Commodities is one and certainly additional pressure on resin. Hurricane Ida pushed out the resin curve by a month or 2, and so we're seeing a continued impact there. Transportation continues to be a negative driver for us, and we're seeing that continue throughout the remainder of the fiscal year.\n And although there hasn't been a big material impact directly, we're looking at labor closely given what we're seeing on pressures there. So we're taking all of that into account. We have not announced since you asked the question directly, an additional price increase on Glad. We've executed high single digits at this point, but we are evaluating an additional price increase on Glad given what we're seeing in resin. And that's been -- we long follow what happens in resin and are able to move pretty quickly on Glad. And that's something that we're contemplating as another price increase on Glad, in addition to what I talked about in the 70%. \nKevin Jacobsen: And then, Andrea, you had asked a question about price mix, and maybe just a little background and I talked about this in August. We benefited from about 3 to 4 points of favorable price mix through the pandemic, and we know that was temporary primarily driven by the rationalization of our product offerings. If you recall, to increase supply availability, we produced a lot less products. They tend to be smaller single accounts. And additionally, because of lack of merchandising activity because of the lack of supply, we were generating favorable price mix for about 4 straight quarters, pretty consistently about 3- to 4-point capability.\n We fully expect that to unwind as we get back to a more normalized level of supply and we get back to a more normalized level of promotional activity. That started in the fourth quarter. We had about 2 points of unfavorable price mix. It continued this quarter. We had 3 points of unfavorable price mix. I'd expect to see that for 2 more quarters. So we'll see it in the second quarter, third quarter. And then by the fourth quarter, I would expect to have lapped this temporary benefit. And you also see the full benefit of the pricing actions we're taking. So by the fourth quarter, I'd expect us to return to favorable price mix. \n And as you probably saw in our prepared remarks. We continue to expect by the back half of the year, we're going to get our sales back into the low end of our long-term sales goal, 3% to 5%. Part of that will be driven by the fact that we'll start generating positive price mix as well in the back half of the year. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Grom of UBS. \nPeter Grom: So I was just kind of hoping to get your updated view on margin progression from here. Clearly, the first quarter came in slightly better than you had anticipated from at least from a gross margin perspective, and you're expecting sequential improvement. But is there any way to help us maybe quantify that sequential improvement from here as pricing builds? And how much expansion you actually expect in the fourth quarter? I mean, I guess what I'm really trying to get at is how should we really think about the margin recovery, and frankly, how quickly can we get back to the mid-40% range? \nKevin Jacobsen: Sure. Thanks, Peter, for the question. And let me give you my perspective on how we see margin phasing out this year. As you recall, back in August, our expectation was that Q1 was going to be our most difficult quarter from a cost input perspective. And then we see sequential improvement in margin throughout the year. And importantly, by the fourth quarter, returning to gross margin expansion, and we identify getting back in the low 40s.\n What has changed since that time are 2 things, and Linda mentioned them. We have revised our expectation on cost inputs. We originally had assumed about $300 million worth of cost inputs on commodities and transportation. We have raised that expectation now at about $350 million. As part of that, we now think we will see peak cost inputs in the second quarter versus the first quarter. That's primarily driven by resin. We have shifted out our expectations about 2 months as a result of Hurricane Ida in terms of when we'll see peak resin, so we'll see that in the second quarter.\n As a result of that, I would expect this to be our most difficult quarter from a cost input perspective. I would expect our margins to be in the mid-30s. And then I expect when we get to the back half of the year, based on the incremental actions we're taking, both on pricing and cost management, we'll see sequential improvements as we move through our Q3 and Q4. And we still expect to get to a point of gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter, and we still expect to be in the low 40s. \nPeter Grom: Okay. Great. So mid-30s that means that to get to the 300 to 400 basis points for the year, I mean, that would imply some pretty substantial gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter. Is that right? \nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, it would. Now keep in mind that this is based on the assumptions we have for the cost inputs. And as you know, that's been difficult to predict. Our assumptions are resin is one of the assumptions. We continue to assume we're going to see resin prices moderate in the back half of the year. When we talked back in August, we assume we'd see resin peak in this calendar year and then start to moderate. We still hold that same expectation. All we've done is push out that peak a couple of months this calendar year. And so that's an important assumption for us that resin prices start to go down in the back half of the year. But assuming it plays out like we expect, yes, we expect to see some material margin improvements in the back half of the year. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. \nStephen Robert Powers: Just -- maybe just an overarching question. I think you laid out pretty clearly a better expected start, good elasticities, more pricing on to come but at the same time, the higher cost that you're contending with across many lines of the P&L. So I guess just for my frame of reference, how do those net out? If your prior outlook was down the middle of your guide, are you now at all biased higher or lower? Or are we still kind of down the middle of your guide with the 1 quarter under your belt? \nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, Steve, maybe I'll give you a perspective on both sales and margin and profit. If I start with the top line, to your point, we did come in better than our expectations. We thought we were going to be down low double digits for Q1. You obviously saw our results are sort of more mid-single digits. Now some of that, we think, is timing, as Linda mentioned. If you look at our performance through the quarter and primarily as a result of Delta, we saw the business really pick up in the second half of the quarter, and that continued through September. So I think we'll see a little bit of that move between quarters now as there's a little bit of retail and consumer inventory that we worked through. But I don't think that will have any impact on the full year, but you'll see a little bit of timing shifts between quarters.\n For us, when we talked in August, we thought the front half would be down high single -- excuse me, low double digits to high single digits. We now think the front half will be down high single digits. So we expect a little bit better performance in the front half of the year on the top line.\n And what I'd say, Steve, is I just think it's a little too early to be making any changes to our outlook. We're pleased with the start to the year. We're still only 1 quarter into the year. As you know, there's quite a few things that are outside of our control that we want to see how they play out and they've been fairly volatile. And so I like the start. We've got a fairly wide range. I think that's appropriate on the top line for now. I want to get into cold and flu, see how that plays out and I want to see how the pandemic plays out before we make any changes.\n As it relates to margin and profit, we did come in a little bit better. But as you said, we see that there's a -- there's more cost headwinds than we initially anticipated, about $50 million. We are taking actions between incremental pricing actions as well as increased cost savings that we think we can offset that. And so that will delay the benefits a little bit to the back half of the year. But we still believe we're on track for both our outlook and our EPS range. And again, I think it's just too early to be guiding to higher low ends or changing those outlooks. \n I like the start of the year. I like our plans for the balance of the year. And I really like the things we can control. But I also recognize there's a number of areas we don't control, and I want to see how those play out over the next quarter or 2. \nStephen Robert Powers: Okay. Great. And I guess maybe a follow-up on just the resin outlook that you just mentioned earlier. I guess I was a little surprised to see you hold to continued expectation of resins and commodities moderating. I'm not saying it's wrong. I mean who knows. Just that it's less conservative than what we've seen from others so far.\n So I guess maybe can you -- I get 2 questions really to that. Can you give us a sense of the margin of profitability at risk if prices remain close to where they are today than what you're assuming? Is that -- can you stay within your range in that scenario? Is it pushing you to the bottom or below the bottom end of the range, that kind of thing?\n And then as I think about the step up -- the implied step up sequentially between margin and the gross margin in the mid-30s in 2Q and then presumably back up above 40 in 3Q, if my quick math is right, what are the drivers there? How much of that is resin moderating? How much of that is the pricing coming in? How much of that is the top line coming back stronger? Just give us a sense for how that step-up occurs sequentially. \nKevin Jacobsen: Sure, Steve. I'd say the profit risk, it's hard to tell exactly what's at risk based on resin because, again, we would take actions. If the resin forecast does not play out like we expect, then we revisit our pricing plans across our portfolio to offset some portion of that. And so it's difficult to put an exact number on if resin doesn't play out to our plan.\n What I would tell you, though, in terms of our resin forecast, as you can imagine, we leverage outside experts on this as well. And this is generally in line with what we're seeing from the outside experts. So it doesn't feel like it's an off-market expectation that we'll see resin prices moderate in the back half of the year. And then a sequential step-up, as you think about what's going to drive that sequential step up in the back half of the year. The first one is commodities. We think this is going to be the most challenging quarter we have from a commodity cost input. If you look at Q1, there's about 550 basis points of headwinds on commodities. I expect Q2 is going to be closer to 600 basis points as we pushed out the resin decline a couple of months. And then you'll see commodities start to drop in the back half of the year. So you'll see some pick up there.\n In addition to commodity, input costs starting to moderate. We'll start to see the full benefit of our pricing actions. It's really just in Q2, we're getting the bulk of our price increases in place. And as we talked about, we're pricing an additional 20% of our portfolio, that will be in the back half of the year. And you'll see the benefit of pricing start to step up. You also see the benefit of our cost savings program ramp up in the back half of the year. So that will create additional benefits. \n And then finally, on manufacturing and logistics. As I think you folks know, we've talked about this quite a bit. We're incurring quite a bit of additional cost as we build more resiliency into our supply chain. We've increased the number of third-party manufacturers we work with. That's true with raw and packaging material suppliers as well. As demand moderates and we'll be able to take more of that production back in-house, we'll be able to step out of these relationships. That will start in the back half of the year. Now that's probably a 12- to 18-month journey to step out these charges, but you'll start to see us do that in the back half of the year if demand moderates to the extent we expect it will. And those will be the key drivers that will support margin improvements in the back half of the year. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. \nFilippo Falorni: This is Filippo Falorni on for Nik. I want to go back to pricing. You mentioned, obviously, the 70% where you're taking pricing, and you mentioned in the release that elasticities have improved so far. Can you discuss what you're assuming in terms of demand elasticity once you're getting to the 70% of the portfolio with price increases, and also whether you're thinking that private label would also follow? Most of your branded competitors clearly are following on price increases, but also what about on the private label side, and what you're thinking about the price gap relative to private label. \nLinda Rendle: Sure. Yes. So as we spoke about and you mentioned we're taking pricing on 70% of the portfolio, and elasticities across our portfolio have improved in this period. And that gives us additional confidence in our ability to take price and, of course, what we believe will be the consumer reaction in that price increase. As you also mentioned, we are seeing branded competitors move, and we're generally seeing price gaps in our categories aligned to what they were before pricing action took place. So nothing seems to be out of line. And we're also seeing private label pass-through pricing at this point as well. And so price gaps as it relates to store brand are also maintaining.\n If we kind of just take a step back, it's one of the reasons why it's so important for us to continue to invest in our brands as we go through this period. That's why we continue to lean into advertising spending, why we've kept up on our innovation program. And that's really helping us as we sell through, one, support the consumer as they go through this pricing change but also support us from a retail execution standpoint because there are other ways that we can help grow the category in addition to pricing.\n So again, all on track. I would say elasticities will help us. But we've built that into the outlook that we've had. The assumed elasticities on that improvement is already built in, and we'll just continue to monitor it. But no surprises at this point in terms of category, other people following and what we're seeing from a price gap perspective. \nFilippo Falorni: Great. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up on -- you mentioned investing in the brands. And considering the difficult supply chain environment that you're facing and every consumer product company is facing, how do you balance the investment, particularly on the innovation front as well as kind of maintaining core supplies on your core products to make sure you have enough inventory levels and you're building inventory levels. If you can talk about managing both the innovation and the core brands, that would be helpful. \nLinda Rendle: Sure. I think first, getting to your point on supply, the good news is we're back in a position across our core brands and innovation that we can supply. So about 5% of our portfolio is on allocation at this point. So we're able to meet consumer demand across the vast majority of our portfolio. And that bodes well for getting distribution back on our core brands, which we purposely narrowed during that pandemic period, but we're beginning to expand that again, and that's going well.\n And really, when we think about advertising, we are an ROI-based advertiser. We  belong in the -- believe in the long term, and we believe in building brands, but we're also very carefully managing how we spend that dollar. So we know in the return we get on investing in innovation, the return that we get on investing in the base. And the team is always optimizing that over time. That has led to very strong ROI improvements on our advertising over time using that model. And even though we put significantly more money in and spent about 11% of sales last year, and we plan to spend 10% of sales this year, we've continued to see that ROI go up.\n And what we've really been focused on is getting much more out of our digital advertising. And as part of our IGNITE Strategy, we had talked about wanting to get to know about 100 million consumers in the U.S., and that allows us to further drive efficiencies in our digital spending and effectiveness. And that is well on its way. We are halfway to that goal and that has really helped us with the ROI.\n So again, it is really about thinking about the long term on the brands. We balance the spending within the brands based off of an ROI model, and we're always able to adjust as we learn more, but it is about building those brands over time and ensuring that we have superior value with consumers. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. \nChristopher Carey: I just -- I know it's been asked in different ways, but maybe just to tie it up. If the forward rates on resins don't play out and say current rates do, you're announcing expansion of pricing going into the market. Productivity sounds like a lever, and you have some other levers at your disposal as well. What's your preference or flexibility to offset the cost environment if it takes another step up? Or said another way, the forwards don't play out, can you expand pricing to more of the portfolio? Do you increase the rate of pricing? You noted that on a slide you're looking at doing just that. Maybe some perspective on -- should that environment not play out as you expect, what's the -- what are kind of the tools in your arsenal? \nLinda Rendle: Sure, Chris. Thanks for the question. I think as Kevin highlighted, we do have an increased expectation on the cost environment, and then we've taken the appropriate actions through pricing and cost reductions to deal with that. And that's exactly what we would do is we would see that resin curve continue to be pushed out. We would evaluate both the rates and the degree of pricing across the portfolio. And frankly, we have all of that ready now. We've been evaluating that and would be ready to go if additional increases were warranted.\n We'd, of course, want to balance that to ensure that we don't get out of whack with price gaps and to ensure that we continue to support our innovation, et cetera. And then, of course, we're always looking for ways to reduce costs, and we would continue to put focus there through everything that we possibly can do. So know that, that's what we are thinking about. We have contingency plans in the event that, that happens, but we'll be balancing all of that if we were to have to take additional actions at that curve were to be pushed out further. \nChristopher Carey: Okay. Okay, got it. And then if I could just -- one more on -- I think you kind of mentioned this a number of times that you're taking a balanced approach to the top line. It sounds like you think you have some flexibility there, specifically to the back half, but a lot can play out. But I guess if I'm thinking about this, your mix is improving. You're not seeing a lot of volume elasticity. If anything, it sounds like you feel pretty good about volumes. Pricing is going to be building into the back half of the year. And I guess if you put all that together, why would you expect to only be at the low end of your long-term target? I guess is question one.\n And then secondly, does that have to do with timing of when the pricing comes into the market? Maybe it's more Q4 weighted. So just any perspective around that? And if it's just ever early, then I suppose that's reasonable. But I just want to make sure I'm not missing something there. \nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, Chris, I would say on our sales outlook for the year, the minus 2% to minus 6%, we think that's a balanced view where we sit today. And you mentioned it, it is still very early in the year. We're only 1 quarter in. And keep in mind, the 2 biggest items that can impact our results that are outside of our control are both how cold and flu season plays out as well as how the pandemic plays out. And so I think it's much too early to start changing our outlook.\n As we said, we're pleased with the start to the year relative to our expectations. But we also know there's a number of items that we don't directly control that will impact our results. And so we'd like to get another quarter or so into the year and see how those are playing out. And then we'll truly come back and update you if we have a different perspective. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. \nJason English: A couple of quick questions. So back to the expectation of commodity released in the second half of the year, I think I also heard Linda mentioned that you guys plan to kind of enact more price increases in the back half of the year. So my question is, what's the risk that retailers begin to push back? If you kind of hold out and wait to push the next round through until commodities are actually already rescinding, isn't there a higher risk that they won't actually be enacted, utilities are going to push back? \nLisah Burhan: Jason, so when we're talking about back half increases, many of which go into discussions at the beginning of our back half. We're continuing to see that cost environment ramp up. And I don't think anybody is thinking that this is going to abate or to be to a place where people are starting to think about we're in a full recovery. So I don't anticipate the back half being an issue. I think retailers will appreciate the fact that we're taking a very disciplined approach to this, and continue to partner with them to ensure that we're doing the right things for the categories. And I wouldn't anticipate there being a different environment in the back half given what we're seeing from a cost perspective.\n Of course, we're being very thoughtful about that. We're building that into the consideration as we plan when we will announce pricing. But we are doing that knowing full well how our categories behave, consumer trends, key merchandising periods, et cetera. And I would say, given the fact that we continue to invest, and we're bringing retailers really strong innovation plans, they have still been a mode of partnership and continuing to build plans with us to build the categories. \nJason English: Got it. That makes sense. And you mentioned the -- I guess, 2 more questions kind of drilling in on gross margin. First, the manufacturing expenses you referred to sort of the unusual ones that you thought would fall away over time. Can you give us any quantification of how big that is?\n And then secondly, in terms of cost savings, it's only 1 quarter, but it was a pretty small quarter in terms of cost savings contribution. What are you expecting for the full year on that line? \nKevin Jacobsen: Yes. Jason, on cost savings, I'd expect cost savings to probably be more robust than we've seen in previous years. As you know, we're leaning into that as one way to help us address the cost environment. It was a little bit lower in Q1. I expect that to ramp up as we move through the year. So you should expect to see greater value as we go through the year and execute some of the additional cost savings actions we're pursuing.\n On the manufacturing up charges, we haven't broken that out specifically. But I can tell you there's a reasonable amount of money that we're incurring as we're leveraging third-party manufacturers and suppliers. I think I've mentioned to you in the past, historically, we have self-manufactured about 80% of our shipments, and we go to contract manufacturers for the remaining 20%. During this pandemic, that mix is more 50-50 right now. So we're relying on contract manufacturers to a much better degree to help us keep up with demand. As demand moderates, we'll be able to pull that back into our facilities and unwind some of these agreements we have in place. And there are some nice savings associated with that. And so you'll see that play out through our P&L.\n As I mentioned, we'll have to see how demand plays out with the pandemic. I believe, certainly over the -- starting in the back half of this year and over the next 12 to maybe 24 months, we'll be able to step out of those charges. But we'll get started, I think, in the back half doing that. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. \nKaumil Gajrawala: I'm glad, I'm next. I want to follow up on, Kevin, on your answer to Jason on producing a larger percentage of your portfolio. Can you maybe talk about how we should be thinking about what the spread is in terms of the margins of self-manufactured versus third party? And then how long should we be thinking about or -- what's the timing in being able to get back to that 80% range? \nKevin Jacobsen: Yes. Thanks for the question. I'd tell you it's interesting. It goes beyond just what you'd call the co-pack profit margin, which could be up from 10% to 20% depending on the co-packer. We've had to extend our supply chain not just through contract manufacturers, but we've done that through raw and packaging material suppliers. It's becoming a much more global supply chain to build in the resiliency we need to manage through the disruptions of this environment. So not only do you have the profit margin or the profit up charge from these folks, but you've got an extended supply chain, which means increased transportation as well as we have to bring product in from further distances.\n You also have increased warehousing because we're holding more inventory on hand to manage through the disruption. So there is a level of cost that's built up in our supply chain. This part of the resiliency we've built in to ensure that we can supply product we will work, I suspect, over the next 12 to 24 months to be able to pull those costs out of our system. Now a lot of that will be driven on how the demand plays out. We assume demand will moderate. Keep in mind, our demand was plus 20% during the pandemic. We think long term is 3% to 5%. As that demand moderates, we'll be able to start pulling costs out of our supply chain, and that will happen over time.\n I'll just -- I'll give you one example of how this played out, and this has happened last quarter. When we had Hurricane Ida, our largest resin provider in the Gulf region went offline for about 2 months and declared a force majeure. But because of the great work our product supply team did, we had increased resin inventory on hand. We had alternative suppliers qualified, and we did not miss a beat from a production perspective. And we were able to keep shipping product to our customers in spite of our largest provider going offline for the better part of the quarter. We've had to do that across our entire portfolio, and we recognize that comes with a cost, and that's the cost we're going to be able to go after, which is another reason that gives us confidence we can rebuild margins over time beyond the commodity environment improving. We know we can step out of these charges. And as I said, I think that's a year or 2 process for us to do that. \nKaumil Gajrawala: Okay. Got it. And if I could just ask about mix. You were pretty clear in your comments and in the release that now you have value packs, multi-packs, all these things are kind of coming back. In your kind of 2 to 6, have you provided how much of the drag mix will be over the course of the full year? \nKevin Jacobsen: Yes. In terms of the course of the full year on the top line, as I said, we had about a 3- to 4-point benefit from price mix due to this temporary benefit of less merchandising activity and a lower level of assortment we were offering. That will be reversed out. And so I'd expect 3 to 4 points of unfavorable price mix. It started in Q4. It continued in Q1, expected for 2 more quarters. By the fourth quarter, we've lapped it. And we've also got the benefit of pricing. So I'd expect favorable price mix by the time we get to the fourth quarter. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. \nLauren Lieberman: A couple of questions. So first thing I wanted to ask about was cash flow. You've called it out in the release, and it was $48 million quite low this quarter. There was a mention of higher inventory, but it still seems pretty dramatic. So I'd just love a little bit more color on that, if possible. \nKevin Jacobsen: Sure, Lauren. You're exactly right. In terms of cash flow, we delivered $41 million. It was down 89%. Typically, if you look at the cash we generate, it's fairly consistent across the quarters. A little bit of a dip in Q2 because of some seasonality in our Kingsford business. But historically, we generate our cash pretty consistently across the quarters. It's going to look very different this year. In the front half, it's going to be depressed because of the reduction in net earnings. Keep in mind, we're lapping about 50%, 60% growth in net earnings last year. So earnings are down more materially in the front half of the year. That will reduce the cash we generate. And then I expect that to pick up pretty significantly in the back half of the year. \n In total, before the pandemic, we were generating somewhere between $900 million and $1 billion of cash on an annual basis. I think we'll be a little bit lower this year, expected to be in the $850 million to $950 million range primarily driven because the increased costs will depress our earnings a bit this year. And so it will be a little bit below our normal run rate in terms of cash we generate, and then I expect that to rebound as we move into fiscal year '23. \nLauren Lieberman: Okay. Great. And it was just -- the other thing with that is the cash flow this quarter, though, was a lot lower than it was in a normal pre-COVID first quarter. So that wasn't the reason I was asking the question beyond the earnings decline. Is there anything else just, again, because we don't have the visibility yet into the cash flow statement that's worth calling out in terms of this quarter in particular a sequential performance that we should be thinking about? \nKevin Jacobsen: Yes. I would I'd probably note 2 items. There was some timing on receivables and payables. And one example, I mentioned earlier, we saw a really strong performance later in the quarter as a result of the Delta variant. We had a pretty strong month of September. And what that means is our AR balance was higher than we had anticipated. That's just timing related. We've already collected those receivables by now. But just based on the cutoff, we carried some extra AR going into the end of the quarter.\n And then inventory levels, as I've talked about, we have raised inventory levels as part of the work we're doing to ensure supply. And so those will be elevated for a while, and we'll start working that down over time. \nLauren Lieberman: Okay. Great. And then on the timing elements that you had just called out because -- on particular categories, just anything that might be worth noting. I don't typically think of your categories as ones that see a lot of retailer inventory build ahead of a price increase. So I'm assuming this is just more about, I guess, retailer concerns about the degree of which Delta was going to persist and your expectations that works through. So sequentially, we should be thinking about sales decelerating. I mean your full year guidance is very clear. I just wanted to get a sense for the 1Q, 2Q dynamic. \nKevin Jacobsen: Sure. Lauren, as it relates to Q1, Q2 on sales, as you recall, last quarter, we thought we'd be down low single digits in Q1 and then low -- excuse me, low double digits in Q1 and then high single digits. We've improved our front half forecast. We now think the whole front half will be down high single digits. That's a little bit better than what we thought back in August. There's just a little bit of timing that will probably move between quarters. As I said, we probably got a little bit of extra retail inventory, a little bit of extra consumer inventory based on the timing of the shipments. I think that will play out between the quarters. And we continue to expect the front half of the year to be down high single digits. And so I think it will look that much different than what we saw in Q1. \nLauren Lieberman: Okay. Great. And then just one more question to -- I know everyone's been asking about resin and gross margin. But I was just curious, you hadn't mentioned chlorine. I think it was asked about earlier in a question, but I think there's been a pretty sizable move in chlorine since August. And just any other color on labor and logistics and how you're thinking about that into your forecast with things improving in the back half of your year. \nKevin Jacobsen: Sure. As it relates to commodities, as you know, back in August, we knew this is going to be a tough year, and we had anticipated about $300 million worth of cost increases, which is pretty significant for us. In a typical year, we might see $50 million, maybe $60 million of cost increases. So we knew there's going to be a tough year on substrate, on soybean oil, on resin, and that was baked into our outlook back in August.\n What has changed for us based on our initial assumption is really resin has gotten worse. We think the peak resin price will push out, as we said, a couple of months. But by and large, we think we have gotten the commodity environment mostly right. Resin is the only one we're updating. And then transportation is the other one. I had assumed that we'd start to see transportation rates come down in the back half of the year. And what we think now is this imbalance in supply and demand we're seeing in that market is going to continue for all of fiscal year '22. And so that's the other change we're making. And those are really the 2 changes versus what we talked about in August. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. \nKevin Grundy: A couple of clean-up questions for me on pricing because I know we've covered a lot of ground at this point. So you indicated intentions to price on 70% of the portfolio. I think that's clear. And I apologize if I missed this. Can you just comment on the remaining 30% where, at the moment, you currently do not intend to take price just given the pressure on gross margin? It would certainly seem like across the board, there's a cost justification for that. Perhaps you can just comment on it.\n And then on the elasticity, the second question, Linda, your elasticities have been better than expected. This is broadly held true across the CPG and it sounds like you expect that improvement to hold. Maybe just spend a moment on that. Talk about that a bit and why you do not expect to see any sort of mean reversion to historical elasticities. \nLinda Rendle: Sure. I'll start on the pricing question, Kevin. So on the 30% we're choosing to not price at the moment, we're evaluating category by category, what the cost increases are. We're looking at commodity and cost justification. And there are some of our categories that have not been as impacted that are not as driven by resin and certainly might be impacted by transportation but to a lesser degree, and there's other choices that we can make. And as we've talked about, we're taking a look across the entire P&L to see where we can reduce costs. And so nobody is excluded from that. None of the businesses are excluded from that.\n But as it relates to pricing, we're really looking at it category by category, looking at the cost impact and what we think will happen from a consumer standpoint and making that choice. That doesn't mean, though, of course, as we continue to navigate throughout the year, if we were to have additional pressures that we wouldn't consider pricing that additional 30%. But at this point, we think it's the best mix not to.\n And then elasticities, I think it is true that consumers have turned to branded solutions during this pandemic. They want trusted solutions, and they certainly turned to our portfolio. And we've spoken about the numerous ways our portfolio has gotten stronger during this time, whether that be household penetration. Again, stronger retention in buy rates, higher repeat rates. And what we deem as the best consumer value we've seen since measuring it with 70% of our portfolio deemed superior by consumers. That has translated into stronger elasticities.\n That doesn't mean though there is an elasticity impact, and I just want to make sure that's clear. They've improved, but we certainly do expect a volume impact to taking pricing. It's just with a lesser degree that we would have seen prepandemic. And we're watching that closely. And the reason, again, that we continue to invest to keep those elasticities holding as people move through. \n And just the one caveat I would continue to warn. Consumer behavior has been very difficult to predict during this pandemic. All the fundamentals look good right now, but we'll continue to see, as Kevin has articulated what happens in cold and flu, what happens through the course of the remainder of the pandemic. But at this point, we feel very confident that our brands are strong. We can take this pricing, and if that's -- those lower elasticities will hold. \nKevin Grundy: Got it. And just a quick clarification. Do you care to comment on which categories you do not -- at this point in time, I'm looking at the Nielsen data, and it would certainly not appear to be the case in salad dressing or charcoal. Are those the 2 categories primarily at this point? Or you do not care to comment? \nLinda Rendle: No comment yet, Kevin. I hope you can understand we're working through this live right now. And so as we have all of these price increases implemented, then we can talk more about the details of the categories. But I would just say, as you watch the data, I know that pricing will be rolling through this quarter and in the back half as well. And so you'll be seeing that flow through across a number of our categories coming up here quickly. \nOperator: Next question is from the line of Linda Bolton-Weiser with D.A. Davidson. \nLinda Bolton-Weiser: Yes. The international business performed a little bit better than we expected on the sales line. Can you talk about whether you think the international markets are still experiencing some benefit from the pandemic or not? \nLinda Rendle: Yes. The international, if you look at the 2-year stack for that business, this quarter was up 19%, so it continues to perform very well. I mean we saw a double-digit growth in a number of our businesses, including our wipes business, Burt's Bees, Cat Litter, and mid-single-digit growth in another of our large businesses, including Glad and Brita. So I feel, overall, very good about international.\n Depending on the market, we're seeing significant pricing pass-through in some of markets which -- so we're taking double-digit pricing in places in international, and that's gone well to date. But we're really leaning into those growth levers we have in international. I would say depending on the market is -- to the degree which the pandemic is impacting that, and you can appreciate, given we compete in over 100 markets, it's very different by market. But generally, we're seeing cleaning behaviors continue to persist across the globe where people are cleaning more and more concerned about their health and wellness. And we're taking advantage of that across our portfolio to deliver innovation, to continuing to invest in our brands and expand our distribution. \n So I think to your point, international did perform well. We do have some tough comps coming up here again in Q2. But we have strong plans, and our brands are growing share in the markets that we compete in. \nLinda Bolton-Weiser: And can I just ask one more about -- I know there were a couple of questions about the cadence of sales for first quarter and second quarter. And I'm not sure I'm understanding why you would expect overall sales decline to get bigger in the second quarter. The POS data actually seems to indicate only a modest decline in October, what we're seeing in the data. So can you just give one more -- say one more time why you expect the sales decline to be bigger in the second quarter. \nKevin Jacobsen: Linda, what I'd say on the second quarter compared to the first quarter, a few things for you to think about. As we've said, we think our sales will be down high single digits in the front half of the year. So hopefully, that helps you think about the second quarter. We're lapping 27% growth again in Q2, which is what we had to lap in Q1. And also, as we mentioned, we think there's a little bit of shift of timing between Q1 and Q2. So we had very strong shipments late in Q1. We think some of that's created some additional inventory with both retailers and consumers that get worked out in the second quarter.\n So I think when you consider all those items, you get to down high single digits in the front half which will put a little bit more pressure on Q2 as you have some shifting between quarters. \nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. Ms.  Rendle, I will now like to turn the program back to you. \nLinda Rendle: Thanks, Michelle. Thanks again, everyone. I look forward to speaking to you again on our next call in February. Until then, please stay well. \nOperator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kevin Jacobsen",
            "content": "And Andrea -- no, please go ahead. And then, Andrea, you had asked a question about price mix, and maybe just a little background and I talked about this in August. We benefited from about 3 to 4 points of favorable price mix through the pandemic, and we know that was temporary primarily driven by the rationalization of our product offerings. If you recall, to increase supply availability, we produced a lot less products. They tend to be smaller single accounts. And additionally, because of lack of merchandising activity because of the lack of supply, we were generating favorable price mix for about 4 straight quarters, pretty consistently about 3- to 4-point capability.\n We fully expect that to unwind as we get back to a more normalized level of supply and we get back to a more normalized level of promotional activity. That started in the fourth quarter. We had about 2 points of unfavorable price mix. It continued this quarter. We had 3 points of unfavorable price mix. I'd expect to see that for 2 more quarters. So we'll see it in the second quarter, third quarter. And then by the fourth quarter, I would expect to have lapped this temporary benefit. And you also see the full benefit of the pricing actions we're taking. So by the fourth quarter, I'd expect us to return to favorable price mix. \n And as you probably saw in our prepared remarks. We continue to expect by the back half of the year, we're going to get our sales back into the low end of our long-term sales goal, 3% to 5%. Part of that will be driven by the fact that we'll start generating positive price mix as well in the back half of the year. Sure. Thanks, Peter, for the question. And let me give you my perspective on how we see margin phasing out this year. As you recall, back in August, our expectation was that Q1 was going to be our most difficult quarter from a cost input perspective. And then we see sequential improvement in margin throughout the year. And importantly, by the fourth quarter, returning to gross margin expansion, and we identify getting back in the low 40s.\n What has changed since that time are 2 things, and Linda mentioned them. We have revised our expectation on cost inputs. We originally had assumed about $300 million worth of cost inputs on commodities and transportation. We have raised that expectation now at about $350 million. As part of that, we now think we will see peak cost inputs in the second quarter versus the first quarter. That's primarily driven by resin. We have shifted out our expectations about 2 months as a result of Hurricane Ida in terms of when we'll see peak resin, so we'll see that in the second quarter.\n As a result of that, I would expect this to be our most difficult quarter from a cost input perspective. I would expect our margins to be in the mid-30s. And then I expect when we get to the back half of the year, based on the incremental actions we're taking, both on pricing and cost management, we'll see sequential improvements as we move through our Q3 and Q4. And we still expect to get to a point of gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter, and we still expect to be in the low 40s. Yes, it would. Now keep in mind that this is based on the assumptions we have for the cost inputs. And as you know, that's been difficult to predict. Our assumptions are resin is one of the assumptions. We continue to assume we're going to see resin prices moderate in the back half of the year. When we talked back in August, we assume we'd see resin peak in this calendar year and then start to moderate. We still hold that same expectation. All we've done is push out that peak a couple of months this calendar year. And so that's an important assumption for us that resin prices start to go down in the back half of the year. But assuming it plays out like we expect, yes, we expect to see some material margin improvements in the back half of the year. Yes, Steve, maybe I'll give you a perspective on both sales and margin and profit. If I start with the top line, to your point, we did come in better than our expectations. We thought we were going to be down low double digits for Q1. You obviously saw our results are sort of more mid-single digits. Now some of that, we think, is timing, as Linda mentioned. If you look at our performance through the quarter and primarily as a result of Delta, we saw the business really pick up in the second half of the quarter, and that continued through September. So I think we'll see a little bit of that move between quarters now as there's a little bit of retail and consumer inventory that we worked through. But I don't think that will have any impact on the full year, but you'll see a little bit of timing shifts between quarters.\n For us, when we talked in August, we thought the front half would be down high single -- excuse me, low double digits to high single digits. We now think the front half will be down high single digits. So we expect a little bit better performance in the front half of the year on the top line.\n And what I'd say, Steve, is I just think it's a little too early to be making any changes to our outlook. We're pleased with the start to the year. We're still only 1 quarter into the year. As you know, there's quite a few things that are outside of our control that we want to see how they play out and they've been fairly volatile. And so I like the start. We've got a fairly wide range. I think that's appropriate on the top line for now. I want to get into cold and flu, see how that plays out and I want to see how the pandemic plays out before we make any changes.\n As it relates to margin and profit, we did come in a little bit better. But as you said, we see that there's a -- there's more cost headwinds than we initially anticipated, about $50 million. We are taking actions between incremental pricing actions as well as increased cost savings that we think we can offset that. And so that will delay the benefits a little bit to the back half of the year. But we still believe we're on track for both our outlook and our EPS range. And again, I think it's just too early to be guiding to higher low ends or changing those outlooks. \n I like the start of the year. I like our plans for the balance of the year. And I really like the things we can control. But I also recognize there's a number of areas we don't control, and I want to see how those play out over the next quarter or 2. Sure, Steve. I'd say the profit risk, it's hard to tell exactly what's at risk based on resin because, again, we would take actions. If the resin forecast does not play out like we expect, then we revisit our pricing plans across our portfolio to offset some portion of that. And so it's difficult to put an exact number on if resin doesn't play out to our plan.\n What I would tell you, though, in terms of our resin forecast, as you can imagine, we leverage outside experts on this as well. And this is generally in line with what we're seeing from the outside experts. So it doesn't feel like it's an off-market expectation that we'll see resin prices moderate in the back half of the year. And then a sequential step-up, as you think about what's going to drive that sequential step up in the back half of the year. The first one is commodities. We think this is going to be the most challenging quarter we have from a commodity cost input. If you look at Q1, there's about 550 basis points of headwinds on commodities. I expect Q2 is going to be closer to 600 basis points as we pushed out the resin decline a couple of months. And then you'll see commodities start to drop in the back half of the year. So you'll see some pick up there.\n In addition to commodity, input costs starting to moderate. We'll start to see the full benefit of our pricing actions. It's really just in Q2, we're getting the bulk of our price increases in place. And as we talked about, we're pricing an additional 20% of our portfolio, that will be in the back half of the year. And you'll see the benefit of pricing start to step up. You also see the benefit of our cost savings program ramp up in the back half of the year. So that will create additional benefits. \n And then finally, on manufacturing and logistics. As I think you folks know, we've talked about this quite a bit. We're incurring quite a bit of additional cost as we build more resiliency into our supply chain. We've increased the number of third-party manufacturers we work with. That's true with raw and packaging material suppliers as well. As demand moderates and we'll be able to take more of that production back in-house, we'll be able to step out of these relationships. That will start in the back half of the year. Now that's probably a 12- to 18-month journey to step out these charges, but you'll start to see us do that in the back half of the year if demand moderates to the extent we expect it will. And those will be the key drivers that will support margin improvements in the back half of the year. Yes, Chris, I would say on our sales outlook for the year, the minus 2% to minus 6%, we think that's a balanced view where we sit today. And you mentioned it, it is still very early in the year. We're only 1 quarter in. And keep in mind, the 2 biggest items that can impact our results that are outside of our control are both how cold and flu season plays out as well as how the pandemic plays out. And so I think it's much too early to start changing our outlook.\n As we said, we're pleased with the start to the year relative to our expectations. But we also know there's a number of items that we don't directly control that will impact our results. And so we'd like to get another quarter or so into the year and see how those are playing out. And then we'll truly come back and update you if we have a different perspective. Yes. Jason, on cost savings, I'd expect cost savings to probably be more robust than we've seen in previous years. As you know, we're leaning into that as one way to help us address the cost environment. It was a little bit lower in Q1. I expect that to ramp up as we move through the year. So you should expect to see greater value as we go through the year and execute some of the additional cost savings actions we're pursuing.\n On the manufacturing up charges, we haven't broken that out specifically. But I can tell you there's a reasonable amount of money that we're incurring as we're leveraging third-party manufacturers and suppliers. I think I've mentioned to you in the past, historically, we have self-manufactured about 80% of our shipments, and we go to contract manufacturers for the remaining 20%. During this pandemic, that mix is more 50-50 right now. So we're relying on contract manufacturers to a much better degree to help us keep up with demand. As demand moderates, we'll be able to pull that back into our facilities and unwind some of these agreements we have in place. And there are some nice savings associated with that. And so you'll see that play out through our P&L.\n As I mentioned, we'll have to see how demand plays out with the pandemic. I believe, certainly over the -- starting in the back half of this year and over the next 12 to maybe 24 months, we'll be able to step out of those charges. But we'll get started, I think, in the back half doing that. Yes. Thanks for the question. I'd tell you it's interesting. It goes beyond just what you'd call the co-pack profit margin, which could be up from 10% to 20% depending on the co-packer. We've had to extend our supply chain not just through contract manufacturers, but we've done that through raw and packaging material suppliers. It's becoming a much more global supply chain to build in the resiliency we need to manage through the disruptions of this environment. So not only do you have the profit margin or the profit up charge from these folks, but you've got an extended supply chain, which means increased transportation as well as we have to bring product in from further distances.\n You also have increased warehousing because we're holding more inventory on hand to manage through the disruption. So there is a level of cost that's built up in our supply chain. This part of the resiliency we've built in to ensure that we can supply product we will work, I suspect, over the next 12 to 24 months to be able to pull those costs out of our system. Now a lot of that will be driven on how the demand plays out. We assume demand will moderate. Keep in mind, our demand was plus 20% during the pandemic. We think long term is 3% to 5%. As that demand moderates, we'll be able to start pulling costs out of our supply chain, and that will happen over time.\n I'll just -- I'll give you one example of how this played out, and this has happened last quarter. When we had Hurricane Ida, our largest resin provider in the Gulf region went offline for about 2 months and declared a force majeure. But because of the great work our product supply team did, we had increased resin inventory on hand. We had alternative suppliers qualified, and we did not miss a beat from a production perspective. And we were able to keep shipping product to our customers in spite of our largest provider going offline for the better part of the quarter. We've had to do that across our entire portfolio, and we recognize that comes with a cost, and that's the cost we're going to be able to go after, which is another reason that gives us confidence we can rebuild margins over time beyond the commodity environment improving. We know we can step out of these charges. And as I said, I think that's a year or 2 process for us to do that. Yes. In terms of the course of the full year on the top line, as I said, we had about a 3- to 4-point benefit from price mix due to this temporary benefit of less merchandising activity and a lower level of assortment we were offering. That will be reversed out. And so I'd expect 3 to 4 points of unfavorable price mix. It started in Q4. It continued in Q1, expected for 2 more quarters. By the fourth quarter, we've lapped it. And we've also got the benefit of pricing. So I'd expect favorable price mix by the time we get to the fourth quarter. Sure, Lauren. You're exactly right. In terms of cash flow, we delivered $41 million. It was down 89%. Typically, if you look at the cash we generate, it's fairly consistent across the quarters. A little bit of a dip in Q2 because of some seasonality in our Kingsford business. But historically, we generate our cash pretty consistently across the quarters. It's going to look very different this year. In the front half, it's going to be depressed because of the reduction in net earnings. Keep in mind, we're lapping about 50%, 60% growth in net earnings last year. So earnings are down more materially in the front half of the year. That will reduce the cash we generate. And then I expect that to pick up pretty significantly in the back half of the year. \n In total, before the pandemic, we were generating somewhere between $900 million and $1 billion of cash on an annual basis. I think we'll be a little bit lower this year, expected to be in the $850 million to $950 million range primarily driven because the increased costs will depress our earnings a bit this year. And so it will be a little bit below our normal run rate in terms of cash we generate, and then I expect that to rebound as we move into fiscal year '23. Yes. I would I'd probably note 2 items. There was some timing on receivables and payables. And one example, I mentioned earlier, we saw a really strong performance later in the quarter as a result of the Delta variant. We had a pretty strong month of September. And what that means is our AR balance was higher than we had anticipated. That's just timing related. We've already collected those receivables by now. But just based on the cutoff, we carried some extra AR going into the end of the quarter.\n And then inventory levels, as I've talked about, we have raised inventory levels as part of the work we're doing to ensure supply. And so those will be elevated for a while, and we'll start working that down over time. Sure. Lauren, as it relates to Q1, Q2 on sales, as you recall, last quarter, we thought we'd be down low single digits in Q1 and then low -- excuse me, low double digits in Q1 and then high single digits. We've improved our front half forecast. We now think the whole front half will be down high single digits. That's a little bit better than what we thought back in August. There's just a little bit of timing that will probably move between quarters. As I said, we probably got a little bit of extra retail inventory, a little bit of extra consumer inventory based on the timing of the shipments. I think that will play out between the quarters. And we continue to expect the front half of the year to be down high single digits. And so I think it will look that much different than what we saw in Q1. Sure. As it relates to commodities, as you know, back in August, we knew this is going to be a tough year, and we had anticipated about $300 million worth of cost increases, which is pretty significant for us. In a typical year, we might see $50 million, maybe $60 million of cost increases. So we knew there's going to be a tough year on substrate, on soybean oil, on resin, and that was baked into our outlook back in August.\n What has changed for us based on our initial assumption is really resin has gotten worse. We think the peak resin price will push out, as we said, a couple of months. But by and large, we think we have gotten the commodity environment mostly right. Resin is the only one we're updating. And then transportation is the other one. I had assumed that we'd start to see transportation rates come down in the back half of the year. And what we think now is this imbalance in supply and demand we're seeing in that market is going to continue for all of fiscal year '22. And so that's the other change we're making. And those are really the 2 changes versus what we talked about in August. Linda, what I'd say on the second quarter compared to the first quarter, a few things for you to think about. As we've said, we think our sales will be down high single digits in the front half of the year. So hopefully, that helps you think about the second quarter. We're lapping 27% growth again in Q2, which is what we had to lap in Q1. And also, as we mentioned, we think there's a little bit of shift of timing between Q1 and Q2. So we had very strong shipments late in Q1. We think some of that's created some additional inventory with both retailers and consumers that get worked out in the second quarter.\n So I think when you consider all those items, you get to down high single digits in the front half which will put a little bit more pressure on Q2 as you have some shifting between quarters."

            "name": "Linda Rendle",
            "content": "Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I hope you and your families are well. Hopefully, you found our prepared remarks and this new earnings format helpful. \n We're off to a solid start to fiscal 2022 with stronger-than-anticipated demand across our portfolio and focused execution in a challenging operating environment. We've made meaningful progress on our strategic priorities this quarter, including restoring supply across much of our portfolio, which has enabled us to hold or gain market share in the vast majority of our businesses. We are proactively addressing the inflationary and cost headwinds that are impacting our margins through pricing and cost reduction initiatives. And at the same time, we're making important investments in our business to strengthen our competitive advantages and position the company for long-term success, including advancing our innovation pipeline, deploying our targeted advertising and sales promotion strategy and investing in critical digital capabilities.\n Given our Q1 performance and the actions we are taking, we are reiterating our fiscal '22 outlook. \n With that, Kevin and I would like to open the line for questions. Okay. I'll start with the demand piece, and I'll get into pricing and Kevin can talk about mix. So on the demand side, as we articulated back in Q4, we definitely expected it to be bumpy this year as it came to consumer behavior, et cetera. But the good news is this quarter, given our strong position on supply, what we saw as a very successful return to merchandising with our back-to-school program and, of course, Delta impacts, demand was stronger than we anticipated across the vast majority of our portfolio. So that wasn't just in our cleaning businesses, but really across the board.\n We generally saw consumer mobility continue to be strong. So we haven't seen as big of an impact as people were in shelter in place before. Delta really didn't have that same impact and yet we did continue to see strong demand as people chose to stay at home more, are self continuing to work from home and are continuing to prioritize health and wellness habits, whether that be cleaning and disinfecting, taking vitamins, minerals and supplements, drinking water. We did see a little bit, Andrea, of timing shifts from Q2 when it comes to merch and a little bit of inventory, but that wasn't the majority of what we saw from an improvement perspective, it really was based consumer demand.\n I'll switch to pricing now. As we spoke about in the release, we have announced pricing on 50% of our portfolio. That sell-in continues to go well, and we're seeing execution hit market now in many of the businesses. Given the incremental costs that we're experiencing, we're taking additional action and now pricing a total of 70% of the portfolio this year. And we are beginning to implement many of those as we speak with additional actions that we're taking in the back half to be talked about at that time.\n And I would say, generally, given the environment that we're experiencing across the industry, the conversations are very productive. People understand the environment and largely our peers are going as well for our categories are increasing in pricing. But no surprises. Our brands are really strong. At this point, we have the strongest consumer value score that we've ever had since we began measuring it. Our household penetration continues to look strong. Increased repeat rates, increased buy rates. So our brands are healthy. Shares are growing as a result of that, and we feel really well positioned to execute pricing on 70% of the portfolio this year. 70% of the portfolio is going to encompass a broad range, but it is in relation to 3 things that we're really seeing pressure on. Commodities is one and certainly additional pressure on resin. Hurricane Ida pushed out the resin curve by a month or 2, and so we're seeing a continued impact there. Transportation continues to be a negative driver for us, and we're seeing that continue throughout the remainder of the fiscal year.\n And although there hasn't been a big material impact directly, we're looking at labor closely given what we're seeing on pressures there. So we're taking all of that into account. We have not announced since you asked the question directly, an additional price increase on Glad. We've executed high single digits at this point, but we are evaluating an additional price increase on Glad given what we're seeing in resin. And that's been -- we long follow what happens in resin and are able to move pretty quickly on Glad. And that's something that we're contemplating as another price increase on Glad, in addition to what I talked about in the 70%. Sure. Yes. So as we spoke about and you mentioned we're taking pricing on 70% of the portfolio, and elasticities across our portfolio have improved in this period. And that gives us additional confidence in our ability to take price and, of course, what we believe will be the consumer reaction in that price increase. As you also mentioned, we are seeing branded competitors move, and we're generally seeing price gaps in our categories aligned to what they were before pricing action took place. So nothing seems to be out of line. And we're also seeing private label pass-through pricing at this point as well. And so price gaps as it relates to store brand are also maintaining.\n If we kind of just take a step back, it's one of the reasons why it's so important for us to continue to invest in our brands as we go through this period. That's why we continue to lean into advertising spending, why we've kept up on our innovation program. And that's really helping us as we sell through, one, support the consumer as they go through this pricing change but also support us from a retail execution standpoint because there are other ways that we can help grow the category in addition to pricing.\n So again, all on track. I would say elasticities will help us. But we've built that into the outlook that we've had. The assumed elasticities on that improvement is already built in, and we'll just continue to monitor it. But no surprises at this point in terms of category, other people following and what we're seeing from a price gap perspective. Sure. I think first, getting to your point on supply, the good news is we're back in a position across our core brands and innovation that we can supply. So about 5% of our portfolio is on allocation at this point. So we're able to meet consumer demand across the vast majority of our portfolio. And that bodes well for getting distribution back on our core brands, which we purposely narrowed during that pandemic period, but we're beginning to expand that again, and that's going well.\n And really, when we think about advertising, we are an ROI-based advertiser. We  belong in the -- believe in the long term, and we believe in building brands, but we're also very carefully managing how we spend that dollar. So we know in the return we get on investing in innovation, the return that we get on investing in the base. And the team is always optimizing that over time. That has led to very strong ROI improvements on our advertising over time using that model. And even though we put significantly more money in and spent about 11% of sales last year, and we plan to spend 10% of sales this year, we've continued to see that ROI go up.\n And what we've really been focused on is getting much more out of our digital advertising. And as part of our IGNITE Strategy, we had talked about wanting to get to know about 100 million consumers in the U.S., and that allows us to further drive efficiencies in our digital spending and effectiveness. And that is well on its way. We are halfway to that goal and that has really helped us with the ROI.\n So again, it is really about thinking about the long term on the brands. We balance the spending within the brands based off of an ROI model, and we're always able to adjust as we learn more, but it is about building those brands over time and ensuring that we have superior value with consumers. Sure, Chris. Thanks for the question. I think as Kevin highlighted, we do have an increased expectation on the cost environment, and then we've taken the appropriate actions through pricing and cost reductions to deal with that. And that's exactly what we would do is we would see that resin curve continue to be pushed out. We would evaluate both the rates and the degree of pricing across the portfolio. And frankly, we have all of that ready now. We've been evaluating that and would be ready to go if additional increases were warranted.\n We'd, of course, want to balance that to ensure that we don't get out of whack with price gaps and to ensure that we continue to support our innovation, et cetera. And then, of course, we're always looking for ways to reduce costs, and we would continue to put focus there through everything that we possibly can do. So know that, that's what we are thinking about. We have contingency plans in the event that, that happens, but we'll be balancing all of that if we were to have to take additional actions at that curve were to be pushed out further. Sure. I'll start on the pricing question, Kevin. So on the 30% we're choosing to not price at the moment, we're evaluating category by category, what the cost increases are. We're looking at commodity and cost justification. And there are some of our categories that have not been as impacted that are not as driven by resin and certainly might be impacted by transportation but to a lesser degree, and there's other choices that we can make. And as we've talked about, we're taking a look across the entire P&L to see where we can reduce costs. And so nobody is excluded from that. None of the businesses are excluded from that.\n But as it relates to pricing, we're really looking at it category by category, looking at the cost impact and what we think will happen from a consumer standpoint and making that choice. That doesn't mean, though, of course, as we continue to navigate throughout the year, if we were to have additional pressures that we wouldn't consider pricing that additional 30%. But at this point, we think it's the best mix not to.\n And then elasticities, I think it is true that consumers have turned to branded solutions during this pandemic. They want trusted solutions, and they certainly turned to our portfolio. And we've spoken about the numerous ways our portfolio has gotten stronger during this time, whether that be household penetration. Again, stronger retention in buy rates, higher repeat rates. And what we deem as the best consumer value we've seen since measuring it with 70% of our portfolio deemed superior by consumers. That has translated into stronger elasticities.\n That doesn't mean though there is an elasticity impact, and I just want to make sure that's clear. They've improved, but we certainly do expect a volume impact to taking pricing. It's just with a lesser degree that we would have seen prepandemic. And we're watching that closely. And the reason, again, that we continue to invest to keep those elasticities holding as people move through. \n And just the one caveat I would continue to warn. Consumer behavior has been very difficult to predict during this pandemic. All the fundamentals look good right now, but we'll continue to see, as Kevin has articulated what happens in cold and flu, what happens through the course of the remainder of the pandemic. But at this point, we feel very confident that our brands are strong. We can take this pricing, and if that's -- those lower elasticities will hold. No comment yet, Kevin. I hope you can understand we're working through this live right now. And so as we have all of these price increases implemented, then we can talk more about the details of the categories. But I would just say, as you watch the data, I know that pricing will be rolling through this quarter and in the back half as well. And so you'll be seeing that flow through across a number of our categories coming up here quickly. Yes. The international, if you look at the 2-year stack for that business, this quarter was up 19%, so it continues to perform very well. I mean we saw a double-digit growth in a number of our businesses, including our wipes business, Burt's Bees, Cat Litter, and mid-single-digit growth in another of our large businesses, including Glad and Brita. So I feel, overall, very good about international.\n Depending on the market, we're seeing significant pricing pass-through in some of markets which -- so we're taking double-digit pricing in places in international, and that's gone well to date. But we're really leaning into those growth levers we have in international. I would say depending on the market is -- to the degree which the pandemic is impacting that, and you can appreciate, given we compete in over 100 markets, it's very different by market. But generally, we're seeing cleaning behaviors continue to persist across the globe where people are cleaning more and more concerned about their health and wellness. And we're taking advantage of that across our portfolio to deliver innovation, to continuing to invest in our brands and expand our distribution. \n So I think to your point, international did perform well. We do have some tough comps coming up here again in Q2. But we have strong plans, and our brands are growing share in the markets that we compete in. Thanks, Michelle. Thanks again, everyone. I look forward to speaking to you again on our next call in February. Until then, please stay well."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations, for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference.\nLisah Burhan: Thanks, Ross. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Linda Rendle, our CEO, and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. I hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website. In just a moment, Linda will share a few opening comments, and then we'll take your questions. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements, including about our fiscal 2024 outlook. These statements are based on management's current expectations, but may differ from actual results or outcomes. In addition, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section, which identifies various factors that could affect such forward-looking statements, which has been filed with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the non-GAAP financial information section of our earnings release and the supplemental financial schedules in the Investor Relations section of our website for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Now I'll turn it over to Linda.\nLinda Rendle: Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We closed out fiscal year 2023 with strong results, underscoring the significant progress we've made against our strategic priorities. Over the course of the year, we've been relentlessly focused on driving top-line growth and rebuilding margins in a challenging operating environment, while continuing to invest in the long-term health of our brands, categories and capabilities. Thanks to our team's strong execution across a comprehensive set of actions, we delivered on these commitments. For fiscal year 2023, we generated net sales growth of 4%, within our long-term target, gross margin expansion of 360 basis points and adjusted EPS growth of 24%. Our performance reflects our commitment to driving operational excellence and margin improvements, supported by the strength and resilience of our portfolio and the relevance of our IGNITE strategy. In addition to delivering results over the short term, we made progress on our IGNITE strategy. The investments we're making to deliver consumer inspired innovation, strengthen the superior value of our brands, advance our digital transformation and streamline our operating model, are positioning us to drive long-term profitable growth. As we look ahead to fiscal year 2024, we are clear on our priorities. While we expect the environment to remain difficult with macroeconomic uncertainty persisting, we are committed to building on our progress and have plans to enhance our value superiority at a time when it matters most to consumers. We believe these actions will enable us to continue to drive top-line growth and rebuild margins back to pre-pandemic levels and put us in a position to grow share and household penetration over the long term. I'm confident we're taking the appropriate actions to build a stronger, more resilient company positioned to win in the marketplace, deliver on our operational and financial goals, and create long-term value for stakeholders. With that, Kevin and I will take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Peter Grom from UBS. Please go ahead, Peter.\nPeter Grom: Thanks, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. So I wanted to ask two related questions on the top-line. Maybe first, I know you called out stronger shipments in cleaning and some early shipments for back to school, but the minus 2% volume performance was certainly stronger than what we can see in the track data. Was that largely due to the shipment timing that you mentioned, or is there strength elsewhere that's not being captured by the data? And then just second on the organic sales guidance of 2% to 4%. You mentioned a mild US recession in the back half, you provided some color on phasing starting with mid-single digit growth in 1Q. I just would be curious to get your perspective on the balance of pricing versus volume in that outlook, specifically, as we move through the year. And do you expect volume growth at some point in the back half? Thanks.\nLinda Rendle: Hi, Peter. I'll start with your first question then I'll hand it over to Kevin. So on Q4, over-delivery versus what we had expected, as we noted, we did see stronger consumption across the board across our categories in aggregate. And that's a result of two things, mainly. The first being elasticities continue to be better than they have been historically. And that's an aggregate comment. You know, we see differences by category, but in aggregate, they're favorable and trade promo has been normalizing at a slower pace than we'd expect. And we'll continue to see that normalize as we go through fiscal year 2024, but for Q4, it wasn't to the degree that we thought it would be. So that's -- that's the first bucket, stronger consumption. The second is, better operational performance by our team, and that's just a broad statement across the supply chain. We were able to make some supply that we didn't think we would have. Our shipments to retailers were stronger than we had expected. Just a lot of the things operationally came together with great execution and supported that growth. And then finally in Kingsford, and we spoke about in Q3, we did not perform to our expectations in Q3. We made significant adjustments to the plan, including working with retailers on category growth plans, centered in having the right merchandising and those performed significantly better than we had expected, which was great to see and the consumer reacted very favorably and retailers executed with excellence. And those are really the big three main buckets between what we saw, and what we expected.\nKevin Jacobsen: And then, Peter, I can talk about the -- our plans for fiscal year \u201824 as it relates to sales. And as you saw, we're projecting 2% to 4% for the year. If you think about the front half and the back half, our expectations are sales to be closer to mid-single digits in the front half, excuse me, and then low single digits in the back half. And that phasing from front half to back half, I'd call out a few items. The first is, as you saw in our prepared remarks, we're projecting a mild recession in the back half of our fiscal year, which would be the front half of calendar year \u201824. So we think that will put a little bit of pressure on consumers in our categories, and we've reflected that in our outlook. The other item to be aware of is we are now going to lap the four rounds of pricing we've taken when we get to the middle of the year. So that fourth price increase we took last December, we will lap that when we get halfway through the year. So the second half of the year, we'll now have lapped all the pricing we've taken. So as a result of that, what we expect to see is you'll see improving volume trends as we move through the year, and you'll see the benefit of price mix larger in the front half and then really start to tail off in the back half. And so as we get that that low single digit growth, it'll be a combination of some price mix because we're still doing a little bit of pricing internationally, improving volume trends, but recognizing we still think it's going to be a difficult economic environment for consumers.\nPeter Grom: Thank you, both. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Anna Lizzul from Bank of America. Please go ahead, Anna.\nAnna Lizzul: Good afternoon. Thanks very much for the question. In your fiscal \u201824 guidance, you are expecting a flat to 2% net sales growth. This is a little bit below your long-term algorithm from your IGNITE strategy of that 3% to 5% annual sales growth. I was wondering if you can comment on, when you expect to return to the 3% to 5% net sales growth on a more normalized basis? And in addition, what do you see as the drivers of really achieving that sales growth longer term? Thank you.\nLinda Rendle: Yeah. 2% to 4% percent organic sales growth and 0% to 2% from a reported is what we're expecting now. And that is slightly below what we want from a long-term perspective. But, just to put that in perspective, of course, if you look at our four-year CAGR and our strategy period, we did deliver in the midpoint of that range at 4% and again, 4% this year. This year coming up is a kind of a tale of two halves, is the way I would talk about it. And we expect stronger growth in the front half as we continue to lap the two price increases that we have. And then in the back half, we expect it to get tougher for consumers. And right now, our expectation is a mild recession. So when you put those things together, I think in aggregate, we feel good about the top-line that we've committed to. In addition, that includes about 1 point of a headwind from our vitamins, minerals, and supplements business. As we spoke about, over the last couple of calls, we have re-engineered that plan to focus more on profitability, and we've done that at a trade-off from a top-line perspective. So that does include a 1 point headwind. And, over time, we would expect that that wouldn't be the case and that, that would help us return to getting in within that 3% to 5%. The way that I would think about this, as we march through the year, we are expecting, again, lapping two price increases, we are expecting our elasticities to be more normalized as we go through the course of the year. We're expecting trade promotion to normalize as well, and then we're expecting a mild recession in the back half. Those are all of our assumptions in forming that growth. And if those come true, we feel this plan is a very balanced plan, but we'll be watching really carefully as we move through the year. If any one of those assumptions change, and we need to adjust our plan, that could impact both, on the high end and the lower end of us delivering against what we put out there from an outlook perspective.\nAnna Lizzul: Thank you. And just wanted to ask a follow-up on just on marketing spend versus promotional levels, you've mentioned that advertising as a percent of sales, you intend to spend about 11% in fiscal \u201824 versus about 10% in fiscal \u201823. Do you feel this is the right level of investment given a ramp in marketing spend versus some peers in the space? And also just in terms of the balance of advertising spend versus promotional in fiscal \u201924, it does sound like you're ramping back up on promotional levels. And is this an intention to get back to pre-COVID levels with promotion as well? Thanks.\nLinda Rendle: Sure. So on the marketing spend, as you rightly noted, we've spent about 10% of sales on advertising and sales promotion over our history. And there's times we've spent more than that. This year, we're targeting 11% and we think that's a prudent investment given the pressure the consumer is going to be under from a macroeconomic perspective, the fact that we are coming off of four rounds of pricing, significant price increase, obviously cost justified, but we want to continue to support the consumer as they transition through that. And so we think 11% is the right number. And you have two data points that give us confidence that 11% is the right number. During the pandemic, we took our advertising spending up, even at a time when we couldn't fully supply. That increase in advertising led to stronger superiority ratings for our brands, and that gave us the confidence to take the four rounds of pricing that we took. So we think again, in a time where consumers are pressured and stressed, investing that additional point of advertising makes a lot of sense. And then the second data point I would give you is that we've been on a journey to get to know 100 million consumers in the US, and that allows us to personalize to them, which was part of our IGNITE strategy. We've nearly met that goal, and that has led to a return on investment in our advertising being the highest it ever was. We reached a high point year. So we feel really good about putting that extra point in because we know what we're going to get from a returns perspective in addition to supporting the superiority of our brands. And again, we'll continue evaluate this moving forward. Doesn't mean it will necessarily be 11% the year after. This is really a roll up of what we think our general managers need to best support our brands during this time. And then from a promotion perspective, promotions continue to be lower than they were pre-pandemic, but are ramping up. Our expectation is throughout the course of the year, we'll return to more normalized promotions, so similar to what we were pre-pandemic. And, we've assumed to be fair, though, this year, it would ramp up faster and it hasn't. But based on what we're seeing in the data, we think that's a fair assumption. And again, we wouldn't be targeting going beyond what we were pre-pandemic, but just returning to those levels that we had. And for our categories, that still means the vast majority of our sales are done off the shelf with no price reduction. Most of this is good quality merchandising, targeting the consumer around key price points, et cetera. So we think those in combination are the right level of spend given the consumer dynamics, given what we see from a return perspective and what we think is needed to grow categories and to grow share over the long term.\nAnna Lizzul: Great. Very helpful. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Dara.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. So I just wanted to touch on the fiscal \u201824 guidance. You're assuming gross margins come in well below the fiscal Q4 level and the level in the back half of the year. I know you've got $200 million of higher costs you mentioned in prepared remarks. First, can you just give us some more detail specifically on that bucket and what's driving cost increases? And then, b, just as you think about it conceptually, the lack of sequential progress versus the back half of the year, obviously, it's up year-over-year for the full year. Just wondering how that fits in with your goal to eventually move back towards those pre-COVID gross margin levels and why not more progress this year, again, specifically relative to that back half. Thanks.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah. Happy to take those questions, Dara. Maybe let me start with cost inflation and what we're projecting for this year. Maybe if I step back and just think a little longer term in terms of what we've been dealing with and you folks know fiscal year \u201922, a really difficult year given that extreme levels of cost inflation, about $800 million. Last year, we experienced about $400 million of cost inflation. And this year, we're projecting about $200 million. So sequentially getting better, it's moderating, but we're still expecting to operate in a higher cost environment. As we look at that $200 million worth of supply chain inflation, there's really two areas we're predominantly seeing those cost increases coming through. I would say about a third of that we're projecting will hit in commodities. There's a number of items we still see inflating, particularly chemicals, substrate, corrugate and linerboard, we're still looking at rising costs year-over-year. Resin for us, we're looking as a fairly neutral cost. It came down last year, and we're assuming it'd be relatively flat this year. And then we are seeing some cost declines in some of our ag products and diesel. But overall, we think that bucket will be modestly inflationary. And then the other item we're looking at really hits particularly manufacturing and warehousing primarily driven by labor that we continue to expect to be operating inflationary environment. And so those are the primary buckets where we expect to see the $200 million. Now on the gross margin goals this year and the phasing of those -- as you said, Dara, we're expecting to continue to make progress rebuilding gross margin. And you folks know we've talked about this quite a bit, we're committed getting back to those pre-pandemic levels of margin. I think we made good progress last year. We\u2019ve improved about 360 basis points. We expect to build on this this year, expecting another 150 basis points to 175 basis points of improvement. And so by the end of this year, assuming we deliver this plan, we will have recovered a little over 500 basis points of that 800 basis points we lost. Now in terms of the phasing, I'd say, Dara, typically Clorox has some seasonality in terms of our margins. Typically, our fourth quarter is our highest margin. And that's particularly because we do an -- a disproportionate amount of our Kingsford business in the fourth quarter. I think as you folks know, we sold out 50% at Kingsford in the fourth quarter. It's a very business. So that tends to generate our highest margin. And then typically, Q2 is our lowest margin point. One, because we do very little Kingsford as well as we do some, a lot of gift packing on our Burt's business, which is a great activity to drive awareness and trial, but it comes at a lower margin. So you should normally think about our business. Once we've gotten past the normalization and the pricing and all the disruptions, historically, Q2 is a low point and then Q4s are high. So I think it's better to look on a year-over-year basis versus sequentially quarter by quarter. Now in Q1, I expect we'll make good solid progress. Now, not to the same degree in Q4, 560 basis points because we've now lapped that third round of pricing starting now. And so you should expect it to step down the benefit of pricing, but I expect to have a good solid Q1. And then what I expect to do is continue to advance margins on a year-over-year basis and as we said, we're targeting to get to about 41% this year.\nDara Mohsenian: Okay. And are you assuming any incremental pricing next fiscal year? I'm assuming you're not. Is that more just a pause after all the pricing you've taken and maybe you can return later on? And then if I'm not overstaying my welcome, Linda, can you just comment on household penetration and your performance this fiscal year, particularly in light of the comments around the ROI on marketing being at an all-time high and the personalization reaching nearly a 100 million consumers? Thanks.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah, Dara, I can start with our pricing assumptions. In the outlook, we have not assumed any broad-based pricing in the US similar to the first four rounds we've taken. Now, we will continue to price internationally because of the higher inflation rates we're experiencing there. And we'll also continue to focus on net revenue management activities. But in terms of broad-based pricing, we don't have anything assumed in the US this year.\nLinda Rendle: And then your question on household penetration, when we talked about this a bit over the last few quarters, household penetration, along with volume, were things we knew were going to take a hit we took the level of pricing we have over the last 18 months. And we've certainly seen that. And this is a category comment, not just a Clorox brand comment, but what we tend to see is people having short-term reactions from a behavior perspective, and they adjust as they see the initial shock of pricing. And, certainly, they've seen four rounds they've had to adjust to. So typically what we see is we see consumers looking to go to alternates. Maybe they use the inventory they have in their home, they delay a purchase cycle, they look -- they engage in value seeking behavior. They trade up to larger sizes or smaller sizes. And in very extreme cases, they leave the category. And then from a household penetration perspective, a number of those factors play in. We've seen some light users exit the category, which isn't a big surprise. It's typically what we've seen during price increases. And I think importantly to note, again, this is a category behavior, not a Clorox brand behavior. And then what we're focused on, of course, is over time returning that household penetration. And I think it's important to put in perspective, we're still in nine out of 10 US households in our portfolio. But we want to be in a place where we're growing household penetration again. So what I would think about is all the investments that we spoke about a little earlier, increase in advertising and sales promotion, as well as our focus on innovation and category growth plans are all in service of returning to volume growth, returning to household penetration growth and then, of course, our aim over the long term to grow share. I mean we would expect household penetration to begin to improve as we get through pricing, and as we move through the course of the year and then through the course of our plan. But what I would say is, very in line with our expectation, and we feel good about the plans we have in place to continue to make progress on household penetration in fiscal year \u201824 and beyond.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Filippo Falorni from Citi. Please go ahead, Filippo.\nFilippo Falorni: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Just want to ask a question on gross margin again, following up to Dara's question. What drove the outperformance relative to your plan in Q4? It seemed like cost saving came in well ahead of expectation, and it was a record year for you guys, particularly in Q4. And, how much was the incremental volume leverage from the better -- from better volume trends? And then as you think about next year, how should we think about cost savings -- like, also, another year above, algorithm? Thank you.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah. Thanks, Filippo, for the question. As it relates to Q4 and you're right, the over-delivery on gross margin versus our expectation. We went into the quarter targeting 40% to 41% gross margin. And as you saw, we delivered just under 43%. I would say for the most part, as you look at the various drivers within gross margin, they're generally in line with our expectation. That was certainly true for cost savings, pricing, and commodities. The biggest variance was our top-line performance and particularly on volume. And so volume only declined 2% for the quarter. We had projected a larger volume decline in the quarter. And as a result of that, had improved operating leverage, that really flowed through the entire P&L. It certainly benefited gross margin, but it also was the primary driver of our very strong earnings performance for the quarter. And then, as we go forward and on your question on cost savings, look, our team did some just terrific work this year. We target a 175 basis points of EBIT margin expansion each year through cost savings. In fiscal year \u201823, we delivered well north of 200 basis points. And that's really a credit to the team and the work they're doing to drive cost out of the system. And I fully expect to have a very strong year this year as well. So I would expect this year, we'll have another strong year that's probably north of 200 basis points. And that's incredibly important because as we said, we continue to operate in an inflationary environment. And for us to continue to grow margin, it's really based on the good work our team is doing both on driving cost savings and driving the supply chain optimization work we're doing. And that's allowing us to absorb that increased inflation and continue on our progress rebuilding margin. So really good work by the team and exceeded our goals both last year and I expect to do it again this year.\nFilippo Falorni: Great. That's super helpful, Kevin. And then a high-level question, Linda, just, in your guidance on top-line, you mentioned you expect a sequential improvement in volume throughout the year. Just what gives you guys the confidence of the volume coming back other than, obviously, the comparisons to like, at a high level, is it that incremental advertising investment or any other specific point that you can point to give us some confidence on the volume improvement? Thank you.\nLinda Rendle: Yeah. On volume, maybe just to take a step back, I think would be helpful and talk a little bit more similar to my comments on household penetration of what impacts volume and then what we believe we'll see over time as we return to more volume based growth from more pricing driven growth. So the big picture on this, we knew we were going to make a volume trade-off with the level of pricing that we took. And certainly that pricing was cost justified. And I think that's the right trade-off given the fact that we were able to deliver the top-line and margin progress that we committed to. And it's only one lever that we look at it, understanding brand and category health. So if we if we look at volume, again, what impacts it? Consumers are adjusting to pricing right now. And we still have two price increases that we will lap here in Q1 and Q2. And so they're still adjusting to what the pricing is. And they're adjusting to pricing well beyond our categories. I think it's also important to note there's an element of cross elasticity here. Everything in their world has changed from a wallet perspective. And they also just came through a pandemic and they want to have experiences. So we're watching that consumer settle out. And what we're seeing in our data is volumes are beginning to improve. You saw that if you look to 52 weeks, our volumes were down more than they were in the latest 13 weeks, for example, so we are making improvement. We still have to lap those two price increases. But from a consumer behavior standpoint, what you'll see is consumers will return to their old routines because those routines were the most efficient and effective for them, and particularly in essential categories, they don't want to have to work harder to do this stuff. So perhaps they've run through the inventory they have in their house, maybe they tried an alternative and it doesn't work as well, and we tend to see those people start to come back. We also saw light users category loss tend to come back again because we reintroduce our products to them through innovation. We use our advertising spend to talk to them about the benefits of the product, we remind them that, and they pick us up again as they send their child back to school or if their family experiences a run of cold and flu in the house. So those moments, we tend to bring those light users over, and volumes tends to grow again. And we've seen that every time we've taken pricing, and that's consistent in categories. I think what's unique for this time is, the amount of inflation our industry and Clorox experienced specifically is unprecedented. We\u2019re certainly not taking this level of pricing. So it really will be about the pace that this happens at. But we're happy with the progress we've made so far. We think we have the right plans in place. We're making the right investments. Our brands are still a superior value versus what they were pre-pandemic, so they're very strong. And we believe over time, again, we will make progress on volumes and return to more volume-based growth moving forward.\nFilippo Falorni: Great. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JP Morgan. Please go ahead, Andrea.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good afternoon. Hello, everyone. My question is on the shipments and consumption trade-off, if there's any trade off. You mentioned volumes came in better than anticipated, Linda, and was driven by -- was it driven by consumption, or do you think retailers were also rebuilding inventory, given that consumption was better than feared? As you exit the quarter, do you feel inventory levels are where they should be? And then related to that, I also have a clarification on the assumption for the mild recession for the second half and your comments about, like, volumes coming in slightly better than anticipated. So -- but on top of that, you said category behavior has been changing. Is that some more price elasticity that you saw towards the back end of the quarter or your exit rate on the quarter, or you are just assuming prudently that at some point, you're going to see the historical price elasticities you want to kick in?\nKevin Jacobsen: Hey, Andrea. Let me maybe start with your shipment consumption question and then Linda can address price elasticity. As it relates to the fourth quarter, I think there's a few things we are seeing, and I'll talk both versus our expectations and on a year-over-year basis. Versus our expectations, as you know, we had anticipated about 3% to 6% organic sales growth, and we delivered much stronger growth in the quarter. That was primarily driven by consumption coming in stronger than we anticipated. So the consumer is still quite resilient and we haven't seen any drop-off in consumption as we look Q4 to Q3 and we expect that we might see some drop-off in consumption, and that didn't materialize. And then the other driver of our performance was Kingsford. And as you know, we talked quite a bit about that last quarter. We were disappointed with the results in the third quarter. We made some changes to our plans. And I would tell you, we're a bit cautious on what exactly we'd be able to accomplish in the fourth quarter. But credit to our team, we had very strong execution. That business grew both volume and double digit in sales, had a very strong performance. And that was the primary drivers to the over delivery. The other element to think about though as it relates to inventory, we think retailers generally have the right inventory levels. But one of the reasons we had very strong growth on a year-over-year basis is, if you think about last year, retailers were reducing inventory levels. And at the time, as we were all getting more comfortable with the resiliency of the supply chain, everyone was starting to take down their safety stocks. And we saw that last year with retailers reducing inventory. And if you think about what's really happening when they do that, what that means is retailers continue to sell to their customers, but they don't reorder from the manufacturers. So they're still selling product and not reordering from us. And so last year, our shipments lagged consumption. This year, as you fast forward, we saw our shipments much closer to consumption because retailers are not adjusting inventory levels. So on a year-over-year basis, that drove much stronger performance. That was particularly true in our home care business where we saw inventory reductions a year ago. We saw, and particularly in wipes, we saw very strong wipes shipments this Q4, which is really now we're shipping in line with consumption, which was not the case a year ago. And that really contributed to very strong year-over-year performance and that 14% growth. And then, Linda, I know she can speak to elasticities.\nLinda Rendle: So on elasticity, what we saw in Q4 specifically was continued in aggregate, lower elasticities than pre-pandemic and lower than we had expected. Again, this is nuanced by categories or some categories that are less favorable, et cetera. But in aggregate, our elasticities were more favorable than we expected. What we expect to happen in fiscal year \u201924 is over time those elasticities return to more normalized levels. And it's not anything related to particularly our categories, but just the broader pressure the consumer is under. So if you look at what's going on, certainly balance sheets for them are returning to pre-pandemic levels, particularly savings rates where the consumer had a lot of excess savings over the last few years. Right now, we are anticipating a mild recession in the back half. We think that's the most prudent plan based on what we're seeing for economic predictions in the US. That will put additional pressure on the consumer as well. And we think those factors in combination will lead to more normalized price elasticities, and that's what we have assumed in the plan.\nAndrea Teixeira: That's helpful. And on the -- just a clarification, the impact of the inventory write-down -- not write-down, but inventory rationalization last year, was it like a low single digit headwind that then disappeared this year or normalized?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah. Andrea, you're exactly right. Last year, we anticipated there was a couple point headwind as a result of the inventory reductions at retailers. And so we didn't have that impact this year. So year-over-year, that's a source of benefit and part of the 14% organic sales growth we delivered this year, part of that was driven by lapping that inventory reduction in the prior period.\nAndrea Teixeira: Super helpful. Thank you. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, Chris.\nChris Carey: Hey, everyone.\nKevin Jacobsen: Hi, Chris.\nChris Carey: Just one quick follow-up on the gross margin assumptions. Kevin, you said in the prepared remarks that commodities would still be a bit inflationary. What are those commodities? I know there's always a lag, but I would just be curious where you're seeing that just given the favorability that we can see on this side? Then I have a quick follow-up.\nKevin Jacobsen: Sure. Chris, as it relates to commodities, and within that $200 million, we said about a third of that we see is coming from commodity inflation. So that'd be roughly, $60 million or so. I would say there's a few areas. We're seeing substrate, some chemicals, and some corrugate linerboard inflating year-over-year. Now that's partially being offset in a number of areas where we are expecting some deflation, particularly in ag products, soybean oil. We also expect diesel down year-over-year. And resin, we've got about flat on a year-over-year basis, so it's not necessarily contributing or helping. But that's really what we're seeing in terms of our commodity basket and it's modestly inflationary, certainly an improvement from where we were last year, but still modestly inflationary is what we're projecting.\nChris Carey: Okay. And then just on the organic sales over-delivery, non-tracked charcoal comping, some under shipment in the base, and then stronger consumption, just to make sure I have those. Anything else\u2026\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah.\nChris Carey: \u2026coming up a lot this evening. Okay. All right. Thanks.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah. Those are two primary drivers.\nChris Carey: Okay. Great. Just like a strategic question, Linda, it's interesting how far this whole spectrum on investment has come that, this evening, it's almost like, are you spending enough? And you're talking about higher advertising spending, really strong S&A. And I guess maybe it'd be helpful because, we're getting through earning season now. What's your take on why we're seeing this really significant step-up in investment levels? And it's not just from Clorox. It's from all of your peers, marketing spending, SG&A are just going to levels that have not been seen in a very long time? Is this just a lot of manufacturers saying we need to get volumes going, are you feeling a lot more push from the retailers to get volumes going? Just, what are your thoughts on maybe why this investment cycle is coming together and some of the key drivers and see where it\u2019s going. So just -- I know it's a big question, but thanks for any thoughts.\nLinda Rendle: Sure, Chris. Yeah. I won't speak on behalf of the industry, I\u2019ll certainly let everyone speak on their own behalf. But I can just give you the insights into how we're thinking about it. And I think it's a pretty clear understanding. We -- headed into COVID, we had learned a lot about volatility and the impact that it had on our business. And so we began investing more a number of years ago to ensure that we had the right digital foundation, that we had the right organization suited to a more volatile environment, that we have the right capabilities to ensure that we continue to lead from a consumer insights perspective and that the data we have flows as fast as we possibly can get it, so that we can make quick decisions. So that was certainly an area for us where we needed to invest within our digital transformation and our operating model to ensure we could react as fast as consumers could be. We want to be more consumer obsessed, faster, and leaner. And then if you look at the bucket on promotional spending, I look at that as more of a return to the norm. And for us, that spending is on good things. We spend mostly on quality merchandising. We do that to introduce consumers to innovation. We do that to remind them in keep pulse points of the year, like back to school, back to college, remind them the great products that we have, introduce them to new benefits, et cetera. And so seeing that return to more pre-pandemic levels, I think, makes good sense given the industry can fully supply now. We can certainly supply now. And so we get back into that good cadence of giving the right information to shoppers. And then on A&SP, which we have decided to take up, as you know, from 10% to 11%, and, and we addressed earlier, I think this is another case where the number one thing that we can do right now is ensure that we have superior value for our consumers. And we have that from a ratings perspective. Over the last couple of years, we reached the highest brand superiority overall from a portfolio perspective we've ever had. We continue to have more of our portfolio of superior than we did pre-pandemic. And we think given the stress that consumer is going to be under, it would make absolute sense given the improvement we've made on margin to invest a bit more in advertising and sales promotion to secure that with consumers. And that's how we're thinking about it. We have great brands, great innovation, great products, and we want them at this time when they're making those choices in their total basket of spending to remind them in our household essential categories no one delivers a better value than Clorox. And that's exactly what we're focused on. So to me, I think it is it's exactly what we do. We focus on the long term. We focus on building brands. And the spending is right in line with doing that.\nChris Carey: Thank you, both.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Javier Escalante from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, Javier.\nJavier Escalante: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I am -- I have another permutation of the same, observed retail sales in tracked channels versus the over-deliver in the quarter, but hopefully it's from a different angle. So if you can talk about all channel retail sales growth, if you give us a sense of what were Clorox's Q4 retail sales, including online and Home Depot and things like that, so we can better understand your guidance going into fiscal \u201924? So if we can start with that and I have a follow-up.\nKevin Jacobsen: Javier, let me let me see if this helps. If you look at our Q4 performance and I think your question is sales across many different channels. As you saw, very strong growth, if you look at tracked channels, that's true. But what I'd also tell you is some of the areas that are not showing up in tracked channels, we had very strong performance. Our PPD business grew both volume and sales in the quarter. In international, we held volumes and grew sales 14% organically. And then our non-track sales were even stronger than track. So, we're seeing broad performance, not only in tracked channels, but we're seeing it in all the areas where we're selling product. And that contributed to the overall performance of the business. And that's why you'll probably see even stronger results on what you're seeing if you're just looking at tracked channel performance.\nJavier Escalante: Well, the reason I'm asking that is because, I think Linda mentioned that consumption was stronger, right, and this is part of the over-deliver in the quarter, but we don't see that in track channels. We see retail sales growth at 6%, both in the March the June quarter and then there is this very big difference in organic sales, and particularly on the volume side. So wondering if you could at least -- let me tackle differently. What is -- what percentage of your sales is in non-tracked channels, specifically in this quarter, given the seasonality of Kingsford? That would be helpful.\nLinda Rendle: Javier, maybe it would be good just to back up again and go through to make sure we go through all the drivers of what drove track consumption versus organic sales, and Kevin just covered part of it. But we do have a fair amount of our sales in non-track channels. It's a little complicated because non-track does not include international PPD, which is why Kevin broke it out the way he did. So, just to break it down, we had Q4 organic sales growth of 14% and we saw track sales consumption of about 7%. So the delta would be what Kevin highlighted. International and PPD are portion of that. PPD grew volume, international held volume. Remember that we're lapping wipes inventory that Kevin spoke about, and that's a portion of it. And then we saw stronger, non-tracked performance in a number of retailers on a number of businesses. And that's across e-commerce and brick and mortar, et cetera. And then in addition to that, we did, we haven't spoken a lot about this yet, but we do always ship some of our Q1 events in Q4, and that contributed to that delta as well. But we do have a strong non-channel track channel presence. And so, yes, that absolutely can move the number. And this is pretty normal for us to have a quarter that is a bit disconnected from tracked channel sales, in addition that you have the fact that we have very strong merchandising in Q1 as we normally do, and we typically ship some of that in Q4. But those are really the -- if you look at those four buckets, those are the four buckets of the difference between the 14% and the 7%.\nJavier Escalante: Well, thank you. And if I squeeze in something when it comes to pricing for next year, how much is the carryover impact for fiscal -- in fiscal \u201824?\nKevin Jacobsen: Javier, this one is pretty minimal. What we have left to lap is, the fourth round of pricing that we took for half a year. So if you look --\nJavier Escalante: Okay.\nKevin Jacobsen: This year, we had in total, about 670 basis points of total benefit for the year, you should expect a much smaller benefit in fiscal year \u201824 because now we're looking at just half a year on one of our pricing actions. And the fourth round was not as large as the third round.\nJavier Escalante: Okay. Thank you so much. Very helpful.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Olivia Tong from Raymond James. Please go ahead, Olivia.\nOlivia Tong: Great. Thanks. I just want to revisit gross margin because the pace of gross margin expansion in fiscal \u201824 versus the year just reported, obviously, a fair bit of deceleration. But I'm trying to understand, I mean, fiscal \u201823 recovery in gross margin was so meaningfully ahead of your expectations. Why is the pace of expansion slowing so much in fiscal \u201824? Because cost inflation, well, maybe not down, is certainly less of a pressure versus last year. Pricing is by and large working. The top-line is growing and gross margin is still quite a bit below pre-COVID levels, so would love a little bit more color on that. Thanks.\nKevin Jacobsen: Sure, Olivia. As it relates to gross margin, as you said, we continue to expect to make progress this year. So our commitment is to rebuild gross margin back to pre-pandemic levels. This year, we're looking at about a 150 to a 175 basis points of progress. And that's slowing from what we delivered last year and is primarily driven by pricing. So we took four rounds of pricing over the last 18 months, and that had a significant benefit last year. It contributed over 650 bps to gross margin. As we look at fiscal year \u201824, as I was just mentioning to Javier, we have fairly limited pricing in the plan. We're going to get a little bit of carryover on that fourth price increase. So it'll have a smaller impact on gross margin. And then we're really able to grow margin based on all the very good work our team is doing on cost savings and supply chain optimization. So in spite of still dealing with about $200 million worth of cost inflation, we believe we can more than offset that through the good work we're doing within the supply chain and continue to grow gross margins. And so while we're making good progress, I'd expect that to continue as we move into fiscal year '25, I expect that progress to continue. The one thing we'll have to look at over time is, we bought these commodities for decades. They are cyclical. At some point, they'll turn deflationary. That's not our expectation this year. But certainly, when that occurs, that'll certainly accelerate the pace of recovery. It's just hard in this environment to predict exactly when that's going to occur. But we feel very good about our ability to rebuild margins back to those pre-pandemic levels, and we know that's going to take some time to get there. But I have to tell you, I feel very good about progress we're going to continue to make this year in spite of ongoing inflation we're dealing with.\nLinda Rendle: Olivia, I'll add just one point to that. Kevin underscored the $200 million, which is significantly better than what we had at $500 million in fiscal year '23. But I just want to underscore that's still three times the level of average we had before we got into this inflationary cycle on an average year of inflation. So I think the point that Kevin is making is really important to understand. This is still a very challenging environment with significant cost inflation, although certainly better than we experienced over the last two years.\nOlivia Tong: Got it. And then on the top-line, as you look towards rebuilding volume as the year progresses, can you talk a little bit about innovation and what role that plays, and in your view, what kind of impact does innovation have on this year versus last?\nLinda Rendle: Sure. Innovation continues to be the lifeblood of how we grow our brands over time. And we set out to deliver bigger, secure innovation platforms as part of our IGNITE strategy. And we've talked about the fact that we've been able to have more net contribution from innovation in our strategy period than we did in the prior strategy period. And we're going to continue to focus on accelerating that this year. We have innovation across our portfolio just as we did this year. So all of our major brands launched innovation in fiscal year '23. We would expect something similar in fiscal year '24. We're really focused on value and value superiority in that innovation. So we're looking at a combination of product improvements and new innovations, as well as good claims support. And of course, we'll support that innovation with that 11% of sales from an advertising and sales promotion perspective. But we think as we lap these price increases, as a consumer comes under more pressure, innovation will be as important as it ever has been. And certainly our retailers are looking for innovation to help them grow their categories to ensure that we're getting shoppers down the aisles, et cetera. So what I would say is it's a continuation of what we've done. Of course, we want to have additional progress as we can and think we have the right investments to ensure that that continues in fiscal year \u201824.\nOlivia Tong: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead, Lauren.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks so much. So just taking a look, [playing our loan model] (ph) and looking at kind of the dreaded multi-year stacks, and -- but looking at the two year stacks on volume and on price mix this quarter in particular, like, all your comments make frankly more and more sense on the things you were lapping and the contribution, for example, for charcoal, to price mix that the inverse probably, I guess, for wipes on health and wellness. I was curious as we look forward, any other periods, because the stacks are messy, that you think should be called out where there is a dynamic of retailers having reduced inventory in the prior year so that we should be particularly keen for differences in shipments versus what we're seeing in tracked channels, knowing there's always on track that we won't see.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah, Lauren, it has certainly been, as we said, bumpy. This is now -- this is -- not everyone understands, I think, the definition of bumpy, and that we have, lots of lots of et cetera. I would say we are at a pretty good period of normalization now where I don't see anything, that we look ahead and say there was significant inventory buildup or something that we have to lap that's very notable. You know, we've gone through the COVID waves lapping. Pricing would be the one thing I call we're still lapping pricing. And Kevin, I think, and I have been clear on that. But I think you can predict that based off of what we put out there. And of course, that comment is barring any other changes that we see. Any other shocks in the environment, I want to knock on a little bit of wood saying that. But I don't see anything material that we would be looking ahead and saying, there's a big lap ahead of us that we have to consider, pricing being the one exception.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay. Great. And then just in follow-up, I was curious if you could comment on kind of where you stand, I guess, in terms of shelf space or distribution and knowing that and we've talked about several times in the past pre-COVID, there was some, kind of lost shelf space. And now you've had -- as you pointed out in the release, really strong innovation agenda. So I guess, where do you stand on kind of shelf space? How are you thinking -- do you think there's opportunities to be growing shelf space with innovation in \u201824? Is that part of the outlook or not so much?\nLinda Rendle: Yeah. We made good progress as we returned to full supply and getting our total distributions point up. So we made good progress over the last, call it, 18 to 24 months across a number of our businesses. And you all remember that in many cases where, the current -- us and our competitors couldn't fully supply to a lot of third tier brands that had entered in, for the most part, that is cleaned up, and we've been able to gain distribution points as a result of that in aggregate. What we're focused on for fiscal year \u201824 is exactly what you said. We want to gain distribution on our innovation. We want to make sure that we have the right SKUs on the shelf, as we think about, the right pack for the consumer, given their value seeking. We think we've done most of that work, but we want to continue to make progress, and particularly ensure that we get our innovations on shelf as fast as we possibly can on both the physical and digital shelf, and that's what the team will be focused on. And that will contribute to \u201824. We expect the category growth plans and the plans we have with retailers and our execution of those plans to contribute. But we feel good about what we're walking into and what we have for both the front half and the back half.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay. Thanks so much.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks, Lauren.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Steven Powers from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, Steven. Steven, is your line muted?\nSteven Powers: Sorry. Can you hear me?\nOperator: Yep. Can hear you now. Go ahead.\nSteven Powers: Okay. Great. Sorry about that. So following up on that conversation you were just having with Lauren, actually, so it sounds like, things are relatively normalized from a supply and inventory standpoint. So the guidance implies, shipping to consumption. I guess I I'm curious, if it also, you've guided to what you expect category growth rates to be, both from a value perspective and a volume perspective, or if you're embedding any bias of share gain or even some share sacrifice as you still continue rebuild the margins? Just how to think about your guide relative to category growth expectations?\nLinda Rendle: So we've certainly taken account of the foundation of any year that we plan. We look at what we expect the categories to contribute, and, our assumptions in both as we lap pricing and as we head into what we predict is a mild recession in the back half of our fiscal, assume category rates commensurate with that. And then by category, we're looking at our plans, comparing it to that and adjusting based off of if we see headwinds or tailwinds. We want to make progress over the long term on share. We've built that into these plans. We've built in the fact that we're spending additional advertising and sales promotion, that we have good innovation plans. And that lands us at the total outlook that we've provided. But they're very much grounded in the realities of the categories and what we expect.\nSteven Powers: Okay. So just to summarize that, on a net basis, it doesn't sound like you're -- it sounds like the top-line all you're making is essentially in line with category growth. If things go well, maybe top end will market share gain, if not, you're kind of in the zone. Is that fair?\nLinda Rendle: That's fair.\nSteven Powers: Okay. Thank you.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jason English from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, Jason.\nJason English: Hey, folks. Good evening. Thank you for [indiscernible] me in, and congratulations on a strong finish to the year. I'm going to totally do it myself, by going back in time to a time where you guys used to give us a log of all your price increases and decreases. And the point there was, there was decreases back in, I think, 2009 and 2010, you had you had some decreases on Glad, on Litter, more recently in 2018, I think you rolled back the prices of Glad. Obviously, all that was accompanied by pretty substantial downdraft in commodities. So my question is, if we get to your point, Kevin, your other downdraft in commodities, because these commodities, to your point, are cyclical, would we expect or should we expect you to roll back some of these price increases that you put through one of the four in the last year or two? Or, in light of the investment you're making, are you trying to manage the business differently? So instead of give back that relief in the form of pricing, you spend it back into the ability of the P&L through lines like A&P and marketing?\nLinda Rendle: Hi, Jason. Thank you for your comment. And then on your question on price rollback, just to be completely clear, so we're all on the same page, we've rolled back one price increase in a category we no longer own from a truckload perspective after taking an increase. And the other ones that you're referring to, I think, rightfully on Glad, is we've always used trade as a way to evaluate given resin is such volatile commodity. And so as we've taken pricing, we've used trade in the past in order to make up a difference if we've seen favorability in resin that we needed to deal with or we saw something change in the category. But the pricing that we've taken has stuck in the marketplace. And given what we're facing right now, obviously, we have not fully recovered margins, made great progress through the pricing action we've taken, but we have additional work to do given the fact that we continue to see an inflationary environment, also we talked about three times the average year, certainly better than last year, but still a big headwind. We are planning to -- and anticipate the pricing increases will stick, and that will bring back volume and household penetration through innovation and through investment in advertising and sales promotion. But we don't see any structural reason why these price increases wouldn't stick like they have in the past. And again, we're really focused on ensuring we grow categories the right way through those other levers. And if we need to make an adjustment, I think Kingsford is a good example. We did not roll back pricing. So we took pricing. Competition did not follow. We made an adjustment to our plan by putting incremental merchant place. We did not rollback. Our truckload pricing, we continue to hold that, is a good example of how we're approaching it, that if we see a dynamic in a category we need to react to, we will try to do that in a short-term manner, and maintain the truckload pricing we've taken.\nJason English: Okay. So that actually sounds like you do intend to manage pricing differently than you did a decade ago or so. Last time we came through a commodity super cycle where you didn't just adjust by trade, you actually announced those price increases, you published those price increases, you gave us a log for the list price decreases on the back end of it. And I'm hearing you say now that that's even if clients do come in, that's not the intent. The intent is to manage it differently with trade, flexing trade if we find ourselves in that scenario, and I totally appreciate that you don't see that scenario. That's not what you're calling for in 2024, given the commodity the overall inflation environment?\nLinda Rendle: Yeah. I see it as a continuation of what we've done in the past, Jason, seems like we have a little bit of different data. But, yes, I think we're getting to the same conclusion, which is we intend for these and price increases to stick. We think we have the right tools in place to do that. And we're focused on all the other levers we can pull to continue on the strong category performance we've had from a top-line perspective as I noted on spending and innovation. But we're -- you're landing on the same conclusion, which is we believe these price increases will stick and have a good structural reason to do that.\nJason English: Understood. Thank you.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks, Jason.\nOperator: This now concludes the question-and-answer session. Ms. Rendle, I would now like to turn the program back to you.\nLinda Rendle: Great. Thank you, everyone. We look forward to speaking with you again on our next call. And until then, please stay well.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Jacobsen",
            "content": "And then, Peter, I can talk about the -- our plans for fiscal year \u201824 as it relates to sales. And as you saw, we're projecting 2% to 4% for the year. If you think about the front half and the back half, our expectations are sales to be closer to mid-single digits in the front half, excuse me, and then low single digits in the back half. And that phasing from front half to back half, I'd call out a few items. The first is, as you saw in our prepared remarks, we're projecting a mild recession in the back half of our fiscal year, which would be the front half of calendar year \u201824. So we think that will put a little bit of pressure on consumers in our categories, and we've reflected that in our outlook. The other item to be aware of is we are now going to lap the four rounds of pricing we've taken when we get to the middle of the year. So that fourth price increase we took last December, we will lap that when we get halfway through the year. So the second half of the year, we'll now have lapped all the pricing we've taken. So as a result of that, what we expect to see is you'll see improving volume trends as we move through the year, and you'll see the benefit of price mix larger in the front half and then really start to tail off in the back half. And so as we get that that low single digit growth, it'll be a combination of some price mix because we're still doing a little bit of pricing internationally, improving volume trends, but recognizing we still think it's going to be a difficult economic environment for consumers. Yeah. Happy to take those questions, Dara. Maybe let me start with cost inflation and what we're projecting for this year. Maybe if I step back and just think a little longer term in terms of what we've been dealing with and you folks know fiscal year '22, a really difficult year given that extreme levels of cost inflation, about $800 million. Last year, we experienced about $400 million of cost inflation. And this year, we're projecting about $200 million. So sequentially getting better, it's moderating, but we're still expecting to operate in a higher cost environment. As we look at that $200 million worth of supply chain inflation, there's really two areas we're predominantly seeing those cost increases coming through. I would say about a third of that we're projecting will hit in commodities. There's a number of items we still see inflating, particularly chemicals, substrate, corrugate and linerboard, we're still looking at rising costs year-over-year. Resin for us, we're looking as a fairly neutral cost. It came down last year, and we're assuming it'd be relatively flat this year. And then we are seeing some cost declines in some of our ag products and diesel. But overall, we think that bucket will be modestly inflationary. And then the other item we're looking at really hits particularly manufacturing and warehousing primarily driven by labor that we continue to expect to be operating inflationary environment. And so those are the primary buckets where we expect to see the $200 million. Now on the gross margin goals this year and the phasing of those -- as you said, Dara, we're expecting to continue to make progress rebuilding gross margin. And you folks know we've talked about this quite a bit, we're committed getting back to those pre-pandemic levels of margin. I think we made good progress last year. We've improved about 360 basis points. We expect to build on this this year, expecting another 150 basis points to 175 basis points of improvement. And so by the end of this year, assuming we deliver this plan, we will have recovered a little over 500 basis points of that 800 basis points we lost. Now in terms of the phasing, I'd say, Dara, typically Clorox has some seasonality in terms of our margins. Typically, our fourth quarter is our highest margin. And that's particularly because we do an -- a disproportionate amount of our Kingsford business in the fourth quarter. I think as you folks know, we sold out 50% at Kingsford in the fourth quarter. It's a very business. So that tends to generate our highest margin. And then typically, Q2 is our lowest margin point. One, because we do very little Kingsford as well as we do some, a lot of gift packing on our Burt's business, which is a great activity to drive awareness and trial, but it comes at a lower margin. So you should normally think about our business. Once we've gotten past the normalization and the pricing and all the disruptions, historically, Q2 is a low point and then Q4s are high. So I think it's better to look on a year-over-year basis versus sequentially quarter by quarter. Now in Q1, I expect we'll make good solid progress. Now, not to the same degree in Q4, 560 basis points because we've now lapped that third round of pricing starting now. And so you should expect it to step down the benefit of pricing, but I expect to have a good solid Q1. And then what I expect to do is continue to advance margins on a year-over-year basis and as we said, we're targeting to get to about 41% this year. Yeah, Dara, I can start with our pricing assumptions. In the outlook, we have not assumed any broad-based pricing in the US similar to the first four rounds we've taken. Now, we will continue to price internationally because of the higher inflation rates we're experiencing there. And we'll also continue to focus on net revenue management activities. But in terms of broad-based pricing, we don't have anything assumed in the US this year. Yeah. Thanks, Filippo, for the question. As it relates to Q4 and you're right, the over-delivery on gross margin versus our expectation. We went into the quarter targeting 40% to 41% gross margin. And as you saw, we delivered just under 43%. I would say for the most part, as you look at the various drivers within gross margin, they're generally in line with our expectation. That was certainly true for cost savings, pricing, and commodities. The biggest variance was our top-line performance and particularly on volume. And so volume only declined 2% for the quarter. We had projected a larger volume decline in the quarter. And as a result of that, had improved operating leverage, that really flowed through the entire P&L. It certainly benefited gross margin, but it also was the primary driver of our very strong earnings performance for the quarter. And then, as we go forward and on your question on cost savings, look, our team did some just terrific work this year. We target a 175 basis points of EBIT margin expansion each year through cost savings. In fiscal year \u201823, we delivered well north of 200 basis points. And that's really a credit to the team and the work they're doing to drive cost out of the system. And I fully expect to have a very strong year this year as well. So I would expect this year, we'll have another strong year that's probably north of 200 basis points. And that's incredibly important because as we said, we continue to operate in an inflationary environment. And for us to continue to grow margin, it's really based on the good work our team is doing both on driving cost savings and driving the supply chain optimization work we're doing. And that's allowing us to absorb that increased inflation and continue on our progress rebuilding margin. So really good work by the team and exceeded our goals both last year and I expect to do it again this year. Hey, Andrea. Let me maybe start with your shipment consumption question and then Linda can address price elasticity. As it relates to the fourth quarter, I think there's a few things we are seeing, and I'll talk both versus our expectations and on a year-over-year basis. Versus our expectations, as you know, we had anticipated about 3% to 6% organic sales growth, and we delivered much stronger growth in the quarter. That was primarily driven by consumption coming in stronger than we anticipated. So the consumer is still quite resilient and we haven't seen any drop-off in consumption as we look Q4 to Q3 and we expect that we might see some drop-off in consumption, and that didn't materialize. And then the other driver of our performance was Kingsford. And as you know, we talked quite a bit about that last quarter. We were disappointed with the results in the third quarter. We made some changes to our plans. And I would tell you, we're a bit cautious on what exactly we'd be able to accomplish in the fourth quarter. But credit to our team, we had very strong execution. That business grew both volume and double digit in sales, had a very strong performance. And that was the primary drivers to the over delivery. The other element to think about though as it relates to inventory, we think retailers generally have the right inventory levels. But one of the reasons we had very strong growth on a year-over-year basis is, if you think about last year, retailers were reducing inventory levels. And at the time, as we were all getting more comfortable with the resiliency of the supply chain, everyone was starting to take down their safety stocks. And we saw that last year with retailers reducing inventory. And if you think about what's really happening when they do that, what that means is retailers continue to sell to their customers, but they don't reorder from the manufacturers. So they're still selling product and not reordering from us. And so last year, our shipments lagged consumption. This year, as you fast forward, we saw our shipments much closer to consumption because retailers are not adjusting inventory levels. So on a year-over-year basis, that drove much stronger performance. That was particularly true in our home care business where we saw inventory reductions a year ago. We saw, and particularly in wipes, we saw very strong wipes shipments this Q4, which is really now we're shipping in line with consumption, which was not the case a year ago. And that really contributed to very strong year-over-year performance and that 14% growth. And then, Linda, I know she can speak to elasticities. Yeah. Andrea, you're exactly right. Last year, we anticipated there was a couple point headwind as a result of the inventory reductions at retailers. And so we didn't have that impact this year. So year-over-year, that's a source of benefit and part of the 14% organic sales growth we delivered this year, part of that was driven by lapping that inventory reduction in the prior period. Hi, Chris. Sure. Chris, as it relates to commodities, and within that $200 million, we said about a third of that we see is coming from commodity inflation. So that'd be roughly, $60 million or so. I would say there's a few areas. We're seeing substrate, some chemicals, and some corrugate linerboard inflating year-over-year. Now that's partially being offset in a number of areas where we are expecting some deflation, particularly in ag products, soybean oil. We also expect diesel down year-over-year. And resin, we've got about flat on a year-over-year basis, so it's not necessarily contributing or helping. But that's really what we're seeing in terms of our commodity basket and it's modestly inflationary, certainly an improvement from where we were last year, but still modestly inflationary is what we're projecting. Yeah. Yeah. Those are two primary drivers. Javier, let me let me see if this helps. If you look at our Q4 performance and I think your question is sales across many different channels. As you saw, very strong growth, if you look at tracked channels, that's true. But what I'd also tell you is some of the areas that are not showing up in tracked channels, we had very strong performance. Our PPD business grew both volume and sales in the quarter. In international, we held volumes and grew sales 14% organically. And then our non-track sales were even stronger than track. So, we're seeing broad performance, not only in tracked channels, but we're seeing it in all the areas where we're selling product. And that contributed to the overall performance of the business. And that's why you'll probably see even stronger results on what you're seeing if you're just looking at tracked channel performance. Javier, this one is pretty minimal. What we have left to lap is, the fourth round of pricing that we took for half a year. So if you look -- This year, we had in total, about 670 basis points of total benefit for the year, you should expect a much smaller benefit in fiscal year \u201824 because now we're looking at just half a year on one of our pricing actions. And the fourth round was not as large as the third round. Sure, Olivia. As it relates to gross margin, as you said, we continue to expect to make progress this year. So our commitment is to rebuild gross margin back to pre-pandemic levels. This year, we're looking at about a 150 to a 175 basis points of progress. And that's slowing from what we delivered last year and is primarily driven by pricing. So we took four rounds of pricing over the last 18 months, and that had a significant benefit last year. It contributed over 650 bps to gross margin. As we look at fiscal year \u201824, as I was just mentioning to Javier, we have fairly limited pricing in the plan. We're going to get a little bit of carryover on that fourth price increase. So it'll have a smaller impact on gross margin. And then we're really able to grow margin based on all the very good work our team is doing on cost savings and supply chain optimization. So in spite of still dealing with about $200 million worth of cost inflation, we believe we can more than offset that through the good work we're doing within the supply chain and continue to grow gross margins. And so while we're making good progress, I'd expect that to continue as we move into fiscal year '25, I expect that progress to continue. The one thing we'll have to look at over time is, we bought these commodities for decades. They are cyclical. At some point, they'll turn deflationary. That's not our expectation this year. But certainly, when that occurs, that'll certainly accelerate the pace of recovery. It's just hard in this environment to predict exactly when that's going to occur. But we feel very good about our ability to rebuild margins back to those pre-pandemic levels, and we know that's going to take some time to get there. But I have to tell you, I feel very good about progress we're going to continue to make this year in spite of ongoing inflation we're dealing with. Yeah, Lauren, it has certainly been, as we said, bumpy. This is now -- this is -- not everyone understands, I think, the definition of bumpy, and that we have, lots of lots of et cetera. I would say we are at a pretty good period of normalization now where I don't see anything, that we look ahead and say there was significant inventory buildup or something that we have to lap that's very notable. You know, we've gone through the COVID waves lapping. Pricing would be the one thing I call we're still lapping pricing. And Kevin, I think, and I have been clear on that. But I think you can predict that based off of what we put out there. And of course, that comment is barring any other changes that we see. Any other shocks in the environment, I want to knock on a little bit of wood saying that. But I don't see anything material that we would be looking ahead and saying, there's a big lap ahead of us that we have to consider, pricing being the one exception."

            "name": "Linda Rendle",
            "content": "Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We closed out fiscal year 2023 with strong results, underscoring the significant progress we've made against our strategic priorities. Over the course of the year, we've been relentlessly focused on driving top-line growth and rebuilding margins in a challenging operating environment, while continuing to invest in the long-term health of our brands, categories and capabilities. Thanks to our team's strong execution across a comprehensive set of actions, we delivered on these commitments. For fiscal year 2023, we generated net sales growth of 4%, within our long-term target, gross margin expansion of 360 basis points and adjusted EPS growth of 24%. Our performance reflects our commitment to driving operational excellence and margin improvements, supported by the strength and resilience of our portfolio and the relevance of our IGNITE strategy. In addition to delivering results over the short term, we made progress on our IGNITE strategy. The investments we're making to deliver consumer inspired innovation, strengthen the superior value of our brands, advance our digital transformation and streamline our operating model, are positioning us to drive long-term profitable growth. As we look ahead to fiscal year 2024, we are clear on our priorities. While we expect the environment to remain difficult with macroeconomic uncertainty persisting, we are committed to building on our progress and have plans to enhance our value superiority at a time when it matters most to consumers. We believe these actions will enable us to continue to drive top-line growth and rebuild margins back to pre-pandemic levels and put us in a position to grow share and household penetration over the long term. I'm confident we're taking the appropriate actions to build a stronger, more resilient company positioned to win in the marketplace, deliver on our operational and financial goals, and create long-term value for stakeholders. With that, Kevin and I will take your questions. Hi, Peter. I'll start with your first question then I'll hand it over to Kevin. So on Q4, over-delivery versus what we had expected, as we noted, we did see stronger consumption across the board across our categories in aggregate. And that's a result of two things, mainly. The first being elasticities continue to be better than they have been historically. And that's an aggregate comment. You know, we see differences by category, but in aggregate, they're favorable and trade promo has been normalizing at a slower pace than we'd expect. And we'll continue to see that normalize as we go through fiscal year 2024, but for Q4, it wasn't to the degree that we thought it would be. So that's -- that's the first bucket, stronger consumption. The second is, better operational performance by our team, and that's just a broad statement across the supply chain. We were able to make some supply that we didn't think we would have. Our shipments to retailers were stronger than we had expected. Just a lot of the things operationally came together with great execution and supported that growth. And then finally in Kingsford, and we spoke about in Q3, we did not perform to our expectations in Q3. We made significant adjustments to the plan, including working with retailers on category growth plans, centered in having the right merchandising and those performed significantly better than we had expected, which was great to see and the consumer reacted very favorably and retailers executed with excellence. And those are really the big three main buckets between what we saw, and what we expected. Yeah. 2% to 4% percent organic sales growth and 0% to 2% from a reported is what we're expecting now. And that is slightly below what we want from a long-term perspective. But, just to put that in perspective, of course, if you look at our four-year CAGR and our strategy period, we did deliver in the midpoint of that range at 4% and again, 4% this year. This year coming up is a kind of a tale of two halves, is the way I would talk about it. And we expect stronger growth in the front half as we continue to lap the two price increases that we have. And then in the back half, we expect it to get tougher for consumers. And right now, our expectation is a mild recession. So when you put those things together, I think in aggregate, we feel good about the top-line that we've committed to. In addition, that includes about 1 point of a headwind from our vitamins, minerals, and supplements business. As we spoke about, over the last couple of calls, we have re-engineered that plan to focus more on profitability, and we've done that at a trade-off from a top-line perspective. So that does include a 1 point headwind. And, over time, we would expect that that wouldn't be the case and that, that would help us return to getting in within that 3% to 5%. The way that I would think about this, as we march through the year, we are expecting, again, lapping two price increases, we are expecting our elasticities to be more normalized as we go through the course of the year. We're expecting trade promotion to normalize as well, and then we're expecting a mild recession in the back half. Those are all of our assumptions in forming that growth. And if those come true, we feel this plan is a very balanced plan, but we'll be watching really carefully as we move through the year. If any one of those assumptions change, and we need to adjust our plan, that could impact both, on the high end and the lower end of us delivering against what we put out there from an outlook perspective. Sure. So on the marketing spend, as you rightly noted, we've spent about 10% of sales on advertising and sales promotion over our history. And there's times we've spent more than that. This year, we're targeting 11% and we think that's a prudent investment given the pressure the consumer is going to be under from a macroeconomic perspective, the fact that we are coming off of four rounds of pricing, significant price increase, obviously cost justified, but we want to continue to support the consumer as they transition through that. And so we think 11% is the right number. And you have two data points that give us confidence that 11% is the right number. During the pandemic, we took our advertising spending up, even at a time when we couldn't fully supply. That increase in advertising led to stronger superiority ratings for our brands, and that gave us the confidence to take the four rounds of pricing that we took. So we think again, in a time where consumers are pressured and stressed, investing that additional point of advertising makes a lot of sense. And then the second data point I would give you is that we've been on a journey to get to know 100 million consumers in the US, and that allows us to personalize to them, which was part of our IGNITE strategy. We've nearly met that goal, and that has led to a return on investment in our advertising being the highest it ever was. We reached a high point year. So we feel really good about putting that extra point in because we know what we're going to get from a returns perspective in addition to supporting the superiority of our brands. And again, we'll continue evaluate this moving forward. Doesn't mean it will necessarily be 11% the year after. This is really a roll up of what we think our general managers need to best support our brands during this time. And then from a promotion perspective, promotions continue to be lower than they were pre-pandemic, but are ramping up. Our expectation is throughout the course of the year, we'll return to more normalized promotions, so similar to what we were pre-pandemic. And, we've assumed to be fair, though, this year, it would ramp up faster and it hasn't. But based on what we're seeing in the data, we think that's a fair assumption. And again, we wouldn't be targeting going beyond what we were pre-pandemic, but just returning to those levels that we had. And for our categories, that still means the vast majority of our sales are done off the shelf with no price reduction. Most of this is good quality merchandising, targeting the consumer around key price points, et cetera. So we think those in combination are the right level of spend given the consumer dynamics, given what we see from a return perspective and what we think is needed to grow categories and to grow share over the long term. And then your question on household penetration, when we talked about this a bit over the last few quarters, household penetration, along with volume, were things we knew were going to take a hit we took the level of pricing we have over the last 18 months. And we've certainly seen that. And this is a category comment, not just a Clorox brand comment, but what we tend to see is people having short-term reactions from a behavior perspective, and they adjust as they see the initial shock of pricing. And, certainly, they've seen four rounds they've had to adjust to. So typically what we see is we see consumers looking to go to alternates. Maybe they use the inventory they have in their home, they delay a purchase cycle, they look -- they engage in value seeking behavior. They trade up to larger sizes or smaller sizes. And in very extreme cases, they leave the category. And then from a household penetration perspective, a number of those factors play in. We've seen some light users exit the category, which isn't a big surprise. It's typically what we've seen during price increases. And I think importantly to note, again, this is a category behavior, not a Clorox brand behavior. And then what we're focused on, of course, is over time returning that household penetration. And I think it's important to put in perspective, we're still in nine out of 10 US households in our portfolio. But we want to be in a place where we're growing household penetration again. So what I would think about is all the investments that we spoke about a little earlier, increase in advertising and sales promotion, as well as our focus on innovation and category growth plans are all in service of returning to volume growth, returning to household penetration growth and then, of course, our aim over the long term to grow share. I mean we would expect household penetration to begin to improve as we get through pricing, and as we move through the course of the year and then through the course of our plan. But what I would say is, very in line with our expectation, and we feel good about the plans we have in place to continue to make progress on household penetration in fiscal year \u201824 and beyond. Yeah. On volume, maybe just to take a step back, I think would be helpful and talk a little bit more similar to my comments on household penetration of what impacts volume and then what we believe we'll see over time as we return to more volume based growth from more pricing driven growth. So the big picture on this, we knew we were going to make a volume trade-off with the level of pricing that we took. And certainly that pricing was cost justified. And I think that's the right trade-off given the fact that we were able to deliver the top-line and margin progress that we committed to. And it's only one lever that we look at it, understanding brand and category health. So if we if we look at volume, again, what impacts it? Consumers are adjusting to pricing right now. And we still have two price increases that we will lap here in Q1 and Q2. And so they're still adjusting to what the pricing is. And they're adjusting to pricing well beyond our categories. I think it's also important to note there's an element of cross elasticity here. Everything in their world has changed from a wallet perspective. And they also just came through a pandemic and they want to have experiences. So we're watching that consumer settle out. And what we're seeing in our data is volumes are beginning to improve. You saw that if you look to 52 weeks, our volumes were down more than they were in the latest 13 weeks, for example, so we are making improvement. We still have to lap those two price increases. But from a consumer behavior standpoint, what you'll see is consumers will return to their old routines because those routines were the most efficient and effective for them, and particularly in essential categories, they don't want to have to work harder to do this stuff. So perhaps they've run through the inventory they have in their house, maybe they tried an alternative and it doesn't work as well, and we tend to see those people start to come back. We also saw light users category loss tend to come back again because we reintroduce our products to them through innovation. We use our advertising spend to talk to them about the benefits of the product, we remind them that, and they pick us up again as they send their child back to school or if their family experiences a run of cold and flu in the house. So those moments, we tend to bring those light users over, and volumes tends to grow again. And we've seen that every time we've taken pricing, and that's consistent in categories. I think what's unique for this time is, the amount of inflation our industry and Clorox experienced specifically is unprecedented. We're certainly not taking this level of pricing. So it really will be about the pace that this happens at. But we're happy with the progress we've made so far. We think we have the right plans in place. We're making the right investments. Our brands are still a superior value versus what they were pre-pandemic, so they're very strong. And we believe over time, again, we will make progress on volumes and return to more volume-based growth moving forward. So on elasticity, what we saw in Q4 specifically was continued in aggregate, lower elasticities than pre-pandemic and lower than we had expected. Again, this is nuanced by categories or some categories that are less favorable, et cetera. But in aggregate, our elasticities were more favorable than we expected. What we expect to happen in fiscal year '24 is over time those elasticities return to more normalized levels. And it's not anything related to particularly our categories, but just the broader pressure the consumer is under. So if you look at what's going on, certainly balance sheets for them are returning to pre-pandemic levels, particularly savings rates where the consumer had a lot of excess savings over the last few years. Right now, we are anticipating a mild recession in the back half. We think that's the most prudent plan based on what we're seeing for economic predictions in the US. That will put additional pressure on the consumer as well. And we think those factors in combination will lead to more normalized price elasticities, and that's what we have assumed in the plan. Sure, Chris. Yeah. I won't speak on behalf of the industry, I'll certainly let everyone speak on their own behalf. But I can just give you the insights into how we're thinking about it. And I think it's a pretty clear understanding. We -- headed into COVID, we had learned a lot about volatility and the impact that it had on our business. And so we began investing more a number of years ago to ensure that we had the right digital foundation, that we had the right organization suited to a more volatile environment, that we have the right capabilities to ensure that we continue to lead from a consumer insights perspective and that the data we have flows as fast as we possibly can get it, so that we can make quick decisions. So that was certainly an area for us where we needed to invest within our digital transformation and our operating model to ensure we could react as fast as consumers could be. We want to be more consumer obsessed, faster, and leaner. And then if you look at the bucket on promotional spending, I look at that as more of a return to the norm. And for us, that spending is on good things. We spend mostly on quality merchandising. We do that to introduce consumers to innovation. We do that to remind them in keep pulse points of the year, like back to school, back to college, remind them the great products that we have, introduce them to new benefits, et cetera. And so seeing that return to more pre-pandemic levels, I think, makes good sense given the industry can fully supply now. We can certainly supply now. And so we get back into that good cadence of giving the right information to shoppers. And then on A&SP, which we have decided to take up, as you know, from 10% to 11%, and, and we addressed earlier, I think this is another case where the number one thing that we can do right now is ensure that we have superior value for our consumers. And we have that from a ratings perspective. Over the last couple of years, we reached the highest brand superiority overall from a portfolio perspective we've ever had. We continue to have more of our portfolio of superior than we did pre-pandemic. And we think given the stress that consumer is going to be under, it would make absolute sense given the improvement we've made on margin to invest a bit more in advertising and sales promotion to secure that with consumers. And that's how we're thinking about it. We have great brands, great innovation, great products, and we want them at this time when they're making those choices in their total basket of spending to remind them in our household essential categories no one delivers a better value than Clorox. And that's exactly what we're focused on. So to me, I think it is it's exactly what we do. We focus on the long term. We focus on building brands. And the spending is right in line with doing that. Thanks, Chris. Javier, maybe it would be good just to back up again and go through to make sure we go through all the drivers of what drove track consumption versus organic sales, and Kevin just covered part of it. But we do have a fair amount of our sales in non-track channels. It's a little complicated because non-track does not include international PPD, which is why Kevin broke it out the way he did. So, just to break it down, we had Q4 organic sales growth of 14% and we saw track sales consumption of about 7%. So the delta would be what Kevin highlighted. International and PPD are portion of that. PPD grew volume, international held volume. Remember that we're lapping wipes inventory that Kevin spoke about, and that's a portion of it. And then we saw stronger, non-tracked performance in a number of retailers on a number of businesses. And that's across e-commerce and brick and mortar, et cetera. And then in addition to that, we did, we haven't spoken a lot about this yet, but we do always ship some of our Q1 events in Q4, and that contributed to that delta as well. But we do have a strong non-channel track channel presence. And so, yes, that absolutely can move the number. And this is pretty normal for us to have a quarter that is a bit disconnected from tracked channel sales, in addition that you have the fact that we have very strong merchandising in Q1 as we normally do, and we typically ship some of that in Q4. But those are really the -- if you look at those four buckets, those are the four buckets of the difference between the 14% and the 7%. Olivia, I'll add just one point to that. Kevin underscored the $200 million, which is significantly better than what we had at $500 million in fiscal year '23. But I just want to underscore that's still three times the level of average we had before we got into this inflationary cycle on an average year of inflation. So I think the point that Kevin is making is really important to understand. This is still a very challenging environment with significant cost inflation, although certainly better than we experienced over the last two years. Sure. Innovation continues to be the lifeblood of how we grow our brands over time. And we set out to deliver bigger, secure innovation platforms as part of our IGNITE strategy. And we've talked about the fact that we've been able to have more net contribution from innovation in our strategy period than we did in the prior strategy period. And we're going to continue to focus on accelerating that this year. We have innovation across our portfolio just as we did this year. So all of our major brands launched innovation in fiscal year '23. We would expect something similar in fiscal year '24. We're really focused on value and value superiority in that innovation. So we're looking at a combination of product improvements and new innovations, as well as good claims support. And of course, we'll support that innovation with that 11% of sales from an advertising and sales promotion perspective. But we think as we lap these price increases, as a consumer comes under more pressure, innovation will be as important as it ever has been. And certainly our retailers are looking for innovation to help them grow their categories to ensure that we're getting shoppers down the aisles, et cetera. So what I would say is it's a continuation of what we've done. Of course, we want to have additional progress as we can and think we have the right investments to ensure that that continues in fiscal year \u201824. Yeah. We made good progress as we returned to full supply and getting our total distributions point up. So we made good progress over the last, call it, 18 to 24 months across a number of our businesses. And you all remember that in many cases where, the current -- us and our competitors couldn't fully supply to a lot of third tier brands that had entered in, for the most part, that is cleaned up, and we've been able to gain distribution points as a result of that in aggregate. What we're focused on for fiscal year \u201824 is exactly what you said. We want to gain distribution on our innovation. We want to make sure that we have the right SKUs on the shelf, as we think about, the right pack for the consumer, given their value seeking. We think we've done most of that work, but we want to continue to make progress, and particularly ensure that we get our innovations on shelf as fast as we possibly can on both the physical and digital shelf, and that's what the team will be focused on. And that will contribute to \u201824. We expect the category growth plans and the plans we have with retailers and our execution of those plans to contribute. But we feel good about what we're walking into and what we have for both the front half and the back half. Thanks, Lauren. So we've certainly taken account of the foundation of any year that we plan. We look at what we expect the categories to contribute, and, our assumptions in both as we lap pricing and as we head into what we predict is a mild recession in the back half of our fiscal, assume category rates commensurate with that. And then by category, we're looking at our plans, comparing it to that and adjusting based off of if we see headwinds or tailwinds. We want to make progress over the long term on share. We've built that into these plans. We've built in the fact that we're spending additional advertising and sales promotion, that we have good innovation plans. And that lands us at the total outlook that we've provided. But they're very much grounded in the realities of the categories and what we expect. That's fair. Thanks, Steve. Hi, Jason. Thank you for your comment. And then on your question on price rollback, just to be completely clear, so we're all on the same page, we've rolled back one price increase in a category we no longer own from a truckload perspective after taking an increase. And the other ones that you're referring to, I think, rightfully on Glad, is we've always used trade as a way to evaluate given resin is such volatile commodity. And so as we've taken pricing, we've used trade in the past in order to make up a difference if we've seen favorability in resin that we needed to deal with or we saw something change in the category. But the pricing that we've taken has stuck in the marketplace. And given what we're facing right now, obviously, we have not fully recovered margins, made great progress through the pricing action we've taken, but we have additional work to do given the fact that we continue to see an inflationary environment, also we talked about three times the average year, certainly better than last year, but still a big headwind. We are planning to -- and anticipate the pricing increases will stick, and that will bring back volume and household penetration through innovation and through investment in advertising and sales promotion. But we don't see any structural reason why these price increases wouldn't stick like they have in the past. And again, we're really focused on ensuring we grow categories the right way through those other levers. And if we need to make an adjustment, I think Kingsford is a good example. We did not roll back pricing. So we took pricing. Competition did not follow. We made an adjustment to our plan by putting incremental merchant place. We did not rollback. Our truckload pricing, we continue to hold that, is a good example of how we're approaching it, that if we see a dynamic in a category we need to react to, we will try to do that in a short-term manner, and maintain the truckload pricing we've taken. Yeah. I see it as a continuation of what we've done in the past, Jason, seems like we have a little bit of different data. But, yes, I think we're getting to the same conclusion, which is we intend for these and price increases to stick. We think we have the right tools in place to do that. And we're focused on all the other levers we can pull to continue on the strong category performance we've had from a top-line perspective as I noted on spending and innovation. But we're -- you're landing on the same conclusion, which is we believe these price increases will stick and have a good structural reason to do that. Thanks, Jason. Great. Thank you, everyone. We look forward to speaking with you again on our next call. And until then, please stay well."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Clorox Company Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for the Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin.\nLisah Burhan: Thanks, Jen. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Linda Rendle, our CEO; and Kevin Jacobson, our CFO. I hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website. In just a moment, Linda will share a few opening comments, and then we'll take your questions. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements, including about fiscal year 2023 outlook. These statements are management's current expectations that may differ from actual results or outcomes. In addition, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section, which identify various factors that could affect such forward-looking statements, which have been filed with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the non-GAAP financial information section of our earnings release and the supplemental financial schedule in the Investor Relations section of our website for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Now I'll turn it over to Linda.\nLinda Rendle: Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We delivered strong results in the third quarter and made a challenging operating and cost environment, with organic sales growth in all four segments, gross margin expansion and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our performance reflects solid execution by our team, the strength and resilience of our portfolio, the superior value of our brands and the relevance of our IGNITE strategy. Based on our strong performance, we're raising our fiscal year outlook. During the quarter, we made great progress through building margin while maintaining top line growth. Net sales grew above our long-term target and we delivered our second consecutive quarter of gross margin improvement supported by cost justified pricing and decade high cost savings. We also made further progress on our IGNITE priorities, investing in our brands and innovation pipeline, while advancing our digital transformation and streamlined operating model to create a stronger, more resilient company. While we're encouraged by our progress to-date, we're relentlessly focused on controlling what we can to drive and appropriately balance both top line and bottom line growth. Looking ahead, we expect the operating environment to remain volatile and challenging. Despite recent moderation in pockets of input costs, overall inflationary headwinds continue to be strong. In light of this and ongoing macro uncertainty, we're watching consumer reactions very closely given the potential for them to come under greater pressure and we are prepared to adapt plans as necessary. Regardless, we have trusted brands and essential categories, which we continue to invest behind. I remain confident that our actions position us well to navigate this environment to deliver consistent profitable growth over time. With that, Kevin and I will take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from Andrea Teixeira. Please go ahead.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you, operator and good afternoon, everyone. So my question refers a more on the quarter coming in better than anticipated. And Linda, you and Kevin and the team had highlighted that elasticities can kind of came in better. But of course, you're not lapping and not assuming that's going to continue. So you can -- if you can talk a little bit about that? You called out Kingsford being one that you potentially have to work out the price gaps. Any other area that you'd think would be an opportunity? And regarding VMS, just as a clarification, are you putting the asset for sale or just rightsizing it?\nKevin Jacobsen: Andrea, this is Kevin. Thank you for the question. Maybe I can start with our expectations for Q4. And as you saw, we delivered 8% organic sales growth in the third quarter, which is stronger than we anticipated. And you may have seen Andrea, in our prepared remarks, there is about 2 points that were one-time in nature, and I'm happy to talk about those. But if I set those aside, we delivered about 6 points organic sales growth. If you look at our outlook for Q4, our full year outlook, and you can back into it. We're projecting about 3% to 6% organic growth. I would say at the high end of that range, it would look very like it did in Q3. We expect continued strong consumption. The business is performing well. I think the one watch out we have and you mentioned it is our Kingsford business. While we had very strong performance in the third quarter, Kingsford was a one business that came in below our expectations. And you may have seen in our prepared remarks, we're seeing an increased level of competitive activity and we're not seeing competition move to the same degree we moved on pricing. That was one of the businesses we priced in December and we've seen price gaps widen and as a result, we saw our shares decline in the third quarter. Now the team with that in mind they've gone back and they've adjusted their plans in Q4, so we're increasing our support for the business in the fourth quarter. But it's certainly something we're watching, and Andrea, you may know this that business has an outsized impact on our fourth quarter. We do about 50% of our total sales in Kingsford happened in the fourth quarter. So it's clearly something we're keeping a close eye on. We think we have good plans in place that we've adjusted to reflect what we learned in Q3, but we're watching that closely, particularly around the key holidays, and it's a little early to tell how Memorial Day or July 4 plays out. And I think if we have a good successful season, we'll be at the top end of that range, which is pretty consistent in Q3. But if it delivers below our expectations, I think that would be a reason why we'd be towards the lower end of the range for the fourth quarter.\nLinda Rendle: Andrea, I'll take VMS. So as you're all aware, VMS is a small portion of our portfolio. It's about 3% of sales right now and has continued to face challenging market dynamics from a category perspective, what we're seeing coming out of COVID. And then, of course, we've highlighted the performance issues on that business. And we've reassessed that business as it relates to the role it plays in our portfolio. As Kevin highlighted, we're seeing strong results across the majority of our businesses. And we think it's the right step now to look at resource allocation and allocate resources to businesses we think how higher growth potential and therefore, making a bigger focus on profitability in the VMS business. And that's what the team will be laser focused on moving forward. That includes, like I said, moving resources to businesses that have growth potential as well as continuing to narrow our focus on core brands. And we think that's the right role for the business moving forward. Given that, that's what triggered the non-cash impairment, but we feel like we have the right plans moving forward. And as it relates to our portfolio, we're always doing that work with our Board. We'll continue to do that. But right now, we're focused on driving more profitability in the VMS business as we own it today.\nAndrea Teixeira: That's very helpful. If I can squeeze one question on, if I can, on the wipes business. It seems as if there wasn't any call out of -- it seems that has normalized. Any changes in potentially regaining some shelf space that was lost at the time given the private label taking more share and you didn't have enough capacity, how did that normalize? And anything in the dynamics of the timing of promotions in doing a club or anything that you could call out that happened in the quarter?\nLinda Rendle: Yeah. Certainly, for wipes, that was a business or one of the business most impacted by COVID. And as we noted, in Q3, we were lapping the Omicron variants and then begin to get to a period where we're more normalized from a COVID perspective with wipes. But it definitely has been bumpy over the last few years as we've gone through that. But we've been very pleased with the performance on the wipes business. We've continually grown share quarter-after-quarter for the last well 12 months over 18 months now on wipes. We've regained significant distribution. Our merchandising plans, while lower than they were pre-pandemic are stronger than they have been and that's behind our ability to supply and we are able to fully supply that business now. And we continue to see consumers turn to us in times of cold and flu. Even with a season that was moved up, we saw strong consumer reaction from a cold and flu perspective. So we feel good about the future of that business. We continue to have a good innovation pipeline. And if you look at our shares, they certainly support the fact that what we thought would happen with all the tertiary brands launched did as we return to strong share leadership and continue to grow that share position.\nAndrea Teixeira: Very helpful. Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Peter Grom with UBS.\nPeter Grom: Thanks, operator and good afternoon, everyone. So maybe just two questions on gross margin. Maybe one more near term and one, looking at longer term. So you've been making some nice sequential progress this year in 3Q of almost 42%, which is quite strong. But the guidance implies a step down in 4Q. So I know there's a lot of noise. If I go back and look at gross margin progression, pre-pandemic, it's pretty rare that you see that sequential step down. So just any color on what may be driving that?\nKevin Jacobsen: Hi, Peter. Yeah. Thanks for the question on gross margin. I would not look at it as stepping down in Q4. If I look at our Q3 performance, and as you mentioned, we delivered a 41.8%, there's about 1 point of benefit from the one-time items we highlighted. So if I set that aside, it's sort of an ongoing basis, we're a little under 41%. If you look at our raised outlook for the full year, we're now looking at 38.5% to 39%. You can back into the fourth quarter and now suggest we get to about 40% to 41%. So I would say our fourth quarter is very much in line with what we delivered in the third quarter, if I just set aside the onetime benefit we had. And so we expect the good strong performance we delivered this quarter to continue on into the fourth quarter.\nPeter Grom: That's super helpful. And then I guess maybe looking out longer term, I recognize being hesitant to provide goalpost around a time line of returning to pre-pandemic profitability. But just looking at the 3Q performance, the 4Q exit rate, the broader trends around inflation. It just does seem like there's -- the light at the end of the tunnel might be approaching faster than anticipated. So I would just love some perspective on the margin recovery? And whether based on what you're seeing right now, whether returning to pre-pandemic levels is in the cards as you look out to next year?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah. Peter, as it relates to gross margin, Lynn and I remain committed to getting back to pre-pandemic levels that's work that's well underway, and we intend to get there. I'm going to be cautious about providing in the outlook for fiscal year '24. We're still in the process of developing our plans. So it's a bit too early for that. But I would say at a high level, you should expect when you see our plans, it will be very much focused on the same priorities we've been driving this year. We're going to continue to drive top line growth. We fully expect to continue to make progress, expanding gross margins and rebuilding them. And then we'll continue to advance our strategic priorities. The challenge with the gross margin, I know there's a lot of interest in exactly when we get to pre-pandemic levels is. On the elements, we control, I feel very good about the progress we're making and we've talked a lot about those drivers. I would say those initiatives are primarily on track or exceeding our expectations. But the reality is there's a real impact from the areas we don't control, either supply chain disruptions or inflation. And as I said in the past, I really think that inflationary component will either accelerate or delay our time to recovery, depending on how that plays out over the next 12 months to 24 months. And I frankly don't think anyone's got a particularly good crystal ball right now to predict that. And so we're going to continue to focus on those things we can control. We're making really good progress. I expect that progress to continue in fiscal year '24. But I think it's a little premature for us to make an exact call on where we think we'll be by the end of '24.\nPeter Grom: Got it. Thanks so much. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah. Thanks, Peter.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Anna Lizzul with Bank of America.\nAnna Lizzul: Hi. Thank you very much for the question. To continue the theme on gross margins. I did want to just follow up. Understanding that commodity costs are still a headwind, but directionally keep moving in a better direction and less of a drag on margins here. I mean do you see commodity costs largely stabilizing at this point into fiscal Q4? And then also, do you see a bigger benefit acknowledging that the mix and assortment on margins was a benefit in fiscal Q3, would you expect a bigger benefit on that in fiscal Q4? Thank.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah. Thanks, Anna for the question. As it relates to commodity inflation, it is still an inflationary environment. Now it is moderating that level of inflation. But to give you a perspective, in Q1, we had 330 basis points of commodity inflation; in Q3, at 230 basis points. And so we've seen some moderation, but still an inflationary environment. As we've said, resin is a one product rebuy that we are seeing deflation. We've seen that for a good part of the year but that's being more than offset by most of the other products we purchase. And so it continues to be inflationary. We had called about $400 million in total supply chain inflation, about half of that from commodities and half from other areas at the beginning of the year and that still looks like the right call. We still expect about $400 million of inflation. And so I expect to exit this year still operating in an inflationary environment as it relates to commodities. Now as it relates to manufacturing and logistics, I'd say the one area we are starting to see prices come down year-over-year, at least that's our expectations on transportation. It has stabilized in the third quarter. And then our expectations in the fourth quarter, we'll start to see transportation on a year-over-year basis to be lower. But keep in mind, when we talk logistics, there's really three pieces in there. There's transportation, which I think is moving to a deflationary market as we're seeing less demand for goods and more trucks available. But that also includes warehousing and what we call our diesel surcharge and we continue to see inflation in those other two elements. So logistics continue to be a headwind, but transportation piece of logistics, we're starting to see that decline, at least that's our expectation for the fourth quarter.\nAnna Lizzul: Okay. Thanks very much. And then just on the mix and assortment part of margins, are you expecting to see a better benefit from fiscal Q3 to fiscal Q4?\nKevin Jacobsen: I don't. I mean a little bit of the Q3 benefit mix and assortment is our cleaning business, particularly wipes because we're lapping Omicron, our wipes business is down and bigly when you get to large multipacks. And so that was a benefit in the quarter that I expect them to get back down to a more normalized mix of our cleaning portfolio, I would not see that continue in Q4.\nAnna Lizzul: Great. Thanks very much.\nKevin Jacobsen: Thanks, Anna.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. So a couple of things on the gross margin side. I guess I wanted to re-ask Peter's question and I understood the answer in terms of on an underlying basis, at least the high end of full year guidance seems fairly similar levels in Q4 -- fiscal Q4 versus fiscal Q3 adjusted. But you did see a lot of sequential improvement in Q3 relative to Q2. And as you mentioned, there are some things getting better in terms of logistics in theory, some of the commodity costs are less of a pressure point next quarter. So just wanted to understand why we wouldn't continue to see a path of sequential improvement, given as we look at fiscal Q3 on an underlying basis, you saw that versus fiscal Q2? And then also, just looking at the underlying performance in fiscal Q3, can you just highlight, based on the pressure points of the individual buckets, where did you come in better than expected versus what you originally expected in fiscal Q3? Thanks.\nKevin Jacobsen: Sure. Yeah. Thanks, Dara. As it relates to Q4, I'd say the one item I would add to your list and you're exactly right. We expect some moderation in cost inputs as we move from Q3 to Q4. The counterbalance of that is on pricing. We believe Q3 will be the strongest benefit from pricing. As we move into Q4, we're now lapping two price increases, the first two rounds we took. And so I would expect that we'll see less benefit from pricing in Q4, essentially offset by more moderating cost environment. So collectively, we get back to that 40, 41, which is fairly consistent with Q3, seeing a little less inflation and a little less benefit from pricing about offsetting. And then as it relates to Q3, probably the biggest benefit above what we expected is volume deleveraging. We went into the quarter expecting based on elasticities that we would see volumes down in the mid-teens range. And as you saw, our volume was down about 11%. So that stronger top line performance that really drove through the entire P&L. We overdelivered on sales relative to our expectations, but it also contributed to a strong gross margin as well as EPS. So that was really the biggest change versus our expectations. And as I mentioned earlier, Peter, the cost inflation is generally in line with what we expected. That was true for Q3 and we still expect about $400 million of cost inflation for the full year.\nDara Mohsenian: Great. That's helpful. And then just on price gaps, you obviously talked about Kingsford, are the plans on Kingsford mainly to adjust promotional spending? Are there other plans as you think about managing that business, particularly heading into the peak season here? And can you discuss if you're comfortable with price gaps elsewhere across the portfolio or are you seeing anything worrisome elsewhere? Thanks.\nLinda Rendle: Sure. I'll start with the portfolio and then get a little deeper on Kingsford. So from a price gap perspective, the pricing we took a few months ago went generally as expected. And we've seen pockets of price gaps. And frankly, we're still closing some of those, and we've adjusted some of our plans on the businesses where we've had issues. For the most part, our price gaps are in line to where we expected them to be. Kingsford, as you call out is the biggest gap that we have right now as competition did not follow that price increase in full. And that's one that we are making adjustments to our plan, and we have those already beginning to show up in market in Q4. Part of that would be trade related. We're ensuring we have the right merchandising plans to support the right price points, but we're also focused on market baskets with retailers, which is one of the biggest opportunities given the overall basket for the consumer in the drilling space is under pressure with protein prices being up, and of course, the rest of the things that go on the grill. So we're focused on supporting those enhanced merchandising plans, and we'll expect to see that play out as we head into Q4. That being said, though, we are laser-focused on any price gap issues that we have in pockets and we have plans ready to adjust, and we will do that on select other areas of our portfolio where we continue to see gaps. But what I'd say is there's so much noise as prices fluctuate and as promotion starts to come back into the marketplace that we're being incredibly cautious to ensure that we have the right value for our brands and maintain that superior brand value with consumers but not get ahead of ourselves from a trade perspective. And I think that balance has been working, and we'll continue to do that in Q4 and beyond as we manage price gaps.\nDara Mohsenian: Great. That's helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Filippo Falorni with Citi.\nFilippo Falorni: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Question on pricing. You mentioned obviously in Q4, you're going to cycle some of the price increases from last year. You still have the December price increase flowing through. So can you give us a sense of magnitude or the sequential change in pricing that you're thinking for Q4? And then longer term, you've talked in the past about shifting from list price increases towards more price back at capture. So can you give us a sense of the potential contribution from those initiatives as we look to fiscal '24 and beyond? Thank you.\nKevin Jacobsen: Sure. Hi, Filippo. As it relates to Q4, I won't give a buy line forecast for the fourth quarter, but you should expect that the price benefit to margin we saw in Q3 is a high watermark this year. And then now as we really start lapping that second price increase, you'll start to see that pull back. I'd say more in the range, somewhere in that Q1 to Q2 range, generally in that area. So we'll see that start to step down. And that should continue to play out that way for the next three quarters until we fully lap the last round of pricing we took in December, it will continue to step down in value over time. And then your question on list price changes, I think you may have read in our prepared remarks, we do not have any additional large scale pricing in our plans for the balance of this fiscal year. We will continue to work on place back architecture (ph) changes. And then we'll evaluate we're developing our plans for '24. So we'll come back to you in August and we'll share more details about our plans about how much would be pricing and how we would execute that pricing is a little too early to have that conversation. What I would say though, maybe longer term is, I think as we get through this inflationary cycle and we get back to an appropriate level of margins, I would expect us to get back to a more normalized level of how we grow the top line, which is more volume dependent and we'll continue to focus on innovation, consumer trade-up and some price back architecture be much more volume driven than price mix driven and so I think you'll see that evolve over time. But we're still very much in the mode where it's being more driven by price mix and I expect that to continue for another three quarters until we lap all this pricing.\nFilippo Falorni: Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Hi, everybody. In the prepared remarks, Linda, you talked about, you\u2019ve been please with market share performance and I was -- Linda\u2019s, readily apparent on a dollar basis. But I was just curious how much you guys think about volume share and whether or not that's a metric that's important to you, it's something you focus on? And then, I have a follow-up related to that after I kind of hear the answer.\nLinda Rendle: Sure, Lauren. So on share overall, we were happy to maintain share in aggregate, and we grew share in five of our nine businesses and continue to grow share in the growth markets around the world. That being said, of course, our goal is to grow share and I've been transparent about that, that we're not satisfied into that zone, but we are really pleased to see given the level of pricing that we've taken that our shares have held up. And of course, we are talking about dollar share, and if you recall, earlier, we were growing volume share pretty steadily as pricing had fully taken hold in our categories, and that was something that we were looking at, too. So Lauren, we're balancing both of them. Our focus is usually on dollar share as the primary metric that we want to focus on. We think that convey as well our overall superior value and how we think about consumers thinking about value in the category and dollar share is a better representative of that. But again, we are watching volume and unit share to see how consumers are making decisions, et cetera. The good news is that because the categories have mainly moved in line with us with some exceptions, Kingsford being notably, you're seeing adjustments in volume share that in some places are larger, but most of the time in line and just have to do with normalizing price gaps. So we watch it, primary metric is dollar share. Happy to see where we are and happy to be growing in five to nine businesses, but the work is certainly not done yet.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay. Great. And then so when I was thinking about gross margin and Kevin had mentioned it briefly about the operating deleverage and it was better this quarter than expected, but it's still a headwind to gross margin. As you think forward, what should we be thinking about in terms of volumes, stable at newer lower level, albeit give all the pricing (ph), is it volume growth? Because [Technical Difficulty] how should we think about where the business is geared to on an absolute volume performance basis such that if we're really talking about restoring gross margins versus pre-pandemic levels. We often be mindful of where volumes stand relative to that pre-pandemic period?\nKevin Jacobsen: Lauren, I'd say a few things on volume. I think one thing that continues to benefit is, as you know, is we chose to use contract manufacturers mean that significant spike, so we did not overbuild our facilities that allowed us to, as volume moderated we were able to set those agreements down and not be left with a lot of unused capacity internally. And so I think that's benefited us. I think -- as I mentioned, I think to Filippo, as we move forward now, depending on where pricing goes in fiscal year '24, but given the pricing we've taken, I would expect price mix to continue to moderate and the volume declines to moderate as well as we cycle through this pricing. And so as I said, short of any future pricing being taken, I think we've probably got a three more quarters or so, we're seeing price/mix driving the top line to a greater extent of volume. But I think that will level and balance out as we look further out into our fiscal year '24 and so I think that's when we get to a more steady state of volume. And what we try to do is be thoughtful about ensuring we're building our manufacturing capacity to be in line with these plans and not getting ahead of ourselves. And so that's the work we've been doing with our supply chain team to try to make sure we don't end up in a position where once we get to the steady state, we've got too much capacity in our facilities. I think we're in pretty good shape, but that's something we continue to evaluate and continue to adjust our plans. But certainly, it's something we're keeping a close eye on.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay. Great. And then final question. I was just in the expenses excluded from earnings this quarter and then the outlook set in the operating model changes that just things are moving more quickly, so higher expenses in this year, but no change to the overall program. But on the digital expenses, they are higher. And so you're now excluding, I think it's an additional $0.07 or something like that. So I'd just be curious if we could explain a little bit what's the incremental? Is it just the estimated cost of the program has gone up? Is there an incremental savings, just curious about that change?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yea. Sure. Thanks for the question. As it relates to our digital transformation that program is very much on track. As you know, it's a five year program, and we plan to spend $500 million, no change in our expectation. We are seeing a little bit of a shifting between years. This is the second year of the five-year program. We started the year out, expecting we spend about $150 million, $90 million of OpEx, about $60 million of CapEx and that $90 million equates to about $0.55. We have now raised our total spending to about $160 million, so from $150 million to $160 million. And that's just a little bit of shift in timing between years. We're not changing the overall expected spend as a result of pulling a little bit of that forward into fiscal year '23, we've raised our expectation about $10 million and that's that $0.07 you mentioned, Lauren.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay. Thank you so much. Sorry for all the questions.\nKevin Jacobsen: Thanks, Lauren.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Olivia Tong with Raymond James Financial.\nOlivia Tong: Great. Thanks. Good morning. My first question is on advertising and your view on reinvestment levels, especially with A&P up pretty substantially in Q3. So we certainly saw some nice acceleration following the gross margin improvement. So just wondering on your views going forward if gross margin continues to recover ahead of your expectations, where do you think advertising goes? And then just a follow-up on that. This is the biggest increase in advertising margin that on a year-over-year basis in quite a few years. So can you talk about where the incremental spend was and your view on the ability to generate the same level of ROI on that spend versus what you're going and expectations were?\nLinda Rendle: Sure, Olivia. Advertising continues to be an incredibly important part of how we support the superior value of our brands. We believe fundamentally in it. And it's why we've done everything to continue to maintain spending what we think is about the right level over a year, which is about 10% of sales and we'll continue to be on track for doing that this year. As you noted, Q3 was significantly higher than other quarters and that's given innovation that we launch and timing of merchandising. And again, we don't manage quarter-to-quarter, but this was the right time to spend this money to support our brands. And coincides with having our fourth price increase in the market, which is good timing. We continue to believe that about 10% is the right spending, but we adjust that and look at that depending on what the businesses require. And we're not afraid to move or adjust that moving forward. But again, right now, about 10%, we're on track to do that for the year. And if you look at our ROI on marketing, it has been terrific and is another reason why we continue to feel strongly that, that investment contributes to the value creation that we can get from our brands. And our focus, as you know, has been on improving our ROI given the fact that we are driving personalization. So we wanted to get to know 100 million consumers in the U.S. And what getting to know 100 million consumers does is it allows you to know them better and it allows you to personalize to them. And we've had the added benefit of driving efficiency and effectiveness by doing that. So we're getting the right people, the right message at the right time and spending our money more effectively. And if you look across the advertising we said in our prepared remarks that, that was more heavily concentrated in the U.S. where we had lots of good opportunities. and was pretty widespread across our businesses. And you saw the strength across all segments with organic sales growth across all four. And again, as we head into fiscal year '24, we'll let you know what we think the right level of advertising spending will be, but you can hear that our commitment to that as the way we create value remains steadfast.\nOlivia Tong: Got it. That's helpful. And then I just have a few specific questions on Kingsford. If you could just remind us first where Kingsford margins stand relative to company average. And then obviously, a lot of pricing this quarter. How much of that pricing acceleration that you saw in Q3 was driven by Kingsford versus the other brands where you saw competition in follow (ph) pricing?\nKevin Jacobsen: Olivia, I'll answer on gross margin and we don't provide gross margin at individual brand level, but it's a nice profitable contributor to the company. And I'm sorry, can you repeat your second question? I'm not sure that was tracking.\nOlivia Tong: Sure. Would you mind just giving us a sense in terms of Kingsford relative to company average then? And then also, how much of that pricing acceleration that you saw in Q3 was driven by Kingsford versus other brands where you did see the competition follow your pricing?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah. On the margin, we don't share other than I'll just give you direct message, it\u2019s a nice business for us and so we're quite happy when we get increased sales in Kingsford. As it relates to pricing, I would say I'm not sure I fully understand your question. But I would say overall, Kingsford is not as large in Q3, your question about how Kingsford usually contributed to pricing. As I mentioned earlier, we do about 50% of our sales in our fourth quarter on the Kingsford business, so it has a very outsized impact on the company. But in Q3, that's really early season for Kingsford. And so it's less meaningful in terms of the impact it has on our performance.\nOlivia Tong: Got it. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo.\nChris Carey: Hi, everyone.\nLinda Rendle: Hi, Chris.\nChris Carey: So I'm just digesting a lot of the questions on this earnings call around sequential momentum in gross margin, which was great. It sounds like the underlying momentum will continue into Q4. I guess the question I want to ask is just philosophy on investment, right, because of this gross margin trajectory continues and you don't materially step up spending, you're going to be looking at a very, very significant year of earnings growth in fiscal '24, right? And I know you're not going to comment on fiscal '24, but certainly, this is the reality when you flow through these gross margins to the model. And I think these questions on investment are well taken and where you want to spend. But if 10% of sales is the right number, then it would imply that you're going to be spending an enormous amount on S&A? And I guess, just maybe help us understand where the types of areas where you might want to lean in, if you're now clearly over delivering on the gross margin line? If not an advertising? Are there areas of SG&A that you felt like have been underinvested in that you have opportunity over the next four to six quarters as if you look at the normalization of the P&L over the next couple of years? And just connected to that, there's been this target of 13% estimate as a percentage of sales out there. Is that still a relevant target over the near to medium term? Thanks, Rendle.\nLinda Rendle: Sure, Chris. I'll start and then ask if Kevin wants to add anything after I finish. Just maybe taking a step back in what we're trying to accomplish. And we talked about the balance that we want to strike between maintaining top line growth and rebuilding margins and ensuring given the incredibly volatile and uncertain environment that we're taking all the actions we can control to do both of those things. And we are pleased with the progress that we've made on both of them. If you look at our growth, if you look at any kind of three-year average over quarters, et cetera., it puts us at the top end of our growth algorithm and then we're making nice progress on margin. I think Kevin highlighted why Q3 between onetime less deleveraging than we expected, what we expect in Q4, really happy with the margin performance that it's nothing that we should expect as outsized in Q4. Obviously not providing a fiscal year '24 outlook, but let me just give you how we're thinking about the environment and what's going on out there. We want to continue to maintain that balance on top line growth and margin improvement. We still think it's a multiyear journey to rebuild margins. And we think the uncertainty from a consumer perspective in '24 is going to continue to remain high. And that's very difficult to predict right now exactly what the inflationary environment will look like when -- if we will hit a recession, and then, of course, what the corresponding impact will be to the consumer. And it is very likely that they could become under more pressure. And so what we're taking this out is another good quarter. We need to continue to control or controlling. We want to continue that into fiscal year '24. And then we want to make the right investments to your good point to support that business. And we believe in advertising, supporting innovation, which we continue to feel very strongly about ensuring we have the right capital plans against our business, which we feel we do. And we'll look at all of those hard in '24 to make sure that we're making the right choices. And we're not afraid to invest if we need to, to support both that top line growth and rebuilding margins. We'll have more specifics, of course, and we talk to you again in August about what that means for '24. But just know that the posture we're going into is we're committed to that margin growth, committed to maintaining top line and then making all the necessary adjustments to do that at the right pace.\nChris Carey: Okay. Thanks for that. That's a very fair just on the -- just one quick follow-up on Olivia's question. The way I understood it was, did Kingsford atypically contribute the pricing in Q3. And as such, to get back in Q4. I'm not exactly sure that's what you meant, but that was the question I had. So I figured it ask you as well. Thanks so much.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes. Chris, on pricing, as I think you may recall, we took pricing pretty broadly across our portfolio in December. So Kingsford was one of a number of brands repriced. And so as I said, Kingsford did not have an outsized impact and because it is low season, it had fairly small impact. So I don't expect to see any meaningful change in Q4 as it relates to the pricing we took and specifically what Kingsford contributed to that pricing overall because again, pricing is just one brand and we priced a good portion of our portfolio in December.\nChris Carey: Okay. Thanks so much.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah. Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Javier Escalante with Evercore ISI.\nJavier Escalante: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. My question has to do with SG&A and if you could, first, operationally, tell us what you have accomplished on this digital investment that you are making financially is $0.63. It's been excluded of consensus what is reasonable to think as recurring cost going into fiscal '24?\nLinda Rendle: Hi, Javier. I'll start just with a reminder of what our digital program entails and how we're thinking about it. And then if there's any specifics we want to provide, Kevin can talk about the specifics of the spend for this year and how we're thinking about it moving forward. So we're investing, as you know, $500 million to transform our company digitally. And this, of course, is putting in the right technologies, including a new ERP, but it really is around changing the processes and the work that everyone at Clorox does to be faster and simpler. And we see this supporting both our top line momentum as we put in place innovation capabilities, better access to consumer data to drive insights and speed of decision-making as well as efficiencies as we have the ability to look across our supply chain and make decisions that reduce costs. This investment is on track. I think Kevin highlighted that to begin with. We'll see differences year-to-year. We're in the second year of the program, but the team continues to be on track implementing against that. What we've said is, most of the investment is upfront, but you get the majority of the benefit as you start to exit our IGNITE strategy or in 2025. And that's because you're putting all of those capabilities and technologies in place and changing how the entire company works and operates. And then we continue to be on track for that. This is a very high-return project for us. When Kevin and I evaluated this, we looked at the return and we track that project by project to ensure we're getting that return, and we continue to be on track to deliver good value on this over the long term. As it comes to specifics, we talked about in our release that we are about to implement the first region of our ERP coming up this calendar year. That is on track. -- as well as some of the other technology improvements that we've made. And of course, we have paired that with an operating model change that is also on track and in fact, a little bit ahead from a cost savings perspective this year as we were able to implement some of those changes faster. But those two things in combination are really about being fast, simple and more cost effective company that we -- that we want to be and to develop the type of resiliency and strength we can to weather whatever comes our way, another pandemic or whatever else the macroeconomic or geopolitical environment throws our way.\nJavier Escalante: So just to clarify, there is no recurring cost associated with the $0.63 in digital spending that you are making in fiscal '23?\nKevin Jacobsen: Sure. Hi, Javier. As it relates to the spending, what will happen is the $500 million is the cost, the investment to put these new systems in place. I think through the end of this year, we'll be a little less than halfway through that spend. So it will be somewhere around $230 million, $240 million. And then that will continue as we complete the program over the next three years. That's the one-time investment with this in place. Now there are all ongoing maintenance costs, which we have in our legacy systems now that when those get shut off, there will be ongoing maintenance costs for a cloud-based system that we'll continue to pay. But the $500 million is the cost of the investment in this technology to get it put in place.\nJavier Escalante: That's very helpful. And if you changing topics, if you can comment underlying category growth on a volume basis so we can compare it versus your 11% decline now that Omicron is behind us? And if you can give that assessment of volume category growth when it comes to your household penetration, Clorox products versus 2019? Thank you very much.\nLinda Rendle: As you would expect, given the elasticities of what we spoke about and the fact that our pricing is generally in line with category pricing, category volumes were down, and we've absolutely expected that to be the case. If you look at dollar sales, so if you look at consumption, high-single digits in our categories, which continues to show the strength and resilience of the consumer in our categories. Given we compete in Essentials, this is something that we expected. We're watching really closely as the consumer continues to react to pricing and as they continue to react to the macroeconomic environment. But right now feeling very good about the category position that we're in and consumer response to pricing. Generally, we would expect over time as we begin to lap category pricing and see category volumes return and get to that place where you see low-single digit growth in our categories from a volume perspective over time. We are certainly not at that point right now. as we have nine more months to lap pricing. And then, of course, we'll see what plays out from a commodity perspective and any required pricing that happens in the future that would also impact that. The only other thing that I would say as it relates to pricing and you think about volumes. We're not seeing that type of trade down either as it relates to consumers making choices for private label, et cetera. That's been pretty steady. As we highlighted earlier, our shares in aggregate, are flat. We grew in five of nine categories. We have seen private label increase share a bit in some of our categories, but it's not coming from us. It looks like it's coming from other brands and that there is a simplifying of the category, and it all relates to the value that we offer consumers 76% of our portfolio is still deem secure by consumers. We've continued to invest in that. So volume is what we expect in the categories. And again, we expect that to bounce back over time as we continue to invest in innovation and advertising and in category growth plans with our retailers.\nJavier Escalante: And the household penetration statistics, do you have them?\nLinda Rendle: Sure. Yeah. On Household penetration is still very high for the Clorox portfolio. We're still in about nine out of 10 homes, and as we spoke about last quarter, household penetration is something we expect to decline in a time when you take extraordinary pricing. But that's not a clock phenomenon. It is a category phenomenon. And what you see is people using those more price sensitive behaviors. They're letting a trash bag, fill longer. They're stretching their time in between cleanings they're doing those things to make their wallet stretch, and that results in usually category penetration declining and we are seeing that. What I would say, though, is we see no difference in our brands versus the category, and we would expect over time to rebuild category penetration as we rebuild volumes.\nJavier Escalante: That\u2019s all for me. Thank you very much. Very helpful.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks, Javier.\nOperator: We'll hear next from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nStephen Robert: Very thanks. Actually, it's a good lead in. I just wanted to pick up on that household penetration discussion. Last quarter, we were talking about it. And I think the framing was that you were looking to rebuild household penetration over the course of 2024 and then looking longer term, obviously. Just in response to, I think, to Lauren's question earlier on volume growth, Kevin, your response, if I heard it correctly, you emphasized stabilization of volumes. So I just want to marry you kind of tie those two things together and make sure I'm grounded in the right takeaway because if we're rebuilding household penetration over the course of '24, I think that implies positive volume, whereas you emphasized stabilization of volume. I know it's maybe splitting hairs, but just wanted to think of -- just kind of understand how you're thinking about it? Maybe it's a progression over the course of '24, but just -- so I don't walk away the wrong impression. Thank you.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah, Steve. Thanks for the question. As it relates to volumes, I think for the next three quarters, given that the pricing we just took in December, we would expect to [indiscernible] volumes decline and view with grow top line based on price mix as we get past that pricing and assume we don't have any other large-scale pricing in our plan, then I think the balances start switching. And as we target that 3% to 5% top line growth, you're driving that more through volume versus price mix. So then I think it reverses and then volume starts to be the primary driver of our top line, supplemented with our innovation and trading consumers up, but more volume driven as we target 3% to 5% over the long term. . But I think we\u2019re probably still a number of quarters away before we get to that more stable environment. We\u2019ll return to a more traditional model of top line being more driven by volume and price mix.\nStephen Robert: Okay. Thank you very much.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah. Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.\nJason English: Hey. Good afternoon, folks. Thanks for sorting me in. A couple of questions. Let's start with maybe the trade down. To Lauren's question earlier, you're clearly losing some volume share in a number of categories. You're seeing usage occasions like they're not going through cheaper products, their trade down. Where are you seeing those lost usage occasions out of your brand? Like, where is it going, if it's not going to it's a trade down?\nLinda Rendle: Yeah, Jason. It's very dependent on category the consumer behavior. But what I would say is we noticed big buckets of the following: First, we see consumers trading to larger sizes, and they're looking for the best cost per use, for example. We also see certain consumers trading down to lower sizes because they're looking for the lowest out-of-pocket price point, and they're willing to pay on a higher per use basis because they only have a certain amount of money to get them through their shopping cycle for that period of time. We're also seeing people trade within our portfolio, for example, so where somebody might use a more expensive cleaner, they are using a dilutable cleaner or a bleach cleaner and willing to put more elbow grease in to get that same amount of clean and trade off that pricing convenience. And then we're seeing behaviors and this is really consistent across the category where people are just trying to stretch something more. So they're getting every less spray out of a bottle. They are using a wipe longer, they're stuffing a trash bag, and that's pretty consistent across the category. But really, those 3 1st buckets are the really important ones as we see people trade into different sizes and then, of course, adjust their behavior. And the good news for us is, in many cases, we're able to capture that consumer because we offer different levels of convenience, for example, in our cleaning business.\nJason English: Okay. And Kevin, can you -- you mentioned a couple of sort of onetime transitory benefits this quarter. Can you remind me what they were and quantify them? And then related, maybe do the adjusted math on this. Gross profit, we're all benchmarking is pre-COVID, right? How you -- as you are, too, when you mentioned like recovery to margins, your gross profit, I think, was up adjusted 19% versus 3Q '19. And cumulative volume growth of three, suggesting that unit economics are up a lot, like 15.5% versus pre-COVID. And almost to Chris' question, like, why you hold this? Like you're going to blow through a $3.2 billion, $3.3 billion gross profit next year at that level. So what is anything unusual or is that like -- that's it, your unit economics are that much better and we can run rate this?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah, Jason. The two questions, I think the first question you had was onetime benefits in the quarter. We had two. The first one was on trade spending. We have a normal process at the end of the second quarter. We evaluate our trade spending accrual. In this case, we're not seeing the promotional environment increased at the rate we expected. So we reduced our trade spending accrual. That was a onetime benefit in the quarter. . And then the other onetime benefit was one of our competitors had an out of stock in our dilutable category. And so our Pine saw business saw a pretty nice performance, double-digit growth as a result of that out of stock. Now the combination is back on shelves. So we don't expect that to continue back to a more normalized level of competition. So those two items are the ones we highlighted is fairly unique for the quarter that we don't expect to continue into Q4. That generated about 2 points of top line benefit and about 100 basis points of margin benefit for the quarter. And then on unit economics, yes, we're in mean rebuilding gross margins and we are going to be. We expect to be a much larger company than we were before the pandemic. We went into the pandemic with a little over $6 billion in sales. As you know, we're seeing a little over $7 billion right now. So you would expect gross profit to be higher because as we rebuild gross margins, and we are a bigger company that will generate more gross profit. So ultimately, we expect that to occur as we rebuild margins over time. But as Linda said, we think that's a multiyear journey to get there. We'll have to see how much progress we make in '24, we're developing those plans right now. But that is certainly our intent is to rebuild gross margin and have the results or the impact of gross profit as it relates to a larger company.\nJason English: Okay. Yeah. It sounds like this is a good benchmark. It's a run rate then. Thank you. I'll pass it on.\nKevin Jacobsen: Thanks, Jason.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Great. Thanks,. Good afternoon, A couple for me, a cleanup on the SG&A, Kevin, I apologize if I missed this. It looks like your SG&A on an underlying basis, ex the digital moved up about 50 basis points from your prior guidance. What's driving that?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah. Kevin, if you just -- I'll talk Q3 and talk full year. So in Q3, a little over 16%. We had a couple of items. We had the digital transformation, which we highlighted is about 150 basis points. We also had about 40 basis points from our operating model changes. A portion of those restructuring set in SG&A, a portion sits in link. And so you're seeing some of that flow through in SG&A. And then the other one was we have higher expected incentive compensation. We have a very strong pay-for-performance philosophy. And as we've taken our goals up for the year. We expect our incentive compensation will be higher as well. So we baked that in. So as a result, we went from 15% to 16% was our expectation last quarter and now we're expecting closer to 16% for the year.\nKevin Grundy: Got it. A couple more for me real quick. Just to walk from like the 14.5% this year to 13% ambition longer-term understanding it's going to take some time to get there. But sort of broad brush strokes, what gets you from 14.5% this year to 13.5% over a reasonable amount of time?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah. I would say one is, if you just get to a normalized level of incentive compensation, it's going to be above target is our expectation this year. But if you just go back to a target payout, you pick up 40 to 50 bps there. And then our expectation, you start looking at the operating model we talked about, so $75 million to $100 million. We're going to generate about $35 million of our expectation this year, but that's a nice contributor as you look at '24 and beyond. And then you start getting the benefits from our digital transformation. We're still very early in that process. But over time, as we bring a new technology online, we're going to see more productivity opportunities. And so collectively, when you look at all that together, that's the path for how we believe we get to 13% as we look forward over the next several years.\nKevin Grundy: Got it. Thank you, Kevin. One quick follow-up, if I can. I was going to ask on trade promotion and it kind of came up end of your response. Again, like from our perspective, hard to gauge sort of order of magnitude with the decision to take down the accrual. But I think like collectively everyone on the call would think promotion levels moving higher and not lower, and I guess, particularly in your categories. So I was going to -- a question for both of you. I was going to ask Linda just how you're thinking about freight promotion risk around that? Are you starting to have those conversations already? Are retailers starting to push already? They see what's going on with resin and inflation more broadly. They see what's happening with this gross margin start to inflect. Are you starting to get more pressure there? And Kevin, maybe you could just jump in and sort of comment on the decision to take down a trade accrual with the likelihood the trade promotion is going to move higher over the next 12 months? And then I can pass it on. Thank you for that.\nLinda Rendle: Sure, Kevin. We're continuing to see the promotional environment normalize. And the dynamic that happened is we expect the promotional environment to increase this quarter but did not increase as much as we expected. And that's a dynamic and then Kevin can talk about the accrual as it relates to that. As we look just broader, though, in the environment on promotion, that stays a very specific role for our categories. We talked about in the past that more than 90% of our business is done off the shelf with no pricing discount and promotion plays a role to ensure that we talk to consumers about innovation. We talked to them around key holidays and pulse points where consumers are looking, for example, back-to-school or back to college or around cold and flu. And we use that to ensure that we're speaking to consumers about our products, the values they offer and new innovation. That continues to be the focus that we have on the promotional environment, and those are the discussions we continue to have with retailers. We're not afraid to use promotional dollars if we have price gaps that we need to adjust on a temporary basis, and we will do that. We are doing that right now, as we have a couple of price gaps that are out of line that we spoke to earlier. But generally, Primo continues to be a strategic investment lever for us to ensure that we're in front of the consumer when we need to be and when it matters from an innovation and pulse point period. perspective.\nKevin Jacobsen: And then I would just add as it relates to the trade accrual specifically and Linda said it well, which is it's not that we expect tradesmen to go down. It's just not growing at the rate we expected. We -- before the pandemic, about 25% of our product was sold in some form of promotion. In our most recent quarter is at 20%. And if I look at Q3 a year it goes at 19%. So it is increasing. We expect that we get back to more of that pre-pandemic level faster. And so the reduction in accrual is just recognizing it's not as growing as fast as we had anticipated, but we do expect to continue to increase.\nKevin Grundy: Understood. Thank you., both. I appreciate it. Good luck.\nKevin Jacobsen: Thanks, Keving.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer session. Ms. Rendle, I'd now like to turn the program back to you.\nLinda Rendle: Thank you, everyone. We look forward to speaking with you again on our next call in August. And until then, please stay well.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Jacobsen",
            "content": "Andrea, this is Kevin. Thank you for the question. Maybe I can start with our expectations for Q4. And as you saw, we delivered 8% organic sales growth in the third quarter, which is stronger than we anticipated. And you may have seen Andrea, in our prepared remarks, there is about 2 points that were one-time in nature, and I'm happy to talk about those. But if I set those aside, we delivered about 6 points organic sales growth. If you look at our outlook for Q4, our full year outlook, and you can back into it. We're projecting about 3% to 6% organic growth. I would say at the high end of that range, it would look very like it did in Q3. We expect continued strong consumption. The business is performing well. I think the one watch out we have and you mentioned it is our Kingsford business. While we had very strong performance in the third quarter, Kingsford was a one business that came in below our expectations. And you may have seen in our prepared remarks, we're seeing an increased level of competitive activity and we're not seeing competition move to the same degree we moved on pricing. That was one of the businesses we priced in December and we've seen price gaps widen and as a result, we saw our shares decline in the third quarter. Now the team with that in mind they've gone back and they've adjusted their plans in Q4, so we're increasing our support for the business in the fourth quarter. But it's certainly something we're watching, and Andrea, you may know this that business has an outsized impact on our fourth quarter. We do about 50% of our total sales in Kingsford happened in the fourth quarter. So it's clearly something we're keeping a close eye on. We think we have good plans in place that we've adjusted to reflect what we learned in Q3, but we're watching that closely, particularly around the key holidays, and it's a little early to tell how Memorial Day or July 4 plays out. And I think if we have a good successful season, we'll be at the top end of that range, which is pretty consistent in Q3. But if it delivers below our expectations, I think that would be a reason why we'd be towards the lower end of the range for the fourth quarter. Hi, Peter. Yeah. Thanks for the question on gross margin. I would not look at it as stepping down in Q4. If I look at our Q3 performance, and as you mentioned, we delivered a 41.8%, there's about 1 point of benefit from the one-time items we highlighted. So if I set that aside, it's sort of an ongoing basis, we're a little under 41%. If you look at our raised outlook for the full year, we're now looking at 38.5% to 39%. You can back into the fourth quarter and now suggest we get to about 40% to 41%. So I would say our fourth quarter is very much in line with what we delivered in the third quarter, if I just set aside the onetime benefit we had. And so we expect the good strong performance we delivered this quarter to continue on into the fourth quarter. Yeah. Peter, as it relates to gross margin, Lynn and I remain committed to getting back to pre-pandemic levels that's work that's well underway, and we intend to get there. I'm going to be cautious about providing in the outlook for fiscal year '24. We're still in the process of developing our plans. So it's a bit too early for that. But I would say at a high level, you should expect when you see our plans, it will be very much focused on the same priorities we've been driving this year. We're going to continue to drive top line growth. We fully expect to continue to make progress, expanding gross margins and rebuilding them. And then we'll continue to advance our strategic priorities. The challenge with the gross margin, I know there's a lot of interest in exactly when we get to pre-pandemic levels is. On the elements, we control, I feel very good about the progress we're making and we've talked a lot about those drivers. I would say those initiatives are primarily on track or exceeding our expectations. But the reality is there's a real impact from the areas we don't control, either supply chain disruptions or inflation. And as I said in the past, I really think that inflationary component will either accelerate or delay our time to recovery, depending on how that plays out over the next 12 months to 24 months. And I frankly don't think anyone's got a particularly good crystal ball right now to predict that. And so we're going to continue to focus on those things we can control. We're making really good progress. I expect that progress to continue in fiscal year '24. But I think it's a little premature for us to make an exact call on where we think we'll be by the end of '24. Yeah. Thanks, Peter. Yeah. Thanks, Anna for the question. As it relates to commodity inflation, it is still an inflationary environment. Now it is moderating that level of inflation. But to give you a perspective, in Q1, we had 330 basis points of commodity inflation; in Q3, at 230 basis points. And so we've seen some moderation, but still an inflationary environment. As we've said, resin is a one product rebuy that we are seeing deflation. We've seen that for a good part of the year but that's being more than offset by most of the other products we purchase. And so it continues to be inflationary. We had called about $400 million in total supply chain inflation, about half of that from commodities and half from other areas at the beginning of the year and that still looks like the right call. We still expect about $400 million of inflation. And so I expect to exit this year still operating in an inflationary environment as it relates to commodities. Now as it relates to manufacturing and logistics, I'd say the one area we are starting to see prices come down year-over-year, at least that's our expectations on transportation. It has stabilized in the third quarter. And then our expectations in the fourth quarter, we'll start to see transportation on a year-over-year basis to be lower. But keep in mind, when we talk logistics, there's really three pieces in there. There's transportation, which I think is moving to a deflationary market as we're seeing less demand for goods and more trucks available. But that also includes warehousing and what we call our diesel surcharge and we continue to see inflation in those other two elements. So logistics continue to be a headwind, but transportation piece of logistics, we're starting to see that decline, at least that's our expectation for the fourth quarter. I don't. I mean a little bit of the Q3 benefit mix and assortment is our cleaning business, particularly wipes because we're lapping Omicron, our wipes business is down and bigly when you get to large multipacks. And so that was a benefit in the quarter that I expect them to get back down to a more normalized mix of our cleaning portfolio, I would not see that continue in Q4. Thanks, Anna. Sure. Yeah. Thanks, Dara. As it relates to Q4, I'd say the one item I would add to your list and you're exactly right. We expect some moderation in cost inputs as we move from Q3 to Q4. The counterbalance of that is on pricing. We believe Q3 will be the strongest benefit from pricing. As we move into Q4, we're now lapping two price increases, the first two rounds we took. And so I would expect that we'll see less benefit from pricing in Q4, essentially offset by more moderating cost environment. So collectively, we get back to that 40, 41, which is fairly consistent with Q3, seeing a little less inflation and a little less benefit from pricing about offsetting. And then as it relates to Q3, probably the biggest benefit above what we expected is volume deleveraging. We went into the quarter expecting based on elasticities that we would see volumes down in the mid-teens range. And as you saw, our volume was down about 11%. So that stronger top line performance that really drove through the entire P&L. We overdelivered on sales relative to our expectations, but it also contributed to a strong gross margin as well as EPS. So that was really the biggest change versus our expectations. And as I mentioned earlier, Peter, the cost inflation is generally in line with what we expected. That was true for Q3 and we still expect about $400 million of cost inflation for the full year. Sure. Hi, Filippo. As it relates to Q4, I won't give a buy line forecast for the fourth quarter, but you should expect that the price benefit to margin we saw in Q3 is a high watermark this year. And then now as we really start lapping that second price increase, you'll start to see that pull back. I'd say more in the range, somewhere in that Q1 to Q2 range, generally in that area. So we'll see that start to step down. And that should continue to play out that way for the next three quarters until we fully lap the last round of pricing we took in December, it will continue to step down in value over time. And then your question on list price changes, I think you may have read in our prepared remarks, we do not have any additional large scale pricing in our plans for the balance of this fiscal year. We will continue to work on place back architecture (ph) changes. And then we'll evaluate we're developing our plans for '24. So we'll come back to you in August and we'll share more details about our plans about how much would be pricing and how we would execute that pricing is a little too early to have that conversation. What I would say though, maybe longer term is, I think as we get through this inflationary cycle and we get back to an appropriate level of margins, I would expect us to get back to a more normalized level of how we grow the top line, which is more volume dependent and we'll continue to focus on innovation, consumer trade-up and some price back architecture be much more volume driven than price mix driven and so I think you'll see that evolve over time. But we're still very much in the mode where it's being more driven by price mix and I expect that to continue for another three quarters until we lap all this pricing. Lauren, I'd say a few things on volume. I think one thing that continues to benefit is, as you know, is we chose to use contract manufacturers mean that significant spike, so we did not overbuild our facilities that allowed us to, as volume moderated we were able to set those agreements down and not be left with a lot of unused capacity internally. And so I think that's benefited us. I think -- as I mentioned, I think to Filippo, as we move forward now, depending on where pricing goes in fiscal year '24, but given the pricing we've taken, I would expect price mix to continue to moderate and the volume declines to moderate as well as we cycle through this pricing. And so as I said, short of any future pricing being taken, I think we've probably got a three more quarters or so, we're seeing price/mix driving the top line to a greater extent of volume. But I think that will level and balance out as we look further out into our fiscal year '24 and so I think that's when we get to a more steady state of volume. And what we try to do is be thoughtful about ensuring we're building our manufacturing capacity to be in line with these plans and not getting ahead of ourselves. And so that's the work we've been doing with our supply chain team to try to make sure we don't end up in a position where once we get to the steady state, we've got too much capacity in our facilities. I think we're in pretty good shape, but that's something we continue to evaluate and continue to adjust our plans. But certainly, it's something we're keeping a close eye on. Yea. Sure. Thanks for the question. As it relates to our digital transformation that program is very much on track. As you know, it's a five year program, and we plan to spend $500 million, no change in our expectation. We are seeing a little bit of a shifting between years. This is the second year of the five-year program. We started the year out, expecting we spend about $150 million, $90 million of OpEx, about $60 million of CapEx and that $90 million equates to about $0.55. We have now raised our total spending to about $160 million, so from $150 million to $160 million. And that's just a little bit of shift in timing between years. We're not changing the overall expected spend as a result of pulling a little bit of that forward into fiscal year '23, we've raised our expectation about $10 million and that's that $0.07 you mentioned, Lauren. Thanks, Lauren. Olivia, I'll answer on gross margin and we don't provide gross margin at individual brand level, but it's a nice profitable contributor to the company. And I'm sorry, can you repeat your second question? I'm not sure that was tracking. Yeah. On the margin, we don't share other than I'll just give you direct message, it's a nice business for us and so we're quite happy when we get increased sales in Kingsford. As it relates to pricing, I would say I'm not sure I fully understand your question. But I would say overall, Kingsford is not as large in Q3, your question about how Kingsford usually contributed to pricing. As I mentioned earlier, we do about 50% of our sales in our fourth quarter on the Kingsford business, so it has a very outsized impact on the company. But in Q3, that's really early season for Kingsford. And so it's less meaningful in terms of the impact it has on our performance. Yes. Chris, on pricing, as I think you may recall, we took pricing pretty broadly across our portfolio in December. So Kingsford was one of a number of brands repriced. And so as I said, Kingsford did not have an outsized impact and because it is low season, it had fairly small impact. So I don't expect to see any meaningful change in Q4 as it relates to the pricing we took and specifically what Kingsford contributed to that pricing overall because again, pricing is just one brand and we priced a good portion of our portfolio in December. Yeah. Thanks, Chris. Sure. Hi, Javier. As it relates to the spending, what will happen is the $500 million is the cost, the investment to put these new systems in place. I think through the end of this year, we'll be a little less than halfway through that spend. So it will be somewhere around $230 million, $240 million. And then that will continue as we complete the program over the next three years. That's the one-time investment with this in place. Now there are all ongoing maintenance costs, which we have in our legacy systems now that when those get shut off, there will be ongoing maintenance costs for a cloud-based system that we'll continue to pay. But the $500 million is the cost of the investment in this technology to get it put in place. Yeah, Steve. Thanks for the question. As it relates to volumes, I think for the next three quarters, given that the pricing we just took in December, we would expect to [indiscernible] volumes decline and view with grow top line based on price mix as we get past that pricing and assume we don't have any other large-scale pricing in our plan, then I think the balances start switching. And as we target that 3% to 5% top line growth, you're driving that more through volume versus price mix. So then I think it reverses and then volume starts to be the primary driver of our top line, supplemented with our innovation and trading consumers up, but more volume driven as we target 3% to 5% over the long term. . But I think we're probably still a number of quarters away before we get to that more stable environment. We'll return to a more traditional model of top line being more driven by volume and price mix. Yeah. Thanks, Steve. Yeah, Jason. The two questions, I think the first question you had was onetime benefits in the quarter. We had two. The first one was on trade spending. We have a normal process at the end of the second quarter. We evaluate our trade spending accrual. In this case, we're not seeing the promotional environment increased at the rate we expected. So we reduced our trade spending accrual. That was a onetime benefit in the quarter. . And then the other onetime benefit was one of our competitors had an out of stock in our dilutable category. And so our Pine saw business saw a pretty nice performance, double-digit growth as a result of that out of stock. Now the combination is back on shelves. So we don't expect that to continue back to a more normalized level of competition. So those two items are the ones we highlighted is fairly unique for the quarter that we don't expect to continue into Q4. That generated about 2 points of top line benefit and about 100 basis points of margin benefit for the quarter. And then on unit economics, yes, we're in mean rebuilding gross margins and we are going to be. We expect to be a much larger company than we were before the pandemic. We went into the pandemic with a little over $6 billion in sales. As you know, we're seeing a little over $7 billion right now. So you would expect gross profit to be higher because as we rebuild gross margins, and we are a bigger company that will generate more gross profit. So ultimately, we expect that to occur as we rebuild margins over time. But as Linda said, we think that's a multiyear journey to get there. We'll have to see how much progress we make in '24, we're developing those plans right now. But that is certainly our intent is to rebuild gross margin and have the results or the impact of gross profit as it relates to a larger company. Thanks, Jason. Yeah. Kevin, if you just -- I'll talk Q3 and talk full year. So in Q3, a little over 16%. We had a couple of items. We had the digital transformation, which we highlighted is about 150 basis points. We also had about 40 basis points from our operating model changes. A portion of those restructuring set in SG&A, a portion sits in link. And so you're seeing some of that flow through in SG&A. And then the other one was we have higher expected incentive compensation. We have a very strong pay-for-performance philosophy. And as we've taken our goals up for the year. We expect our incentive compensation will be higher as well. So we baked that in. So as a result, we went from 15% to 16% was our expectation last quarter and now we're expecting closer to 16% for the year. Yeah. I would say one is, if you just get to a normalized level of incentive compensation, it's going to be above target is our expectation this year. But if you just go back to a target payout, you pick up 40 to 50 bps there. And then our expectation, you start looking at the operating model we talked about, so $75 million to $100 million. We're going to generate about $35 million of our expectation this year, but that's a nice contributor as you look at '24 and beyond. And then you start getting the benefits from our digital transformation. We're still very early in that process. But over time, as we bring a new technology online, we're going to see more productivity opportunities. And so collectively, when you look at all that together, that's the path for how we believe we get to 13% as we look forward over the next several years. And then I would just add as it relates to the trade accrual specifically and Linda said it well, which is it's not that we expect tradesmen to go down. It's just not growing at the rate we expected. We -- before the pandemic, about 25% of our product was sold in some form of promotion. In our most recent quarter is at 20%. And if I look at Q3 a year it goes at 19%. So it is increasing. We expect that we get back to more of that pre-pandemic level faster. And so the reduction in accrual is just recognizing it's not as growing as fast as we had anticipated, but we do expect to continue to increase. Thanks, Keving."

            "name": "Linda Rendle",
            "content": "Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We delivered strong results in the third quarter and made a challenging operating and cost environment, with organic sales growth in all four segments, gross margin expansion and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our performance reflects solid execution by our team, the strength and resilience of our portfolio, the superior value of our brands and the relevance of our IGNITE strategy. Based on our strong performance, we're raising our fiscal year outlook. During the quarter, we made great progress through building margin while maintaining top line growth. Net sales grew above our long-term target and we delivered our second consecutive quarter of gross margin improvement supported by cost justified pricing and decade high cost savings. We also made further progress on our IGNITE priorities, investing in our brands and innovation pipeline, while advancing our digital transformation and streamlined operating model to create a stronger, more resilient company. While we're encouraged by our progress to-date, we're relentlessly focused on controlling what we can to drive and appropriately balance both top line and bottom line growth. Looking ahead, we expect the operating environment to remain volatile and challenging. Despite recent moderation in pockets of input costs, overall inflationary headwinds continue to be strong. In light of this and ongoing macro uncertainty, we're watching consumer reactions very closely given the potential for them to come under greater pressure and we are prepared to adapt plans as necessary. Regardless, we have trusted brands and essential categories, which we continue to invest behind. I remain confident that our actions position us well to navigate this environment to deliver consistent profitable growth over time. With that, Kevin and I will take your questions. Andrea, I'll take VMS. So as you're all aware, VMS is a small portion of our portfolio. It's about 3% of sales right now and has continued to face challenging market dynamics from a category perspective, what we're seeing coming out of COVID. And then, of course, we've highlighted the performance issues on that business. And we've reassessed that business as it relates to the role it plays in our portfolio. As Kevin highlighted, we're seeing strong results across the majority of our businesses. And we think it's the right step now to look at resource allocation and allocate resources to businesses we think how higher growth potential and therefore, making a bigger focus on profitability in the VMS business. And that's what the team will be laser focused on moving forward. That includes, like I said, moving resources to businesses that have growth potential as well as continuing to narrow our focus on core brands. And we think that's the right role for the business moving forward. Given that, that's what triggered the non-cash impairment, but we feel like we have the right plans moving forward. And as it relates to our portfolio, we're always doing that work with our Board. We'll continue to do that. But right now, we're focused on driving more profitability in the VMS business as we own it today. Yeah. Certainly, for wipes, that was a business or one of the business most impacted by COVID. And as we noted, in Q3, we were lapping the Omicron variants and then begin to get to a period where we're more normalized from a COVID perspective with wipes. But it definitely has been bumpy over the last few years as we've gone through that. But we've been very pleased with the performance on the wipes business. We've continually grown share quarter-after-quarter for the last well 12 months over 18 months now on wipes. We've regained significant distribution. Our merchandising plans, while lower than they were pre-pandemic are stronger than they have been and that's behind our ability to supply and we are able to fully supply that business now. And we continue to see consumers turn to us in times of cold and flu. Even with a season that was moved up, we saw strong consumer reaction from a cold and flu perspective. So we feel good about the future of that business. We continue to have a good innovation pipeline. And if you look at our shares, they certainly support the fact that what we thought would happen with all the tertiary brands launched did as we return to strong share leadership and continue to grow that share position. Sure. I'll start with the portfolio and then get a little deeper on Kingsford. So from a price gap perspective, the pricing we took a few months ago went generally as expected. And we've seen pockets of price gaps. And frankly, we're still closing some of those, and we've adjusted some of our plans on the businesses where we've had issues. For the most part, our price gaps are in line to where we expected them to be. Kingsford, as you call out is the biggest gap that we have right now as competition did not follow that price increase in full. And that's one that we are making adjustments to our plan, and we have those already beginning to show up in market in Q4. Part of that would be trade related. We're ensuring we have the right merchandising plans to support the right price points, but we're also focused on market baskets with retailers, which is one of the biggest opportunities given the overall basket for the consumer in the drilling space is under pressure with protein prices being up, and of course, the rest of the things that go on the grill. So we're focused on supporting those enhanced merchandising plans, and we'll expect to see that play out as we head into Q4. That being said, though, we are laser-focused on any price gap issues that we have in pockets and we have plans ready to adjust, and we will do that on select other areas of our portfolio where we continue to see gaps. But what I'd say is there's so much noise as prices fluctuate and as promotion starts to come back into the marketplace that we're being incredibly cautious to ensure that we have the right value for our brands and maintain that superior brand value with consumers but not get ahead of ourselves from a trade perspective. And I think that balance has been working, and we'll continue to do that in Q4 and beyond as we manage price gaps. Sure, Lauren. So on share overall, we were happy to maintain share in aggregate, and we grew share in five of our nine businesses and continue to grow share in the growth markets around the world. That being said, of course, our goal is to grow share and I've been transparent about that, that we're not satisfied into that zone, but we are really pleased to see given the level of pricing that we've taken that our shares have held up. And of course, we are talking about dollar share, and if you recall, earlier, we were growing volume share pretty steadily as pricing had fully taken hold in our categories, and that was something that we were looking at, too. So Lauren, we're balancing both of them. Our focus is usually on dollar share as the primary metric that we want to focus on. We think that convey as well our overall superior value and how we think about consumers thinking about value in the category and dollar share is a better representative of that. But again, we are watching volume and unit share to see how consumers are making decisions, et cetera. The good news is that because the categories have mainly moved in line with us with some exceptions, Kingsford being notably, you're seeing adjustments in volume share that in some places are larger, but most of the time in line and just have to do with normalizing price gaps. So we watch it, primary metric is dollar share. Happy to see where we are and happy to be growing in five to nine businesses, but the work is certainly not done yet. Sure, Olivia. Advertising continues to be an incredibly important part of how we support the superior value of our brands. We believe fundamentally in it. And it's why we've done everything to continue to maintain spending what we think is about the right level over a year, which is about 10% of sales and we'll continue to be on track for doing that this year. As you noted, Q3 was significantly higher than other quarters and that's given innovation that we launch and timing of merchandising. And again, we don't manage quarter-to-quarter, but this was the right time to spend this money to support our brands. And coincides with having our fourth price increase in the market, which is good timing. We continue to believe that about 10% is the right spending, but we adjust that and look at that depending on what the businesses require. And we're not afraid to move or adjust that moving forward. But again, right now, about 10%, we're on track to do that for the year. And if you look at our ROI on marketing, it has been terrific and is another reason why we continue to feel strongly that, that investment contributes to the value creation that we can get from our brands. And our focus, as you know, has been on improving our ROI given the fact that we are driving personalization. So we wanted to get to know 100 million consumers in the U.S. And what getting to know 100 million consumers does is it allows you to know them better and it allows you to personalize to them. And we've had the added benefit of driving efficiency and effectiveness by doing that. So we're getting the right people, the right message at the right time and spending our money more effectively. And if you look across the advertising we said in our prepared remarks that, that was more heavily concentrated in the U.S. where we had lots of good opportunities. and was pretty widespread across our businesses. And you saw the strength across all segments with organic sales growth across all four. And again, as we head into fiscal year '24, we'll let you know what we think the right level of advertising spending will be, but you can hear that our commitment to that as the way we create value remains steadfast. Hi, Chris. Sure, Chris. I'll start and then ask if Kevin wants to add anything after I finish. Just maybe taking a step back in what we're trying to accomplish. And we talked about the balance that we want to strike between maintaining top line growth and rebuilding margins and ensuring given the incredibly volatile and uncertain environment that we're taking all the actions we can control to do both of those things. And we are pleased with the progress that we've made on both of them. If you look at our growth, if you look at any kind of three-year average over quarters, et cetera., it puts us at the top end of our growth algorithm and then we're making nice progress on margin. I think Kevin highlighted why Q3 between onetime less deleveraging than we expected, what we expect in Q4, really happy with the margin performance that it's nothing that we should expect as outsized in Q4. Obviously not providing a fiscal year '24 outlook, but let me just give you how we're thinking about the environment and what's going on out there. We want to continue to maintain that balance on top line growth and margin improvement. We still think it's a multiyear journey to rebuild margins. And we think the uncertainty from a consumer perspective in '24 is going to continue to remain high. And that's very difficult to predict right now exactly what the inflationary environment will look like when -- if we will hit a recession, and then, of course, what the corresponding impact will be to the consumer. And it is very likely that they could become under more pressure. And so what we're taking this out is another good quarter. We need to continue to control or controlling. We want to continue that into fiscal year '24. And then we want to make the right investments to your good point to support that business. And we believe in advertising, supporting innovation, which we continue to feel very strongly about ensuring we have the right capital plans against our business, which we feel we do. And we'll look at all of those hard in '24 to make sure that we're making the right choices. And we're not afraid to invest if we need to, to support both that top line growth and rebuilding margins. We'll have more specifics, of course, and we talk to you again in August about what that means for '24. But just know that the posture we're going into is we're committed to that margin growth, committed to maintaining top line and then making all the necessary adjustments to do that at the right pace. Hi, Javier. I'll start just with a reminder of what our digital program entails and how we're thinking about it. And then if there's any specifics we want to provide, Kevin can talk about the specifics of the spend for this year and how we're thinking about it moving forward. So we're investing, as you know, $500 million to transform our company digitally. And this, of course, is putting in the right technologies, including a new ERP, but it really is around changing the processes and the work that everyone at Clorox does to be faster and simpler. And we see this supporting both our top line momentum as we put in place innovation capabilities, better access to consumer data to drive insights and speed of decision-making as well as efficiencies as we have the ability to look across our supply chain and make decisions that reduce costs. This investment is on track. I think Kevin highlighted that to begin with. We'll see differences year-to-year. We're in the second year of the program, but the team continues to be on track implementing against that. What we've said is, most of the investment is upfront, but you get the majority of the benefit as you start to exit our IGNITE strategy or in 2025. And that's because you're putting all of those capabilities and technologies in place and changing how the entire company works and operates. And then we continue to be on track for that. This is a very high-return project for us. When Kevin and I evaluated this, we looked at the return and we track that project by project to ensure we're getting that return, and we continue to be on track to deliver good value on this over the long term. As it comes to specifics, we talked about in our release that we are about to implement the first region of our ERP coming up this calendar year. That is on track. -- as well as some of the other technology improvements that we've made. And of course, we have paired that with an operating model change that is also on track and in fact, a little bit ahead from a cost savings perspective this year as we were able to implement some of those changes faster. But those two things in combination are really about being fast, simple and more cost effective company that we -- that we want to be and to develop the type of resiliency and strength we can to weather whatever comes our way, another pandemic or whatever else the macroeconomic or geopolitical environment throws our way. As you would expect, given the elasticities of what we spoke about and the fact that our pricing is generally in line with category pricing, category volumes were down, and we've absolutely expected that to be the case. If you look at dollar sales, so if you look at consumption, high-single digits in our categories, which continues to show the strength and resilience of the consumer in our categories. Given we compete in Essentials, this is something that we expected. We're watching really closely as the consumer continues to react to pricing and as they continue to react to the macroeconomic environment. But right now feeling very good about the category position that we're in and consumer response to pricing. Generally, we would expect over time as we begin to lap category pricing and see category volumes return and get to that place where you see low-single digit growth in our categories from a volume perspective over time. We are certainly not at that point right now. as we have nine more months to lap pricing. And then, of course, we'll see what plays out from a commodity perspective and any required pricing that happens in the future that would also impact that. The only other thing that I would say as it relates to pricing and you think about volumes. We're not seeing that type of trade down either as it relates to consumers making choices for private label, et cetera. That's been pretty steady. As we highlighted earlier, our shares in aggregate, are flat. We grew in five of nine categories. We have seen private label increase share a bit in some of our categories, but it's not coming from us. It looks like it's coming from other brands and that there is a simplifying of the category, and it all relates to the value that we offer consumers 76% of our portfolio is still deem secure by consumers. We've continued to invest in that. So volume is what we expect in the categories. And again, we expect that to bounce back over time as we continue to invest in innovation and advertising and in category growth plans with our retailers. Sure. Yeah. On Household penetration is still very high for the Clorox portfolio. We're still in about nine out of 10 homes, and as we spoke about last quarter, household penetration is something we expect to decline in a time when you take extraordinary pricing. But that's not a clock phenomenon. It is a category phenomenon. And what you see is people using those more price sensitive behaviors. They're letting a trash bag, fill longer. They're stretching their time in between cleanings they're doing those things to make their wallet stretch, and that results in usually category penetration declining and we are seeing that. What I would say, though, is we see no difference in our brands versus the category, and we would expect over time to rebuild category penetration as we rebuild volumes. Thanks, Javier. Yeah, Jason. It's very dependent on category the consumer behavior. But what I would say is we noticed big buckets of the following: First, we see consumers trading to larger sizes, and they're looking for the best cost per use, for example. We also see certain consumers trading down to lower sizes because they're looking for the lowest out-of-pocket price point, and they're willing to pay on a higher per use basis because they only have a certain amount of money to get them through their shopping cycle for that period of time. We're also seeing people trade within our portfolio, for example, so where somebody might use a more expensive cleaner, they are using a dilutable cleaner or a bleach cleaner and willing to put more elbow grease in to get that same amount of clean and trade off that pricing convenience. And then we're seeing behaviors and this is really consistent across the category where people are just trying to stretch something more. So they're getting every less spray out of a bottle. They are using a wipe longer, they're stuffing a trash bag, and that's pretty consistent across the category. But really, those 3 1st buckets are the really important ones as we see people trade into different sizes and then, of course, adjust their behavior. And the good news for us is, in many cases, we're able to capture that consumer because we offer different levels of convenience, for example, in our cleaning business. Sure, Kevin. We're continuing to see the promotional environment normalize. And the dynamic that happened is we expect the promotional environment to increase this quarter but did not increase as much as we expected. And that's a dynamic and then Kevin can talk about the accrual as it relates to that. As we look just broader, though, in the environment on promotion, that stays a very specific role for our categories. We talked about in the past that more than 90% of our business is done off the shelf with no pricing discount and promotion plays a role to ensure that we talk to consumers about innovation. We talked to them around key holidays and pulse points where consumers are looking, for example, back-to-school or back to college or around cold and flu. And we use that to ensure that we're speaking to consumers about our products, the values they offer and new innovation. That continues to be the focus that we have on the promotional environment, and those are the discussions we continue to have with retailers. We're not afraid to use promotional dollars if we have price gaps that we need to adjust on a temporary basis, and we will do that. We are doing that right now, as we have a couple of price gaps that are out of line that we spoke to earlier. But generally, Primo continues to be a strategic investment lever for us to ensure that we're in front of the consumer when we need to be and when it matters from an innovation and pulse point period. perspective. Thank you, everyone. We look forward to speaking with you again on our next call in August. And until then, please stay well."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Clorox Company Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference. \nLisah Burhan: Thank you, Jen. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Linda Rendle, our CEO; and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. I hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website. In just a moment, Linda will share a few opening comments, and then we'll take your questions. \n During this call, we may make forward-looking statements, including about our fiscal 2023 outlook. These statements are based on management's current expectations, but may differ from actual results or outcomes. In addition, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section, which identifies various factors that could affect such forward-looking statements, which has been filed with the SEC. \n In addition, please refer to the non-GAAP financial information section of our earnings release and the supplemental financial schedule in the Investor Relations section of our website, for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Now I'll turn it over to Linda. \nLinda Rendle: Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks, despite persistent macroeconomic headwinds, we delivered better-than-expected Q2 results, with organic sales growth in 3 of 4 segments, gross margin expansion, and double-digit earnings growth. Our performance reflects the strength and superior value of our brands, strong execution across a broad set of actions and the benefit of some timing shifts. As a result, we've updated our full-year outlook.\n During the quarter, we made good progress through building margin, driving top line momentum and executing against our IGNITE Strategy to strengthen our advantages and accelerate profitable growth for the long term. This includes advancing our innovation pipeline, delivering cost savings and taking additional cost-justified pricing actions while maintaining record high consumer value superiority. Overall, we feel good about our progress, but we're relentlessly driving additional improvements as we continue to invest in our brands, categories and capabilities. \n Looking ahead, we expect the operating environment to remain volatile and challenging, and we'll continue using all the levers under our control while protecting the value proposition of our products to recover margin and drive long-term growth for our brands and categories. We are confident that our leading product portfolio in essential categories, coupled with our proactive actions will enable us to navigate this environment and return to more consistent profitable growth over time. With that, Kevin and I will take your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] \n Our first question today will come from Peter Grom with UBS. \nPeter Grom: Thanks, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. So maybe just to start, when we think about the 2Q performance, and I know you outlined a few things on the script, but just from our perspective, plus 4% organic versus the original guidance of down low single digits and kind of gross margin coming in at 200 basis points or so above in midpoint of your outlook, it's a decent amount of upside versus what you were expecting. So can you maybe just help us understand where were the biggest surprises versus your forecast for those 2 items? \nLinda Rendle: Sure. Thanks, Peter. So the first thing that I would just start with, and I'll hand it over to Kevin to walk through the quarter in a bit more detail, we're doing exactly what we said we were going to do. We are maintaining top line momentum, which came in better than we expected, and Kevin will walk you through those factors, while also doing the hard work to improve margins. And so from that perspective, we're feeling good about that balance. We're going to continue to be focused on it for the year. And Kevin, why don't you take them through the details of how the quarter should go. \nKevin Jacobsen: Sure. Peter, I would say in terms of the strength of the quarter, if I think about the top line, as Linda said, really good strong fundamentals on the business. We saw consumption up 6%. We held share, direct  channels in the U.S. We continue to grow shares internationally. We delivered a record cost savings for the quarter. In fact, we had to go back and look, this is the strongest quarter we've had in the last 10 years, so really great execution by our team. \n Another area I'd highlight is we hit a record case fill rate since the pandemic has begun. And so our team continues to make very good progress, improving our supply chain operations in spite of the ongoing disruptions we're dealing with. And so I'd say from a business fundamentals perspective, the team has done really good work this quarter. \n And then I'd also say, and you saw in our prepared remarks, we've had some benefit from some timing shifts. One we'd call out is cold and flu season. We saw the season start earlier than we anticipated, and we think it's peaked in our Q2. Typically, you see cold and flu season peak in our -- in the January-February time frame, which is our Q3. So we think that's pulled forward into Q2, some of our shipments for cleaning and disinfecting products. \n We also had a little bit of merchant timing shifts, and that's pretty typical moving between quarters that it won't have any impact on the year, but provided some benefit to the quarter. And then lastly, as I said, cost savings, while it was certainly a record quarter, and we're on track for the full year to have a very strong year. The team was able to pull forward some of that benefit. And so collectively, the good strong fundamentals of the business plus a little bit of timing benefit were the primary drivers of the really strong performance in the quarter. \nPeter Grom: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just a bigger picture question on the gross margin front. And you've obviously have made some great strides here in the past -- this quarter specifically. But Kevin, I would just be curious if you could comment on how we should be really thinking about gross margin progression for the next 18 months or so in the context of what we're seeing today, given the 40% exit rate. \n I just would assume that you could have substantial margin expansion on top of the 37% that you're guiding to for this year. If we can -- if we should expect sequential improvement from the 40% into the first half of next year. So just any thoughts on kind of the margin recovery and how we should be kind of thinking about gross margin expansion over the next 18 months or so? \nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, Peter, what I'd say is I'm not going to provide an outlook for our fiscal year '24 today. I'm going to resist doing that because there's so much volatility right now. We want to get a little further into this year, finish the plans. We're just starting to develop our plans for next year right now, so it's a little premature to talk about that. \n But what I would say is we feel very good about the progress we're making. As you folks know, we believe this quarter was an inflection point for us, where we returned to gross margin expansion. We've done that, that you saw in our prepared remarks. We expect to build on that in Q3, looking to get to 200 to 300 basis points of additional expansion and then continue in Q4. \n And then as you think forward beyond fiscal year '23, at a very high level, you should expect us to continue to prioritize what we're doing right now, which is maintaining our top line momentum and making the investments necessary to do that. We're continuing to work to rebuild margins, and we said that'll take some time, but that work is underway. And then we're going to continue to drive our strategic initiatives, our digital transformations, our streamlined operating model. Those will continue to be our priorities. But we'll give you a better feel for that as we get closer to fiscal year '24. . \nOperator: Our next question will come from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. \nDara Mohsenian: Just a point clarification on gross margins. You came in better than expected in both Q1 and Q2. Is there some offset in the back half of the year as we think about full year guidance not changing? Or is it more conservatism just given the volatility out there? \n And then secondly, you took some pricing in December. Any initial thoughts on competitive response, if you're seeing any big pushbacks from retailers? Probably too early to judge consumer demand, but any thoughts on that front would be helpful also just relative to the December increases. \nKevin Jacobsen: Sure. And let me start on gross margin and then Linda can comment on pricing. As it relates to gross margin, as you said, we did overdeliver our expectations for Q2. We came into the quarter targeting a 100 to 200 basis point improvement. We delivered a little over 300. If you look at the drivers of that over-delivery, I'd point to 2 items. \n The first is less operating deleveraging. So because of the very strong top line performance and it exceeded our expectations, volume was only down 10% for the quarter. We had anticipated it to be down more, and we're expecting more deleveraging. So we see the benefit of that item, which tends to be discrete in the quarter. \n And then we did have some benefit of pulling cost savings forward. Now we remain on track to have a very good year. We're not changing our full year view of cost savings, but the team did some nice work pulling some of those projects in early and I'm always happy to get cost savings projects started early, but that was a benefit as well that will have a bit of an impact on the back half of the year. \n And so I think this is a balanced forecast for gross margins where we continue to believe we'll get to about 38% in the full year. And Dara, you made this comment, and I agree, it's still an environment with lower visibility and quite a bit of volatility. And so I want to see how this fourth round of pricing plays out. It's a little early for us to read. I want to get another quarter under our belt and see how that's playing out, and I think we'll have a better perspective on the full year. But with that, let me turn it over to Linda to talk a little bit more about pricing. \nLinda Rendle: Yes. As Kevin just mentioned, we executed that fourth round of pricing in early December. And as Kevin noted, it's too early to determine, from a consumer perspective, the reaction. I would say, to date, everything looks in line with our expectations from an elasticity perspective. But again, too early, we haven't had a full purchase cycle yet, and it's still being reflected in the market. \n As it relates to competition, we did say in this price increase, we led for the most part on this round of pricing. And while we've seen some category movement in pricing. There are other categories we have not seen competitors move in yet. And we're watching that really, really closely to see what that's going to look like and prepare -- we're prepared to react. If our price gaps get out of line, or if we're seeing a consumer reaction not in line with our expectations given the full category hasn't moved. So too early yet to judge that, but it is true that some categories, we have not seen competition move subsequent to our pricing. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. \nAndrea Teixeira: So I wanted to go back to the top line outlook improvement. So I think that probably, as you mentioned, it's a function of price elasticity or maybe the pull forward of shipments at this point. And is that the reason why you also did not raise guidance as much as you could have given the beat? Is that something that perhaps the retailers took more shipments ahead of the price increase in December and therefore, you can see some of that pull forward corrected in the third quarter fiscal? Is that how we should be thinking? \nKevin Jacobsen: Andrea, I would say, overall, I feel very good about where we're at from a top line perspective. And as you saw, we narrowed our range and we moved it to the top half of our range from an organic perspective. We're now targeting flat to up 3%. If you look at our performance through the first half of the year, organic sales growth is a little over 0.5%. So that success suggests much stronger performance in the back half of the year. \n And so the outlook, I think, really reflects a good start to the year, but it would project acceleration in the back half of the year in terms of organic sales growth really driven by, again, good strength in the business plus the ongoing impact of the pricing actions we're taking. I think if you look at the range right now, you can do the math. It would suggest the back half would be anywhere from flat to up 5% on an organic basis. \n And we've got still a fairly wide range in the back half of the year. And I think that reflects exactly what Linda was just talking about. There is some uncertainty about how this fourth round of pricing will go. And so we think it's appropriate to maintain a bit wider range until we see exactly how both the consumers react to this round of pricing as well as what we see from other manufacturers in terms of if they choose to follow or not. \nAndrea Teixeira: And with the fourth quarter price increase, just a fine point, I'm sorry, the December price increase, the fourth round, can you remind us again how much would be the average pricing that you're getting to the beginning of the third quarter as we enter the third quarter? \nLinda Rendle: Yes. This fourth round was a bit more moderate than we had taken in July, if you recall, July was the largest of the 4 price increases. This one was around mid-single digits and fairly broad across the portfolio, but more moderate than we had taken in the past. And again, too early to judge on what the pricing looks like and what the impacts are. But this one was definitely more moderate than what we saw in July. \n And if you look at July, the elasticities are exactly in line with our expectations across categories. So we would expect our models to continue to hold in December, but it's dynamic out there and consumers are certainly facing a lot of inflation in their broader basket, so we're watching it closely. \nAndrea Teixeira: That's helpful. The -- so the mid-single digits plus a high single, like in general, like ,on average, you're probably running around mid-teens. And then so that implies, in the midpoint of the range, if the 0 to 5, you're looking at 2.5%, you're probably looking at elasticities running around 12%, 13%. Is that the way your model now calls for the second half? \nKevin Jacobsen: Yes. Andrea, what I'd say, in terms of elasticities, our expectation is elasticities for this December round of pricing would be very similar to what we saw in July, which is consistent with our historical levels of elasticities. You might remember in the first few rounds, we were seeing lower elasticities than historical levels. Consumers were less price sensitive. But now that's really reverted back to historical level elasticity. \n And then I would say on the back half, be a little careful because we do have some shifting as we talk about between quarters. I think maybe a better way to look at that, if you try to take out the noise of some volume shifting between Q2 and Q3, Q2, we had 4% organic sales growth. You saw in my prepared remarks, you may have seen, we're projecting 2% to 3% growth organic sales growth in Q3. \n Over that 6-month period, we're looking at organic sales growth a little over 3%. And so clearly, an acceleration of where we've been based on the fundamentals of the business we're talking about. But consumers continue to be resilient. Our categories have been -- shown to be resilient to date, and I think that's reflected in raising our outlook. \nAndrea Teixeira: And the elasticity is about 0.7, right, if my math serves me right on average on all the categories? \nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, say, Andrea, we don't comment on -- specifically on elasticity. And as you can imagine, they're quite different by category, by geography. And so it's something we don't comment publicly on the elasticities of the brands. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. \nKaumil Gajrawala: Can you talk a bit about supply and about inventory? You mentioned that fill rates were great. Maybe just a little bit more on your ability to supply through your variance, maybe digging into the categories a little bit? And then how do you feel about trade inventories as well as maybe inventories in the pantries? \nKevin Jacobsen: Sure. Thanks, Kaumil, for the question. On supply, I would say the supply chain, we're definitely seeing improvements from the disruptions we're dealing with over the last year or 2. It continues to normalize, and that certainly helped benefit our inventory levels. So as you know, we have raised safety stocks to try to help manage the supply chain disruptions we're dealing with and create less impact to our ability to ship product to our retailers. \n As the supply chain is normalizing, we are able to go back and reduce the safety stock levels. And so as an example, in Q2, this is our fourth straight quarter that we've been able to reduce the inventory levels. I think year-over-year, we pulled another 4 days out of inventory on hand, and that's really a reflection of an improving supply chain. \n And you heard my earlier comment, 1 example of that is we've hit the highest case fill rate we've been able to deliver since the pandemic began. Now we've done that through some very good work by our team. But I would tell you, we are still dealing with intermittent supply chain disruptions. \n And I'm sure you'll remember last quarter, we talked about a few disruptions on our Glad and our Burt's Bees business, so that continues to occur. But it's certainly starting to normalize, and we're seeing less disruptions than we did a few years ago. And so that's allowed us to continue to work to optimize our supply chain. And one of those elements is reducing inventory levels. \n And then from a retailer perspective, the only place we saw some change in retailer inventory levels was on our Brita business in Q2. So we did see a little bit of a reduction in retail inventories on that business. Nothing else to speak of. And I would tell you in our outlook, we're not anticipating any additional material changes to retail inventories. \n That always goes on every quarter. You'll see some noise, but nothing that we think has any meaningful impact on our outlook, and that's what's assumed right now. And then maybe I know, Linda, do you want to talk about consumer pantry levels? \nLinda Rendle: Yes. What we're seeing is very similar to what Kevin highlighted just in retail. We are not seeing significant pantry loading by consumers or changes in behavior as it relates to the pantry. What we are seeing, and I think we'll highlight it in probably some discussion around what's going on with pricing with the consumer, we are seeing consumers continue to drive value-seeking behaviors given what they're facing. \n So we're seeing some purchase cycles extend as people try to make products work longer for them. They're purchasing different sizes. So that's changing the purchase cycle. But that's largely in line with what we would expect from the elasticity impact that's in line with our expectations. And we're not seeing any other consumer behavior that's abnormal outside of that normal elasticity impact. \nKaumil Gajrawala: Okay. Got it. So I guess if supply chains in more of a normal place, inventories are at a normal place, both at retail and consumer, you now have a higher top line outlook that's -- we're in more of a normalized zone then. Is that fair to say? Some of those puts and takes over the last couple of years are behind us? \nKevin Jacobsen: I wouldn't say normalized me. I think that's probably overstating it. We are still dealing with supply chain disruptions. I would just say the frequency of those disruptions has definitely gone down. But I would not say we're -- I wouldn't describe it as a normal environment. \n We're still dealing with a number of challenges on a regular basis. But certainly, it's a lower frequency. And we were just talking last quarter about several of those that we're still working to resolve are mostly behind us. And I would expect we'll see more disruptions going forward. I don't believe we're in a position not to expect that. And so that's probably the way I would better describe it than we're in a normal environment. . \nKaumil Gajrawala: Got it, better than before, but not normal. \nKevin Jacobsen: Certainly better than before. \nOperator: And we'll hear next from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. \nChristopher Carey: I wanted to follow up on the supply chain dynamic in the context of your gross margin outlook for Q3. I -- and I guess it's similar to the volume outlook. But I'm struggling a little bit given the delivery in Q2 with why it should be potentially a lot better, right? Unless productivity gets worse, you have pricing, which is going to remain strong. Raw materials probably get sequentially better. \n You just were talking about manufacturing and logistics, which sounds like it should get better. And then from a volume standpoint, you're going to be tracking similar to what you just did in Q2. And so why is the -- maybe like the other -- why is the operating deleverage so much worse in Q3? Or maybe, like, what am I missing? What gets worse sequentially? \nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, Chris, thank you for the question. And I agree. We do expect gross margin will get better in Q3. If you look at what we provided in the prepared remarks, we're looking at a gross margin of 38% to 39%, so I think a very nice improvement for where we landed in Q2 at just a little over 36%. You may also recall, we don't use spot rates when we develop our outlooks. We use forward curves.\n So our outlook has always anticipated declining commodity costs as we move through the year. That's not a change in assumption for us. The only other item I would highlight is we will likely see more volume deleveraging in Q3 versus Q2. Because keep in mind now, we have the fourth round of pricing that went into effect in December. It had no meaningful impact on the second quarter. \n You'll start to see the impact of that in the third quarter, which means I would expect a bit more volume decline in Q3 than versus what we saw in Q2 as you now have one more round in pricing and the elasticities associated with that  round of pricing, so a little bit more volume deleveraging.\n But in spite of that, we're going to continue to drive nice benefits from pricing, cost savings. And as a result, I expect to continue to make very nice sequential progress. It'll will be up -- we believe, up 200 to 300 basis points versus Q2 and that keeps us very much on track for getting back to about 40% by the fourth quarter. \nChristopher Carey: Okay. Got it. And then just to confirm that, that volume that you're talking about, that's -- a lot of that's in the Health and Wellness segment just given timing of cold and flu? \nKevin Jacobsen: No, the volume deleveraging will be based on the pricing. And as Linda mentioned, the pricing is pretty broad-based across our portfolio. So as we take our fourth round of pricing, there will be an element of volume deleveraging because of the elasticities on those price increases. That will impact the third quarter. \n But I think the other point you're making also keep in mind, we're lapping the Omicron variant from Q3 of last year. So that'll have an impact on our cleaning and disinfecting business as we've got a more difficult comp on that business. So I think really a combination on both those items, you'll see that play out in our volume projections for Q3. \nChristopher Carey: Okay. All right. Great. Just 1 quick follow-up still on the gross margin front. This was a nice sequential improvement in the manufacturing and logistics clients, certainly relative to where we were, right? And so have we reached the end of this headwind? Can we start thinking about manufacturing and logistics normalization and maybe even it turns to a tailwind for your gross margins at some point in the back half of next year?\n And certainly, as we get into fiscal '24, it does seem like some easing in this line item could be an unlock, something which you don't necessarily have control over, but we're looking at freight rates rolling over and again, just the normalization of this line item, it seems like a good development, so I wonder how sticky you think this is and candidly, whether this line item will ever actually become a tailwind for you or just costs are higher and it's likely to remain inflationary over the medium term horizon. \nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, sure, Chris. I would say, as it relates to manufacturing and logistics, our expectation is it will continue to be a headwind this entire year. So we think it's -- as you saw in our remarks, $400 million of supply chain inflation. About half of that is in commodities. The other half is in manufacturing and logistics. Now we do think it moderates as we move through the year. And so we think each quarter, it'll be less of a hit than the previous quarter, but it'll be inflationary for the entire year, and that's factored into our outlook. \n And as it relates to the medium to longer term, as I mentioned, we're going to hold off on making any comments on fiscal year '24. It's just a little too early for us to do that. But at least this year, you should assume it'll continue to be inflationary, but moderating as we move through the quarters. . \nOperator: And our next question will come from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. \nJason English: Two quick questions. I guess, logistics and manufacturing are now off the table. But in cleaning, you guys mentioned that professional is still lagging. And I think you cited in there, 1 driver is office occupancy, which seems odd. It seems like we're deep enough into COVID, where office occupancy is actually going the other way. So can you unpack a bit more of the headwinds on the Professional business in cleaning? \nLinda Rendle: Sure. Jason, there was really 2 factors in Professional. One, which is a more midterm issue and then one that was a very short-term issue. That affected professional last quarter. And I'll start with that one, which was our Pine-Sol recall and that impacted Professional. We have a fairly large business in Pine-Sol in Professional, and we'd expect as we bring that distribution back, that just to be a short-term impact.\n As you look at the medium term, though, office occupancy is still down significantly as return to office has been delayed, and we've all seen the press on how hard it's been to get people to come back into the office to the degree that we thought we would. So that continues to be a headwind to the business. \n We're looking at other avenues to grow the business beyond just that, looking at our portfolio broadly and innovation. And we continue to have conviction that our professional business will be a growth driver for us in the future. And it's good to see it start to be a bit more normalized than it was in the past, but we are still dealing with that office occupancy headwind. \nJason English: Okay. Okay. And Kevin, I've had a lot of debate with investors recently around sort of normalized earnings. I think probably everyone's having that debate. But 1 key point of it really does rests at gross profit. And I know you aspire to get back to historical gross margins in time. But one way we're looking at it is around unit economics with the notion that gross profit per unit is probably a more reasonable near-term target of what a normalized gross profit would look like. \n What, if any, holes do you see in that thought process? And if you think gross profit per unit should be a lot higher than it was in fiscal '19, can you give us an understanding or a better explanation of kind of why and maybe where you might be able to achieve that? \nKevin Jacobsen: Sure. Jason, I would say we aspire to do both. I mean, you start by rebuilding gross profit then ultimately rebuild gross margin over time. For us, it'll be the same drivers we've talked about. We're going to continue to execute the pricing actions that we've taken. And as we've said, we don't have any additional plans to take further pricing this fiscal year based on our cost forecast. \n But we'll continue to drive pricing. We'll continue to drive cost savings and supply chain optimization. That's the way that we think puts us in a position to first recover gross profit and then ultimately keep going to recover gross margin. Typically, I'd say, in a normal environment, the work we do on cost savings is enough to offset a normalized level of inflation and allow us to build margins over time. And that allows us to continue to invest in our brands and continue to set the company. We have to deliver value over the long term. \n Obviously, we're dealing with a very unique environment right now with the unprecedented level of cost inflation. And so that's why we're leaning into pricing. I'd like to believe over time , as we get to a normalized environment as you described, we get back to more of our consistent model where we're really driving cost savings, and that's allowing us to offset inflation and build margin over time. But we're not in that environment right now. So we're leaning more aggressively into pricing. But I think ultimately, it's always both. We start by rebuilding gross profit and then we ultimately work to rebuild gross margin over time. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. \nKevin Grundy: Great. Question for both of you really on investment spending. I guess, sort of -- well, I'm trying to connect the dots here. So you're still targeting 10% of sales for the year. You're about 9% in the first half. Kevin, I think you mentioned, so that implies naturally, an acceleration in the back half of the year. Can you guys comment for a moment, I guess, on destinations for the spend? \n Number two, why we would not expect to see a little bit more of an acceleration? If that's the case, why not more of sort of an immediate top line payback and understanding that some of this is sort of more longer term in nature? It'd be great to get your thoughts on that. \n And then the third piece, because I think kind of coming away from the call, there's going to be, I suspect, a view that the gross margin guidance may be a little bit conservative given the strong performance in the front half of the fiscal year. What's your feeling on potential reinvestment? \n Understanding it's a long still -- there's still ways to get back to where you'd like to from a gross margin perspective. But how are you feeling about potential reinvestment this year? Should you exceed on your gross margin guidance, what's the likelihood that you would sort of lean in here and reinvest given some of the promising signs you've seen on the top line? \nLinda Rendle: Kevin, on the investment spending piece, incredibly important. We're seeing good consumer and category resilience. We're happy that we are maintaining share in an environment. We are aggressively going after rebuilding margin. And you all know that's exactly what we've targeted. We want to keep our top line momentum while rebuilding margins at the same time. And that's how we're approaching investments. \n We're making the right short-term investments to do that, but we're also not taking our eye off the long term and continuing to invest in those things that are going to make us a stronger company, like our digital transformation and like our op model. So that's what we're focused on. \n It just happens to be the shape of spending to have less in the front half of the year versus the back half given our plans, but that's just the shape of the investment, and we still are targeting 10% from an advertising and sales promotion perspective, still continuing to invest in innovation. That's been going well for us. And overall, going to continue to focus that investment on our brands.\n What I will say, though, is we're watching our categories incredibly closely right now. And the most important thing that we do is continue to deliver superior value to our consumers. And right now, we're really happy to say, among all that pricing that we took, strong double digits, we've maintained our record high superiority rating of 76%. We were in the 50% range a few years ago. And that combination gives us the confidence to continue to invest. \n But if we see a change in that, where consumers are reacting in a different way or if we don't see competition follow on price increases, we are ready with backup plans that we can activate very, very quickly to make adjustments to that. And if we need to make additional investments, we will to support the value spirit of our brands. But we feel we have that balance right, right now. That played out in Q2 behind the good balance we had in top line and bottom line. But that's how we're thinking about it overall, and we'll continue to take a proactive approach of adjusting if we need to. \nKevin Grundy: I appreciate the color. If I could just 1 very quick follow-up, and I think you kind of touched on this a little bit. Are you starting to hear from retailers at all just given some of the moderation in commodities that they'd like to see more on deal here, more trade promotion?\n Because it hasn't moved up -- looking at the scatter data on the 4 12-week basis, we haven't seen it move up a lot. And we know that some of the categories you play in, historically have been heavily promoted categories. I want to assess it as a risk, but is that sort of coming up that some of this pricing you're going to take, you're going to have to go back on deal? And then I'll pass it on. \nLinda Rendle: Kevin, what you're seeing in the latest data is what we see from a Q2 perspective in that promotion is still below where it was pre-pandemic across our categories. It's higher than it was a year ago in our categories, but definitely lower than pre-pandemic. And what we're hearing from retailers, which you would expect, is how do we continue to keep our categories healthy. \n So it's not a discussion on promotion necessarily. It's a discussion on how we have the right set for -- with the right distribution for our products, how we can lean into innovation and drive value from a market basket perspective, from a retailer perspective. But we are not hearing in a normal amount of level of interest in promotion because they know that's not usually the right way to drive the category.\n We want to use promotion very strategically in times of the year where we can ensure that consumers like back-to-school, for example, or cold and flu, where we know people are looking for our products, and we can introduce them to innovation or remind them to buy. So those conversations continue to be really constructive and we're mutually focused on ensuring the categories are healthy and doing it the right way. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital. \nLauren Lieberman: Great. First thing I wanted to ask about was the performance in household, because the volume growth was pretty striking. So just curious if you could tell us a little bit more about which of the businesses had volumes up and if there was any of the merchandising attached to that or kind of what was going on there. Because, again, to see volume up with pricing as strong as it is, is pretty notable. \nKevin Jacobsen: Lauren, yes, I'm happy to answer the question on households. As you saw, we had 9% growth in the segment. From a volume perspective, really litter was the star of the group. We had double-digit growth on that business. And we continue to see very strong category growth. \n As you know, we've talked about it before. strong pet adoption during the pandemic. That's continued to fuel that category. And then we've continued to see very strong performance in that business. And so we are seeing -- in spite of the pricing we've taken, we are still growing volume in that business, more than offsetting the elasticity impact. \nLauren Lieberman: Okay. Great. And then also, just on the pricing. I'm [ not ] sure which of you had mentioned that pricing really had very little impact on the second quarter given the timing that went into the market and some of it is still showing up on shelves. So as we think about modeling forward, you spoke to seeing more volume pressure, but should we also see pricing accelerating versus what's already in the financials in the second quarter? \nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, Lauren, I think you'll have 2 impacts. Now we're starting to lap the first round of pricing we took last year. So you're starting to see some of that first run of pricing drop off as we get into the back half of our fiscal year, and it's being replaced with his fourth round. So it's not as clean as another round of pricing being added. I think in aggregate, this fourth round was larger than our first round. So in aggregate, you'll see a little bit more benefit from pricing, and you see a little larger hit in terms of the impact to volume from elasticities. \nLauren Lieberman: Okay. All right. That's great. And yes -- and then just a final question, which we've -- I thought it was interesting the way the prepared remarks were written about rebuilding household penetration. So knowing that you don't typically expect a lot of revenue growth when you take pricing and everything is kind of going according to plan, but I was curious what categories kind of warrant that extra attention with -- specifically with regard to rebuilding household penetration. And what, if anything, you can tell us about plans to do that? \nLinda Rendle: Yes, Lauren, this is a fundamental thing we're really focused on. And one of the trade-offs you do when you take the level of pricing that we're taking in the categories is you trade off some household penetration in the short term in order to do that. \n And while we're still in 9 out of 10 households and have very strong household penetrations across our category and in most cases, are performing better than the category is in household penetration, this is 1 of the trade-offs that we're making. And I think it's the right trade-off given the fact that we need to both maintain top line momentum and rebuild margins. \n But that being said, household penetration is incredibly important to us and the health of our business over the long term, and we are committed to regrowing that over time. And typically, what we see in price increases, you see some volume loss initially as consumers adjust their behavior. You begin to rebuild that over time.\n  So our first focus on household penetration will be rebuilding volumes over the mid- to long term. And we will do that by continuing to invest in innovation, having strong levels of investment in our brands as we're going to have 10% spending in A&SP this year and continuing to make the wrong -- right long-term digital investments to support brand building, et cetera.\n One note we were really proud of, we had our highest ROI marketing in this last period due to the personalization efforts that we've taken out. So we haven't talked a lot about that, but that's working, and it's allowing our money to work harder and will allow us to help us focus on growing household penetration over time. \n So what I would -- just again, to say it, this is a wide-eyed open trade-off that we are making in household penetration, but it's something that as we rebuild volumes, we would expect to rebound over time. And what's key to that is continuing to invest in our brands. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Olivia Tong with Raymond James Financial. \nOlivia Tong Cheang: Great. I wanted to ask you about Glad and Burt's, where things stand there. Particularly with Glad, given the particularly strong performance in household, how much that contributed, if Glad continues to be an issue. And then with Burt's, where do we stand with respect to some of the supply chain challenges there? \nLinda Rendle: Sure. Glad was a business we were up in sales this quarter. We actually grew share from a trash perspective. So we're really pleased with the performance of Glad through multiple rounds of pricing. We're seeing strong performance in the market, and that's really behind our innovation program that we've spent a lot of time talking about, whether it be the addition of colors and sense, our focus on value there. Our work on distribution across the retailer base is paying off, and we feel good about where that business is from a trash perspective.\n And then from a Burt's perspective, we did share that we had a supply disruption that happened and we believe we'll be able to work through it through Q3, and that continues to be the case. We made good progress on it in Q2 when we're able to support some strong holiday promotions and sales that led to growth on that business, but we still have some work to do, and we intend to be through that by the end of this quarter. \nOlivia Tong Cheang: Right. And then just following up. I know you mentioned a couple of times, it's too early to read too much into the December pricing. But just overall, are you seeing any bifurcation as far as pack sizes or willingness to stay with branded versus private label with high-end consumers versus low-end? \n And I imagine that as the year progressed -- so I don't think you have so far, but as the year progresses, how much of that is embedded into sort of some conservatism on the outlook? Because it seems like the consumer is still sticking with you, but just curious if you see anything that would give you a reason for some caution as the year progresses. \nLinda Rendle: Sure. As we've said, it really is too early to judge December's price increase at this point. But maybe I'll speak, Olivia, to the broader sets of price increases and just what we're seeing on average and what we continue to expect to happen as December gets fully reflected in the marketplace. \n We are seeing consumers and our categories remain resilient. And you can see that just in the strong consumption that you see in MULO right now. Consumers are reacting favorably. And I think this is really due to the fact that we're in essential categories. These brands play a role in consumers' every day routines, and we're continuing to see them favor value. That's what we've always focused on with our brands. \n They're looking for superior value, not necessarily the lowest price. And with our superiority rating, I mentioned earlier, of 76%, consumers continue to feel that our brands are the best value and they're voting for them in store. And with that, we are seeing value-seeking behavior that's within our own brands. \n So people want to stay with the Clorox company branded product. And so they're trading within our portfolio, and we've seen that over the last number of price increases. Some consumers are choosing to buy opening price points, because perhaps that day, their wallet, they have a limited amount of money they can spend in the category or they're looking for the very, very best value on a price per use basis and so they're trading up to larger sizes, or maybe they're trading within our cleaning portfolio between a dilutable and a spray cleaner in order to get the value equation right for them. And the good news is we have offerings to meet their needs there. And that's what we're really focused on with retailers, ensuring we have the right distribution to meet those needs as consumers continue to look for the best value within our portfolio. And I think we're going to continue to see that happen. \n As it relates to private label, we're not seeing any meaningful trade down in our categories to private label. And again, we maintain share amid 4 price increases, so that is playing out. But I'll tell you, we're watching it really closely. This -- it looks like it's going to continue to get tougher for the consumer in aggregate. And so we're looking particularly as that fourth round is implemented and particularly in categories where we have higher private label penetration to ensure that we have that right value. \n And I also mentioned earlier, we haven't seen some competitors reflecting additional price increase as we did in December. And so we're watching our gaps really closely in those categories as well to ensure that we are continuing to offer superior value. And we will make adjustments. We are ready to if we need to, to protect the value of those brands. But at the moment, category and consumer is resilient. Our brands are very resilient maintaining share, and we're going to continue to activate our plans on innovation and investment to keep them healthy. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Javier Escalante with Evercore ISI. \nJavier Escalante Manzo: Hello, can you hear me? Sorry for that. I wanted to double-click on the timing factors and the household volume growth of 3%. If you look at the scatter data, it shows a double-digit decline. So if you can help us understand how much stronger these pet food, pet litter business was in the quarter and whether there was a channel shift there. And then I have a question more philosophically to Linda when it comes to the Health and Wellness business. \nKevin Jacobsen: Javier, let me see if I answer your question on shifting. So as we mentioned, in Q2, we had some benefit of shifting of some merch activity. And as I said, that's pretty typical that you'll see some merch events shift between quarters out of Q3 into Q2, and that was across a number of businesses. And then more specifically, we're seeing the benefit of an early start to cold and flu season in Q2 as it relates to our Health and Wellness portfolio. But maybe say a little bit more on what your question is. I'm not sure that gets to the question you're asking. \nJavier Escalante Manzo: No. It's a little bit more of a follow-up on Lauren's question when it comes to did the job being household and the categories that you've referred to, to being the -- shifting was Health and Wellness and they were down 19% and the real jump was in household, and we don't see that in retail. So if you can help us -- if you can give color there and help us understand the disconnect between what we see in retail and what you just reported. \nLinda Rendle: Yes, I'll jump in on that one, Javier. So you are noting a few categories that have very strong untracked channel performance. And particularly in litter, our business in club, that was up due to some strong merchandising activity we had and actually some of the shift that we experienced from Q3 into Q2. So that's what you're seeing in the difference between the tracked channels and what we're talking about from a volume and sales performance in household. \nJavier Escalante Manzo: Very helpful, Linda. And then basically curious, how you go about answering this question with consumer research. You have Health and Wellness down 19%. It's lapping down 18% from a year ago volumes. How you see normalization play out? Do you see people cleaning more as they were during the pandemic? Cleaning less? And if they are cleaning less, how much many other quarters you feel that volumes are going to be down in Health and Wellness? \nLinda Rendle: Yes. This is a category that certainly has had the biggest swings as consumers change their behavior as we went through the height of the pandemic, and we're still lapping. We're still normalizing, given Omicron happened last Q3, and we're in the process of lapping that right now. What I would say is if you look at this last Q2 versus pre-pandemic, our volumes are still higher. So in aggregate, people are still cleaning more.\n And certainly, we're still normalizing consumer behavior. And then we had a very abnormal cold and flu season this year. It happened earlier, it happened in December from a peak perspective. It usually happens in January and February. So there are a lot of dynamics in play here around normalization. \n But what we see is still a business that has great opportunity to grow and be an outsized contributor to the company given people, they care about cleaning and disinfecting as part of keeping them well. But we're going to be normalizing as we get through this and consumers continue to adjust their behavior. And hopefully, we'll get into a more normalized cycle where cold and flu normalizes, and we're seeing a more normalized impact from COVID, but we're not quite there yet. \n And as we look at the volume loss, that's really due to that factor around normalization, but also the pricing that we have, and it's in line with our expectations. So as we look at that, that just gives us conviction because it's about what we expected it to be. And then as we move forward, we'll continue to adjust as consumers adjust. \n But it's the same thing we're focusing on innovation in those categories where we can make the job easier for them. We're continuing to invest to help people to understand different ways to keep themselves well, whether that be in a professional setting or at home. But we feel really good about the Health and Wellness business overall. It's just going to be bumpy until we get back to a normalized environment. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Anna Lizzul with BofA Global Research. \nAnna Lizzul: I just wanted to follow up on the cost side. You're still seeing cost inflation, but you noted in your prepared remarks that cost inflation has moderated slightly on a sequential basis even though it's still higher year-over-year. I was wondering if you can give some more color on which inputs are moderating and how quickly those are coming down versus the ones that are still headwinds. And then could you also remind us how quickly you expect some of your raw materials come down in your P&L relative to when you see spot prices for those raw materials decline. \nKevin Jacobsen: Sure. As it relates to the cost environment, and you said it correctly, we are seeing moderating cost increase. Now as I said, we anticipate it's going to be inflationary all year long, but that year-over-year increase will moderate as we move through the year. As I look at specific commodities, we have anticipated resin would be a cost tailwind, so a lower year-over-year cost for resin. That's something we assumed at the beginning of the year, and that continues to play out that we are seeing resin prices favorable year-over-year. \n But that is being offset by -- we're seeing increases in most of our other buys outside of resin. So soybean oil, linerboard, chemicals, solvents, substrate. Most of the other key buys that we are purchasing, we are seeing cost increases on a year-over-year basis, and we expect that to continue throughout the year. So that's generally how it's playing out. \n What I would tell you, when you talk about what that moderation is, I think you can see it when you look at just the first half results. If I look at Q1, commodities were a 330 basis point hit to gross margin. In Q2, they're a 240 basis point hit. So that's exactly what we're describing. Still a headwind, but a lower hit each quarter. \n I would expect that to continue to play out that we'll see a declining impact from commodity costs as we move through the year. But again, we're looking at $400 million for the total inflation, resin being favorable, most of our other buys continue to be unfavorable on a year-over-year basis. \nAnna Lizzul: And just, could you remind us how quickly you would expect the cost to come down in your P&L just relative to when we see those spot prices coming down? \nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, I'm sorry that you would ask that question. Well, it really varies by commodities. In some cases, we hedge. And so in those cases, you may have 9 to 18 months before we see the impact of a changing commodity environment play through our cost structure. In other cases, we have contractual relationships with our suppliers that delays those changes. So it's really hard to give you an enterprise answer how quickly that plays through. It is a commodity-by-commodity discussion based on how we set up those relationships with our suppliers. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. \nStephen Robert Powers: On the household penetration topic, I guess the question is how much recovery at this point is anticipated for -- within the remainder of your outlook for fiscal '23? Is that something you expect to see some sequential progress rebuilding in the next few months and quarters? Or is that more of a fiscal '24 and beyond objective? \nLinda Rendle: Yes, Steve, on household penetration, that is definitely a more mid- to long-term goal for us to get back to household penetration, given the fact that the December price increase is just starting to take a hold now. We would expect to have to go through an entire cycle of that and we haven't even lapped the July price increase, which was our big 1 coming up here. So that will be something that we're focused on now to ensure that we are investing and that we're keeping as many consumers in as we possibly can. But that work will be rebuilding over 24 and beyond. \nStephen Robert Powers: Yes. Okay. I mean, is there an assumption that you -- you may go backwards sort of as we get into calendar '23 before you go forward again? Or is it more hold-the-line? \nLinda Rendle: Yes. I think that's very possible, Steve, based on the fact that we just took that pricing, we could see a bit more of a reduction in household penetration. And again, we think that is the right trade-off to make to get that balance right between top line and bottom line. But yes, it's possible as we go through, we could see some additional household penetration erosion. \nStephen Robert Powers: Okay. Okay. And then you talked about promotional intensity in the category. And right now, it seems pretty rational, benign, constructive. I guess, is there, at all, in the base plan, an element of increased promotion as you go through the next couple of quarters? Or is that also more steady state as a base case? \nLinda Rendle: The base case is more steady state, Steve. As we talk about promotions being a more strategic part of our portfolio than something that we just do to drive volume on a quarterly basis. That's the approach that we're taking for the back half of the year. We have good innovation plans. We want to make sure that we hit consumers on key pulse periods to remind them about the category and the value that we drive. \n So that's our approach. Again, being what it is, we will look to ensure that we have the right value and that we are competitive. And so if there were to be a change in what we're seeing in the category today, which is slightly higher, like I said earlier, promotion than last year, but still less than in pandemic, we could potentially adjust our plans and we're ready to do that. but we would expect just a more normalized promo environment. That's how we're treating it for the back half, and that's what we've seen so far in Q2. \nStephen Robert Powers: Okay. Okay. And the last question, on the one hand, there's definitely a really good news story here in terms of the pricing momentum you've gotten and sort of the gap between price and it's building relative to the cost trend and the gross margin rebuild. On the other hand, you've mentioned a couple of times tonight, just the price gaps that you're watching, whether private label or branded price gaps and just the sort of consumer resiliency post this fourth wave of pricing. \n I guess can you give us a better sense of what the mile markers are for you in terms of -- is it just the gaps that you're seeing, but you have widened out? Is there a time period where you just don't want to see those gaps that wide for that long? Is it value share? Is it volume share? Is it those household penetration metrics? I mean, I'm sure it's a mosaic of all those things and probably some others, but just give us a little sense of kind of if there are more important indicators in there, that would be helpful, just the way you're thinking about it. \nLinda Rendle: Yes, you got it right on mosaic, Steve. That's exactly it, which is we're taking a combination of all of those factors as we're deciding if we need to adjust our plans or not. And really primarily, what we're looking at is consumer reaction to our brands, and we're looking very closely at any changes that would be outside of what we expect given the elasticities that we have in market. And then we would make corresponding plans.\n And we're looking at competitors to see are they doing something different, are they promoting more heavily, or are they looking at a certain pack size that would make us adjust our plans. Those are the 2 primary factors we're looking at in the very, very short term. And then, of course, as we look over months and quarters, we're looking at share, and we're really happy that we maintain share this quarter given the fourth round of pricing.\n But that's the other thing we're watching. Is there too much of a slide in share, is that trade-off not worth it,  et cetera. So we're looking at all of it. But to start, we're looking at that gap, we're looking at consumer behavior by category to say is it different than our expectations and then adjusting from there. \nOperator: And this concludes the question-and-answer session. Ms. Rendle, I'd like to now turn the conference back to you. \nLinda Rendle: Thank you, everyone. We'll see you at CAGNY later this month and look forward to updating you on our progress in May. Please stay well. \nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Jacobsen",
            "content": "Sure. Peter, I would say in terms of the strength of the quarter, if I think about the top line, as Linda said, really good strong fundamentals on the business. We saw consumption up 6%. We held share, direct  channels in the U.S. We continue to grow shares internationally. We delivered a record cost savings for the quarter. In fact, we had to go back and look, this is the strongest quarter we've had in the last 10 years, so really great execution by our team. \n Another area I'd highlight is we hit a record case fill rate since the pandemic has begun. And so our team continues to make very good progress, improving our supply chain operations in spite of the ongoing disruptions we're dealing with. And so I'd say from a business fundamentals perspective, the team has done really good work this quarter. \n And then I'd also say, and you saw in our prepared remarks, we've had some benefit from some timing shifts. One we'd call out is cold and flu season. We saw the season start earlier than we anticipated, and we think it's peaked in our Q2. Typically, you see cold and flu season peak in our -- in the January-February time frame, which is our Q3. So we think that's pulled forward into Q2, some of our shipments for cleaning and disinfecting products. \n We also had a little bit of merchant timing shifts, and that's pretty typical moving between quarters that it won't have any impact on the year, but provided some benefit to the quarter. And then lastly, as I said, cost savings, while it was certainly a record quarter, and we're on track for the full year to have a very strong year. The team was able to pull forward some of that benefit. And so collectively, the good strong fundamentals of the business plus a little bit of timing benefit were the primary drivers of the really strong performance in the quarter. Yes, Peter, what I'd say is I'm not going to provide an outlook for our fiscal year '24 today. I'm going to resist doing that because there's so much volatility right now. We want to get a little further into this year, finish the plans. We're just starting to develop our plans for next year right now, so it's a little premature to talk about that. \n But what I would say is we feel very good about the progress we're making. As you folks know, we believe this quarter was an inflection point for us, where we returned to gross margin expansion. We've done that, that you saw in our prepared remarks. We expect to build on that in Q3, looking to get to 200 to 300 basis points of additional expansion and then continue in Q4. \n And then as you think forward beyond fiscal year '23, at a very high level, you should expect us to continue to prioritize what we're doing right now, which is maintaining our top line momentum and making the investments necessary to do that. We're continuing to work to rebuild margins, and we said that'll take some time, but that work is underway. And then we're going to continue to drive our strategic initiatives, our digital transformations, our streamlined operating model. Those will continue to be our priorities. But we'll give you a better feel for that as we get closer to fiscal year '24. . Sure. And let me start on gross margin and then Linda can comment on pricing. As it relates to gross margin, as you said, we did overdeliver our expectations for Q2. We came into the quarter targeting a 100 to 200 basis point improvement. We delivered a little over 300. If you look at the drivers of that over-delivery, I'd point to 2 items. \n The first is less operating deleveraging. So because of the very strong top line performance and it exceeded our expectations, volume was only down 10% for the quarter. We had anticipated it to be down more, and we're expecting more deleveraging. So we see the benefit of that item, which tends to be discrete in the quarter. \n And then we did have some benefit of pulling cost savings forward. Now we remain on track to have a very good year. We're not changing our full year view of cost savings, but the team did some nice work pulling some of those projects in early and I'm always happy to get cost savings projects started early, but that was a benefit as well that will have a bit of an impact on the back half of the year. \n And so I think this is a balanced forecast for gross margins where we continue to believe we'll get to about 38% in the full year. And Dara, you made this comment, and I agree, it's still an environment with lower visibility and quite a bit of volatility. And so I want to see how this fourth round of pricing plays out. It's a little early for us to read. I want to get another quarter under our belt and see how that's playing out, and I think we'll have a better perspective on the full year. But with that, let me turn it over to Linda to talk a little bit more about pricing. Andrea, I would say, overall, I feel very good about where we're at from a top line perspective. And as you saw, we narrowed our range and we moved it to the top half of our range from an organic perspective. We're now targeting flat to up 3%. If you look at our performance through the first half of the year, organic sales growth is a little over 0.5%. So that success suggests much stronger performance in the back half of the year. \n And so the outlook, I think, really reflects a good start to the year, but it would project acceleration in the back half of the year in terms of organic sales growth really driven by, again, good strength in the business plus the ongoing impact of the pricing actions we're taking. I think if you look at the range right now, you can do the math. It would suggest the back half would be anywhere from flat to up 5% on an organic basis. \n And we've got still a fairly wide range in the back half of the year. And I think that reflects exactly what Linda was just talking about. There is some uncertainty about how this fourth round of pricing will go. And so we think it's appropriate to maintain a bit wider range until we see exactly how both the consumers react to this round of pricing as well as what we see from other manufacturers in terms of if they choose to follow or not. Yes. Andrea, what I'd say, in terms of elasticities, our expectation is elasticities for this December round of pricing would be very similar to what we saw in July, which is consistent with our historical levels of elasticities. You might remember in the first few rounds, we were seeing lower elasticities than historical levels. Consumers were less price sensitive. But now that's really reverted back to historical level elasticity. \n And then I would say on the back half, be a little careful because we do have some shifting as we talk about between quarters. I think maybe a better way to look at that, if you try to take out the noise of some volume shifting between Q2 and Q3, Q2, we had 4% organic sales growth. You saw in my prepared remarks, you may have seen, we're projecting 2% to 3% growth organic sales growth in Q3. \n Over that 6-month period, we're looking at organic sales growth a little over 3%. And so clearly, an acceleration of where we've been based on the fundamentals of the business we're talking about. But consumers continue to be resilient. Our categories have been -- shown to be resilient to date, and I think that's reflected in raising our outlook. Yes, say, Andrea, we don't comment on -- specifically on elasticity. And as you can imagine, they're quite different by category, by geography. And so it's something we don't comment publicly on the elasticities of the brands. Sure. Thanks, Kaumil, for the question. On supply, I would say the supply chain, we're definitely seeing improvements from the disruptions we're dealing with over the last year or 2. It continues to normalize, and that certainly helped benefit our inventory levels. So as you know, we have raised safety stocks to try to help manage the supply chain disruptions we're dealing with and create less impact to our ability to ship product to our retailers. \n As the supply chain is normalizing, we are able to go back and reduce the safety stock levels. And so as an example, in Q2, this is our fourth straight quarter that we've been able to reduce the inventory levels. I think year-over-year, we pulled another 4 days out of inventory on hand, and that's really a reflection of an improving supply chain. \n And you heard my earlier comment, 1 example of that is we've hit the highest case fill rate we've been able to deliver since the pandemic began. Now we've done that through some very good work by our team. But I would tell you, we are still dealing with intermittent supply chain disruptions. \n And I'm sure you'll remember last quarter, we talked about a few disruptions on our Glad and our Burt's Bees business, so that continues to occur. But it's certainly starting to normalize, and we're seeing less disruptions than we did a few years ago. And so that's allowed us to continue to work to optimize our supply chain. And one of those elements is reducing inventory levels. \n And then from a retailer perspective, the only place we saw some change in retailer inventory levels was on our Brita business in Q2. So we did see a little bit of a reduction in retail inventories on that business. Nothing else to speak of. And I would tell you in our outlook, we're not anticipating any additional material changes to retail inventories. \n That always goes on every quarter. You'll see some noise, but nothing that we think has any meaningful impact on our outlook, and that's what's assumed right now. And then maybe I know, Linda, do you want to talk about consumer pantry levels? I wouldn't say normalized me. I think that's probably overstating it. We are still dealing with supply chain disruptions. I would just say the frequency of those disruptions has definitely gone down. But I would not say we're -- I wouldn't describe it as a normal environment. \n We're still dealing with a number of challenges on a regular basis. But certainly, it's a lower frequency. And we were just talking last quarter about several of those that we're still working to resolve are mostly behind us. And I would expect we'll see more disruptions going forward. I don't believe we're in a position not to expect that. And so that's probably the way I would better describe it than we're in a normal environment. . Certainly better than before. Yes, Chris, thank you for the question. And I agree. We do expect gross margin will get better in Q3. If you look at what we provided in the prepared remarks, we're looking at a gross margin of 38% to 39%, so I think a very nice improvement for where we landed in Q2 at just a little over 36%. You may also recall, we don't use spot rates when we develop our outlooks. We use forward curves.\n So our outlook has always anticipated declining commodity costs as we move through the year. That's not a change in assumption for us. The only other item I would highlight is we will likely see more volume deleveraging in Q3 versus Q2. Because keep in mind now, we have the fourth round of pricing that went into effect in December. It had no meaningful impact on the second quarter. \n You'll start to see the impact of that in the third quarter, which means I would expect a bit more volume decline in Q3 than versus what we saw in Q2 as you now have one more round in pricing and the elasticities associated with that  round of pricing, so a little bit more volume deleveraging.\n But in spite of that, we're going to continue to drive nice benefits from pricing, cost savings. And as a result, I expect to continue to make very nice sequential progress. It'll will be up -- we believe, up 200 to 300 basis points versus Q2 and that keeps us very much on track for getting back to about 40% by the fourth quarter. No, the volume deleveraging will be based on the pricing. And as Linda mentioned, the pricing is pretty broad-based across our portfolio. So as we take our fourth round of pricing, there will be an element of volume deleveraging because of the elasticities on those price increases. That will impact the third quarter. \n But I think the other point you're making also keep in mind, we're lapping the Omicron variant from Q3 of last year. So that'll have an impact on our cleaning and disinfecting business as we've got a more difficult comp on that business. So I think really a combination on both those items, you'll see that play out in our volume projections for Q3. Yes, sure, Chris. I would say, as it relates to manufacturing and logistics, our expectation is it will continue to be a headwind this entire year. So we think it's -- as you saw in our remarks, $400 million of supply chain inflation. About half of that is in commodities. The other half is in manufacturing and logistics. Now we do think it moderates as we move through the year. And so we think each quarter, it'll be less of a hit than the previous quarter, but it'll be inflationary for the entire year, and that's factored into our outlook. \n And as it relates to the medium to longer term, as I mentioned, we're going to hold off on making any comments on fiscal year '24. It's just a little too early for us to do that. But at least this year, you should assume it'll continue to be inflationary, but moderating as we move through the quarters. . Sure. Jason, I would say we aspire to do both. I mean, you start by rebuilding gross profit then ultimately rebuild gross margin over time. For us, it'll be the same drivers we've talked about. We're going to continue to execute the pricing actions that we've taken. And as we've said, we don't have any additional plans to take further pricing this fiscal year based on our cost forecast. \n But we'll continue to drive pricing. We'll continue to drive cost savings and supply chain optimization. That's the way that we think puts us in a position to first recover gross profit and then ultimately keep going to recover gross margin. Typically, I'd say, in a normal environment, the work we do on cost savings is enough to offset a normalized level of inflation and allow us to build margins over time. And that allows us to continue to invest in our brands and continue to set the company. We have to deliver value over the long term. \n Obviously, we're dealing with a very unique environment right now with the unprecedented level of cost inflation. And so that's why we're leaning into pricing. I'd like to believe over time , as we get to a normalized environment as you described, we get back to more of our consistent model where we're really driving cost savings, and that's allowing us to offset inflation and build margin over time. But we're not in that environment right now. So we're leaning more aggressively into pricing. But I think ultimately, it's always both. We start by rebuilding gross profit and then we ultimately work to rebuild gross margin over time. Lauren, yes, I'm happy to answer the question on households. As you saw, we had 9% growth in the segment. From a volume perspective, really litter was the star of the group. We had double-digit growth on that business. And we continue to see very strong category growth. \n As you know, we've talked about it before. strong pet adoption during the pandemic. That's continued to fuel that category. And then we've continued to see very strong performance in that business. And so we are seeing -- in spite of the pricing we've taken, we are still growing volume in that business, more than offsetting the elasticity impact. Yes, Lauren, I think you'll have 2 impacts. Now we're starting to lap the first round of pricing we took last year. So you're starting to see some of that first run of pricing drop off as we get into the back half of our fiscal year, and it's being replaced with his fourth round. So it's not as clean as another round of pricing being added. I think in aggregate, this fourth round was larger than our first round. So in aggregate, you'll see a little bit more benefit from pricing, and you see a little larger hit in terms of the impact to volume from elasticities. Javier, let me see if I answer your question on shifting. So as we mentioned, in Q2, we had some benefit of shifting of some merch activity. And as I said, that's pretty typical that you'll see some merch events shift between quarters out of Q3 into Q2, and that was across a number of businesses. And then more specifically, we're seeing the benefit of an early start to cold and flu season in Q2 as it relates to our Health and Wellness portfolio. But maybe say a little bit more on what your question is. I'm not sure that gets to the question you're asking. Sure. As it relates to the cost environment, and you said it correctly, we are seeing moderating cost increase. Now as I said, we anticipate it's going to be inflationary all year long, but that year-over-year increase will moderate as we move through the year. As I look at specific commodities, we have anticipated resin would be a cost tailwind, so a lower year-over-year cost for resin. That's something we assumed at the beginning of the year, and that continues to play out that we are seeing resin prices favorable year-over-year. \n But that is being offset by -- we're seeing increases in most of our other buys outside of resin. So soybean oil, linerboard, chemicals, solvents, substrate. Most of the other key buys that we are purchasing, we are seeing cost increases on a year-over-year basis, and we expect that to continue throughout the year. So that's generally how it's playing out. \n What I would tell you, when you talk about what that moderation is, I think you can see it when you look at just the first half results. If I look at Q1, commodities were a 330 basis point hit to gross margin. In Q2, they're a 240 basis point hit. So that's exactly what we're describing. Still a headwind, but a lower hit each quarter. \n I would expect that to continue to play out that we'll see a declining impact from commodity costs as we move through the year. But again, we're looking at $400 million for the total inflation, resin being favorable, most of our other buys continue to be unfavorable on a year-over-year basis. Yes, I'm sorry that you would ask that question. Well, it really varies by commodities. In some cases, we hedge. And so in those cases, you may have 9 to 18 months before we see the impact of a changing commodity environment play through our cost structure. In other cases, we have contractual relationships with our suppliers that delays those changes. So it's really hard to give you an enterprise answer how quickly that plays through. It is a commodity-by-commodity discussion based on how we set up those relationships with our suppliers."

            "name": "Linda Rendle",
            "content": "Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks, despite persistent macroeconomic headwinds, we delivered better-than-expected Q2 results, with organic sales growth in 3 of 4 segments, gross margin expansion, and double-digit earnings growth. Our performance reflects the strength and superior value of our brands, strong execution across a broad set of actions and the benefit of some timing shifts. As a result, we've updated our full-year outlook.\n During the quarter, we made good progress through building margin, driving top line momentum and executing against our IGNITE Strategy to strengthen our advantages and accelerate profitable growth for the long term. This includes advancing our innovation pipeline, delivering cost savings and taking additional cost-justified pricing actions while maintaining record high consumer value superiority. Overall, we feel good about our progress, but we're relentlessly driving additional improvements as we continue to invest in our brands, categories and capabilities. \n Looking ahead, we expect the operating environment to remain volatile and challenging, and we'll continue using all the levers under our control while protecting the value proposition of our products to recover margin and drive long-term growth for our brands and categories. We are confident that our leading product portfolio in essential categories, coupled with our proactive actions will enable us to navigate this environment and return to more consistent profitable growth over time. With that, Kevin and I will take your questions. Sure. Thanks, Peter. So the first thing that I would just start with, and I'll hand it over to Kevin to walk through the quarter in a bit more detail, we're doing exactly what we said we were going to do. We are maintaining top line momentum, which came in better than we expected, and Kevin will walk you through those factors, while also doing the hard work to improve margins. And so from that perspective, we're feeling good about that balance. We're going to continue to be focused on it for the year. And Kevin, why don't you take them through the details of how the quarter should go. Yes. As Kevin just mentioned, we executed that fourth round of pricing in early December. And as Kevin noted, it's too early to determine, from a consumer perspective, the reaction. I would say, to date, everything looks in line with our expectations from an elasticity perspective. But again, too early, we haven't had a full purchase cycle yet, and it's still being reflected in the market. \n As it relates to competition, we did say in this price increase, we led for the most part on this round of pricing. And while we've seen some category movement in pricing. There are other categories we have not seen competitors move in yet. And we're watching that really, really closely to see what that's going to look like and prepare -- we're prepared to react. If our price gaps get out of line, or if we're seeing a consumer reaction not in line with our expectations given the full category hasn't moved. So too early yet to judge that, but it is true that some categories, we have not seen competition move subsequent to our pricing. Yes. This fourth round was a bit more moderate than we had taken in July, if you recall, July was the largest of the 4 price increases. This one was around mid-single digits and fairly broad across the portfolio, but more moderate than we had taken in the past. And again, too early to judge on what the pricing looks like and what the impacts are. But this one was definitely more moderate than what we saw in July. \n And if you look at July, the elasticities are exactly in line with our expectations across categories. So we would expect our models to continue to hold in December, but it's dynamic out there and consumers are certainly facing a lot of inflation in their broader basket, so we're watching it closely. Yes. What we're seeing is very similar to what Kevin highlighted just in retail. We are not seeing significant pantry loading by consumers or changes in behavior as it relates to the pantry. What we are seeing, and I think we'll highlight it in probably some discussion around what's going on with pricing with the consumer, we are seeing consumers continue to drive value-seeking behaviors given what they're facing. \n So we're seeing some purchase cycles extend as people try to make products work longer for them. They're purchasing different sizes. So that's changing the purchase cycle. But that's largely in line with what we would expect from the elasticity impact that's in line with our expectations. And we're not seeing any other consumer behavior that's abnormal outside of that normal elasticity impact. Sure. Jason, there was really 2 factors in Professional. One, which is a more midterm issue and then one that was a very short-term issue. That affected professional last quarter. And I'll start with that one, which was our Pine-Sol recall and that impacted Professional. We have a fairly large business in Pine-Sol in Professional, and we'd expect as we bring that distribution back, that just to be a short-term impact.\n As you look at the medium term, though, office occupancy is still down significantly as return to office has been delayed, and we've all seen the press on how hard it's been to get people to come back into the office to the degree that we thought we would. So that continues to be a headwind to the business. \n We're looking at other avenues to grow the business beyond just that, looking at our portfolio broadly and innovation. And we continue to have conviction that our professional business will be a growth driver for us in the future. And it's good to see it start to be a bit more normalized than it was in the past, but we are still dealing with that office occupancy headwind. Kevin, on the investment spending piece, incredibly important. We're seeing good consumer and category resilience. We're happy that we are maintaining share in an environment. We are aggressively going after rebuilding margin. And you all know that's exactly what we've targeted. We want to keep our top line momentum while rebuilding margins at the same time. And that's how we're approaching investments. \n We're making the right short-term investments to do that, but we're also not taking our eye off the long term and continuing to invest in those things that are going to make us a stronger company, like our digital transformation and like our op model. So that's what we're focused on. \n It just happens to be the shape of spending to have less in the front half of the year versus the back half given our plans, but that's just the shape of the investment, and we still are targeting 10% from an advertising and sales promotion perspective, still continuing to invest in innovation. That's been going well for us. And overall, going to continue to focus that investment on our brands.\n What I will say, though, is we're watching our categories incredibly closely right now. And the most important thing that we do is continue to deliver superior value to our consumers. And right now, we're really happy to say, among all that pricing that we took, strong double digits, we've maintained our record high superiority rating of 76%. We were in the 50% range a few years ago. And that combination gives us the confidence to continue to invest. \n But if we see a change in that, where consumers are reacting in a different way or if we don't see competition follow on price increases, we are ready with backup plans that we can activate very, very quickly to make adjustments to that. And if we need to make additional investments, we will to support the value spirit of our brands. But we feel we have that balance right, right now. That played out in Q2 behind the good balance we had in top line and bottom line. But that's how we're thinking about it overall, and we'll continue to take a proactive approach of adjusting if we need to. Kevin, what you're seeing in the latest data is what we see from a Q2 perspective in that promotion is still below where it was pre-pandemic across our categories. It's higher than it was a year ago in our categories, but definitely lower than pre-pandemic. And what we're hearing from retailers, which you would expect, is how do we continue to keep our categories healthy. \n So it's not a discussion on promotion necessarily. It's a discussion on how we have the right set for -- with the right distribution for our products, how we can lean into innovation and drive value from a market basket perspective, from a retailer perspective. But we are not hearing in a normal amount of level of interest in promotion because they know that's not usually the right way to drive the category.\n We want to use promotion very strategically in times of the year where we can ensure that consumers like back-to-school, for example, or cold and flu, where we know people are looking for our products, and we can introduce them to innovation or remind them to buy. So those conversations continue to be really constructive and we're mutually focused on ensuring the categories are healthy and doing it the right way. Yes, Lauren, this is a fundamental thing we're really focused on. And one of the trade-offs you do when you take the level of pricing that we're taking in the categories is you trade off some household penetration in the short term in order to do that. \n And while we're still in 9 out of 10 households and have very strong household penetrations across our category and in most cases, are performing better than the category is in household penetration, this is 1 of the trade-offs that we're making. And I think it's the right trade-off given the fact that we need to both maintain top line momentum and rebuild margins. \n But that being said, household penetration is incredibly important to us and the health of our business over the long term, and we are committed to regrowing that over time. And typically, what we see in price increases, you see some volume loss initially as consumers adjust their behavior. You begin to rebuild that over time.\n  So our first focus on household penetration will be rebuilding volumes over the mid- to long term. And we will do that by continuing to invest in innovation, having strong levels of investment in our brands as we're going to have 10% spending in A&SP this year and continuing to make the wrong -- right long-term digital investments to support brand building, et cetera.\n One note we were really proud of, we had our highest ROI marketing in this last period due to the personalization efforts that we've taken out. So we haven't talked a lot about that, but that's working, and it's allowing our money to work harder and will allow us to help us focus on growing household penetration over time. \n So what I would -- just again, to say it, this is a wide-eyed open trade-off that we are making in household penetration, but it's something that as we rebuild volumes, we would expect to rebound over time. And what's key to that is continuing to invest in our brands. Sure. Glad was a business we were up in sales this quarter. We actually grew share from a trash perspective. So we're really pleased with the performance of Glad through multiple rounds of pricing. We're seeing strong performance in the market, and that's really behind our innovation program that we've spent a lot of time talking about, whether it be the addition of colors and sense, our focus on value there. Our work on distribution across the retailer base is paying off, and we feel good about where that business is from a trash perspective.\n And then from a Burt's perspective, we did share that we had a supply disruption that happened and we believe we'll be able to work through it through Q3, and that continues to be the case. We made good progress on it in Q2 when we're able to support some strong holiday promotions and sales that led to growth on that business, but we still have some work to do, and we intend to be through that by the end of this quarter. Sure. As we've said, it really is too early to judge December's price increase at this point. But maybe I'll speak, Olivia, to the broader sets of price increases and just what we're seeing on average and what we continue to expect to happen as December gets fully reflected in the marketplace. \n We are seeing consumers and our categories remain resilient. And you can see that just in the strong consumption that you see in MULO right now. Consumers are reacting favorably. And I think this is really due to the fact that we're in essential categories. These brands play a role in consumers' every day routines, and we're continuing to see them favor value. That's what we've always focused on with our brands. \n They're looking for superior value, not necessarily the lowest price. And with our superiority rating, I mentioned earlier, of 76%, consumers continue to feel that our brands are the best value and they're voting for them in store. And with that, we are seeing value-seeking behavior that's within our own brands. \n So people want to stay with the Clorox company branded product. And so they're trading within our portfolio, and we've seen that over the last number of price increases. Some consumers are choosing to buy opening price points, because perhaps that day, their wallet, they have a limited amount of money they can spend in the category or they're looking for the very, very best value on a price per use basis and so they're trading up to larger sizes, or maybe they're trading within our cleaning portfolio between a dilutable and a spray cleaner in order to get the value equation right for them. And the good news is we have offerings to meet their needs there. And that's what we're really focused on with retailers, ensuring we have the right distribution to meet those needs as consumers continue to look for the best value within our portfolio. And I think we're going to continue to see that happen. \n As it relates to private label, we're not seeing any meaningful trade down in our categories to private label. And again, we maintain share amid 4 price increases, so that is playing out. But I'll tell you, we're watching it really closely. This -- it looks like it's going to continue to get tougher for the consumer in aggregate. And so we're looking particularly as that fourth round is implemented and particularly in categories where we have higher private label penetration to ensure that we have that right value. \n And I also mentioned earlier, we haven't seen some competitors reflecting additional price increase as we did in December. And so we're watching our gaps really closely in those categories as well to ensure that we are continuing to offer superior value. And we will make adjustments. We are ready to if we need to, to protect the value of those brands. But at the moment, category and consumer is resilient. Our brands are very resilient maintaining share, and we're going to continue to activate our plans on innovation and investment to keep them healthy. Yes, I'll jump in on that one, Javier. So you are noting a few categories that have very strong untracked channel performance. And particularly in litter, our business in club, that was up due to some strong merchandising activity we had and actually some of the shift that we experienced from Q3 into Q2. So that's what you're seeing in the difference between the tracked channels and what we're talking about from a volume and sales performance in household. Yes. This is a category that certainly has had the biggest swings as consumers change their behavior as we went through the height of the pandemic, and we're still lapping. We're still normalizing, given Omicron happened last Q3, and we're in the process of lapping that right now. What I would say is if you look at this last Q2 versus pre-pandemic, our volumes are still higher. So in aggregate, people are still cleaning more.\n And certainly, we're still normalizing consumer behavior. And then we had a very abnormal cold and flu season this year. It happened earlier, it happened in December from a peak perspective. It usually happens in January and February. So there are a lot of dynamics in play here around normalization. \n But what we see is still a business that has great opportunity to grow and be an outsized contributor to the company given people, they care about cleaning and disinfecting as part of keeping them well. But we're going to be normalizing as we get through this and consumers continue to adjust their behavior. And hopefully, we'll get into a more normalized cycle where cold and flu normalizes, and we're seeing a more normalized impact from COVID, but we're not quite there yet. \n And as we look at the volume loss, that's really due to that factor around normalization, but also the pricing that we have, and it's in line with our expectations. So as we look at that, that just gives us conviction because it's about what we expected it to be. And then as we move forward, we'll continue to adjust as consumers adjust. \n But it's the same thing we're focusing on innovation in those categories where we can make the job easier for them. We're continuing to invest to help people to understand different ways to keep themselves well, whether that be in a professional setting or at home. But we feel really good about the Health and Wellness business overall. It's just going to be bumpy until we get back to a normalized environment. Yes, Steve, on household penetration, that is definitely a more mid- to long-term goal for us to get back to household penetration, given the fact that the December price increase is just starting to take a hold now. We would expect to have to go through an entire cycle of that and we haven't even lapped the July price increase, which was our big 1 coming up here. So that will be something that we're focused on now to ensure that we are investing and that we're keeping as many consumers in as we possibly can. But that work will be rebuilding over 24 and beyond. Yes. I think that's very possible, Steve, based on the fact that we just took that pricing, we could see a bit more of a reduction in household penetration. And again, we think that is the right trade-off to make to get that balance right between top line and bottom line. But yes, it's possible as we go through, we could see some additional household penetration erosion. The base case is more steady state, Steve. As we talk about promotions being a more strategic part of our portfolio than something that we just do to drive volume on a quarterly basis. That's the approach that we're taking for the back half of the year. We have good innovation plans. We want to make sure that we hit consumers on key pulse periods to remind them about the category and the value that we drive. \n So that's our approach. Again, being what it is, we will look to ensure that we have the right value and that we are competitive. And so if there were to be a change in what we're seeing in the category today, which is slightly higher, like I said earlier, promotion than last year, but still less than in pandemic, we could potentially adjust our plans and we're ready to do that. but we would expect just a more normalized promo environment. That's how we're treating it for the back half, and that's what we've seen so far in Q2. Yes, you got it right on mosaic, Steve. That's exactly it, which is we're taking a combination of all of those factors as we're deciding if we need to adjust our plans or not. And really primarily, what we're looking at is consumer reaction to our brands, and we're looking very closely at any changes that would be outside of what we expect given the elasticities that we have in market. And then we would make corresponding plans.\n And we're looking at competitors to see are they doing something different, are they promoting more heavily, or are they looking at a certain pack size that would make us adjust our plans. Those are the 2 primary factors we're looking at in the very, very short term. And then, of course, as we look over months and quarters, we're looking at share, and we're really happy that we maintain share this quarter given the fourth round of pricing.\n But that's the other thing we're watching. Is there too much of a slide in share, is that trade-off not worth it,  et cetera. So we're looking at all of it. But to start, we're looking at that gap, we're looking at consumer behavior by category to say is it different than our expectations and then adjusting from there. Thank you, everyone. We'll see you at CAGNY later this month and look forward to updating you on our progress in May. Please stay well."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Clorox Company First Quarter and Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference. \nLisah Burhan: Thank you, Ross. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Linda Rendle, our CEO; and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. I hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website. In just a moment, Linda will share a few opening comments, and then we'll take your question.\n During this call, we may make forward-looking statements, including about our 2023 fiscal year outlook. These statements are based on management's current expectations, but may differ from actual results or outcomes.\n In addition, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section, which identifies various factors that could affect such forward-looking statements, which has been filed with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the non-GAAP financial information section of our earnings release and the supplemental financial schedule in the Investor Relations section of our website for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n Now I'll turn it over to Linda. \nLinda Rendle: Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. While the challenging and volatile global operating environment we discussed last quarter persist, we delivered better-than-expected Q1 results, reflecting the strength of our brands, ongoing consumer loyalty and solid execution.\n During the quarter, we maintained our unrelenting focus on rebuilding margin by taking additional inflation-driven pricing, delivering cost savings, optimizing our supply chain and implementing our new operating model. At the same time, we continue to invest in our brands, to deliver consumer-inspired innovation with superior value as well as advance our digital transformation to drive top line momentum and position the company for long-term success.\n Looking ahead, it's still early in the fiscal year, and we continue to contend with a number of macro headwinds, which we are proactively addressing, and we'll remain agile as the environment evolves. Given these factors, we are reiterating our full year outlook. Nevertheless, guided by our IGNITE Strategy, we remain committed to delivering on our 3% to 5% sales growth target over the long term.\n The fundamentals of our business are strong. We plan essential categories and our business is well positioned to benefit from lasting consumer demand tailwinds. I'm confident we're on the right track to generate consistent and profitable growth over time and build a stronger, more resilient company.\n With that, Kevin and I will take your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Peter Grom from UBS. \nPeter Grom: So I wanted to ask a big picture question on kind of the guidance for the year. You mentioned that currency is [ a $0.17 -- $0.17 to adjusted ] EPS. And I know there are varying degrees of views under the level of conservatism embedded in this guidance.\n But just when we think about the ability to maintain the earnings range, [ despite in that, what that strategy is about, about the half ] the size of the entire range, is there something that's coming in better to offset that, whether it be underlying growth, commodity costs, et cetera? Or is kind of the right way to think about the updated currency impact is that you now expect to kind of be at the lower end of that earnings range? \nKevin Jacobsen: Hey, Peter. Thanks for the question on guidance. Let me provide a perspective. And what I'd tell you, at a high level, I feel our guidance is very balanced and it is where we expect to land the year.\n If I think about some of the puts and takes where we're at, as you saw in our prepared remarks, we had a good solid start to the year that exceeded our expectations, what we shared with you about a quarter ago. And so we feel very good about the start of the year.\n At the same time, we are dealing with some additional headwinds, FX being one. But as Linda also mentioned, we've got a couple of supply disruptions on a couple of our businesses that we're working through. And so I'd say, a good start to the year. We've got a couple issues we're dealing with, but by and large, feel like we remain on track.\n I think what's also important, Peter, as we think about -- you had mentioned inflation, I would say inflation is generally playing out as we expected. We said at the beginning of the year, it was about $400 million of the cost, inflation in the supply chain. We still expect about that same amount. Although I would tell you, when we started the year, we were a little below $400 million. We're a little above right now. So it's gotten a little bit worse.\n As we've been doing through the entire pandemic, we are making the appropriate adjustments to our plans. We've done that. And as a result, we feel good that we're on track for our outlook. \nPeter Grom: And I guess, I had just one follow-up on the kind of the organic sales outlook. I know, previously, a lot of the weakness was expected to occur in Health and Wellness, and you were expecting to see continued momentum across the rest of the business.\n In the first quarter, obviously, Health and Wellness came in better than you were anticipating, and it seems like, at least from our perspective, that the other segments [ all with ] weaker performance. So just like any thoughts or updated thoughts on how to think about the building blocks for the organic sales outlook from a segment perspective? \nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, Peter, you're right. As you think about Q1 versus our expectations, our Health and Wellness segment came in better, behind the strength of Cleaning and Disinfecting. That business outperformed our expectations based a on very successful back-to-school merchandising program primarily.\n And then, as you said, if you look at the rest of our portfolio, we had anticipated stronger organic growth. It came in a little bit below our expectations, really driven by the supply disruptions in our Burt's Bees and our Glad business unit. If those 2 businesses had delivered against our expectations, we would have delivered about 3% organic growth on the rest of our portfolio, ex Health and Wellness.\n But clearly, these are some new issues, that we've been dealing with this for the last 3 years. Supply chain disruptions are nothing new. We're dealing with it in these 2 businesses. We expect to get those worked out this quarter. And by the back half of the year, I'd expect those businesses are back to shipping, back to our expectations.\n So I think it will drag a little bit in the second quarter as a result of that, and then I expect stronger performance in the back half of the year as we get those resolved. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. \nAndrea Teixeira: So my question would be on kind of like how you see shipments against consumption. And obviously, Health and Wellness was coming in better than anticipated. How should we be thinking of retailers taking in inventory potentially ahead of the price increases or anything on that sense in the other ones?\n And how, conversely, on your point, Kevin, about not being able to fulfill some of the other parts of the business and would have been a better outcome of 3%, like how should we be thinking about consumption against inventory? And as you try to fulfill, is that something that you may have missed in terms of the sets and the seasonal impacts of that going forward, especially for Charcoal and Litter as we move into the quarters? \nLinda Rendle: Hi, Andrea. Thanks for the question. So generally, we saw in Q1 minimal impact from any type of inventory effect going either way. We did have a couple of businesses that we saw retailers make some inventory adjustments actually on the other side. We call that vitamins, minerals and supplements as one of them, Charcoal as another. And we look at that as a very normal inventory changes, no impact to the consumer or impact to consumption, but retailers continue to optimize their inventory levels.\n We did not see a mismatch between consumption and shipments going the other way, where we see inventories rising at retail. But we continue to see that's going to be dynamic. Retailers are making adjustments, adjusting to the new volumes they're seeing in the categories. So we're watching that as we move forward, but again, would not be any type of strategic impact. It would simply be shifts in timing versus any other type of concern that we would have.\n So at this point, we think we're at about the right inventory levels across all of our businesses, and again, minimal impact in Q1 and do not anticipate a sizable impact moving forward in our outlook. \nAndrea Teixeira: And just if I can follow up on the margin. Kevin, you mentioned then that there was an impact on volume deleverage this quarter. But as you move forward, you're still expecting the 200 basis points improvement in gross margin as we navigate through this $400 million that you called out being a little bit higher than initial and then FX.\n Is there anything that you can comment, perhaps more pricing that you can use as offsets? And I understand, of course, you're going to start to lap and have a better -- in the first quarter with a very good start from that perspective. Just trying to see the cadence and what to expect going forward. \nKevin Jacobsen: Sure, Andrea. And you're correct. We still expect to deliver about 38% gross margin for the full year. That would be up about 200 basis points versus a year ago. And as we've said, this continues to be a very dynamic environment.\n As conditions change, we continue to adjust our plans as appropriate, to maintain our plans for the full year. I'll just give you one example. As we've seen the FX environment become more difficult, as we talked about, and we're seeing higher inflation in a number of countries where we operate, we've gone back and adjusted our [ pricing plans ] in our international markets.\n That's an example where we're going back and making appropriate plan changes to address the changing macro environment. And through those changes, we're able to keep our plans on track for the year. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. \nDara Mohsenian: So obviously, very strong price mix in the quarter at 13%. You did take pricing later than some competitors and more aggressively at this point in time at least. So can you just talk about the consumer reaction that you're seeing so far, the retailer reaction and also just what you're seeing from competitors in terms of price gaps? And just give us a sense of also what's left to come going forward on the pricing front in terms of increases from here. \nLinda Rendle: Sure. Happy to, Dara. So pricing is on track. And as you noted, we've taken multiple rounds of pricing, with a third round in market effective in July. And we are seeing elasticity largely in line with our expectations.\n And that has been early in the year, slightly favorable to what they were pre-COVID, but we're starting to see them drift towards our pre-COVID elasticities as we had anticipated. Our categories remain healthy and resilient. And our price gaps have returned to pre-pandemic levels for most brands.\n Given the pressures that Kevin spoke about in terms of cost, we are taking an additional round of pricing in December, which will be our fourth major round of pricing. We don't anticipate that round to be as deep or broad as the July pricing, which was the largest of the 4 that we will take to date. And we anticipate that we'll be leading in many of the categories that we're taking pricing in, in December.\n And as Kevin said, we're going to continue to be nimble and adjust. But at this point, consumer resilience, elasticity, is in line with expectations, and price gaps where we would expect them to be. \nDara Mohsenian: Great. And then it sounded like market share is coming in better than expected perhaps on the Cleaning side, with the merchandising around back-to-school, et cetera. So can you just talk about what you're seeing from a market share standpoint on that side of the business and what you're expecting going forward? \nLinda Rendle: Sure. And maybe I'll just broaden the comment on share overall. We're making progress on share, but we have more work to do. And supply disruptions have been part of that, going on in our Household Essentials business.\n But we were happy to continue to see the momentum in Cleaning, as you note. We've grown share consistently now quarter after quarter, and that continued with the strong performance that we had in back-to-school, as you noted.\n We grew all-outlet share in our 4 largest businesses. So that's Home Care, Glad, Food and Charcoal, which was great to see. But as I've said many times, I expect to grow share in aggregate, and we're not quite there yet. But we'll continue to see progress as pricing flows through in December and as our distribution plans continue to take hold. But we feel good about the progress, but the work is not done yet on share. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo. \nChristopher Carey: Can I just maybe ask maybe more of a conceptual question about gross margins? Kevin, I think you noted that your commodity -- or that the cost basket of $400 million was trending slightly below $400 million before, and now, it's trending above $400 million. So I wonder if you could just maybe offer some additional context on the complexion of that cost basket, perhaps between commodity and noncommodity?\n And maybe layering on to that, just the concept of, certainly, there's a view, which I think you've talked about yourselves, that the gross margins of this business should continue to improve at a progressive rate over the next few years.\n And I just wonder what you think about the durability of some of these cost increases that you've seen, specifically on the noncommodity side, which continue to linger. And how much pricing do you think you might need to take or cost savings that you would need to execute in order to achieve your longer-term objectives on the margin line? \nKevin Jacobsen: Sure. Thanks, Chris, for the question. And let me start with the overall basket of cost increases we're looking at. And as you mentioned, we started the year expecting about $400 million, a little below. We've updated that with this most recent outlook, and we're rolling up to a little bit over $400 million, but generally, still in that area.\n What hasn't really changed for us is commodity inflation overall. It represents about half that total inflation. While we've seen a little bit of change by item [ we purchased ], the general level of inflation in the commodities is pretty consistent with what we thought about a quarter ago. So no real change there.\n We've seen a little bit of improvement on resin prices, and then there's a few other areas in chemicals and ag products that have gone a little bit the other way. But puts and takes, but by and large, our commodity inflation expectation is consistent with what we thought earlier this year.\n Where we are seeing a little bit higher prices is primarily in logistics, and I'm sure you folks are seeing what's going on with the price of diesel. That's coming in higher than we anticipated. So we revised up a bit our expectation on logistics cost inflation. So we're still operating in generally that $400 million range, but a little bit higher cost we're expecting in logistics for the balance of the year.\n In terms of how I expect the gross margins to phase going forward, I think this is an important inflection point for us. As you know, margins declined for about 5 straight quarters given the tremendous cost inflation we're dealing with last year, as you recall, about $800 million worth of cost inflation in the supply chain.\n We stabilized margins in Q4. They were essentially flat year-over-year. As you saw this most recent quarter, gross margin down about 100 basis points, primarily for the charge we took on the Pine-Sol recall. Excluding that charge, they are generally flat year-over-year again. And we expect to start growing this quarter. As you saw in my prepared remarks, we expect 100 to 200 basis points of margin expansion.\n So I think this is an important inflection point. We're getting back now to starting to rebuild margins that we've been working on for a while. I expect that to continue as we move through the balance of this year. As we said, we expect to grow margins about 200 basis points for full year, but I expect that to build starting from Q2 as we move forward.\n And then your longer-term question, Linda and I and the entire leadership team remain committed to rebuilding margins to pre-pandemic levels. And we said that's going to take a while. It's difficult to predict exactly when we'll be able to achieve that because a lot of that is outside of our control.\n I feel very good about the things we control, the pricing we're executing, the cost savings program, and our supply chain optimization work is all very much on track. But the reality is, the cost environment continues to be very dynamic.\n At some point, I expect cost to roll over. These are cyclical commodities. But it's difficult to know when that will occur. And that will likely either accelerate or delay the time of our margin recovery based on outside events.\n And then on the cost buckets outside of commodities, when you look at logistics and manufacturing, there are some of those costs that I think will stick. When you look at labor, I expect those costs will continue going forward. But there's other elements, diesel, things of that nature, I do expect also to see come down at some point. And so we'll have to see exactly how that plays out.\n But what I feel good about is we're starting to make progress on our commitment to start rebuilding margins. That starts for us this quarter. And I would expect that to continue as we move through the year. \nChristopher Carey: Just one quick follow-up would be, and this would be for Linda or Kevin, but Professional business was flat, I believe, in the quarter, which seems like finally seeing some stabilization. I wonder if you could just add some context of what you're seeing in the business and how it factors into your plans for this year. \nLinda Rendle: Yes, it was about flat, and we take that as a good sign as well. We are seeing continued headwinds on that business as it relates to return to office and some of the things that affect our janitorial business.\n But we are seeing some return to office, which is good from a sales perspective as well as hospitals getting into a more normalized routine, where they're using our products to clean in between procedures, et cetera.\n Now from here, we're focused on ensuring that we have the right sales plans, that we're working with businesses and janitorial services to ensure that they have the right protocols and hospitals as well. So we expect, again, over the long term, that business to be an outsized contributor to the company. But certainly, I would say, at this point, we're happy to see it flat again and hope to return to growing here over the coming quarters. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Javier Escalante from Evercore. \nJavier Escalante Manzo: I have 2 questions. One, business planning for Kevin. And if I have a follow-up, to Linda, more strategically on the business planning. If we look at retail [ sourcing in this kind of data ], we see volumes weakening, so it's high teens.\n So in that context, if you could tell us what is your second quarter assumption between volumes and pricing and how you distinguish what is normalization of demand versus elasticities given that you are taking more pricing in the December quarter. And then I have a follow-up. \nKevin Jacobsen: Sure. Javier, on Q2, and I'm not going to give a full detailed outlook for Q2, we've tried to provide some color to be helpful for modeling purposes, we do expect top line to be down low single digits on a reported basis. And we continue to expect about 2 points of FX headwinds. So you should assume organic sales growth is about 2 points better than our reported sales, which are expected to be down in that low single-digit range.\n I expect Q2, in general, like somewhat similar to Q1. I expect ongoing normalization in our Cleaning and Disinfecting portfolio. Now not to the same extent that you saw in Q1, where we're lapping the Delta variant, but we do expect some ongoing normalization in that portfolio.\n And then, as we mentioned, we've got a few supply chain disruptions we're working through. I think that will impact Q2, similar to what we saw in Q1, and we're going to -- we expect to get those resolved as we move into the back half of the year. And so overall, I think as you look at volume-price-mix, I would not expect it to be that different than what we saw in the first quarter. \nJavier Escalante Manzo: So down double digits, the volume for second quarter? \nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, I'd expect so, because that's probably playing out based on elasticities. And maybe a broader point that's helpful to comment on. As you think about the elasticities in our portfolio, generally, our expectation when we take pricing based on the normal elasticities is you don't generate much incremental revenue from that pricing. We are taking pricing to address the cost inflation. It's not necessarily a source of revenue growth.\n And so I would expect, if elasticity is played out as we expect, I would see volume decline similar to what we saw in Q1, maybe a little bit better because of less demand normalization in Cleaning and Disinfecting, but still have volume declines generally offsetting the price mix by generating -- starting to generate very nice savings to gross margin.\n I think you saw, in Q1, we generated over 500 basis points of margin expansion through pricing. I'd expect to build on that in Q2 because we'll get the full impact of the July price increase, plus a modest impact of December pricing we're taking as well. \nJavier Escalante Manzo: That's great, Kevin. And more strategically, to Linda. I'm kind of refamiliarizing myself with Clorox, and I'm a little bit surprised about how significant investment in ERP is.\n Most of your businesses are U.S.-centric. Many of your categories, the main competitor is private label. So essentially, there is more of a cost issue, low-cost base kind of situation. Your cost base is getting higher. So why do you need that investment in digitalization. These are now beauty companies. This is Charcoal, Bleach, trash bags. Help us understand the rationale of that investment. \nLinda Rendle: Javier, our digital transformation is much larger than just implementing a new ERP, which we need to. Our ERP is well over 20 years old, and that's the foundation of how we run our business. But what we're trying to do is modernize our digital infrastructure to maximize our ability to grow and maximize our efficiency.\n So the technology we're investing in is not just foundational, but it allows us to move faster on innovation. Leverage the data, the enormous amount of data that we have, across our ecosystem to get to insights and be able to grow our categories, to be able to generate savings by knowing exactly where the costs are in our supply chain and being able to remove the ones that are not value-added.\n So this digital transformation supports that 3% to 5% growth we're talking about. And we expect that value to begin to happen at the end of the strategy period and beyond that to set us up for the next period.\n And then, of course, from an ERP perspective, we do have businesses in over 100 countries, so we'll be rolling out this ERP across the world to ensure that we can run our business. But this is much bigger than just putting in the base technology. This is really about digitizing for the future. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Anna Lizzul from Bank of America. \nAnna Lizzul: I wanted to follow up on pricing. You mentioned you're taking more pricing in December. So it seems then that you feel comfortable that retailers and consumers can absorb this additional pricing. If you can comment on recent trends, are you seeing any bifurcation in consumer appetite for Clorox products with higher-end consumers, more stable, versus lower-end consumers trading down or out of the brand? \nLinda Rendle: I would say our consumer and our categories remain very resilient through the 3 rounds of pricing that we have taken. And the pricing elasticity has played out just as we expected. And to be clear, that is slightly favorable than it was. Those elasticities were pre-COVID, but we're starting to see them drift to more normalized elasticities as we expected.\n We are not seeing any material signs of trade down from our brands to private label or to other brands. We're watching that closely, and we'll adapt our plans if we need to if that changes. But what we are seeing is consumers broadly seeking value type of behaviors, and that's happening within our portfolio. And we talked a little bit about this last quarter, and this is expected. So we're seeing consumers shop more heavily in value channels, for example. So they're moving to club and dollar and mass.\n We're seeing them look for different ways to explore value through sizing. So maybe buying at an opening price point, if they just have a low out-of-pocket availability from a cash standpoint, or they're trying to get the very best value per ounce or use and they're going with larger sizes.\n We've seen things like trip frequency increase, where people are spending a little bit less on each trip, but they are coming more frequently. And this is very typical value-seeking behavior from consumers at this point.\n And what I'd say is, actually, our low-income consumer in our brands is holding up even more strongly than general population, and we've seen stronger household penetration from low-income consumers, which is consistent with what we believe is that, in this time, the highest value with low-income consumer becomes even more important, and our brands are superior value.\n And that's, of course, measured with the fact that the largest portion of our portfolio is deemed superior by consumers than it ever has before since we've been again measuring it. So we're in a very good spot. We expect the December price increase to go largely as the last 3 have gone. But we're monitoring it really closely.\n We'll expect the environment to continue to be bumpy, and we'll expect consumers to continue to have more stress put on them. But given the categories we compete on, Household Essentials, everyday products that they need, we feel very well-positioned to be able to take another round of pricing. \nAnna Lizzul: Great. That's very helpful. And just as a follow-up, given that you've exited certain private-label contracts, how do you feel about your inventory levels going forward? \nKevin Jacobsen: Anna, I think you're talking about our contract manufacturing agreements, is that right? \nAnna Lizzul: Right. \nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, you're exactly right. So as you may recall, we increased the use of contract manufacturers during the pandemic to help meet the increased demand for our products. [ We knew ] that was [ temporary to normalize ]. We have stepped out of those agreements. We did that at the end of last year.\n And then what we've said is we've been holding higher safety stock inventory levels to help build more resiliency into our supply chain to manage through the ongoing disruptions we're experiencing. As those disruptions start to level out our expectations, we're going to be able to bring inventory levels down as we have more reliability in our supply chain.\n I would say the supply chain is getting better from where we were a year ago, but by no means are we back to a pre-pandemic level of normalcy in the supply chain. And so what we're seeing on inventory right now is we're starting to do just what we said, which is we're starting to bring inventory levels down.\n If you look at where we landed in Q1 on a year-over-year basis, we've been able to reduce inventory levels by about $30 million. And so you probably saw that, our cash provided by operations is up. Part of that is our ability to reduce inventory levels. And that also helps on the cost side as we have less product to move around, less warehousing fees, and we're not storing that product.\n And so we've started to raise inventory levels. I expect that to continue this quarter. And then we're going to really continue to watch the supply chain. And as we have more confidence in our ability to respond to consumer demand and we expect less disruption, we [ seem to be able to ] work that down even further. But we're starting to make good progress there. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Jason English from Goldman Sachs. \nJason English: A couple of questions, also on gross margin. So first, you indicated you expect GMs to be up 100 to 200 bps this quarter. Let's just take the high end of the range, that would imply around 35%, which would be 100 basis points below what you actually did this quarter.\n Historically, there's not a lot of seasonality. Maybe you're talking about pushing through more price. So why would gross margins go down sequentially? What's the incremental headwind that you expect to be weighing on results in the second quarter? \nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, Jason. Thanks for the call. I would say, in terms of driving gross margin accretion, and to your point, 100, 200 basis points of what we're projecting, we continue to project pretty strong performance on cost savings. I expect pricing to build from Q1 to Q2, as I mentioned earlier.\n And then in terms of headwinds, we continue to face a very difficult cost environment. We had over 300 basis points of headwinds in Q1. I expect another challenging quarter in Q2 from cost inflation. We're seeing the same thing in logistics and manufacturing.\n And as we mentioned, we've got a couple of supply chain disruptions that we're dealing with in the second quarter, and that's also going to be a partial drag on margin as well as we work through those, which we expect to get resolved by the third quarter.\n And then probably the last item I'd highlight is volume deleveraging. We do expect volumes to be down in Q2. And as you know, there's some manufacturing deleveraging associated with that. And so when I look across all those drivers, the good news is we expect to be at an inflection point where we start rebuilding margins this quarter, and I expect that to continue. But within the puts and takes, we expect about 100 to 200 basis points this quarter. \nJason English: Okay. And the recall expense goes away, too. So you had more price, less recall expense, and gross margins go lower. I'm missing something here in this, Kevin, from the 1Q to... \nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, there is -- yes, the only one, I would say -- the only other item I would highlight is there is seasonality in our business. Q2 tends to be our lower quarter because it's the lowest quarter for our Kingsford business, which is a nice profitable business. And so typically, Q2 is a lower quarter for us in a normalized environment, and we'd expect that this quarter as well. \nJason English: Okay. And then the manufacturing and logistics, I hear you a lot and clear on logistics, [ we can't refute ] that, right? We all see diesel prices. But I think many of us were expecting, at least the manufacturing component, to flip to a tailwind as you exited some of those co-managed, repatriated volume. And at least my expectation is that would be a powerful mitigator to some logistics.\n Maybe you can unpack that for us. Are we just overestimating the tailwinds of unwinding some of that incremental cost? Or is it that logistics have really stepped up that much higher, that they're materially outpacing those benefits? \nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, Jason, I would say, I think you're overestimating the value of unwinding those co-pack agreements. That was a nice benefit, but it was less than 100 bp benefit to logistics and manufacturing as we step out those agreements. So it nicely helps contribute to rebuilding margins, but by no means was it a significant driver to the margin challenges we've been dealing with over the last 6 quarters or so. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nKaumil Gajrawala: Kevin, can you talk a bit about the operating deleverage risk given how much volumes are declining? And I certainly understand the justification for taking pricing. But we're seeing some big declines in volume. Can you maybe balance the, kind of trying to capture inflation on the cost side versus how much of a drag it might be on the manufacturing deleverage side? \nKevin Jacobsen: Sure, Kaumil. It's interesting, when you think about the manufacturing deleveraging, typically, you expect to have a bigger impact for the volume decline we talked about, being down 15%. What you're seeing though here that mitigates that is, as you know, we stepped out of those contract manufacturing agreements, so we brought that volume back into our plants.\n And so our plant production volume is not down to the degree you're seeing our shipment cases down or essentially just turning off those co-packers. And so it minimizes the volume deleveraging we're seeing in our facilities. And I expect that going forward. \nKaumil Gajrawala: Okay. Great. And you mentioned in your -- I can't remember if it was a press release or your prepared remarks, on distribution gains, is that -- are those gains over the course of this year? And how does the distribution may be compared to 2019? \nLinda Rendle: Sure. So we've been able to grow total distribution points for 8 consecutive quarters now. And our team is doing the work on both restoring the base. If you remember, we rationalized assortment at the beginning of the pandemic to be able to produce as much product as we possibly could. So part of that is restoring back to some of the distribution that we thoughtfully removed on our own in order to run efficiently.\n But then most importantly, we're gaining distribution on the innovation programs that we have in place and have been able to continue that trend moving in the right direction. So we're really happy about where we are from a distribution perspective and continuing to invest in innovation so that we can continue that trend moving forward. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. \nLauren Lieberman: So first question was just the level of pricing at a total company level, 12%. I was just sitting here opening up all my models, and I don't think we have any other U.S.-facing companies or companies who report geographically in HPC who put up that kind of pricing.\n So I guess, Linda, first off, as you put through another round of pricing in December, why is it that you're so confident that we won't see -- start to see some share [ wobbles ]? And you commented on the elasticity not being traded down. So is it just that consumers are using or consuming less at this point and that's the elasticity you're seeing? Because you're suggesting it's not about share loss, but elasticity exists, albeit in line with your forecast. \nLinda Rendle: Yes. Lauren, on pricing, I think it's very difficult to compare across companies because everybody has different portfolios and to your good point, have different global portfolios. But what I would say, and I think this is important, if we look category by category for us, our pricing is in line with the categories that we compete in around the world.\n So as I mentioned earlier, our price gaps are about what they were pre-pandemic, which would, of course, imply that pricing has been about equal across the competitive set that we have in our specific categories and countries.\n We would expect, although we'll lead in many of these price increases, that, that would continue, that with our price gaps, would largely be in line. But that is something that we are looking at with eyes wide open on our plan, that we might have to make adjustments if that is not the case coming out of the fourth round of pricing in December. But largely, we believe, that will be the case, that our price gaps will continue. While [ mosey ] in the short term as people adjust, will continue to be what they were pre-pandemic.\n And then our elasticities are holding exactly what they thought they would. So they've been slightly favorable to pre-pandemic. We're starting to see them drift towards historical levels, which is what we expected. So we're seeing consumer behavior in line with our expectations.\n And what elasticity really is in these categories is consumers adjust their behavior. So they are not trading, in our case, in our categories to private label, but they are maybe making a trash bag last a little bit longer by making sure it's full all the way.\n They are delaying their purchase cycles a little bit and trying to stretch what product they have. And that's typically what we see in our categories. People don't just exit them in full, but they try to find ways to get a bigger bang for their buck. And that's consistent with the behavior we're seeing.\n And we don't expect that to change for the fourth round of pricing. But to your very good point, we are going to watch it very carefully, and we're ready to make adjustments to our plan if we need to, to ensure our price gaps are in line and our business continues to remain healthy with consumers. \nLauren Lieberman: Okay. And I guess, recognizing how strong the aggregate sales growth is without a doubt, I guess, and the elasticity in line with expectations, as you said a couple of times, but at what point does the rate of volume decline be something that is more than you want to see? That -- because it's a bit striking, right? We've had lots of companies that we've seen take a lot of pricing, but no one has -- the volume decline of this magnitude is striking.\n So at what point does that become problematic? That if you weren't in the position of having the benefit of bringing production back in-house, that's supporting the margin and obfuscating any kind of degree of volume deleverage, that it would be a bigger problem. So as we look forward, I think that's just an important question to think about, your sensitivity to volume declines or lack thereof. \nLinda Rendle: Yes. We're focused really on 3 big buckets, Lauren. We're focused on ensuring we maintain top line momentum, which is, of course, in part, sustained by selling a certain amount of volume at a certain price. We are laser-focused on rebuilding margins over time. And as Kevin and I have reiterated, we're committed to growing margins over the long term and returning them back to pre-pandemic levels.\n And then most importantly, the foundation of all of that is having healthy brands. And so you can bet, we are looking incredibly closely at all of the consumer metrics to see and ensure that we remain in a good spot.\n And here is what we see to date, but we'll be watching this moving forward. We have the highest consumer value rating on record since we've measured it, with 75% of our portfolio deemed superior by consumers and increasing superiority in countries around the world as we've measured it.\n We're making progress on share, growing share in our largest 4 businesses. International looks really strong. So I don't think -- from a category perspective, we're not underperforming, and we're seeing similar types of activities from our peers given our price gaps have remained the same.\n Innovation is working in these categories, and people are continuing to look for that for a source of value. So the consumer fundamentals continue to remain strong. We expect volume loss as part of pricing. And we expect, over time, we'll start to build some of that volume back as behavior normalizes.\n But really, we're keeping an eye on that trifecta and managing that very carefully. And of course, that third bucket is all what it hinges on. And Lauren, we're looking at it all the time to ensure we continue to offer that value to consumers. And to date, we do, and we'll make adjustments if we don't.\n And if it does get to the point where those metrics start to erode in a place where we don't feel the long-term ability for us to grow and grow margins is there, then we'll make adjustments. But for now, I feel very comfortable with the 3 rounds of pricing and the fourth we have planned for December based on what we're seeing from the consumer. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Stephen Powers from Deutsche Bank. \nStephen Robert Powers: So kind of staying on the topic of pricing and maybe just to clean up from -- in my own mind some of those earlier discussion, I guess, I'm just curious on the sort of the cost justification, the impetus for the price increase, the fourth round in December, just given that, it sounded like the overall cost inflation outlook for the year was around about the same, especially on commodities. And the first quarter gross margin, if you take out the recall impact, came in a couple of hundred basis points above your original outlook.\n So is there something I'm missing in there? Or was the price increase contemplated in the original outlook for the year? Just if you could help me there, that would be great. \nKevin Jacobsen: Sure, Steve. Let me try to provide a little bit more perspective on pricing and what we're trying to accomplish with our pricing. And as you know, from some of our previous discussions, we're not pricing just looking at the cost environment right now, but this is pricing to recover the cost inflation we've dealt with over several years.\n If you look at the last 2 years, plus what we're projecting this year, it's about $1.5 billion of cost inflation to our supply chain. All else being equal, that's over 20 gross margin points we have lost through cost inflation over that period of time. That's what we're working to build back.\n Now pricing is a very important element of that. We don't expect to recover it all through pricing. That's why we're also driving our cost savings program. We're working to optimize our supply chain.\n And so this fourth round of pricing was always contemplated in our outlook. And it is part of the actions we're taking to rebuild the margins because of the cost inflation, not only this year, but the cost inflation we've been dealing with over the last 36 months.\n And we think this is a necessary action, again along with all the other actions we're taking. It put us in a position to start rebuilding margins this year, and I'd expect that to continue as we move into fiscal year '24. \nStephen Robert Powers: Okay. Okay. So is there -- I mean, outside of the FX-driven pricing in overseas markets, is there additional pricing contemplated in the current year outlook that we should also be contemplating? Or is -- I'm just trying to get a sense for at what point were incremental to your plan. \nLinda Rendle: Yes, Steve. So we always have the December price increase planned, but we are taking some additional brands than we had originally planned and contemplated in the outlook. And at this point, we're going to continue to take pricing over the course of this long-range plan until we get to the place where we've rolled up all margins, and that will be a combination of cost savings and pricing and supply chain optimization, and of course, hopefully, seeing some of these commodities roll over in the out-years.\n But at this point, we don't have any additional pricing to speak about here, but we'll keep you updated as we take additional rounds. And if you recall, we talked about price pack architecture playing a bigger role moving forward. And those actions, we have been working on for the last 12 to 18 months, and we're going to start to see those have a bigger impact in the back half of this fiscal year and in fiscal year '24. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. \nKevin Grundy: Linda, I wanted to come back to market share and potential trade-down risk. I guess just first, I'm trying to reconcile a bit some of the differences that we're seeing in the scan data versus your comments. The Nielsen data would suggest you're losing share in more than half of your portfolio.\n And then I also kind of took note about your comments, about you're not seeing any material signs of trade down from your brands or to private label. And that seems to have been inconsistent with what we're seeing in the Nielsen data as well, where private label is picking up share in bags and bleach and wipes and dressing, et cetera.\n So my first question is just that, maybe just some overarching views on what you might be seeing the differences in tracked versus nontracked channels. \nLinda Rendle: Sure. Yes, my comments on market share against growing all-outlet share in the 4 largest businesses obviously contemplates beyond what you can see in Nielsen. But what you see in Nielsen is consistent with what we see in tracked channels.\n And what I've said is there's a bunch of factors going on here. You have pricing, you have demand normalization, and then you have things like assortment normalization that are still going on as that -- the impacts from the pandemic are getting flushed out.\n What we can say with confidence is there is no material trade down due to pricing that we are seeing in private label in our categories. In fact, what we're really seeing is some of the third-tier brands being squeezed, where we're growing share and private label is growing share in categories. But we don't see a trading between our portfolio given the pricing that we're taking.\n But you are seeing things like assortment normalization continue, and those can have an impact in individual categories. But all of the data that we see, looking at both tracked and nontracked channels, we don't have any material trade down to private label. \nKevin Grundy: Okay. I guess it would not be terribly surprising if that were to be the case, I guess, particularly in your categories, right, where we're not seeing it as much in personal care, you don't see it much in beverages, and we're not really seeing it in alcohol.\n So is it your expectation that we -- that you do not see it in your current planning as you're thinking about category growth rates, elasticities and share that's not currently embedded in your outlook? \nLinda Rendle: That's correct, Kevin. We do not have a material trade down to private label included in our outlook. And that is consistent with how we performed. If you look at 2008, private label did not make any material share progress in our categories, and we're anticipating much the same in this environment. \nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. Ms. Rendle, I would like to now turn the program back to you. \nLinda Rendle: Thanks again, everyone. I look forward to speaking with you again on our next call in February. Until then, please stay well. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Jacobsen",
            "content": "Hey, Peter. Thanks for the question on guidance. Let me provide a perspective. And what I'd tell you, at a high level, I feel our guidance is very balanced and it is where we expect to land the year.\n If I think about some of the puts and takes where we're at, as you saw in our prepared remarks, we had a good solid start to the year that exceeded our expectations, what we shared with you about a quarter ago. And so we feel very good about the start of the year.\n At the same time, we are dealing with some additional headwinds, FX being one. But as Linda also mentioned, we've got a couple of supply disruptions on a couple of our businesses that we're working through. And so I'd say, a good start to the year. We've got a couple issues we're dealing with, but by and large, feel like we remain on track.\n I think what's also important, Peter, as we think about -- you had mentioned inflation, I would say inflation is generally playing out as we expected. We said at the beginning of the year, it was about $400 million of the cost, inflation in the supply chain. We still expect about that same amount. Although I would tell you, when we started the year, we were a little below $400 million. We're a little above right now. So it's gotten a little bit worse.\n As we've been doing through the entire pandemic, we are making the appropriate adjustments to our plans. We've done that. And as a result, we feel good that we're on track for our outlook. Yes, Peter, you're right. As you think about Q1 versus our expectations, our Health and Wellness segment came in better, behind the strength of Cleaning and Disinfecting. That business outperformed our expectations based a on very successful back-to-school merchandising program primarily.\n And then, as you said, if you look at the rest of our portfolio, we had anticipated stronger organic growth. It came in a little bit below our expectations, really driven by the supply disruptions in our Burt's Bees and our Glad business unit. If those 2 businesses had delivered against our expectations, we would have delivered about 3% organic growth on the rest of our portfolio, ex Health and Wellness.\n But clearly, these are some new issues, that we've been dealing with this for the last 3 years. Supply chain disruptions are nothing new. We're dealing with it in these 2 businesses. We expect to get those worked out this quarter. And by the back half of the year, I'd expect those businesses are back to shipping, back to our expectations.\n So I think it will drag a little bit in the second quarter as a result of that, and then I expect stronger performance in the back half of the year as we get those resolved. Sure, Andrea. And you're correct. We still expect to deliver about 38% gross margin for the full year. That would be up about 200 basis points versus a year ago. And as we've said, this continues to be a very dynamic environment.\n As conditions change, we continue to adjust our plans as appropriate, to maintain our plans for the full year. I'll just give you one example. As we've seen the FX environment become more difficult, as we talked about, and we're seeing higher inflation in a number of countries where we operate, we've gone back and adjusted our [ pricing plans ] in our international markets.\n That's an example where we're going back and making appropriate plan changes to address the changing macro environment. And through those changes, we're able to keep our plans on track for the year. Sure. Thanks, Chris, for the question. And let me start with the overall basket of cost increases we're looking at. And as you mentioned, we started the year expecting about $400 million, a little below. We've updated that with this most recent outlook, and we're rolling up to a little bit over $400 million, but generally, still in that area.\n What hasn't really changed for us is commodity inflation overall. It represents about half that total inflation. While we've seen a little bit of change by item [ we purchased ], the general level of inflation in the commodities is pretty consistent with what we thought about a quarter ago. So no real change there.\n We've seen a little bit of improvement on resin prices, and then there's a few other areas in chemicals and ag products that have gone a little bit the other way. But puts and takes, but by and large, our commodity inflation expectation is consistent with what we thought earlier this year.\n Where we are seeing a little bit higher prices is primarily in logistics, and I'm sure you folks are seeing what's going on with the price of diesel. That's coming in higher than we anticipated. So we revised up a bit our expectation on logistics cost inflation. So we're still operating in generally that $400 million range, but a little bit higher cost we're expecting in logistics for the balance of the year.\n In terms of how I expect the gross margins to phase going forward, I think this is an important inflection point for us. As you know, margins declined for about 5 straight quarters given the tremendous cost inflation we're dealing with last year, as you recall, about $800 million worth of cost inflation in the supply chain.\n We stabilized margins in Q4. They were essentially flat year-over-year. As you saw this most recent quarter, gross margin down about 100 basis points, primarily for the charge we took on the Pine-Sol recall. Excluding that charge, they are generally flat year-over-year again. And we expect to start growing this quarter. As you saw in my prepared remarks, we expect 100 to 200 basis points of margin expansion.\n So I think this is an important inflection point. We're getting back now to starting to rebuild margins that we've been working on for a while. I expect that to continue as we move through the balance of this year. As we said, we expect to grow margins about 200 basis points for full year, but I expect that to build starting from Q2 as we move forward.\n And then your longer-term question, Linda and I and the entire leadership team remain committed to rebuilding margins to pre-pandemic levels. And we said that's going to take a while. It's difficult to predict exactly when we'll be able to achieve that because a lot of that is outside of our control.\n I feel very good about the things we control, the pricing we're executing, the cost savings program, and our supply chain optimization work is all very much on track. But the reality is, the cost environment continues to be very dynamic.\n At some point, I expect cost to roll over. These are cyclical commodities. But it's difficult to know when that will occur. And that will likely either accelerate or delay the time of our margin recovery based on outside events.\n And then on the cost buckets outside of commodities, when you look at logistics and manufacturing, there are some of those costs that I think will stick. When you look at labor, I expect those costs will continue going forward. But there's other elements, diesel, things of that nature, I do expect also to see come down at some point. And so we'll have to see exactly how that plays out.\n But what I feel good about is we're starting to make progress on our commitment to start rebuilding margins. That starts for us this quarter. And I would expect that to continue as we move through the year. Sure. Javier, on Q2, and I'm not going to give a full detailed outlook for Q2, we've tried to provide some color to be helpful for modeling purposes, we do expect top line to be down low single digits on a reported basis. And we continue to expect about 2 points of FX headwinds. So you should assume organic sales growth is about 2 points better than our reported sales, which are expected to be down in that low single-digit range.\n I expect Q2, in general, like somewhat similar to Q1. I expect ongoing normalization in our Cleaning and Disinfecting portfolio. Now not to the same extent that you saw in Q1, where we're lapping the Delta variant, but we do expect some ongoing normalization in that portfolio.\n And then, as we mentioned, we've got a few supply chain disruptions we're working through. I think that will impact Q2, similar to what we saw in Q1, and we're going to -- we expect to get those resolved as we move into the back half of the year. And so overall, I think as you look at volume-price-mix, I would not expect it to be that different than what we saw in the first quarter. Yes, I'd expect so, because that's probably playing out based on elasticities. And maybe a broader point that's helpful to comment on. As you think about the elasticities in our portfolio, generally, our expectation when we take pricing based on the normal elasticities is you don't generate much incremental revenue from that pricing. We are taking pricing to address the cost inflation. It's not necessarily a source of revenue growth.\n And so I would expect, if elasticity is played out as we expect, I would see volume decline similar to what we saw in Q1, maybe a little bit better because of less demand normalization in Cleaning and Disinfecting, but still have volume declines generally offsetting the price mix by generating -- starting to generate very nice savings to gross margin.\n I think you saw, in Q1, we generated over 500 basis points of margin expansion through pricing. I'd expect to build on that in Q2 because we'll get the full impact of the July price increase, plus a modest impact of December pricing we're taking as well. Anna, I think you're talking about our contract manufacturing agreements, is that right? Yes, you're exactly right. So as you may recall, we increased the use of contract manufacturers during the pandemic to help meet the increased demand for our products. [ We knew ] that was [ temporary to normalize ]. We have stepped out of those agreements. We did that at the end of last year.\n And then what we've said is we've been holding higher safety stock inventory levels to help build more resiliency into our supply chain to manage through the ongoing disruptions we're experiencing. As those disruptions start to level out our expectations, we're going to be able to bring inventory levels down as we have more reliability in our supply chain.\n I would say the supply chain is getting better from where we were a year ago, but by no means are we back to a pre-pandemic level of normalcy in the supply chain. And so what we're seeing on inventory right now is we're starting to do just what we said, which is we're starting to bring inventory levels down.\n If you look at where we landed in Q1 on a year-over-year basis, we've been able to reduce inventory levels by about $30 million. And so you probably saw that, our cash provided by operations is up. Part of that is our ability to reduce inventory levels. And that also helps on the cost side as we have less product to move around, less warehousing fees, and we're not storing that product.\n And so we've started to raise inventory levels. I expect that to continue this quarter. And then we're going to really continue to watch the supply chain. And as we have more confidence in our ability to respond to consumer demand and we expect less disruption, we [ seem to be able to ] work that down even further. But we're starting to make good progress there. Yes, Jason. Thanks for the call. I would say, in terms of driving gross margin accretion, and to your point, 100, 200 basis points of what we're projecting, we continue to project pretty strong performance on cost savings. I expect pricing to build from Q1 to Q2, as I mentioned earlier.\n And then in terms of headwinds, we continue to face a very difficult cost environment. We had over 300 basis points of headwinds in Q1. I expect another challenging quarter in Q2 from cost inflation. We're seeing the same thing in logistics and manufacturing.\n And as we mentioned, we've got a couple of supply chain disruptions that we're dealing with in the second quarter, and that's also going to be a partial drag on margin as well as we work through those, which we expect to get resolved by the third quarter.\n And then probably the last item I'd highlight is volume deleveraging. We do expect volumes to be down in Q2. And as you know, there's some manufacturing deleveraging associated with that. And so when I look across all those drivers, the good news is we expect to be at an inflection point where we start rebuilding margins this quarter, and I expect that to continue. But within the puts and takes, we expect about 100 to 200 basis points this quarter. Yes, there is -- yes, the only one, I would say -- the only other item I would highlight is there is seasonality in our business. Q2 tends to be our lower quarter because it's the lowest quarter for our Kingsford business, which is a nice profitable business. And so typically, Q2 is a lower quarter for us in a normalized environment, and we'd expect that this quarter as well. Yes, Jason, I would say, I think you're overestimating the value of unwinding those co-pack agreements. That was a nice benefit, but it was less than 100 bp benefit to logistics and manufacturing as we step out those agreements. So it nicely helps contribute to rebuilding margins, but by no means was it a significant driver to the margin challenges we've been dealing with over the last 6 quarters or so. Sure, Kaumil. It's interesting, when you think about the manufacturing deleveraging, typically, you expect to have a bigger impact for the volume decline we talked about, being down 15%. What you're seeing though here that mitigates that is, as you know, we stepped out of those contract manufacturing agreements, so we brought that volume back into our plants.\n And so our plant production volume is not down to the degree you're seeing our shipment cases down or essentially just turning off those co-packers. And so it minimizes the volume deleveraging we're seeing in our facilities. And I expect that going forward. Sure, Steve. Let me try to provide a little bit more perspective on pricing and what we're trying to accomplish with our pricing. And as you know, from some of our previous discussions, we're not pricing just looking at the cost environment right now, but this is pricing to recover the cost inflation we've dealt with over several years.\n If you look at the last 2 years, plus what we're projecting this year, it's about $1.5 billion of cost inflation to our supply chain. All else being equal, that's over 20 gross margin points we have lost through cost inflation over that period of time. That's what we're working to build back.\n Now pricing is a very important element of that. We don't expect to recover it all through pricing. That's why we're also driving our cost savings program. We're working to optimize our supply chain.\n And so this fourth round of pricing was always contemplated in our outlook. And it is part of the actions we're taking to rebuild the margins because of the cost inflation, not only this year, but the cost inflation we've been dealing with over the last 36 months.\n And we think this is a necessary action, again along with all the other actions we're taking. It put us in a position to start rebuilding margins this year, and I'd expect that to continue as we move into fiscal year '24."

            "name": "Linda Rendle",
            "content": "Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. While the challenging and volatile global operating environment we discussed last quarter persist, we delivered better-than-expected Q1 results, reflecting the strength of our brands, ongoing consumer loyalty and solid execution.\n During the quarter, we maintained our unrelenting focus on rebuilding margin by taking additional inflation-driven pricing, delivering cost savings, optimizing our supply chain and implementing our new operating model. At the same time, we continue to invest in our brands, to deliver consumer-inspired innovation with superior value as well as advance our digital transformation to drive top line momentum and position the company for long-term success.\n Looking ahead, it's still early in the fiscal year, and we continue to contend with a number of macro headwinds, which we are proactively addressing, and we'll remain agile as the environment evolves. Given these factors, we are reiterating our full year outlook. Nevertheless, guided by our IGNITE Strategy, we remain committed to delivering on our 3% to 5% sales growth target over the long term.\n The fundamentals of our business are strong. We plan essential categories and our business is well positioned to benefit from lasting consumer demand tailwinds. I'm confident we're on the right track to generate consistent and profitable growth over time and build a stronger, more resilient company.\n With that, Kevin and I will take your questions. Hi, Andrea. Thanks for the question. So generally, we saw in Q1 minimal impact from any type of inventory effect going either way. We did have a couple of businesses that we saw retailers make some inventory adjustments actually on the other side. We call that vitamins, minerals and supplements as one of them, Charcoal as another. And we look at that as a very normal inventory changes, no impact to the consumer or impact to consumption, but retailers continue to optimize their inventory levels.\n We did not see a mismatch between consumption and shipments going the other way, where we see inventories rising at retail. But we continue to see that's going to be dynamic. Retailers are making adjustments, adjusting to the new volumes they're seeing in the categories. So we're watching that as we move forward, but again, would not be any type of strategic impact. It would simply be shifts in timing versus any other type of concern that we would have.\n So at this point, we think we're at about the right inventory levels across all of our businesses, and again, minimal impact in Q1 and do not anticipate a sizable impact moving forward in our outlook. Sure. Happy to, Dara. So pricing is on track. And as you noted, we've taken multiple rounds of pricing, with a third round in market effective in July. And we are seeing elasticity largely in line with our expectations.\n And that has been early in the year, slightly favorable to what they were pre-COVID, but we're starting to see them drift towards our pre-COVID elasticities as we had anticipated. Our categories remain healthy and resilient. And our price gaps have returned to pre-pandemic levels for most brands.\n Given the pressures that Kevin spoke about in terms of cost, we are taking an additional round of pricing in December, which will be our fourth major round of pricing. We don't anticipate that round to be as deep or broad as the July pricing, which was the largest of the 4 that we will take to date. And we anticipate that we'll be leading in many of the categories that we're taking pricing in, in December.\n And as Kevin said, we're going to continue to be nimble and adjust. But at this point, consumer resilience, elasticity, is in line with expectations, and price gaps where we would expect them to be. Sure. And maybe I'll just broaden the comment on share overall. We're making progress on share, but we have more work to do. And supply disruptions have been part of that, going on in our Household Essentials business.\n But we were happy to continue to see the momentum in Cleaning, as you note. We've grown share consistently now quarter after quarter, and that continued with the strong performance that we had in back-to-school, as you noted.\n We grew all-outlet share in our 4 largest businesses. So that's Home Care, Glad, Food and Charcoal, which was great to see. But as I've said many times, I expect to grow share in aggregate, and we're not quite there yet. But we'll continue to see progress as pricing flows through in December and as our distribution plans continue to take hold. But we feel good about the progress, but the work is not done yet on share. Yes, it was about flat, and we take that as a good sign as well. We are seeing continued headwinds on that business as it relates to return to office and some of the things that affect our janitorial business.\n But we are seeing some return to office, which is good from a sales perspective as well as hospitals getting into a more normalized routine, where they're using our products to clean in between procedures, et cetera.\n Now from here, we're focused on ensuring that we have the right sales plans, that we're working with businesses and janitorial services to ensure that they have the right protocols and hospitals as well. So we expect, again, over the long term, that business to be an outsized contributor to the company. But certainly, I would say, at this point, we're happy to see it flat again and hope to return to growing here over the coming quarters. Javier, our digital transformation is much larger than just implementing a new ERP, which we need to. Our ERP is well over 20 years old, and that's the foundation of how we run our business. But what we're trying to do is modernize our digital infrastructure to maximize our ability to grow and maximize our efficiency.\n So the technology we're investing in is not just foundational, but it allows us to move faster on innovation. Leverage the data, the enormous amount of data that we have, across our ecosystem to get to insights and be able to grow our categories, to be able to generate savings by knowing exactly where the costs are in our supply chain and being able to remove the ones that are not value-added.\n So this digital transformation supports that 3% to 5% growth we're talking about. And we expect that value to begin to happen at the end of the strategy period and beyond that to set us up for the next period.\n And then, of course, from an ERP perspective, we do have businesses in over 100 countries, so we'll be rolling out this ERP across the world to ensure that we can run our business. But this is much bigger than just putting in the base technology. This is really about digitizing for the future. I would say our consumer and our categories remain very resilient through the 3 rounds of pricing that we have taken. And the pricing elasticity has played out just as we expected. And to be clear, that is slightly favorable than it was. Those elasticities were pre-COVID, but we're starting to see them drift to more normalized elasticities as we expected.\n We are not seeing any material signs of trade down from our brands to private label or to other brands. We're watching that closely, and we'll adapt our plans if we need to if that changes. But what we are seeing is consumers broadly seeking value type of behaviors, and that's happening within our portfolio. And we talked a little bit about this last quarter, and this is expected. So we're seeing consumers shop more heavily in value channels, for example. So they're moving to club and dollar and mass.\n We're seeing them look for different ways to explore value through sizing. So maybe buying at an opening price point, if they just have a low out-of-pocket availability from a cash standpoint, or they're trying to get the very best value per ounce or use and they're going with larger sizes.\n We've seen things like trip frequency increase, where people are spending a little bit less on each trip, but they are coming more frequently. And this is very typical value-seeking behavior from consumers at this point.\n And what I'd say is, actually, our low-income consumer in our brands is holding up even more strongly than general population, and we've seen stronger household penetration from low-income consumers, which is consistent with what we believe is that, in this time, the highest value with low-income consumer becomes even more important, and our brands are superior value.\n And that's, of course, measured with the fact that the largest portion of our portfolio is deemed superior by consumers than it ever has before since we've been again measuring it. So we're in a very good spot. We expect the December price increase to go largely as the last 3 have gone. But we're monitoring it really closely.\n We'll expect the environment to continue to be bumpy, and we'll expect consumers to continue to have more stress put on them. But given the categories we compete on, Household Essentials, everyday products that they need, we feel very well-positioned to be able to take another round of pricing. Sure. So we've been able to grow total distribution points for 8 consecutive quarters now. And our team is doing the work on both restoring the base. If you remember, we rationalized assortment at the beginning of the pandemic to be able to produce as much product as we possibly could. So part of that is restoring back to some of the distribution that we thoughtfully removed on our own in order to run efficiently.\n But then most importantly, we're gaining distribution on the innovation programs that we have in place and have been able to continue that trend moving in the right direction. So we're really happy about where we are from a distribution perspective and continuing to invest in innovation so that we can continue that trend moving forward. Yes. Lauren, on pricing, I think it's very difficult to compare across companies because everybody has different portfolios and to your good point, have different global portfolios. But what I would say, and I think this is important, if we look category by category for us, our pricing is in line with the categories that we compete in around the world.\n So as I mentioned earlier, our price gaps are about what they were pre-pandemic, which would, of course, imply that pricing has been about equal across the competitive set that we have in our specific categories and countries.\n We would expect, although we'll lead in many of these price increases, that, that would continue, that with our price gaps, would largely be in line. But that is something that we are looking at with eyes wide open on our plan, that we might have to make adjustments if that is not the case coming out of the fourth round of pricing in December. But largely, we believe, that will be the case, that our price gaps will continue. While [ mosey ] in the short term as people adjust, will continue to be what they were pre-pandemic.\n And then our elasticities are holding exactly what they thought they would. So they've been slightly favorable to pre-pandemic. We're starting to see them drift towards historical levels, which is what we expected. So we're seeing consumer behavior in line with our expectations.\n And what elasticity really is in these categories is consumers adjust their behavior. So they are not trading, in our case, in our categories to private label, but they are maybe making a trash bag last a little bit longer by making sure it's full all the way.\n They are delaying their purchase cycles a little bit and trying to stretch what product they have. And that's typically what we see in our categories. People don't just exit them in full, but they try to find ways to get a bigger bang for their buck. And that's consistent with the behavior we're seeing.\n And we don't expect that to change for the fourth round of pricing. But to your very good point, we are going to watch it very carefully, and we're ready to make adjustments to our plan if we need to, to ensure our price gaps are in line and our business continues to remain healthy with consumers. Yes. We're focused really on 3 big buckets, Lauren. We're focused on ensuring we maintain top line momentum, which is, of course, in part, sustained by selling a certain amount of volume at a certain price. We are laser-focused on rebuilding margins over time. And as Kevin and I have reiterated, we're committed to growing margins over the long term and returning them back to pre-pandemic levels.\n And then most importantly, the foundation of all of that is having healthy brands. And so you can bet, we are looking incredibly closely at all of the consumer metrics to see and ensure that we remain in a good spot.\n And here is what we see to date, but we'll be watching this moving forward. We have the highest consumer value rating on record since we've measured it, with 75% of our portfolio deemed superior by consumers and increasing superiority in countries around the world as we've measured it.\n We're making progress on share, growing share in our largest 4 businesses. International looks really strong. So I don't think -- from a category perspective, we're not underperforming, and we're seeing similar types of activities from our peers given our price gaps have remained the same.\n Innovation is working in these categories, and people are continuing to look for that for a source of value. So the consumer fundamentals continue to remain strong. We expect volume loss as part of pricing. And we expect, over time, we'll start to build some of that volume back as behavior normalizes.\n But really, we're keeping an eye on that trifecta and managing that very carefully. And of course, that third bucket is all what it hinges on. And Lauren, we're looking at it all the time to ensure we continue to offer that value to consumers. And to date, we do, and we'll make adjustments if we don't.\n And if it does get to the point where those metrics start to erode in a place where we don't feel the long-term ability for us to grow and grow margins is there, then we'll make adjustments. But for now, I feel very comfortable with the 3 rounds of pricing and the fourth we have planned for December based on what we're seeing from the consumer. Yes, Steve. So we always have the December price increase planned, but we are taking some additional brands than we had originally planned and contemplated in the outlook. And at this point, we're going to continue to take pricing over the course of this long-range plan until we get to the place where we've rolled up all margins, and that will be a combination of cost savings and pricing and supply chain optimization, and of course, hopefully, seeing some of these commodities roll over in the out-years.\n But at this point, we don't have any additional pricing to speak about here, but we'll keep you updated as we take additional rounds. And if you recall, we talked about price pack architecture playing a bigger role moving forward. And those actions, we have been working on for the last 12 to 18 months, and we're going to start to see those have a bigger impact in the back half of this fiscal year and in fiscal year '24. Sure. Yes, my comments on market share against growing all-outlet share in the 4 largest businesses obviously contemplates beyond what you can see in Nielsen. But what you see in Nielsen is consistent with what we see in tracked channels.\n And what I've said is there's a bunch of factors going on here. You have pricing, you have demand normalization, and then you have things like assortment normalization that are still going on as that -- the impacts from the pandemic are getting flushed out.\n What we can say with confidence is there is no material trade down due to pricing that we are seeing in private label in our categories. In fact, what we're really seeing is some of the third-tier brands being squeezed, where we're growing share and private label is growing share in categories. But we don't see a trading between our portfolio given the pricing that we're taking.\n But you are seeing things like assortment normalization continue, and those can have an impact in individual categories. But all of the data that we see, looking at both tracked and nontracked channels, we don't have any material trade down to private label. That's correct, Kevin. We do not have a material trade down to private label included in our outlook. And that is consistent with how we performed. If you look at 2008, private label did not make any material share progress in our categories, and we're anticipating much the same in this environment. Thanks again, everyone. I look forward to speaking with you again on our next call in February. Until then, please stay well."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference.\nLisah Burhan: Thanks, Jen. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. On the call today with me are Linda Rendle, our Chair CEO and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. I hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release and prepared remarks, both of these are available on our website. In just a moment, Linda will share a few opening comments and then we'll take your questions. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements, including about our fiscal 2025 outlook. These statements are based on management's current expectations, but may differ from actual results or outcomes. In addition, we may refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section, which identifies various factors that could affect such forward-looking statements, which has been filed with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the non-GAAP financial information section of our earnings release and the supplemental financial schedules in the Investor Relations section of our website for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Now I'll turn it over to Linda.\nLinda Rendle: Thank you for joining us today. Our fourth quarter fiscal year 2024 results reflect the continued advancement of our strategy to strengthen our competitive advantage, accelerate profitable growth and set up our company for long-term success, all while navigating a recovery from the cyber-attack earlier in the year. Thanks to the team's execution, we ended fiscal year 2024 in a position of operational strength. We fully restored supply and distribution and recovered most of the market share that we lost. We closed out with flat organic sales for the full year, despite the significant disruption caused by the cyber-attack, which drove an 18% organic sales decline in the first quarter. Importantly, we continue to deliver on our commitment to rebuild margin to fuel growth, delivering our seventh consecutive quarter of margin expansion. We're on track to return to our pre-pandemic gross margins in fiscal year 2025. We also achieved another year of double-digits adjusted EPS growth. As we look ahead to fiscal year 2025, consumers will remain under pressure, which will continue to temporarily increase competitive activity and impact category growth. That said, we have a portfolio of strong brands in essential categories that have shown resilience during challenging times. We have and will continue to invest strongly behind our brands to maintain value superiority. While we have more work to do, we are confident that we have the right plans at investment level to win with consumers and deliver strong financial performance in fiscal year 2025, supported by a return to volume-driven sales growth, pre-pandemic gross margin and free cash flow in line with our long term goals. With that, Kevin and I will take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Filippo Falorni with Citi.\nFilippo Falorni: Linda, maybe I wanted to start with just the visibility on the top-line outlook. Obviously, you called out the dynamic in the first and second half. But given the consumer environment and the weakness that you're seeing and the promotional intensity in some of your categories, why are you expecting more of an underlying, particularly in the back half of the year from a volume and pricing standpoint? Do you expect still negative pricing to drive the volume growth? Any more color on the top-line outlook, understanding the dynamic in the first half?\nLinda Rendle: Sure, Filippo. Here's maybe helpful to kind of take a step back and frame what we have in front of us. I'll start just with the consumer environment to your point. The consumer environment is playing out as we expected. We certainly thought in the back half of fiscal year '24 that we would see, given the consumer is under pressure just more generally, we see that play out in our categories as we lap pricing, and as we saw competition in retailers react to trying to ensure that they get their shopper, et cetera. And so, that's played out exactly as we expected. We've seen category growth go from about mid-single-digits to low-single-digits, the softest month being in June. But what we see is generally what we've seen and what we've expected to see during this time. Consumers are continuing to be very focused on value. That means that, they are trading up to larger sizes, trading down. But our categories have been pretty resilient given that. Our brands, given their superiority and the fact that we've been rebuilding distribution and have fully rebuilt distribution coming out of the cyber-attack, our category is exactly where we expect them to be. I think moving forward, as we look at the year and to your point on front half versus back half, we continue to assume that the consumer will be under additional pressure, and that our categories will largely continue as we've seen them now, low-single-digits. And what we're really focused on is ensuring that, we're executing our spending plans. We have strong investment in ANFP, strong investment in innovation to support category growth as well as support share growth, which we expect this year and really focused on delivering superior value. And we know that, anyone can win in an environment where it's a little tougher, in the essential categories we compete in if we are laser-focused on delivering great value to consumers. That's exactly what we're focused on right now, to one, fully rebuild the momentum that we're still rebuild the momentum that we're still rebuilding in a couple of our categories coming out of cyber, and two to continue the momentum we're seeing in many of the other businesses that are restored.\nFilippo Falorni: And maybe one for you Kevin, on the gross margin clearly, outdelivery this quarter. What surprised you to the upside in the quarter? And as we think about next year, there was a lot of volatility in the manufacturing and logistic in the commodity front, maybe some level of expectation on those items for next year?\nKevin Jacobsen: I'd say this year, as you know, in Q4 came in a bit stronger than we anticipated. The biggest driver of the over delivery for us is what we call business unit mix. Our household segment came in below our expectations and we over delivered our expectations on health and wellness segment. And if you look at our profitability, it's meaningfully different between the two segments. And so that mix generates some nice savings for us. And then the other areas, I'd say, is just generally a bit more favorable across the other lines of the supply chain. We had anticipated commodity deflation is a little bit stronger than we anticipated. Cost savings was another very good quarter for the company a bit more than we thought. We got some nice favorability across the supply chain, but the biggest driver was the BU mix that we did not anticipate. As I look forward to fiscal year 2025, kind of talking about the key drivers are, as Linda said, our expectations are going to add another 100 basis points and fully rebuild gross margin. I'd look at a few drivers. Supporting margin expansion, we're going to have another very good year of cost savings. We target 175 basis points each year of EBIT margin expansion. In the last two years, we've done over 200 basis points. I think this year, we'll do another year over 200 basis points with the bulk of that being in the supply chain. And then, we're also seeing some nice benefit from the portfolio work we've done. As you guys saw, we sold Argentina last quarter. We've announced that we're in the process of selling our VMS business. That's going to structurally improve our gross margins as we get through that. So that will certainly contribute to that 100 basis points. I think modestly offsetting that, I do expect a bit of increased trade spending as we get back to this normalized environment, particularly in the front half of the year, where our trade spending last year was below normal because of the cyber event. You'll see a little bit of year-over-year hit in the front half on trade. And then, we're assuming just a modest level of cost inflation, about $75 million across the supply chain, which will partially offset the margin accretion activity I mentioned. But, all in, we feel very confident in our ability to fully rebuild gross margins. And then going forward, as we've talked quite a bit, as our goal is to get back in that cadence of 25 bps to 50 bps of EBIT margin expansion each year. And we think we're set up to do that as we get into '26 and beyond.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Peter Grom with UBS.\nPeter Grom: Maybe just a couple of follow-ups on the top-line. Maybe just first, I would love to kind of get some perspective on the exit rates or kind of what you're seeing quarter-to-date in household relative to the organic growth you delivered in the quarter. I think the prepared remarks mentioned some of the distribution recovery occurring later in the quarter. So just curious if you're already starting to see that improvement as the recovery happens.\nLinda Rendle: Sure, Peter. I'll start us with that. And I think that's a helpful place for us to go a bit more into household and what happened there. That was the bulk of the miss that we had in Q4, but feel like a number of these businesses, to your point, we saw good trends heading out. First I'll cover, which you all know that our grilling business, the largest quarter we have is Q4. It's about 50% of our business and it's a heavily weather dependent business. Unfortunately, for both Memorial Day and July 4, weather was terrible in the U.S., very rainy for Memorial Day and extremely hot for 4th of July and that meant the category was down anywhere from high single-digits to double-digits. And as a result, our Kingsford business came in short of expectations. I don't look at that as any type of structural issue in Kingsford. We had good merchandising plans and where consumers did pull, we saw good take through. I think that is simply just the effects of weather, and obviously a portion of why we didn't deliver. And then two other businesses, which I'll break down in a little -- each is a little bit different. They share some same characteristics. But we've spoken a lot in the past about Glad and Litter. And those were the other two that contributed to the Q4 mess. And in the case of Glad, distribution recovery happens later in the quarter than we had expected, but we have fully recovered distribution. So feel very good on the exit rate from a distribution perspective. And as well, we talked a lot about the fact that when we were out of stock, we had a harder time getting our large sizes back, which is one of our biggest growth levers and critical consumers. They're looking for large sizes. They're going to buy a large size than another competitor. So we didn't know exactly what that purchase cycle would look like and that happened again later in the quarter when we saw people come back to our large size business. That being said, we think that was largely a Q4 dynamic. We have strong plans in place for fiscal year '25 across spending and innovation. And then just some data points to kind of show the extra rate coming out. Obviously, distribution, as I said, was fully recovered by the end of the quarter. That happened a little bit later than we expected. Shares trending in the right direction. We were down nine-tenth of a share point in April, but up to just down two-tenths of a share point in June. So a very big change as we got that distribution in place. We're back to growing share at our largest customer. And then on that very important large size business, that was actually one of Amazon Prime Day's number one sellers. And so feel like Glad is in a great position to deliver the growth that we expect it for in 2025. And then finally, for household, I'll cover Litter. And Litter is a little bit of a mixed story. Certainly saw improvement as we went through the quarter. We got distribution back to what we expected it to be, et cetera. But we are not fully capitalizing on the growth in that category at this point. And we have the operational things in place to do that. We've fully recovered supply. We have our customer service levels back to where they need to be. But, we recognize that this is a category that's going to take a bit more time due to its nature. Just a few things to keep in mind. One, you have some consumers who -- it's difficult to switch because their cat's used to a Litter. And that's a little bit more of a headache to switch litters back and forth when we were out and now back in stock. So we're working through that. We're beginning to regain those consumers back, but it's taking some time. This is a business that's heavily on subscription, which I've spoken about before. And while we've made progress getting people back to their subscriptions for fresh step, we still have more work to do. Then we've seen increased competitive activity as people become more value focused, et cetera. And so I think that dynamic in the category combined with just what's going on in the broader context of the categories, where everybody is really attuned to delivering for consumers given how stressed they are, that's a business that's going to take a little bit longer to recover. I feel fully confident in our ability to do it. We have strong innovation on that business. We have strong spending. But that's one that we're working week in and week out to get those consumers back and it's just going to take a little longer than we had originally expected. If I can to ladder all that up, I feel good. We had one business that was weather related, Glad on the right track, Litter improving, have more work to do. And I think that's what we're going to be working on that for the next couple of quarters. But we're really happy with the progress. We have superior value brands. We're investing them in strongly. And there's growth for us to go get. Litter is one where we haven't fully participated in that growth and we are laser-focused on ensuring that happens in '25 and beyond.\nOperator: The next question will come from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Linda, if you can elaborate more on the elaborate more on the category health? You spoke a bit about how consumers continue to seek value. Wondering, if you can go through the key categories and give us a state of the union. And also in related to that, the RGM capabilities, I know you've in the past have done a lot of that. I wonder if you are, as you set up this 3% to 5% organic sales growth for fiscal '25, if you're deploying some ways of RGM that could help you achieve that.\nLinda Rendle: Sure, Andrea. On the category health piece, here's what I would say. The consumer is stressed in general, but our categories have been resilient and they're where we expected them to be. They're a bit softer, which is exactly what we've experienced in times when the consumer is more stressed. But given that we're in essential categories, they're pretty resilient. Obviously, our categories don't typically grow in the mid-single-digits range, but they did behind pricing. We knew some of that would roll off. But then we have this just additional pressure as consumers are more value focused. We've seen low single-digits. We've seen that bounce around, and we're watching it pretty carefully, but we see no signs right now where we're panicked. We see categories that continue to be resilient, consumers looking for value. Pricing is holding in the marketplace, which is great after taking those multiple rounds of pricing. You're seeing little changes here and there on how retailers are using promotion in the categories. But I would say, our categories are generally healthy and holding up, but just a bit softer as we would normally expect in a time like this. If I look, are there any special dynamics by category, there's still growth to be had. Cal Litter is a great example of one that I just called out that's been still growth-accretive from a category perspective for us. As consumers adopted more cats during COVID, they thankfully still have those cats, and they're investing in the well-being of their pets. I would say, every one category has the similar dynamics around value, et cetera. But we see categories with higher growth opportunities and somewhat a bit lower. But I would say again, they're pretty resilient. I think, if you look at private label, it's probably another important thing to cover. Private label was up about three-tenths of a share point in Q4, but that's coming off of what was some trading during our out-of-stock period. And we're seeing people come back to our brands. We're seeing the middle get squeezed again, which is usually what happens during periods like this. People change with the premium brand or in private label. We do not see consumers meaningfully move to private label in any way. Shares are pretty stable. I'd call out the promotional environment probably, Andrea, is the last thing to touch on. We had anticipated the promotional level would return to pre-COVID levels. We certainly anticipate that for fiscal year '25. Competition is pretty rational in that. We're seeing some pockets of more competition in categories like Glad and Litter and we would expect that, but generally pretty rational. We still think that assumption holds for '25 that will return to pre-COVID levels. It was slightly higher in Q4, actually partially driven by us, but competition as well, and as retailers try new promotional strategies. So, in general, for us, we think the categories are in a good place for us to do what we do best, which is focus on superior value, invest in our brands, ensure that we execute against the strong innovation plans that we have and we have those across all of our major brands again, and feel good about the position they put us in. what we would anticipate is, this slight slowdown will be temporary. We typically see this last 12 to 18 months and our categories would rebound to more of a mid-low single-digits growth number, and we'll just watch for that and be ready to ensure that our brands can take advantage of it. And then you asked on, RGM, Andreas. So I'll just touch on that too because it's so important for how we deliver value now but also in '26 and beyond. That's a relatively new capability for us. We've done some work by businesses. Glad is a great example where you've done some price pack architecture over the years. But we've built out a full capability in the company to take advantage of that and we see that being a top-line contributor and margin contributor for both '25 and beyond. A lot of the activity we'll do right now is really always on pricing, some initial price pack architecture work and we see even more of that in '26 and beyond. But that will be a huge growth driver for us, in the long range plan period.\nOperator: And we'll move next to Chris Carey with Wells Fargo.\nChris Carey: I wanted to come back to sales again. Actually, in a strange way, the fiscal Q1 organic sales guidance is actually a bit lower than what I would have expected a multi-year basis if you assume you get back to growth. Are you embedding a progressive recovery, I guess, in your sales curve as you get through the year? In another way, is this just you're not exactly sure where things are going to land such as the volatility? Or is there greater recapture of some of the initiatives that you're looking for into the back half of the year, which is why you have that strong back half organic sales guidance applied? And I have a follow-up.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes. Hey, Chris, on Q1 sales and as you referred to our guidance of we think it's going to be 20%, 25% growth. And keep in mind, we're lapping an 18% decline in organic sales growth from the prior period. We think that growth is driven by both recovering from cyber as well as the strength of our demand plans. Now as I mentioned, that will be partially offset by increased trade spending. In this normalized environment, we're now lapping a period in front half of last year, when we were at a depressed level of merchandising support because of the out of stocks. And so you'll see good strong top-line growth modestly offset by increased trade spending in the front half of the year, which will depress it a bit. And then, as you get to the back half of the year, we average about a normalized level of spending in the back half of '24. I wouldn't expect much of a price mix impact year-over-year in the back half, but a little bit more pronounced in the front half.\nChris Carey: And just, regarding that back half volume expectation, shaking out around mid-single-digits, do you see it the same way and just confidence around that number in this environment? And then, if I could sneak in, the deceleration that you're expecting in the Q1 gross margin relative to Q4 is quite atypical. I know you're talking about negative mix or positive mix in your fiscal Q4, but I understand charcoal also should have been a detriment. Why such a steep quarter-over-quarter decline? Is it all mix or is manufacturing coming off? Any context there would be helpful.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, sure. On the gross margin lines, you talked about sequentially going from Q4 to Q1. As we said, we think we're going to have a good solid quarter in Q1 up 400 basis points to 500 basis points, but that will be lower than what we landed Q4. Part of it is what I mentioned. The reason we over delivered Q4 is because of this BU mix. We just sold less household products relative to the rest of our portfolio. We don't expect that to be the case in Q1. We expect those businesses to continue to recover and take a larger portion of our sales in Q1, so you won't get that that temporary benefit. And then in addition to that, I talked about the trade spending. You'll have a bit more of a trade spending drag in Q1. And then lastly, some of it is just based on our cost savings timing. We have hundreds of cost savings projects that have natural timelines and so those play out over the course of the year. I'm not particularly too concerned about how it plays out in any given quarter as long as we deliver good strong cost savings for the year, which we expect to do, but that'll have some impact on quarters as well.\nChris Carey: Just regarding the back half confidence, if that mid-single number is where you're kind of thinking and that's it for me.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes. On the 3% to 5% organic sales growth, yes, our expectation will have good strong growth in the back half as well for both volume and sales. When you think about our sales of 3% to 5%, we expect this to primarily come from growing volume and growing share and we expect it to happen both in the front and back half of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog: I had a quick follow-up on Litter. Linda, you mentioned more work to do and mentioned strong innovation you have. So could you maybe touch on some of that for us? And then whether there is more innovation planned to be rolled out in FY'25? Also, could you give us a sense of the magnitude of increased spend levels you'll need to win these consumers back? I guess, maybe just a big picture on trade spend and promos, how big of a risk you see for spend levels to go beyond what you're factoring into guidance? I guess I'm asking, given the retail and consumer environment.\nLinda Rendle: Sure. On Litter just a bit more. First on the innovation side that you touched on, we do have strong plans. First I would say that we're going to double down on some of the very successful platforms that we've had that are very value focused, like Outstretch, which we've talked about before, which is a more concentrated Litter and has performed really well in the market, as particularly consumers are looking for more value having to change that Litter box less, is a very high value for them. We'll double down on those and we have new innovations coming, which I can't give any details yet, but plan for the back half of our fiscal year '25 in the Litter category. We're also looking at claims, and ensuring that we have the right messaging from an advertising perspective. When it comes to investment particularly on Litter, and then I'll speak more broadly to your point on promotion and spend levels in aggregate. In Litter, we contemplated that in our outlook. That is embedded in the assumption that we have 11% to 11.5% of advertising and sales promotion as percent of sales. And then as Kevin just highlighted, the fact that we have increased trade promotion dollars in the system. And so Litter is accounted for that. And then that is the truth for the enterprise as well. We've accounted for the fact that, we're going to keep the spend level about what it was for advertising and sales promotion as a percent of sales versus last year. We think that's a prudent assumption and allows us to continue that momentum with consumers and talking about the value we offer and new innovation. And then same on the trade promotion piece. We have assumed that in our outlook. We've assumed the environment will be about what it was pre-COVID. The risk of that going higher, as what we've seen today, it's been pretty rational and we're seeing retailers be pretty rational. They're definitely ramping up promotion as we expected, but we're not seeing anything that sends us a signal that we haven't made a good assumption. It will be something Bonnie we watch throughout the year though. That certainly is a variable in the plan and could impact it. But for now, I think what people are looking at is using promotion in the right way to ensure that, we're communicating value, that we're introducing innovation, and using that in a very positive way. And we'll be watching it closely and we will react, if we see something from competition. But again, we see a pretty rational environment, pockets of things in Glad, Litter that we're dealing with but we've contemplated all about in the outlook.\nBonnie Herzog: And maybe just a quick second question on your EBIT margin. It's still below historical levels. In the context of everything you just mentioned, how should we think about further recovery and essentially ultimately seeing when they could reach historical levels? And I guess, I'm asking the context of, again, everything you just mentioned, Linda, as well as gross margins becoming less of a tailwind moving forward and then certainly A&P investments and the increase and the expectations there?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes. Bonnie, on EBIT margin, I'd say I feel like we're making very good progress. And then I'll talk adjusted EBIT margin that factors out some of these one-time charges. But if you look at our history, back in fiscal year '22, when we had the significant inflation, our adjusted EBIT margin is about 12%. Last year, we built that back up to about 15%. And if you look at our plans this year, it gets us back to about 17% to 17.5%. We're getting pretty close to fully rebuilding EBIT margin, historical levels about 18%. Our expectation is, by the end of this year we're very close to that level. And then going forward, it's the same things we talked about is continued to drive our margin transformation efforts, continue to drive the top line. We think that's how we get there. And then the very good work we've done on the streamlined operating model, we completed that program. We're on track to deliver $100 million and as we've talked, our intent to start moving our admin spending closer to 13% of sales over time and that will certainly be a contributing element as well. I feel very good about the progress we've made over the last several years, including what we intend to do this year, but I think that work continues beyond. But I have every confidence we'll fully rebuild EBIT margin as well.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: I just wanted to follow-up on the 3% to 5% org sales outlook for fiscal '25. Can you just give us some clarity on the volume versus pricing mix that's embedded in guidance? It sounded like in prepared remarks you do assume some pricing, which surprised me but maybe that's international. Just the balance there and specifically what's driving the pricing would be helpful.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, as it relates to our 3% to 5% goal, that will come from volume growing slightly above 3% to 5%. And then our expectation for price mix is modestly negative, and that's primarily driven by this increased trade spending I talked about in the front half of the year to get back to a more normalized level of merchandising support. We don't have any meaningful pricing in the plan for fiscal year '25. We'll do a little bit internationally, but that won't have a ceding impact on the top line. It will be primarily coming from volume with a very modest offset in price mix.\nDara Mohsenian: And then just, Linda, with the divestiture of Argentina and sale of VMS here, could you just address the 3% to 5% long-term organic sales growth outlook. Does that still hold? Presumably, it still does, but just give us some insight into how you think about the building blocks there, particularly given the recent divestitures?\nLinda Rendle: Yes. It does. It's one of the steps that we take to ensure our financial algorithm is in a good spot. We're committed to continuing to evolve the portfolio in Argentina and VMS are great examples to ensure that we have businesses that are less volatile in the case of Argentina and businesses that we feel can deliver the consistent and profitable growth that we need to, and that really comes down to our decision on VMS. Both of those support a more stable, consistent sales growth. Both of them support margin expansion, as Kevin covered and a more profitable business overall. Obviously, that will have an impact to reported sales this year. But if you look at organic, it's pretty strong. And then as we move forward, what I think it really allows us to do is, focus on the places where we have growth opportunities. It allows us to focus in places like Litter, where I said we have more work to do, in other parts of the business, like international that has grown above our sales average. PPD, which we feel confident now is returning to a stronger grower in the portfolio. So that really in the future as we look to '25 and beyond, not only does that create a new base to grow from that is stronger, but it also allows us to focus on the opportunities in front of us.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies.\nKaumil Gajrawala: On advertising, I saw in this quarter it was at about 14% of sales. Is that just a little bit of maybe a step-up in spend as you got one into the end of the year, just setting you up for next year? Is there something else going on?\nLinda Rendle: Yes. Kaumil, obviously, fiscal year '24 was pretty dynamic, and we set out to have a higher level of spending to support what we thought would be a more value conscious consumer. And then after the cyber-attack in August, we tried to pull back as much spending as we could as we had out of stocks in the market and we backloaded a lot of that plan as we came back into full distribution, as we were able to merchandise again, as we fully rebuilt supply and that 14% represents getting all of those things back in the market and wanting a strong start from a consumer momentum perspective. As you saw for '25, we're returning back to that level of 11%, 11.5%, which is consistent with what we did in aggregate last year. But I think from a Q4 perspective, it just supported all of those fundamentals being live and back in the market and a strong start to the momentum that we intend to continue to build in '25.\nKaumil Gajrawala: And then on promotional activity, but in the context of thinking about gross margins and promo activity, is the assumption that the levels that we're at right now in terms of train spend and promo is where we're sort of leveling off? Or is there an assumption, that it's going to continue to climb over the course of the next calendar year and that 100 bps of gross margin expansion incorporates the likelihood of promos increasing still?\nKevin Jacobsen: Kaumil, the way I'd say it is, if you look at the back half of our fiscal year '24, we merchandise about 25% of our sales and that's very consistent sort of normal merchandising activity. But as I mentioned, in the front half of '24, it was depressed because of the cyber event. As you fast forward to fiscal year '25, you should see a year-over-year increase in trade spending in the front half of the year because we've got to lap that depressed level. But in the back half of fiscal year '25, we're about at the level we think is appropriate and I wouldn't expect a year-over-year increase. You'll see a little bit of a drag on sales and margin in the front half of fiscal year '25 as we get back to that normalized level and I would not expect to see much of that in the back half of fiscal year '25.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Kevin Grundy with BNP Paribas.\nKevin Grundy: Question on advertising and marketing as well. A little bit of a different angle, though. Was there any consideration to maybe leaning in a bit and reinvesting more of this gross margin improvement? You're calling for a 100 basis points of GM improvement. Advertising and marketing up. But I guess I'm asking this one in the context of number one, the market share probably not where you'd hope it would be. And if we're looking at the Nielsen data sort of as a proxy, it seems like there's a lot of share loss beyond household. We're seeing share gains in Hidden Valley and Wipes. Beyond that, at least in the Nielsen data, there's quite a bit of share loss. I'd add to that, we're seeing advertising and marketing trade promo go up across the board. So sort of given the gross margin improvement, share probably not where you want it to be is it prudent just to kind of push back, respectfully push back a little bit to maintain advertising and marketing. Wouldn't this seem like the right time to get the market shares back to where you want them by leaning in even more in this environment, where it's going up across the board from the competitors and your market share is not quite where you want it to be. It'd be great to get your thoughts on that.\nLinda Rendle: Yes, Kevin. As you can imagine for '25, we look at a number of scenarios on what the right level of spend was on advertising on promotion. And our general managers, we pushed them to say, are there incremental spending opportunities that are good, decent short-term payout but would contribute long-term even more. And what they came back with was that 11% to 11.5% range that we had. We think that strikes the right balance. Here's maybe just a little bit of thinking about what you're seeing in share and what we expect and why we're comfortable with the 11% to 11.5%. If you look at share for the extra rate of what we had in June, less than three quarters of recovering from a pretty major cyber events where our distribution, et cetera our distribution was down a third. We lost five full share points. We ended June down three-tenths of a point in share in aggregate. I don't love being down in share, but I think that speaks to the power of the plans, our execution and our brands. To be clear, we intend to grow share in fiscal year '25. But what we're seeing is, just as we restored distribution, which happened mostly in May and June, we haven't even had a full purchase cycle with the consumer yet, which is about 90 days on average. What we're seeing is household penetration begin to rebound. It's not exactly where we want it to be right now, but generally things are all moving in the right direction. And that spend of 11.5% and the increased promotional spend we think is prudent based off of that. I'll be clear though, if the year starts to play out differently and we are not seeing what we expect from our businesses share improve, we feel absolutely comfortable coming back and saying, we need to spend more. And I know I think that would be met positively. But what we're trying to balance right now is top-line growth, ensuring that we have the fuel by expanding margins. We think we have that balance right, right now. And as I've said time and time again, we are not afraid to spend just like we did 14% in Q4 if we feel it's the right thing to do for the business for the long-term.\nOperator: And we'll move next to Robert Moskow with TD Cowen.\nRobert Moskow: Hi, thanks for the question. I guess we can wait for the 10-K, but can you give us a kind of a snapshot on how cash flow ended for the year? It was down for the first three quarters, but wanted to know if there's any kind of recovery in fourth. And then, how should we look at fiscal '25? Is it kind of a -- can we take the net income and kind of just add D&A and subtract CapEx? Or are there any kind of cash expenses that will really hit it or working capital changes that we should be aware of?\nKevin Jacobsen: Sure, Robert. Happy to answer that on free cash flow. Just to remind folks, we target free cash flow as percent of sales 11% to 13%. If you look at free cash flow, it mirrors very similar to what we're doing on the P&L in terms of rebuilding gross margins profitability. If I go back to fiscal year '22, we had about 8% free cash flow. So inflation, depressing margin, depressing profit, we were well below our targeted 11% to 13%. If you look at the last two years, we've averaged about 10%. There are some timing issues on tax payments, but if you take that noise out for fiscal year in '23 and '24 about 10%. This year, fiscal year '25, as we continue to rebuild margin and profitability, we're targeting about 12% free cash flow as percent of sales, so very much back in line with our targeted growth rate. And as a result of that, I think you folks have seen we continue to support the dividend, but we're also starting to pull cash-up on the balance sheet. So we have restarted our share repurchase program. We started this year that we've had suspended for about the last three years and that's really a function of really rebuilding the balance sheet, rebuilding cash flow and now we're able to start deploying that cash back to shareholders.\nRobert Moskow: Where does that stand in your priorities for how to return cash to shareholders? Would there be a step-up in fiscal '25 or does it depend on other factors?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes. In terms of priorities, it's our lowest priority. So job one for us is to invest in the base business and we'll continue to make sure every opportunity we have to invest in the business that generates value for shareholders, we'll continue to do that. We have a very robust plan of investment this year, but in spite of that we support the dividend. Additionally, we have our debt to EBITDA. You folks may know we target 2x to 2.5x. This year, we're looking to be at the very low end of that range, so we're in a very good place from a leverage ratio. And then our last priority, if we have excess cash on the balance sheet, we're going to return that to shareholders and that's the position we find ourselves in this year. We started that process. I'd say for now we're targeting $250 million to $300 million to return. That's primarily catching up on dilution, as we've been out of the market for the last several years. But we'll evaluate that as we get through the year and see how things shake out, but we think this is a good place to start in terms of our outlook.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Javier Escalante with Evercore ISI. Just one moment, please. Then it looks like his line has disconnected. We'll move to our next caller, Olivia Tong with Raymond James.\nOlivia Tong: I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the margin improvement from this year, not just this quarter, because relative to your goals going into the year at this time last year, sales came in below but earnings actually was a fair bit above despite, arguably, consumer challenges building over the course of the neck the last 12 months. Putting cyber aside, would love to hear a little bit about the key drivers of the earnings improvement from this year.\nKevin Jacobsen: In regard to I think you mentioned gross margin primarily. If you look at gross margin, what drove the roughly 360 basis points of improvement? For us, it was another very good year of cost savings, and I really credit our team in spite of the cyber disruption, folks stayed very focused on delivering the productivity improvements that we're counting on. And so we delivered 180 basis points of gross margin expansion through cost savings. That was a very good year for us. We also had pricing primarily in international markets, and that was really Argentina prior to the divestiture, but that certainly contributed to gross margin expansion as well. And then lastly, I'd just say, we've moved into a commodity environment that's fairly benign. If you look at commodities, we've been dealing with tremendous amount of inflation the previous two years. This year is essentially flat, we had no real commodity drag and you had all the benefits of cost savings and the pricing actions we took flowing through to the bottom line. Those are really the primary drivers.\nOlivia Tong: I was more sort of thinking about what came in as a surprise to you. It sounds like it's primarily the cost savings. But then the other thing that I wanted to know about is, one of the things that we're hearing during this earning season is about improving household penetration, especially given the backdrop. Can you discuss some of the things that you're doing to improve your household penetration, whether through promotion and trade spend or some of the digital investments that you're making to try and set out where there are potentially more pockets of consumers that you may be underserving?\nLinda Rendle: Sure. Maybe I'll just close the point on margin, Olivia that you made. Kevin certainly outlined exactly what happened. I think what I would just note is, our continued confidence in the overall margin transformation program we put in place, that's leading to this type of sustained increase in cost savings. We're pulling levers that we pulled before in new ways and we have completely different capabilities that we've built, as well and we're enforcing that by investing in our digital transformation, so better access to data and insights and allowing us to move quicker. I think that's really what we've been pleased to see as it's played out. We have increased confidence and obviously giving us confidence to return to pre-pandemic gross margins, which if you look at the last few years, that's a significant feat given what we had experienced from a commodity increase perspective and overall inflation. That's what I would call out as we continue to get more and more confident about that and it gives us confidence in fiscal year '25 to return to those margins. And I think to Kevin's earlier point that gives us the flexibility to invest if we need to. We feel like we have the right investment levels now, but given the fact that we've made such strong progress there, if we need to invest more, we are ready to do that. And then your point on household penetration, as the industry took pricing, one of the trade-offs we always know that happen at a time when you take pricing is you trade-off household penetration and usually that's temporary. And that happens for a number of reasons. Consumers, you have elasticity and elasticity plays out in a number of ways. Consumers leave the category, consumers decide to behave differently within the category, they make substitute, they have longer purchase cycles, et cetera. And then as you see pricing roll through, you see consumers naturally come back, because they find their alternatives didn't work or they go through all of their pantry. We'd expect to see that happen naturally. But then the work that we're doing is really focused on ensuring that, we are focused on superior value, that we offer them a value that when they go and they're choosing their household essentials that they return to the category and they return to Clorox Brands. And we're seeing that, over the last couple of quarters with some improvements in household penetration. We would expect to see that continue and support the volume driven growth that we'll have in fiscal year '25. But there's a combination of things that we think about in this. Superiority is a combination of pricing, the brand and the product experience. We are ensuring that we have the right price points, which we feel good about. And as I've said before, we continue to look through our net revenue management work to ensure that price points and price gaps are where they need to be. They largely are, but we will absolutely take on if we see a place where our price gaps aren't where they need to be and we'll do that work to ensure that we have that. And we'll use things like price pack architecture to deliver even additional value to those consumers, who may have exited and need a different pack size or buying in a different channel. And then, if you think about product, that's where really innovation and focusing on claims matters. We had a strong innovation program this year. But what I would just emphasize is the last few years, we've had a number as the world has, but I think in particular if you think about Clorox, a number of operational disruptions outside of our control. And we've been trying to balance both margin, earnings, top-line and I think we've done a good job at that. But the organization now is really focused on returning maniacally to growth, given our confidence in margin rebuilding, given our confidence in the brands. And so we are really focused on where is our product need or boost from claims perspective. We are -- pretty innovating. How can we make our innovation even bigger and how can we bring to life those platforms that we intend to launch. And I'll give you maybe just an example of one that doesn't feel like a big deal, but is actually having really an impact in the marketplace, and that's Clorox Scentiva. We launched that a number of years ago. It was very successful. And I talked about in CAGNY that we were going to relaunch Scentiva. And we did that with better claims, better scent profiles and we've actually had the largest quarter in Q4 on Scentiva that we've ever had. A good example where the team is getting laser-focused on value and we're bringing in consumers who maybe can't afford anymore to buy a cleaner and an air freshener and they're getting a great value by having an all in one product with Clorox Scentiva. Good examples of where by category we're being pretty maniacal about that. And then finally, investment. As I've said, I feel like we have the right level of investment on [ANSP] and promo to do exactly that making sure we're capturing consumers at back to school, during times when their family gets ill, reminding them what we can do to keep them safe as well as talking about the trust of the brands and the promises that we deliver. All of that adds up to growing household penetration over time. That's what the team is focused on is, how do we return them to the levels that we were at before and grow them from there, and that it will be part of how we grow share in fiscal year '25.\nOperator: And we'll move to our next question that comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Linda, I mean your last answer gave a lot of color on this, but the implied market share gain, I think is very significant. I hear you on the kind of trend line and where you've gotten back to and more or less flattish. But talking about volume growth north of three to five in a category backdrop that you've described as challenged, resilient but challenged consumer just feels like a really big push. I guess number one, would be why start out with such a high bar? Because again like mid-single-digits volume is a big number and it just yes -- I'll leave it there as my first question.\nLinda Rendle: Sure, Lauren. I think first, one thing to keep in mind as we go through the quarters is we have the lap of cyber. And so we lost five points of share if you look at the height of the cyber tech. And we are regaining a lot of that volume in Q1 and gaining a lot of that share. If you think about exactly what you said, Lauren, the exit rate close to flattish in June. But you have to even if you just forecast getting back to flattish for an entire year, that is a significant amount of volume growth. Then growing share modestly on top of that gets you to that number. I think that's part of what's going on as you have a dynamic of lapping being out of stock, significant volume growth there, significant share loss and refilling that and then growing share modestly, what we would assume in the back half. And some categories will grow faster than others. But we assume the vast majority of our major categories we will see share improvement in and we feel like we have the plans to do that.\nLauren Lieberman: And then if I can just follow-up on some gross margin components. Kevin, you've been super clear that mix is a big contributor this quarter. I just want to clarify, was that in that logistics and manufacturing line? And if you could give any guardrails for like roughly how big it was just when we think about next year's comparison? And then also commodities for fiscal 2025 kind of flattish or is that expected to be a benefit?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, Lauren. On gross margin drivers, you're right. It shows up in the manufacturing line. So when you have mix between business units, and if you saw in our rec we provided. We're favorable about 200 basis points in Q4 and a good portion of that was driven by that favorable BU mix, which I wouldn't expect to continue as move into fiscal year 2025. In regard to commodities, if you look at our outlook for fiscal year 2025, our expectation is about $75 million of total supply chain inflation and we think about half of that will come through commodities and then the other half will come through the other aspects of the supply chain. And so, for us, roughly $35 million, $40 million of commodity inflation this year is a very modest amount of commodity inflation. That's what we're expecting the outlook.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Anna Lizzul with Bank of America Global Research.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is [John Kiefour] on the line for Anna. Just a very quick question on the digital transformation you guys outlined in the prepared remarks. You mentioned Canada seems to be relatively finished. Just wondering how far you guys expect to get through the remainder of the program by the end of this year? Have you seen that like realistically, can you give us any kind of size about how much of the benefits have flowed through? And I guess what you guys are expecting in terms of the cadence from that benefit to flow through overall?\nLinda Rendle: Yes. The digital transformation, we're really pleased with our first wave of our ERP and global finance, rollout that happened on July 1st went very well and gave us strong confidence that, we have set up that wave to learn when we do the new U.S. coming up next year. And so, we have been maniacal about documenting everything that we've learned to set us up for the biggest transition that we have coming on that ERP portion. And as what you saw, we've talked about the fact that, that was delayed due to the cyber event. But we're still on track to finish the program, in fiscal year '26. And we'll make again strong progress this year on the ERP. Next year, the U.S. will come online, and we have additional capabilities coming online as well. We were able to reshuffle some things so that we end the program about the same time. We have seen some value, as you think about the overall digital transformation we have in place as we put our data lake in place, you saw that through things like our marketing efficiencies that we've already had early results on but the bulk of the value that we get and this is a very strong return on investment project comes in '26 and beyond as we complete the implementation of the ERP.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: I know we're running longs, but a couple of questions if I could on that 3% to 5% top-line goal for next year. I guess maybe this gets a little bit at what Lauren was asking about, but is there a way to think about how that compares to the assumed rate of consumption growth in fiscal 2025? I'd expect maybe a couple of points at least of net distribution gains contributing to shipments. So maybe assume consumption running below 3% to 5%, but just wanted to clarify and hopefully quantify that gap. And then as you're talking about it, if we think about it across the segments and just talk about segment variability relative to that goal, are each of the segments expected to run essentially within that range? Or do you see room for some -- any to run notably ahead or below? It seems to me like household and international candidates to run modestly ahead for different reasons, but I just want to play that back for your reaction.\nLinda Rendle: 3% to 5%, this is a complicated set of factors to talk through, given each quarter is a little bit different. But Steve, I think to your point, some of that 3% to 5% is rebuilding, against when we were out of stock in Q1 and Q2. And remember, like you said, we didn't fully restore distribution and merchandising until Q4. You're going to have all of those impacts of that lap, in place. And our categories, we're expecting the low end of low single-digits right now. But we have categories that aren't tracked. And I would just help you keep that in mind too. We have international, we have our professional business that are not in those numbers and we would expect higher exposure to growth in those categories. We've seen that continue to play out and we have get more and more confidence in that, as they've delivered over the last couple of quarters. And then of course, we talked about for share. We won't expect many of our categories to be in the 3% to 5% range. We would expect them to be in low single-digits and then we'll perform slightly better than that. But you do have that lap effect that is certainly playing a role. And then on the segments, what I'd call out is our segments all do have different nuances on performing, call it international is a good example of one that has been a strong growth for us and we'd expect that to continue. And now that we've actually mostly eliminated most of the volatility that we had on FX due to the sale of Argentina, that will be more consistent as well. Our health and wellness segment has continued to perform well. We continue to see share growth opportunities there. Our professional business is back on track, so feeling good there. And then to the point that you made on household, we have maybe an easier comp as you look through the year, given it took longer to fill distribution and we didn't meet expectations on that business in Q4. I think you'll see some variability, but, not outside of the range of the normal variability you would see in our segments.\nSteve Powers: And then if I could, Kevin, you may not want to go here, but I'm going to try anyway. Just you mentioned the structural benefits from the portfolio reshaping, the exit of Argentina VMS, those benefits of margins. I'm wondering if you could give us some kind of quantification or order of magnitude as to how material that is, as you think about the margins that margin improvement is embedded in the '25 guidance?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, Steve, I appreciate the framing of your question. As Linda and I both said, exiting both those businesses, if you think about what we're trying to accomplish in our Ignite strategy, our financial goal is more consistent profitable growth. Those businesses were both dilutive, dilutive to the top line growth rate, dilutive to growth margin and profitability. And so we're exiting both of those businesses. You will see structural improvement. From a top-line perspective, it's probably less than half a point, but it'll structurally improve the growth rates of this company from the top line. And then, from a margin as well, you probably get in that 50 bps to 70 bps structural improvement gross margins once we get both these businesses exited. To me, it is a very nice adjustment to our portfolio to make sure that, we're doing exactly what we committed to more consistency and more profitable growth. And we think exiting both those businesses, while not easy decisions certainly support that endeavor.\nSteve Powers: You appreciate the framing. I appreciate the answer.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Javier Escalante with Evercore ISI.\nJavier Escalante: I have no clue what happened, so let's see whether it works this time around. I would like to tackle the household business slightly different. When you step back, it's rare when you see negative pricing and negative volume at the same time? And I know that you spoke a lot about promotional activity, but to what extent the volumes are telling you is that you took too much pricing? And I have a follow-up.\nLinda Rendle: I'm glad you're back online, Javier. So in household, here's how I would look at it. Certainly, as I said, it didn't meet our expectations. Very clear on why for both for all grilling, Glad and Litter. And it's exactly what I highlighted for grilling. We didn't see any extraordinary merchandising in that category. It was exactly what we expected it to be, but volumes were down due to weather. For Glad, what's going on that you have there is, we were out of the large size market for quite a while. So you have some dynamics on pricing and mix that are happening within that business, until you fully restore supply. I'd say the same thing for Litter. But Litter was a much heavier promotional environment than we would even see as normal as we had expected it to be and we certainly contributed to that as we were looking to get subscriptions back, etcetera. What we see though again is a more rational environment as we move forward back to pre-COVID levels from a pricing perspective. If I look at our value, for Glad, again, we ended the quarter down two-tenths of a point. That would say that our pricing is holding up well in the marketplace. And as we return large sizes, that's the value consumers are looking for. If they might have switched due to price promotion before now that we have the items they want in the market, I would continue to believe that they'll choose us, and evidence of that is the fact that we did so well on Prime Day and we're back to growing share in Glad Trash and our largest customer. And then for Litter, I think again that one's going to take a little bit longer. That is a category we see a decent level of price promotion in. We've accounted for that in our outlook. We would expect to continue to be competitive. But I don't feel like we're in a place where our price gaps are out of whack. It's simply that people are looking to drive against a value-oriented consumer. They want to win share in a more value-oriented marketplace. And again, I think for grilling as we go forward, merchandising plays an important role. Our price gaps look generally in line. Our shares held up. We were down three-tenths of a share point in June. Feel good about where we were despite a bad grilling category season, and feel like if we need to make any adjustments to pricing, like I highlighted earlier, I'm not sure, Javier, when you joined back in the call. But if we need to make any adjustments on an item basis, we absolutely have that plan right now and we won't be afraid to do it as we go through the course of the year. But largely, in aggregate, our pricing is working and holding in the market.\nJavier Escalante: And then the second question has to do with A&P spending or marketing spending. And one particular business that looks very weak in [Circana data] that includes Ulta as well and Amazon and Burt's Bees. So the brand has been weak for a long period of time. It goes through channels that are not compatible or not the same of the balance of the portfolio. And you compete with companies that spend multiples of 14% in marketing, like over 30%. The question is, as you review the portfolio, do you think that you are competitive in Burt's Bees or you will consider adjustments?\nLinda Rendle: Burt's has been an acquisition for us over the years that we've been really pleased about. It's been in a faster growing category and Burt's has contributed stronger sales growth, if you just look in the aggregate, year after year given the opportunities in the natural personal care segment and the attractiveness of those categories. And we don't compete really with some of these large multibillion dollar beauty brands. And we compete in a segment where consumers are looking for products that come from nature, that offer that promise. I mean, although that set is quite competitive, they're not competing with some of the bigger brands that you might think of. And we're really a food drug mass type of business and we were built for that. Our pricing, our architecture is built for that, et cetera. I feel very confident in Burt's future. I'd say, right now, if you look at what Burt's has gone through, unfortunately, last year, we had a massive supply issue when we had a supplier have a fire that put lip tube availability significantly at risk. And then, of course, Burt's had the compounding effect that all of our businesses had of the cyber-attack. What you're seeing is some variability in distribution, et cetera. But if I look at the long-term health and opportunities in front of Burt, I see that as being an opportunities for it to continue to be growth accretive to the company. We're laser focused on making sure that as we have restored supply, we're getting that distribution back. We're also rationalizing distribution in some of the categories. I don't think it makes sense for us to compete in and I think that's just good portfolio management. But Burt's categories are attractive. We have a very strong brand that consumers love and I feel very confident about it moving forward.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. Ms. Rendle, I would now like to turn the program back to you.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks. To close out today's call, I'd like to revisit our long-term strategy and reflect on our transformation journey. Ignite was created to accelerate profitable growth, to create long-term shareholder value. As part of that goal, we set on a course to fundamentally strengthen our value creation model, including how we generate the fuel necessary to drive growth. We're innovating with clear intention. We're focused on delivering superior value through brands consumers love. We're creating a consumer obsessed, faster and leaner organization by reimagining how we work, enabling our team with data and technology, streamlining our operating model, evolving our portfolio to reduce volatility and driving more profitable long term growth. Our strategy has guided us well over the past five years, but we've had to adjust our execution based on several factors outside of our control. We've gone through periods where we saw massive demand increases during COVID-19, normalization of demand, unprecedented inflation, multiple rounds of pricing, a cyber-attack, and the global macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty and volatility that persist today. These shocks have caused our performance to be more volatile. At the same time, they've also led to the acceleration of our transformation agenda. We've been purposeful and balanced on our actions, leaning on our strategy to execute through every challenge, staying committed to rebuilding our margin and earnings, while maintaining top-line growth. This is positioning us to fully restore margin in fiscal year 2025 and deliver strong free cash flow in line with our long-term goals, while investing strongly in our brands. I'm confident we're taking all the right steps, some of which add value now and others will bear fruit as we advance the choices further. We have consistently said that this would not be linear given the environment and challenges, but we continue to make strong progress and remain confident that we're on the right track. Through it all, we stayed true to our goal to transform Clorox into a stronger company poised to deliver more consistent profitable growth and enhance long-term shareholder value. Thank you for your time and questions. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress against our transformation agenda next quarter. Take care.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending.",

            "content": "I'd say this year, as you know, in Q4 came in a bit stronger than we anticipated. The biggest driver of the over delivery for us is what we call business unit mix. Our household segment came in below our expectations and we over delivered our expectations on health and wellness segment. And if you look at our profitability, it's meaningfully different between the two segments. And so that mix generates some nice savings for us. And then the other areas, I'd say, is just generally a bit more favorable across the other lines of the supply chain. We had anticipated commodity deflation is a little bit stronger than we anticipated. Cost savings was another very good quarter for the company a bit more than we thought. We got some nice favorability across the supply chain, but the biggest driver was the BU mix that we did not anticipate. As I look forward to fiscal year 2025, kind of talking about the key drivers are, as Linda said, our expectations are going to add another 100 basis points and fully rebuild gross margin. I'd look at a few drivers. Supporting margin expansion, we're going to have another very good year of cost savings. We target 175 basis points each year of EBIT margin expansion. In the last two years, we've done over 200 basis points. I think this year, we'll do another year over 200 basis points with the bulk of that being in the supply chain. And then, we're also seeing some nice benefit from the portfolio work we've done. As you guys saw, we sold Argentina last quarter. We've announced that we're in the process of selling our VMS business. That's going to structurally improve our gross margins as we get through that. So that will certainly contribute to that 100 basis points. I think modestly offsetting that, I do expect a bit of increased trade spending as we get back to this normalized environment, particularly in the front half of the year, where our trade spending last year was below normal because of the cyber event. You'll see a little bit of year-over-year hit in the front half on trade. And then, we're assuming just a modest level of cost inflation, about $75 million across the supply chain, which will partially offset the margin accretion activity I mentioned. But, all in, we feel very confident in our ability to fully rebuild gross margins. And then going forward, as we've talked quite a bit, as our goal is to get back in that cadence of 25 bps to 50 bps of EBIT margin expansion each year. And we think we're set up to do that as we get into '26 and beyond. Yes. Hey, Chris, on Q1 sales and as you referred to our guidance of we think it's going to be 20%, 25% growth. And keep in mind, we're lapping an 18% decline in organic sales growth from the prior period. We think that growth is driven by both recovering from cyber as well as the strength of our demand plans. Now as I mentioned, that will be partially offset by increased trade spending. In this normalized environment, we're now lapping a period in front half of last year, when we were at a depressed level of merchandising support because of the out of stocks. And so you'll see good strong top-line growth modestly offset by increased trade spending in the front half of the year, which will depress it a bit. And then, as you get to the back half of the year, we average about a normalized level of spending in the back half of '24. I wouldn't expect much of a price mix impact year-over-year in the back half, but a little bit more pronounced in the front half. Yes, sure. On the gross margin lines, you talked about sequentially going from Q4 to Q1. As we said, we think we're going to have a good solid quarter in Q1 up 400 basis points to 500 basis points, but that will be lower than what we landed Q4. Part of it is what I mentioned. The reason we over delivered Q4 is because of this BU mix. We just sold less household products relative to the rest of our portfolio. We don't expect that to be the case in Q1. We expect those businesses to continue to recover and take a larger portion of our sales in Q1, so you won't get that that temporary benefit. And then in addition to that, I talked about the trade spending. You'll have a bit more of a trade spending drag in Q1. And then lastly, some of it is just based on our cost savings timing. We have hundreds of cost savings projects that have natural timelines and so those play out over the course of the year. I'm not particularly too concerned about how it plays out in any given quarter as long as we deliver good strong cost savings for the year, which we expect to do, but that'll have some impact on quarters as well. Yes. On the 3% to 5% organic sales growth, yes, our expectation will have good strong growth in the back half as well for both volume and sales. When you think about our sales of 3% to 5%, we expect this to primarily come from growing volume and growing share and we expect it to happen both in the front and back half of the year. Yes. Bonnie, on EBIT margin, I'd say I feel like we're making very good progress. And then I'll talk adjusted EBIT margin that factors out some of these one-time charges. But if you look at our history, back in fiscal year '22, when we had the significant inflation, our adjusted EBIT margin is about 12%. Last year, we built that back up to about 15%. And if you look at our plans this year, it gets us back to about 17% to 17.5%. We're getting pretty close to fully rebuilding EBIT margin, historical levels about 18%. Our expectation is, by the end of this year we're very close to that level. And then going forward, it's the same things we talked about is continued to drive our margin transformation efforts, continue to drive the top line. We think that's how we get there. And then the very good work we've done on the streamlined operating model, we completed that program. We're on track to deliver $100 million and as we've talked, our intent to start moving our admin spending closer to 13% of sales over time and that will certainly be a contributing element as well. I feel very good about the progress we've made over the last several years, including what we intend to do this year, but I think that work continues beyond. But I have every confidence we'll fully rebuild EBIT margin as well. Yes, as it relates to our 3% to 5% goal, that will come from volume growing slightly above 3% to 5%. And then our expectation for price mix is modestly negative, and that's primarily driven by this increased trade spending I talked about in the front half of the year to get back to a more normalized level of merchandising support. We don't have any meaningful pricing in the plan for fiscal year '25. We'll do a little bit internationally, but that won't have a ceding impact on the top line. It will be primarily coming from volume with a very modest offset in price mix. Kaumil, the way I'd say it is, if you look at the back half of our fiscal year '24, we merchandise about 25% of our sales and that's very consistent sort of normal merchandising activity. But as I mentioned, in the front half of '24, it was depressed because of the cyber event. As you fast forward to fiscal year '25, you should see a year-over-year increase in trade spending in the front half of the year because we've got to lap that depressed level. But in the back half of fiscal year '25, we're about at the level we think is appropriate and I wouldn't expect a year-over-year increase. You'll see a little bit of a drag on sales and margin in the front half of fiscal year '25 as we get back to that normalized level and I would not expect to see much of that in the back half of fiscal year '25. Sure, Robert. Happy to answer that on free cash flow. Just to remind folks, we target free cash flow as percent of sales 11% to 13%. If you look at free cash flow, it mirrors very similar to what we're doing on the P&L in terms of rebuilding gross margins profitability. If I go back to fiscal year '22, we had about 8% free cash flow. So inflation, depressing margin, depressing profit, we were well below our targeted 11% to 13%. If you look at the last two years, we've averaged about 10%. There are some timing issues on tax payments, but if you take that noise out for fiscal year in '23 and '24 about 10%. This year, fiscal year '25, as we continue to rebuild margin and profitability, we're targeting about 12% free cash flow as percent of sales, so very much back in line with our targeted growth rate. And as a result of that, I think you folks have seen we continue to support the dividend, but we're also starting to pull cash-up on the balance sheet. So we have restarted our share repurchase program. We started this year that we've had suspended for about the last three years and that's really a function of really rebuilding the balance sheet, rebuilding cash flow and now we're able to start deploying that cash back to shareholders. Yes. In terms of priorities, it's our lowest priority. So job one for us is to invest in the base business and we'll continue to make sure every opportunity we have to invest in the business that generates value for shareholders, we'll continue to do that. We have a very robust plan of investment this year, but in spite of that we support the dividend. Additionally, we have our debt to EBITDA. You folks may know we target 2x to 2.5x. This year, we're looking to be at the very low end of that range, so we're in a very good place from a leverage ratio. And then our last priority, if we have excess cash on the balance sheet, we're going to return that to shareholders and that's the position we find ourselves in this year. We started that process. I'd say for now we're targeting $250 million to $300 million to return. That's primarily catching up on dilution, as we've been out of the market for the last several years. But we'll evaluate that as we get through the year and see how things shake out, but we think this is a good place to start in terms of our outlook. In regard to I think you mentioned gross margin primarily. If you look at gross margin, what drove the roughly 360 basis points of improvement? For us, it was another very good year of cost savings, and I really credit our team in spite of the cyber disruption, folks stayed very focused on delivering the productivity improvements that we're counting on. And so we delivered 180 basis points of gross margin expansion through cost savings. That was a very good year for us. We also had pricing primarily in international markets, and that was really Argentina prior to the divestiture, but that certainly contributed to gross margin expansion as well. And then lastly, I'd just say, we've moved into a commodity environment that's fairly benign. If you look at commodities, we've been dealing with tremendous amount of inflation the previous two years. This year is essentially flat, we had no real commodity drag and you had all the benefits of cost savings and the pricing actions we took flowing through to the bottom line. Those are really the primary drivers. Yes, Lauren. On gross margin drivers, you're right. It shows up in the manufacturing line. So when you have mix between business units, and if you saw in our rec we provided. We're favorable about 200 basis points in Q4 and a good portion of that was driven by that favorable BU mix, which I wouldn't expect to continue as move into fiscal year 2025. In regard to commodities, if you look at our outlook for fiscal year 2025, our expectation is about $75 million of total supply chain inflation and we think about half of that will come through commodities and then the other half will come through the other aspects of the supply chain. And so, for us, roughly $35 million, $40 million of commodity inflation this year is a very modest amount of commodity inflation. That's what we're expecting the outlook. Yes, Steve, I appreciate the framing of your question. As Linda and I both said, exiting both those businesses, if you think about what we're trying to accomplish in our Ignite strategy, our financial goal is more consistent profitable growth. Those businesses were both dilutive, dilutive to the top line growth rate, dilutive to growth margin and profitability. And so we're exiting both of those businesses. You will see structural improvement. From a top-line perspective, it's probably less than half a point, but it'll structurally improve the growth rates of this company from the top line. And then, from a margin as well, you probably get in that 50 bps to 70 bps structural improvement gross margins once we get both these businesses exited. To me, it is a very nice adjustment to our portfolio to make sure that, we're doing exactly what we committed to more consistency and more profitable growth. And we think exiting both those businesses, while not easy decisions certainly support that endeavor."

            "content": "Thank you for joining us today. Our fourth quarter fiscal year 2024 results reflect the continued advancement of our strategy to strengthen our competitive advantage, accelerate profitable growth and set up our company for long-term success, all while navigating a recovery from the cyber-attack earlier in the year. Thanks to the team's execution, we ended fiscal year 2024 in a position of operational strength. We fully restored supply and distribution and recovered most of the market share that we lost. We closed out with flat organic sales for the full year, despite the significant disruption caused by the cyber-attack, which drove an 18% organic sales decline in the first quarter. Importantly, we continue to deliver on our commitment to rebuild margin to fuel growth, delivering our seventh consecutive quarter of margin expansion. We're on track to return to our pre-pandemic gross margins in fiscal year 2025. We also achieved another year of double-digits adjusted EPS growth. As we look ahead to fiscal year 2025, consumers will remain under pressure, which will continue to temporarily increase competitive activity and impact category growth. That said, we have a portfolio of strong brands in essential categories that have shown resilience during challenging times. We have and will continue to invest strongly behind our brands to maintain value superiority. While we have more work to do, we are confident that we have the right plans at investment level to win with consumers and deliver strong financial performance in fiscal year 2025, supported by a return to volume-driven sales growth, pre-pandemic gross margin and free cash flow in line with our long term goals. With that, Kevin and I will take your questions. Sure, Filippo. Here's maybe helpful to kind of take a step back and frame what we have in front of us. I'll start just with the consumer environment to your point. The consumer environment is playing out as we expected. We certainly thought in the back half of fiscal year '24 that we would see, given the consumer is under pressure just more generally, we see that play out in our categories as we lap pricing, and as we saw competition in retailers react to trying to ensure that they get their shopper, et cetera. And so, that's played out exactly as we expected. We've seen category growth go from about mid-single-digits to low-single-digits, the softest month being in June. But what we see is generally what we've seen and what we've expected to see during this time. Consumers are continuing to be very focused on value. That means that, they are trading up to larger sizes, trading down. But our categories have been pretty resilient given that. Our brands, given their superiority and the fact that we've been rebuilding distribution and have fully rebuilt distribution coming out of the cyber-attack, our category is exactly where we expect them to be. I think moving forward, as we look at the year and to your point on front half versus back half, we continue to assume that the consumer will be under additional pressure, and that our categories will largely continue as we've seen them now, low-single-digits. And what we're really focused on is ensuring that, we're executing our spending plans. We have strong investment in ANFP, strong investment in innovation to support category growth as well as support share growth, which we expect this year and really focused on delivering superior value. And we know that, anyone can win in an environment where it's a little tougher, in the essential categories we compete in if we are laser-focused on delivering great value to consumers. That's exactly what we're focused on right now, to one, fully rebuild the momentum that we're still rebuild the momentum that we're still rebuilding in a couple of our categories coming out of cyber, and two to continue the momentum we're seeing in many of the other businesses that are restored. Sure, Peter. I'll start us with that. And I think that's a helpful place for us to go a bit more into household and what happened there. That was the bulk of the miss that we had in Q4, but feel like a number of these businesses, to your point, we saw good trends heading out. First I'll cover, which you all know that our grilling business, the largest quarter we have is Q4. It's about 50% of our business and it's a heavily weather dependent business. Unfortunately, for both Memorial Day and July 4, weather was terrible in the U.S., very rainy for Memorial Day and extremely hot for 4th of July and that meant the category was down anywhere from high single-digits to double-digits. And as a result, our Kingsford business came in short of expectations. I don't look at that as any type of structural issue in Kingsford. We had good merchandising plans and where consumers did pull, we saw good take through. I think that is simply just the effects of weather, and obviously a portion of why we didn't deliver. And then two other businesses, which I'll break down in a little -- each is a little bit different. They share some same characteristics. But we've spoken a lot in the past about Glad and Litter. And those were the other two that contributed to the Q4 mess. And in the case of Glad, distribution recovery happens later in the quarter than we had expected, but we have fully recovered distribution. So feel very good on the exit rate from a distribution perspective. And as well, we talked a lot about the fact that when we were out of stock, we had a harder time getting our large sizes back, which is one of our biggest growth levers and critical consumers. They're looking for large sizes. They're going to buy a large size than another competitor. So we didn't know exactly what that purchase cycle would look like and that happened again later in the quarter when we saw people come back to our large size business. That being said, we think that was largely a Q4 dynamic. We have strong plans in place for fiscal year '25 across spending and innovation. And then just some data points to kind of show the extra rate coming out. Obviously, distribution, as I said, was fully recovered by the end of the quarter. That happened a little bit later than we expected. Shares trending in the right direction. We were down nine-tenth of a share point in April, but up to just down two-tenths of a share point in June. So a very big change as we got that distribution in place. We're back to growing share at our largest customer. And then on that very important large size business, that was actually one of Amazon Prime Day's number one sellers. And so feel like Glad is in a great position to deliver the growth that we expect it for in 2025. And then finally, for household, I'll cover Litter. And Litter is a little bit of a mixed story. Certainly saw improvement as we went through the quarter. We got distribution back to what we expected it to be, et cetera. But we are not fully capitalizing on the growth in that category at this point. And we have the operational things in place to do that. We've fully recovered supply. We have our customer service levels back to where they need to be. But, we recognize that this is a category that's going to take a bit more time due to its nature. Just a few things to keep in mind. One, you have some consumers who -- it's difficult to switch because their cat's used to a Litter. And that's a little bit more of a headache to switch litters back and forth when we were out and now back in stock. So we're working through that. We're beginning to regain those consumers back, but it's taking some time. This is a business that's heavily on subscription, which I've spoken about before. And while we've made progress getting people back to their subscriptions for fresh step, we still have more work to do. Then we've seen increased competitive activity as people become more value focused, et cetera. And so I think that dynamic in the category combined with just what's going on in the broader context of the categories, where everybody is really attuned to delivering for consumers given how stressed they are, that's a business that's going to take a little bit longer to recover. I feel fully confident in our ability to do it. We have strong innovation on that business. We have strong spending. But that's one that we're working week in and week out to get those consumers back and it's just going to take a little longer than we had originally expected. If I can to ladder all that up, I feel good. We had one business that was weather related, Glad on the right track, Litter improving, have more work to do. And I think that's what we're going to be working on that for the next couple of quarters. But we're really happy with the progress. We have superior value brands. We're investing them in strongly. And there's growth for us to go get. Litter is one where we haven't fully participated in that growth and we are laser-focused on ensuring that happens in '25 and beyond. Sure, Andrea. On the category health piece, here's what I would say. The consumer is stressed in general, but our categories have been resilient and they're where we expected them to be. They're a bit softer, which is exactly what we've experienced in times when the consumer is more stressed. But given that we're in essential categories, they're pretty resilient. Obviously, our categories don't typically grow in the mid-single-digits range, but they did behind pricing. We knew some of that would roll off. But then we have this just additional pressure as consumers are more value focused. We've seen low single-digits. We've seen that bounce around, and we're watching it pretty carefully, but we see no signs right now where we're panicked. We see categories that continue to be resilient, consumers looking for value. Pricing is holding in the marketplace, which is great after taking those multiple rounds of pricing. You're seeing little changes here and there on how retailers are using promotion in the categories. But I would say, our categories are generally healthy and holding up, but just a bit softer as we would normally expect in a time like this. If I look, are there any special dynamics by category, there's still growth to be had. Cal Litter is a great example of one that I just called out that's been still growth-accretive from a category perspective for us. As consumers adopted more cats during COVID, they thankfully still have those cats, and they're investing in the well-being of their pets. I would say, every one category has the similar dynamics around value, et cetera. But we see categories with higher growth opportunities and somewhat a bit lower. But I would say again, they're pretty resilient. I think, if you look at private label, it's probably another important thing to cover. Private label was up about three-tenths of a share point in Q4, but that's coming off of what was some trading during our out-of-stock period. And we're seeing people come back to our brands. We're seeing the middle get squeezed again, which is usually what happens during periods like this. People change with the premium brand or in private label. We do not see consumers meaningfully move to private label in any way. Shares are pretty stable. I'd call out the promotional environment probably, Andrea, is the last thing to touch on. We had anticipated the promotional level would return to pre-COVID levels. We certainly anticipate that for fiscal year '25. Competition is pretty rational in that. We're seeing some pockets of more competition in categories like Glad and Litter and we would expect that, but generally pretty rational. We still think that assumption holds for '25 that will return to pre-COVID levels. It was slightly higher in Q4, actually partially driven by us, but competition as well, and as retailers try new promotional strategies. So, in general, for us, we think the categories are in a good place for us to do what we do best, which is focus on superior value, invest in our brands, ensure that we execute against the strong innovation plans that we have and we have those across all of our major brands again, and feel good about the position they put us in. what we would anticipate is, this slight slowdown will be temporary. We typically see this last 12 to 18 months and our categories would rebound to more of a mid-low single-digits growth number, and we'll just watch for that and be ready to ensure that our brands can take advantage of it. And then you asked on, RGM, Andreas. So I'll just touch on that too because it's so important for how we deliver value now but also in '26 and beyond. That's a relatively new capability for us. We've done some work by businesses. Glad is a great example where you've done some price pack architecture over the years. But we've built out a full capability in the company to take advantage of that and we see that being a top-line contributor and margin contributor for both '25 and beyond. A lot of the activity we'll do right now is really always on pricing, some initial price pack architecture work and we see even more of that in '26 and beyond. But that will be a huge growth driver for us, in the long range plan period. Sure. On Litter just a bit more. First on the innovation side that you touched on, we do have strong plans. First I would say that we're going to double down on some of the very successful platforms that we've had that are very value focused, like Outstretch, which we've talked about before, which is a more concentrated Litter and has performed really well in the market, as particularly consumers are looking for more value having to change that Litter box less, is a very high value for them. We'll double down on those and we have new innovations coming, which I can't give any details yet, but plan for the back half of our fiscal year '25 in the Litter category. We're also looking at claims, and ensuring that we have the right messaging from an advertising perspective. When it comes to investment particularly on Litter, and then I'll speak more broadly to your point on promotion and spend levels in aggregate. In Litter, we contemplated that in our outlook. That is embedded in the assumption that we have 11% to 11.5% of advertising and sales promotion as percent of sales. And then as Kevin just highlighted, the fact that we have increased trade promotion dollars in the system. And so Litter is accounted for that. And then that is the truth for the enterprise as well. We've accounted for the fact that, we're going to keep the spend level about what it was for advertising and sales promotion as a percent of sales versus last year. We think that's a prudent assumption and allows us to continue that momentum with consumers and talking about the value we offer and new innovation. And then same on the trade promotion piece. We have assumed that in our outlook. We've assumed the environment will be about what it was pre-COVID. The risk of that going higher, as what we've seen today, it's been pretty rational and we're seeing retailers be pretty rational. They're definitely ramping up promotion as we expected, but we're not seeing anything that sends us a signal that we haven't made a good assumption. It will be something Bonnie we watch throughout the year though. That certainly is a variable in the plan and could impact it. But for now, I think what people are looking at is using promotion in the right way to ensure that, we're communicating value, that we're introducing innovation, and using that in a very positive way. And we'll be watching it closely and we will react, if we see something from competition. But again, we see a pretty rational environment, pockets of things in Glad, Litter that we're dealing with but we've contemplated all about in the outlook. Yes. It does. It's one of the steps that we take to ensure our financial algorithm is in a good spot. We're committed to continuing to evolve the portfolio in Argentina and VMS are great examples to ensure that we have businesses that are less volatile in the case of Argentina and businesses that we feel can deliver the consistent and profitable growth that we need to, and that really comes down to our decision on VMS. Both of those support a more stable, consistent sales growth. Both of them support margin expansion, as Kevin covered and a more profitable business overall. Obviously, that will have an impact to reported sales this year. But if you look at organic, it's pretty strong. And then as we move forward, what I think it really allows us to do is, focus on the places where we have growth opportunities. It allows us to focus in places like Litter, where I said we have more work to do, in other parts of the business, like international that has grown above our sales average. PPD, which we feel confident now is returning to a stronger grower in the portfolio. So that really in the future as we look to '25 and beyond, not only does that create a new base to grow from that is stronger, but it also allows us to focus on the opportunities in front of us. Yes. Kaumil, obviously, fiscal year '24 was pretty dynamic, and we set out to have a higher level of spending to support what we thought would be a more value conscious consumer. And then after the cyber-attack in August, we tried to pull back as much spending as we could as we had out of stocks in the market and we backloaded a lot of that plan as we came back into full distribution, as we were able to merchandise again, as we fully rebuilt supply and that 14% represents getting all of those things back in the market and wanting a strong start from a consumer momentum perspective. As you saw for '25, we're returning back to that level of 11%, 11.5%, which is consistent with what we did in aggregate last year. But I think from a Q4 perspective, it just supported all of those fundamentals being live and back in the market and a strong start to the momentum that we intend to continue to build in '25. Yes, Kevin. As you can imagine for '25, we look at a number of scenarios on what the right level of spend was on advertising on promotion. And our general managers, we pushed them to say, are there incremental spending opportunities that are good, decent short-term payout but would contribute long-term even more. And what they came back with was that 11% to 11.5% range that we had. We think that strikes the right balance. Here's maybe just a little bit of thinking about what you're seeing in share and what we expect and why we're comfortable with the 11% to 11.5%. If you look at share for the extra rate of what we had in June, less than three quarters of recovering from a pretty major cyber events where our distribution, et cetera our distribution was down a third. We lost five full share points. We ended June down three-tenths of a point in share in aggregate. I don't love being down in share, but I think that speaks to the power of the plans, our execution and our brands. To be clear, we intend to grow share in fiscal year '25. But what we're seeing is, just as we restored distribution, which happened mostly in May and June, we haven't even had a full purchase cycle with the consumer yet, which is about 90 days on average. What we're seeing is household penetration begin to rebound. It's not exactly where we want it to be right now, but generally things are all moving in the right direction. And that spend of 11.5% and the increased promotional spend we think is prudent based off of that. I'll be clear though, if the year starts to play out differently and we are not seeing what we expect from our businesses share improve, we feel absolutely comfortable coming back and saying, we need to spend more. And I know I think that would be met positively. But what we're trying to balance right now is top-line growth, ensuring that we have the fuel by expanding margins. We think we have that balance right, right now. And as I've said time and time again, we are not afraid to spend just like we did 14% in Q4 if we feel it's the right thing to do for the business for the long-term. Sure. Maybe I'll just close the point on margin, Olivia that you made. Kevin certainly outlined exactly what happened. I think what I would just note is, our continued confidence in the overall margin transformation program we put in place, that's leading to this type of sustained increase in cost savings. We're pulling levers that we pulled before in new ways and we have completely different capabilities that we've built, as well and we're enforcing that by investing in our digital transformation, so better access to data and insights and allowing us to move quicker. I think that's really what we've been pleased to see as it's played out. We have increased confidence and obviously giving us confidence to return to pre-pandemic gross margins, which if you look at the last few years, that's a significant feat given what we had experienced from a commodity increase perspective and overall inflation. That's what I would call out as we continue to get more and more confident about that and it gives us confidence in fiscal year '25 to return to those margins. And I think to Kevin's earlier point that gives us the flexibility to invest if we need to. We feel like we have the right investment levels now, but given the fact that we've made such strong progress there, if we need to invest more, we are ready to do that. And then your point on household penetration, as the industry took pricing, one of the trade-offs we always know that happen at a time when you take pricing is you trade-off household penetration and usually that's temporary. And that happens for a number of reasons. Consumers, you have elasticity and elasticity plays out in a number of ways. Consumers leave the category, consumers decide to behave differently within the category, they make substitute, they have longer purchase cycles, et cetera. And then as you see pricing roll through, you see consumers naturally come back, because they find their alternatives didn't work or they go through all of their pantry. We'd expect to see that happen naturally. But then the work that we're doing is really focused on ensuring that, we are focused on superior value, that we offer them a value that when they go and they're choosing their household essentials that they return to the category and they return to Clorox Brands. And we're seeing that, over the last couple of quarters with some improvements in household penetration. We would expect to see that continue and support the volume driven growth that we'll have in fiscal year '25. But there's a combination of things that we think about in this. Superiority is a combination of pricing, the brand and the product experience. We are ensuring that we have the right price points, which we feel good about. And as I've said before, we continue to look through our net revenue management work to ensure that price points and price gaps are where they need to be. They largely are, but we will absolutely take on if we see a place where our price gaps aren't where they need to be and we'll do that work to ensure that we have that. And we'll use things like price pack architecture to deliver even additional value to those consumers, who may have exited and need a different pack size or buying in a different channel. And then, if you think about product, that's where really innovation and focusing on claims matters. We had a strong innovation program this year. But what I would just emphasize is the last few years, we've had a number as the world has, but I think in particular if you think about Clorox, a number of operational disruptions outside of our control. And we've been trying to balance both margin, earnings, top-line and I think we've done a good job at that. But the organization now is really focused on returning maniacally to growth, given our confidence in margin rebuilding, given our confidence in the brands. And so we are really focused on where is our product need or boost from claims perspective. We are -- pretty innovating. How can we make our innovation even bigger and how can we bring to life those platforms that we intend to launch. And I'll give you maybe just an example of one that doesn't feel like a big deal, but is actually having really an impact in the marketplace, and that's Clorox Scentiva. We launched that a number of years ago. It was very successful. And I talked about in CAGNY that we were going to relaunch Scentiva. And we did that with better claims, better scent profiles and we've actually had the largest quarter in Q4 on Scentiva that we've ever had. A good example where the team is getting laser-focused on value and we're bringing in consumers who maybe can't afford anymore to buy a cleaner and an air freshener and they're getting a great value by having an all in one product with Clorox Scentiva. Good examples of where by category we're being pretty maniacal about that. And then finally, investment. As I've said, I feel like we have the right level of investment on [ANSP] and promo to do exactly that making sure we're capturing consumers at back to school, during times when their family gets ill, reminding them what we can do to keep them safe as well as talking about the trust of the brands and the promises that we deliver. All of that adds up to growing household penetration over time. That's what the team is focused on is, how do we return them to the levels that we were at before and grow them from there, and that it will be part of how we grow share in fiscal year '25. Sure, Lauren. I think first, one thing to keep in mind as we go through the quarters is we have the lap of cyber. And so we lost five points of share if you look at the height of the cyber tech. And we are regaining a lot of that volume in Q1 and gaining a lot of that share. If you think about exactly what you said, Lauren, the exit rate close to flattish in June. But you have to even if you just forecast getting back to flattish for an entire year, that is a significant amount of volume growth. Then growing share modestly on top of that gets you to that number. I think that's part of what's going on as you have a dynamic of lapping being out of stock, significant volume growth there, significant share loss and refilling that and then growing share modestly, what we would assume in the back half. And some categories will grow faster than others. But we assume the vast majority of our major categories we will see share improvement in and we feel like we have the plans to do that. Yes. The digital transformation, we're really pleased with our first wave of our ERP and global finance, rollout that happened on July 1st went very well and gave us strong confidence that, we have set up that wave to learn when we do the new U.S. coming up next year. And so, we have been maniacal about documenting everything that we've learned to set us up for the biggest transition that we have coming on that ERP portion. And as what you saw, we've talked about the fact that, that was delayed due to the cyber event. But we're still on track to finish the program, in fiscal year '26. And we'll make again strong progress this year on the ERP. Next year, the U.S. will come online, and we have additional capabilities coming online as well. We were able to reshuffle some things so that we end the program about the same time. We have seen some value, as you think about the overall digital transformation we have in place as we put our data lake in place, you saw that through things like our marketing efficiencies that we've already had early results on but the bulk of the value that we get and this is a very strong return on investment project comes in '26 and beyond as we complete the implementation of the ERP. 3% to 5%, this is a complicated set of factors to talk through, given each quarter is a little bit different. But Steve, I think to your point, some of that 3% to 5% is rebuilding, against when we were out of stock in Q1 and Q2. And remember, like you said, we didn't fully restore distribution and merchandising until Q4. You're going to have all of those impacts of that lap, in place. And our categories, we're expecting the low end of low single-digits right now. But we have categories that aren't tracked. And I would just help you keep that in mind too. We have international, we have our professional business that are not in those numbers and we would expect higher exposure to growth in those categories. We've seen that continue to play out and we have get more and more confidence in that, as they've delivered over the last couple of quarters. And then of course, we talked about for share. We won't expect many of our categories to be in the 3% to 5% range. We would expect them to be in low single-digits and then we'll perform slightly better than that. But you do have that lap effect that is certainly playing a role. And then on the segments, what I'd call out is our segments all do have different nuances on performing, call it international is a good example of one that has been a strong growth for us and we'd expect that to continue. And now that we've actually mostly eliminated most of the volatility that we had on FX due to the sale of Argentina, that will be more consistent as well. Our health and wellness segment has continued to perform well. We continue to see share growth opportunities there. Our professional business is back on track, so feeling good there. And then to the point that you made on household, we have maybe an easier comp as you look through the year, given it took longer to fill distribution and we didn't meet expectations on that business in Q4. I think you'll see some variability, but, not outside of the range of the normal variability you would see in our segments. I'm glad you're back online, Javier. So in household, here's how I would look at it. Certainly, as I said, it didn't meet our expectations. Very clear on why for both for all grilling, Glad and Litter. And it's exactly what I highlighted for grilling. We didn't see any extraordinary merchandising in that category. It was exactly what we expected it to be, but volumes were down due to weather. For Glad, what's going on that you have there is, we were out of the large size market for quite a while. So you have some dynamics on pricing and mix that are happening within that business, until you fully restore supply. I'd say the same thing for Litter. But Litter was a much heavier promotional environment than we would even see as normal as we had expected it to be and we certainly contributed to that as we were looking to get subscriptions back, etcetera. What we see though again is a more rational environment as we move forward back to pre-COVID levels from a pricing perspective. If I look at our value, for Glad, again, we ended the quarter down two-tenths of a point. That would say that our pricing is holding up well in the marketplace. And as we return large sizes, that's the value consumers are looking for. If they might have switched due to price promotion before now that we have the items they want in the market, I would continue to believe that they'll choose us, and evidence of that is the fact that we did so well on Prime Day and we're back to growing share in Glad Trash and our largest customer. And then for Litter, I think again that one's going to take a little bit longer. That is a category we see a decent level of price promotion in. We've accounted for that in our outlook. We would expect to continue to be competitive. But I don't feel like we're in a place where our price gaps are out of whack. It's simply that people are looking to drive against a value-oriented consumer. They want to win share in a more value-oriented marketplace. And again, I think for grilling as we go forward, merchandising plays an important role. Our price gaps look generally in line. Our shares held up. We were down three-tenths of a share point in June. Feel good about where we were despite a bad grilling category season, and feel like if we need to make any adjustments to pricing, like I highlighted earlier, I'm not sure, Javier, when you joined back in the call. But if we need to make any adjustments on an item basis, we absolutely have that plan right now and we won't be afraid to do it as we go through the course of the year. But largely, in aggregate, our pricing is working and holding in the market. Burt's has been an acquisition for us over the years that we've been really pleased about. It's been in a faster growing category and Burt's has contributed stronger sales growth, if you just look in the aggregate, year after year given the opportunities in the natural personal care segment and the attractiveness of those categories. And we don't compete really with some of these large multibillion dollar beauty brands. And we compete in a segment where consumers are looking for products that come from nature, that offer that promise. I mean, although that set is quite competitive, they're not competing with some of the bigger brands that you might think of. And we're really a food drug mass type of business and we were built for that. Our pricing, our architecture is built for that, et cetera. I feel very confident in Burt's future. I'd say, right now, if you look at what Burt's has gone through, unfortunately, last year, we had a massive supply issue when we had a supplier have a fire that put lip tube availability significantly at risk. And then, of course, Burt's had the compounding effect that all of our businesses had of the cyber-attack. What you're seeing is some variability in distribution, et cetera. But if I look at the long-term health and opportunities in front of Burt, I see that as being an opportunities for it to continue to be growth accretive to the company. We're laser focused on making sure that as we have restored supply, we're getting that distribution back. We're also rationalizing distribution in some of the categories. I don't think it makes sense for us to compete in and I think that's just good portfolio management. But Burt's categories are attractive. We have a very strong brand that consumers love and I feel very confident about it moving forward. Thanks. To close out today's call, I'd like to revisit our long-term strategy and reflect on our transformation journey. Ignite was created to accelerate profitable growth, to create long-term shareholder value. As part of that goal, we set on a course to fundamentally strengthen our value creation model, including how we generate the fuel necessary to drive growth. We're innovating with clear intention. We're focused on delivering superior value through brands consumers love. We're creating a consumer obsessed, faster and leaner organization by reimagining how we work, enabling our team with data and technology, streamlining our operating model, evolving our portfolio to reduce volatility and driving more profitable long term growth. Our strategy has guided us well over the past five years, but we've had to adjust our execution based on several factors outside of our control. We've gone through periods where we saw massive demand increases during COVID-19, normalization of demand, unprecedented inflation, multiple rounds of pricing, a cyber-attack, and the global macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty and volatility that persist today. These shocks have caused our performance to be more volatile. At the same time, they've also led to the acceleration of our transformation agenda. We've been purposeful and balanced on our actions, leaning on our strategy to execute through every challenge, staying committed to rebuilding our margin and earnings, while maintaining top-line growth. This is positioning us to fully restore margin in fiscal year 2025 and deliver strong free cash flow in line with our long-term goals, while investing strongly in our brands. I'm confident we're taking all the right steps, some of which add value now and others will bear fruit as we advance the choices further. We have consistently said that this would not be linear given the environment and challenges, but we continue to make strong progress and remain confident that we're on the right track. Through it all, we stayed true to our goal to transform Clorox into a stronger company poised to deliver more consistent profitable growth and enhance long-term shareholder value. Thank you for your time and questions. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress against our transformation agenda next quarter. Take care."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference.\nLisah Burhan: Thanks Paul. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. On the call today with me are Linda Rendle, our Chair CEO, and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. I hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release and prepared remarks, both of these are available on our website. In just a moment, Linda will share a few opening comments and then we'll take your questions. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements, including about our fiscal 2024 outlook. These statements are based on management's current expectations, but may differ from actual results or outcomes. In addition, we may refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section, which identifies various factors that could affect such forward-looking statements, which has been filed with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the non-GAAP financial information section of our earnings release and the supplemental financial schedules in the investor relations section of our website for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Now I'll turn it over to Linda.\nLinda Rendle : Thank you for joining us today. During the third quarter, we continued to progress our recovery from the August cyber-attack while advancing our Ignite strategy to build a stronger, more resilient company. For the most part, our progress in the third quarter was in-line with our expectations. Sales came in lower, as a few businesses experienced slower supply recovery than we planned. Gross margin came in higher, benefiting from our margin transformation program and a [modernized environment] (ph). Despite lower sales and strong investments in our brands, we finished the quarter ahead of our expectations on adjusted earnings per share. Before we turn to questions, I think stepping back and putting these results in context is important. Given the magnitude of disruption from the cyber-attack, we knew our plans to restore the fundamentals of our business would be complex, and a recovery path would not be linear. We have made tremendous progress and are laser-focused on finishing the job. We tracked well ahead of our expectations in the second quarter and knew we had more work to do as we entered the back half of the year to return our business to the strong trajectory it was on at the start of fiscal year 2024. This included fully rebuilding inventories, restoring normalized service levels, and rebuilding commercial plans for each of our businesses, which we accomplished by the end of the third quarter. These actions unlock our ability to fully restore lost distribution due to the cyber-attack and return to normalized merchandising levels as planned in the fourth quarter. Through Q3, we have regained nearly 90% of the market share we lost and expect to make further progress in Q4. With service levels now normalized and strong investment levels behind our brands, we're confident we can rebuild household penetration and return to volume growth over time. Despite the significant disruption and lost sales we've experienced and based on our team's strong work, we are now positioned to exceed our original gross margin target and meet or exceed our adjusted EPS guidance we provided at the beginning of the year before the cyber-attack. Importantly, our recovery progress to date puts us in a good position to exit fiscal 2024 with strong fundamentals. In addition, we continue to execute well against our IGNITE strategic priorities throughout our recovery. We made substantial progress rebuilding gross margins, continuing to target returning to pre-pandemic levels over time. We launched innovation invested in our brands and capabilities, progressed our streamlined operating model and digital transformation, and completed the divestiture of our Argentina business, which supports our goal of evolving our portfolio to deliver more consistent and profitable growth. In closing, we're taking the right steps to navigate the near-term and continuing to advance our IGNITE strategy. I'm confident we have the right investments and plans to deliver against our strategic and financial objectives and enhance long-term shareholder value. With that, Kevin and I will take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you, Ms. Linda. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Peter Grom of UBS. Your line is open.\nPeter Grom: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Hope you're doing well. I was hoping to get some more color on kind of the implied 4Q organic sales growth and how this informs you on kind of the path forward here. I know this was always the case, but it seems like you're expecting to kind of close some of these distribution gaps of 4Q, more or less implying that you're going to overship versus consumption. But when you kind of look at the implied 4Q guide and to kind of where you need to be to land at the low end -- of low single digits for the year, doesn't really imply a ton of growth considering this dynamic. So maybe first, am I thinking about that right? And if so, how does this exit rate inform your view on the growth looking out to next year just in the context of the long-term algorithm of 3% to 5%? Thanks.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks, Peter. Why don't I get us started and I'll just talk about some of the dynamics that we expect in the fourth quarter. And then I'll hand it to Kevin, and he can talk about the outlook. And of course, you'll appreciate we're not setting guidance for fiscal year \u201825 at this point, but Kevin can certainly give you how we're thinking about the exit. So as it comes to Q4, there are a number of dynamics and things that are important that we plan to do and have the right plans to address. And the first is what you mentioned. We intend to fully restore the temporary distribution we lost as a result of the cyber-attack. And we are well on track to do that. At this point, we know the decisions on the shelf resets from all of our major retailers. We built the inventory in order to supply those distribution losses and are on track to restore that distribution. So certainly, that will help both reported and organic sales as we head into the fourth quarter. The second dynamic is now that we have fully restored our ability to supply and are back to normalized service levels, we are going to return to our merchandising plans, which, if you recall from our earlier conversations, we expect to be higher than they were during the pandemic, basically returning to pre-pandemic levels. And that is on track as well for the fourth quarter, and both of those will support growth. The thing I would mention, And as you can see, the implied range is rather large. And that's because it's still quite variable and volatile what we're dealing with. We're dealing with a complex recovery. shelf resets are all at different times for our retailers. How fast those resets happen. And then, of course, where we are on the purchase cycle with consumers will matter, and that's informing the depth and breadth of that range. But I'll hand that over to Kevin and he can help you think about just how that plays out in the outlook.\nKevin Jacobsen: Hey, Peter. You know, as it relates to the outlook and I think specifically your question, organic sales growth in Q4. What I expect to see occurring this quarter is improving volume trends. If you look at our volume performance, we're down about 7% the front half of the year down 4% in Q3. I expect that to continue to improve as we move forward. I also expect we'll see some increased trade spending. We continue to work back towards a more normalized promotional environment. Q3 was still below sort of that normal level, so I think you would expect to see some increased trade spending. And then as a result of the divestiture of Argentina business, it's gotten a lot simpler. I don't expect any FX headwinds. I don't expect any meaningful pricing now. Most of our pricing was in international -- that would all go away. So you should see improving volume trends, a little bit of uptick in trade spending, and that gets you down to probably flat to down a little bit in terms of organic sales growth in Q4. And that would keep us on track to be up about 1% for the year.\nPeter Grom: Awesome. Thanks so much for that. And Kevin, maybe just one follow-up or more of a piece of clarification. In the prepared remarks, you mentioned kind of building on the 43% gross margin exiting the year. Is that a broad-based comment, or are you talking specifically on building relative to the 4Q exit rate?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah, I think there's a few things. You saw where we landed, Peter, in Q3, a little over 42%. We think we'll be closer to 43% when we exit. You know, as Linda said, we're not prepared to provide our outlook for next year. But I would tell you, we fully expect to continue to expand margins in fiscal year \u201825. So we'll exit this year. You know, over the full year, we're probably up around 42%. And I expect a bill on that next year.\nPeter Grom: Thanks so much. I'll pass it on.\nKevin Jacobsen: Thanks, Peter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you, everyone, and good afternoon there. Linda, you mentioned in the prepared remarks few areas of the portfolio that experienced slower supply recovered than planned, that impacted the third quarter. And I understand the 10% that you mentioned that still is below the service levels. But relative to your 2% organic growth, how much was out-channel consumption given also comments in that same report that you experienced consumption losses? So can you elaborate more on which areas you were still below in share and what gives you confidence that the consumers you lost during that period within your consumption patterns would come back. And then Kevin, a clarification on what you just said about building margins into 2025 -- the fiscal 2025. How do you see rising prices in other commodities? Are you embedding these two inflationary commodities and how would you expect to offset that? Is that mostly on the savings? They IGNITE, how we should be thinking as we move forward.\nLinda Rendle: Sure. All right, I'll get started with that first question. And I think the question was twofold. So I'll start first maybe addressing the areas on supply that we called out that impacted sales for the quarter. And then I'll talk a bit more about the consumer and the confidence that we have about where we are and that we have the right plans in place as we roll into Q4 to continue to accomplish what we intend to do around the consumer and restore our business fundamentals. So in supply recovery, we talked about the last call and actually the call before that we had a couple of businesses that were more challenged given the depth of their portfolio. And that was Glad, and we called out Litter as well. And those continued to be a challenge a bit longer in the quarter than we had originally anticipated at the time of forecast. The good news is that with a few other minor things in businesses, we were able to fully fix all of those by the end of the quarter, and we exited Q3 getting back to normalized service levels to our customers. And so feel good that as we head into Q4, we have the right inventory and we have the right production plans and plans with our retailers to be able to get back all of those distribution points that we lost temporarily and, again, restore merchandising. So again, that was a temporary thing in nature, impacted Q3, but we don't anticipate that it will impact Q4. If you look at the consumer, a few things going on. First, our distribution points are still down versus pre-cyber, which we had anticipated. And we knew that the majority of shelf resets would happen in Q4. That is still going as planned and we expect to fully regain that distribution that we anticipated having at the beginning of the year when we set our original outlook. So on track there. And then I would say we're starting to see the share turnarounds. We've recovered nearly 90% of our share loss. And actually, if you even look at the last few weeks, you've continued to see that trend improve. And in addition, we're rebuilding households. So our households in Q3 are still down versus pre-cyber, which we expected, but improving and moving in the right direction. And if you think about it, we really only had from when we fully restored inventories, and again, haven't fully restored distribution, that's basically one purchase cycle for the consumer in our categories. Purchase cycle is about 90 days. So we've had one chance to influence as that consumer comes back to the shelf, and we're not fully restored yet. What we're laser focused on in Q4, and this is why we have the investment levels that we do, where we've increased our spending on advertising and sales promotion, as well as reduced revenue, ensuring that we have the right spending that in this next purchase cycle, that we can recapture that consumer. We intend to do as much of that as we can in Q4, and we're hoping to get the majority of it done. We're very confident in distribution, very confident in the merchandising, and now we're just watching as the consumer comes back to a fully-stocked shelf. What is their behavior, and do we need to make any tweaks as we head into the beginning of fiscal year \u201825, but feel very good about where we are in restoring the fundamentals and very good that we're beginning to see the consumer come back that we lost during that time.\nKevin Jacobsen: Andrea, your question on \u201825 and gross margin, you know, as I'm sure you can appreciate, we're still in the process of building our plans right now for \u201825. But where we're sitting at today, I fully expect we're going to be growing top line, expanding margins, growing earnings. And so as you think about how we grow margin, I think to your specific question, certainly top-line growth helps build margin. Additionally, divestiture of our Argentina business, that was [margin-diluted] (ph) to the company. So, divesting that business certainly helps our margin. And then our margin transformation efforts. We think collectively that more than offsets what we believe will be a level of cost inflation but continue to moderate. So, we do not believe right now we're going to be in a deflationary environment next year. There will be some cost inflation, but it continues to moderate. And the actions I just mentioned we think are more than enough to offset that and allow us to continue to build margin next year. But the exact amount we're still working through.\nAndrea Teixeira: Yeah, thank you. That's super helpful. In Argentina, what is the impact of removing Argentina as a tailwind?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah, we don't break that out, Andrea, specifically. But I can tell you it was significantly below the company average in terms of gross margins. You can probably do some math. It was 2% of sales and well below the company average in terms of gross margin.\nAndrea Teixeira: Okay, very good. Thank you very much, I will pass it on.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nChristopher Carey: Hi, everyone.\nLinda Rendle: Hi, Chris.\nChristopher Carey: I wanted to ask about sales delivery in the quarter excluding international. So in the prepared remarks, you spoke about increased competitive activity as you were trying to get back on shelf. Price mix was negative in your key division in the quarter. And I'm trying to marry that with, I think you had sounded quite good recently on the logistical dynamic of getting back on shelf in the quarter. And so I guess I'm trying to put maybe altogether the why behind sales coming in a bit below your expectations and whether competitors are perhaps a bit firmer on shelf and share gains than you had expected, and you need to increase competitive spending, whether that's in price mix? And obviously, you called out some trade promo in your gross margins this quarter, to get back on shelf and whether you think to your comment to the prior question, you may need to actually accelerate that spending over the next several quarters if this shelf-uplift is not exactly how you expect. So you can tell, I'm trying to wrestle between not just that sales came in below the expectation, but the why and some of the actions that you seem to be taking to try and rectify the situation.\nLinda Rendle: Yes, Chris, we -- from all the data that we see, the progress we've made with the consumer and what we anticipate will happen here in Q4, we do not feel like we have a dynamic that the sales miss was due to a consumer issue that we have or not bouncing back to that degree with the household penetration we lost. This was simply we had two very complex businesses, we thought we would make more progress on supply than we did. It went longer, it went through the remainder of the quarter when we thought we would get it done mid-quarter. That impacted our ability really to supply for merchandising mostly. Distribution, we always knew would come back in the fourth quarter because that's when retailers reset their shelves. So the good news is because we were able to fully restore supply by the end of the quarter, we're still on track to recover that distribution. But this really was heightened competition as we weren't able to supply merchandising events and still not in a place where we were fully able to supply on those couple of businesses. But we're through that, we got through that at the end of Q3. We have the ability now to fully supply in Q4. That investment level, we feel is the right investment level. And I'll just be clear, we have not constrained our businesses. We have said they should spend what they need to -- to get these households back. That is contemplated in the outlook that we provided and we believe we have the right spending on both advertising and [self-promotion] (ph) and merchandising. And if we have to make adjustments as we go through the quarter, we will. But right now, we feel like we have the right plans, we are seeing those households come back. Again, we went through one purchase cycle. We're going through another one here in Q4, but all indicators are that we will restore our business. And we feel like the fundamentals will be fully recovered by the end of Q4 and set us up well as we head into fiscal year '25.\nChristopher Carey: Okay. One quick follow-up would just be Manufacturing and Logistics was a 210 basis point negative impact to gross margin in the quarter. That's a pretty notable step-up. And I don't think we're seeing logistics inflation at that level. Kevin, can you maybe just contextualize what happened there in the quarter? And whether that specifically is durable going forward or whether this is just an anomaly? Thanks.\nKevin Jacobsen: Sure, Chris. The increase you referred to that is primarily driven by inflation in Argentina, you might recall before we divested that business, we were projecting about 300% inflation, and they had a significant devaluation in December. So that was playing through and it's the biggest driver. To your question, as you go forward now that we divest the business, I would not expect to see Logistics and Manufacturing be that level of a drag. Logistics is turning on us, it's fairly benign in terms of year-over-year cost once you strip out Argentina. So, this is one of the additional benefits of not having that business in our portfolio any longer, given the disruptions it had broadly across the P&L.\nChristopher Carey: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nDara Mohsenian: Hi guys. I get you don't want to be too explicit for fiscal '25 at this point, but I just had a follow-up question on top-line growth as we move into next year just relative to a normal base this year. Kevin, can you just talk about or Linda, any puts and takes as you look out to fiscal '25 as we think about top line growth? And maybe also just quantify what level of sales did you lose in fiscal '24? Do you expect to lose in fiscal '24 from the systems issue relative to a typical year?\nKevin Jacobsen: Hi, Dara, what I'd say it's a little too early for us to talk too specifically about the '25. As I said, we're still developing our plan. Maybe the one item, I would just make sure remind folks is, with the divestiture of Argentina business, that's about 2 points of sales. We'll see a portion of that in Q4, but you'll probably still have about 1.5 point headwind next year as a result of that sale. But for the other items, we're going to wait until August to have that conversation because we're still working through our plans. It'd just be too early to talk any detail.\nDara Mohsenian: Okay. And then on gross margins, you talked about a CAGNY to focus on holistic margin management and RGM. Can you give us a little more color on how important that might be over the next couple of years? And as you think about recovering gross margin pressure over time as you indicated in the prepared remarks, is that a big piece of the recovery? And as we think about the recovery, is this a multi-year effort? Should we think about a lot of progress coming out in fiscal 2025? How do you think about that conceptually from a timing standpoint?\nLinda Rendle: Sure, Dara. Without obviously, again providing any guidance for 2025 or beyond on specifics. I think I can say with really strong confidence, one based on the track records, if you look, we've delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion behind this toolkit that we have. And what we talked about at CAGNY is important. Pricing and cost savings have been the majority of the tools that we've had, and we put them to good use over the last couple of years as we've dealt with inflation. But we knew that we wanted to take a broader look and the fact that we are implementing a digital transformation, and we have more visibility end-to-end, gave us a great opportunity to look and see where else can we go beyond traditional cost savings. Revenue growth management is certainly one of those tools, price pack architecture within that. And the teams all have plans in place to use those tools to continue to make progress against our commitment that we stand behind to return gross margins to pre-pandemic levels and then grow from there. And we feel very confident in our ability to do that. Kevin and I have talked before, it's really dependent on two things. One how fast we implement this toolbox and feel good about that. But second will be what the cost environment looks like. And as what we continue to look forward, we continue to see inflation in people's reporting. Again, we are not providing any specifics around our business at this point. But the pace of recovery and when we returned to pre-pandemic levels will be those two factors, but we feel very good about what's in our control and that we have the right toolbox to be able to accomplish what we set out to do.\nDara Mohsenian: Okay, thanks guys.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks Dara.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anna Lizzul of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nAnna Lizzul: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for the question. You mentioned in your prepared remarks a consumer who remains under pressure. I was wondering if you're seeing this across all income tiers? Or is this comment primarily related to the lower income consumer as some other companies have indicated so far in Q1? And then you mentioned your levels of merchandising and promotion are increasing along with the higher advertising spend in the second half here. So, just wondering how much of this is driven by the need to rebuild share loss from the cyber-attack versus just trying to win over a financially weaker consumer. Thank you.\nLinda Rendle: Sure. We're seeing pressure across all consumer groups. And we are seeing behaviors broadly outside of our categories changing for nearly everyone, as they evaluate what's going on. And as they think about what's happening in the future whether that come down to the interest rate environment, et cetera, cost of housing, a cost of a basket of groceries when they go to the store. So we are seeing that behavior quite broadly, and we called it value-seeking. People are buying larger sizes, they are buying smaller sizes and they are thinking about the trips they take, et cetera. I would say, in particular, we always have our eyes focused on the lower income consumer as they are more pressured. And I -- and to-date, we have stood very well with them. And we tend to do it during times -- tough economic times for low-income consumers because we deliver products at a great value that work really well, and they can't afford to make a mistake in our categories. And so we typically fared-well, and we continue to see that we are doing well with low income consumers. And we haven't seen a material trade to private label that isn't due to the cyber-attack. And of course we are watching that closely as we get our distribution and our merchandising back, but we largely believe private label growth is due to the fact that we weren't on the shelf. And we are seeing Q3 their share was lower than it was in Q2. We are seeing all the right indicators our households are coming back that might have tried private label during that time when we were off the shelf. So we're watching all income tiers always focused on low income, but that was a very general comment to say that all consumers are under more pressure and are certainly evaluating their behaviors and how they are spending their wallet. And then when it comes to our spending plans, we had always anticipated that we would return to pre-pandemic merchandising levels before we even saw a more stressed consumer. Because we just thought that was the right level of spending to ensure we were introducing people to new innovation making sure that we are capturing new behaviors in times where consumers are open to that. For example, when they send their kids back to school or when they send the kids to college. And so we'd always anticipated that, and that -- this promo though does also support our return to share growth and our return from a distribution perspective. So we like that it works doubly hard for us. But I wouldn't say, we are doing this because of our recovery from cyber. We just always anticipated that this merchandising level of return. And then from an advertising and sales promotion level, we did increase that this year because we saw a pressured consumer and wanted to make sure that we were communicating our superior value, et cetera. But these are all within the range of normal spending for us in a given year. We typically spend around 10% in advertising and sales promotion. It will be closer to 11% this year, and we are returning to a level of reduced revenue spending that we've had in the past. So, we don't see any need to go further or deeper than that. We feel like we have the right level. But this really is about more normal course of business than it is that we're seeing consumer behaviors that we need to react to.\nAnna Lizzul: Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Javier Escalante of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nJavier Escalante: Good afternoon everyone and thank you for the question. I actually have two. One is if you could -- on the commentary when it comes to market share and household penetration, it feels as if you are referring always back to the cyber-attack. But if I understand the trajectory correctly, there was also market share losses relative to say pre-pandemic because of the supply chain issues that you mentioned. So if you can comment on that -- whether the intent is to restore market share to pre-pandemic levels in these highly contested categories like pet litters and trash bags? And then I have a follow-up.\nLinda Rendle: Sure, Javier. I mean it has certainly been a complex last few years and lots of puts and takes. And so what I would comment on is we intend to grow market share. That is our mid- to long-term goal, and that is the bar we hold for ourselves to say if we are winning with the consumer or not. Clearly, given the cyber-attack, we have not grown market share this year, but we're seeing the trend move in the right place. So for perspective, we lost about 5 points of share, nearly one-third of our market share during the low point from a cyber perspective. And we are back down -- we ended the quarter down about [0.75] (ph). We've made progress since there if you look at the weekly data. But what we first need to do is restore market share and then grow from there, and we believe we have the right plans to do that. If you look at many of our businesses, they are variable versus the market share they had in the past. But in aggregate, we mostly returned and some businesses were higher, for example, on our cleaning business. We made significant progress on market share, even though we had COVID and then, of course, multiple rounds of pricing. And our brands have held up really well. So my evaluation would be heading into the cyber that we were in the right place from a market share. We had plans to grow market share. Cyber has unfortunately caused another place where we took a step back, and we have to rebuild, but I'm confident in our ability to return and then we're working on plans in fiscal year '25 and beyond to deliver that market share growth we aspire to.\nJavier Escalante: Thank you. And then the follow-up, and it's a little bit in the line of Chris' question. It seems -- rarely you are seeing consumer businesses, and it could be accounting that you have negative pricing and negative volumes at the same time in the quarter. So what gives you confidence that you didn't take too much pricing and the value players are gaining share in trash bags and pet litter and I believe most recently in Glad that you don't need to reset prices into 2025.\nLinda Rendle: Yes. I would say, first of all there is a price mix in a trade component of Q3, and certainly, Kevin can walk through that in more detail. But if I just take step back and say, what were the dynamics in Q3 that give us confidence and what were the dynamics that negatively impacted us? It's pretty clear. We weren't able to fully supply on a couple of those businesses that you mentioned, Glad and Litter in particular. And that means we weren't fully available for the consumer, which we don't like. But the good news is, as I've said, we recovered that ability to supply by the end of Q3, and we feel good heading into Q4. And also, there were more competitive dynamics, given that fact that we couldn't fully supply. We saw more merchandising from competitors, et cetera. As it specifically relates to private label, if you look -- there was a stressed consumer prior to the cyber event, and we didn't have any material loss to private label and share during that time, nor have we, in any recessionary time lost any material share to private label. We offer brands with great value. We offer innovation, the consumer trust us, they love our products. They love our brands, and we spend behind those brands to ensure that they understand the superior value we deliver. And we see that beginning to take hold and work in Q3, as we restore distribution and inventories. We saw private label share come down versus Q2 and heading in the right direction back to what we would expect it to be in a more normalized environment. We expect to continue to make progress as we restore distribution in Q4. So I think it would be pretty understandable to say -- when you are not fully on the shelf and you don't have all your distribution, a consumer is going to choose what's on the shelf, and they did. And -- but we feel confident in our brands, confident in our spending plans that we'll restore that back. And history would tell us when we were out of stock in COVID that happens. When we've had product issues where we're out of shelf on time sell, we came back. We restored our share in distribution. We have a long history of doing this, and I remain confident in our ability to do it in Q4 and beyond.\nJavier Escalante: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Filippo Falorni of Citigroup. Your line is open.\nFilippo Falorni: Hi, good afternoon guys. I first wanted to ask on the recovery from a shelf space standpoint. In prior earnings call, you sounded very confident that you're going to recover the full of the TDP that you still haven't recovered the distribution points. Is that still the expectation and in the quarter, and in the year, I mean? And was the weakness in the quarter? Like does that change a bit the full year expectation versus what you had expected, particularly for Glad and for the Cat Litter business? Thank you.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks, Filippo. We fully expect to recover in Q4, the distribution against our plan that we had fiscal year '24 that we lost. We view that as temporary. And we have seen the shelf decisions from retailers. They are now in the process of converting their sets. As we speak in some of our categories and some will happen throughout the quarter. So we have strong confidence that we will restore that distribution. And that really was not the Q3 story because we always knew most of that distribution would come back in Q4. That's really more of a supply and service level issue story in Q3. And again, we have fully recovered from that, and we are heading into Q4 in a great place. We're able to fully supply that distribution that we will recover. I'd also just note, I did a recent roadshow with all of our top retailers. And they want our business pack on shelf-two. We are the brand that leads their categories. They're very invested and growing with us. Our conversations we're focused on growing, moving forward, our innovation plans, what we want to do to unlock our joint digital plans now that we're well underway on our digital transformation, now that we know 100 million consumers, how can we personalize better to them. The conversations were very growth-oriented, future focused and they're looking forward to having our full distribution back as well so that we can grow their categories.\nFilippo Falorni: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe, Linda, just a longer-term question. I remember when you updated your long-term outlook to 3% to 5% from 2% to 4%, a component of that higher outlook was the international business. Obviously, you made the decision to divest Argentina. So maybe you can review what's left in the international business and how that contributes to your long-term target?\nLinda Rendle: Sure. You are absolutely right that we talked about international being a portion of that growth. And if you look at the performance of our International over the last couple of years, it certainly has played a role where it's growing faster. But we also talked about having a more consistent less volatile business. And Argentina was a high source of volatility and variability. And certainly, you saw the FX impact play out, and you heard Kevin talk about what we expect moving forward. So that was definitely on our minds to reduce the volatility and variability that we had and then be able to grow from a very solid base. And you might recall from a few years ago, we had purchased the majority ownership of a JV partnership we have in the Middle East, was a good example of looking at markets that we could grow faster in that were more stable and predictable and that has played out very well. We continue to have a really healthy consumer there. Innovation is working well in that marketplace. And so what I\u2019d say is, it's very consistent with what we've said before. We have continued business in Latin America that we feel good about, and we'll continue to grow business in Asia, Europe, the Middle East. And we continue to have growth pockets on businesses like Litter, et cetera, our cleaning business, which is the majority of our business is international and we continue to expect international to be a strong contributor, but it will be much more profitable and stable versus what it was before.\nFilippo Falorni: Great. Thank you.\nLinda Rendle: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Your line is open.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Just a couple of things. So first was just in the release you specifically called out that part of the increase in the gross margin outlook was a more favorable outlook for raw material cost or for input. So just curious on a little bit of color there. And then secondly was thinking about Argentina, I know we are not going to do business planning guidance for '25. But just thinking about when you lap Argentina, like Argentina FX is such a huge impact, for example, on gross margins even this quarter, last quarter. Do we like reverse that? Or is it just the impact disappear because the business is gone. I'm just kind of thinking ahead. Again, not about the totality of gross margin, but just how to think about the absence of Argentina moving forward and the margin impact on the business.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, Lauren, happy to take those. As it relates to gross margins \u2013 I\u2019m going to start there and kind of what we're seeing from a cost perspective. We are seeing costs continue to moderate, I think as you saw in Q3, is a fairly small impact, particularly if you look at commodities, we are seeing some commodities become deflationary. You see that a bit in soybean oil, which is something we use in our food business. You're seeing it in other categories, substrates, some chemicals. We are seeing still some cost increases, particularly on petroleum-based products, solvents, diesel. Resins up just a little bit. That's more supply-demand driven more than input costs. And so I'd say, it is definitely going in the right direction. It is a fairly modest hit for us in Q3, and that's certainly been an ongoing improvement. I would say, on the other piece of inflation, which is more wage driven, it's generally playing out as we expected. That tends to show up in manufacturing and warehousing. We're still seeing ongoing inflation there. But on the commodity front, it is certainly easing and as we step out of Argentina, which is a source of inflation, I expect it will be fairly benign by the time we get to Q4 on the commodity side, and then we'll continue to deal with the wage inflation. And then [how] (ph) thing about Argentina next year, I think you said exactly right, is -- as we move forward, a number of the areas you talked about, you will not have that impact going forward. So let me give you an example. You highlighted FX this quarter, to your point it was about 180 basis point hit to margin. That was almost entirely Argentina. As I look forward, even starting in Q4, we should have almost no FX hit to gross margin. So you get that benefit. But keep in mind, that will be offset by other areas, things like pricing, but pricing you see in Q3 was primary Argentina, that will also go away. So you'll strip all that out. Ultimately, the net impact of all that is Argentina was a margin-dilutive business for us. So by stepping out of that, all the different lines, when you look at it in totality, our margins will go up as a result of exiting Argentina. But you'll strip out each one of those elements that Argentina drove.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay. And that impact from Argentina from the exit and just going back to it's actually a pretty small business. It is a small net impact when you put all these pieces back together on the year-over-year margin like in this quarter next year for example?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, that's right. I mean you look at the business, it is 2% of sales, and you can probably do the math pretty quickly. It is a very dilutive business to us that when we owned it and represents 2% of our sales. So you can probably do the math, you see there is some modest benefit to our gross margin going forward now is out of the portfolio.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay. Great. And then one thing I just want to clarify. I think I figured out the call in on, but there were two conflicting statements in the release in the prepared remarks about supply chain constraints being a problem in the quarter, but having resumed normal service levels. So I didn't know if it was a timing difference, like normal service levels as you exit the quarter, but constrained by supply chain during the quarter. I just wanted to make sure it's clear on how those two statements fit together.\nLinda Rendle: That's right, Lauren. So we were not able to fully service our retailers throughout Q3 until the end. So at the end of Q3, we restored normal service levels and we entered Q4 with them back to being normalized and that marries with the supply chain comment that we had some constraints, which impacted those service levels throughout the quarter.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay, all right. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Olivia Tong of Raymond James. Your line is open.\nOlivia Tong: Great, thanks. I wanted to ask you two questions around margins. First, on gross margin. Obviously, the EPS outlook for this year is now higher than where you were pre cyber-attack and much of that is due to the gross margin expansion of about 100 basis points ahead of where you thought you were going to be at the beginning of the year. So in the past, you've talked about 200 basis points of gross margin improvement annually, as you recover from the post-COVID decline this year, now [$2.75] (ph). Last year, obviously, a lot more than that, despite all the ups and downs with the cyber-attack. So, can you just talk about ex-Argentina, ex the cyber, all these things, the ability to keep outperforming on gross margin, what you learned from this year last year, what capabilities continue versus some of the one-offs that are helping and hurting this year? Or just sort of the ongoing recovery on gross margin relative to the post-COVID timing? Thanks.\nKevin Jacobsen: Sure, I'll be happy to take that one. As you think about gross margin, and you almost have to separate what we've been doing for the last several years in terms of where I think it's going longer-term. We're still working to recover from the record level of inflation that we've had to absorb. And as I think you know quite well, Olivia, we lost about 800 basis points in gross margin due to this inflationary cycle. And Linda and I both talked quite a bit, we remain committed fully recovering that. To your point, with the work we did last year, the work we're doing this year, we'll get about 650 basis points \u2013 we will recover. We've got more work to do and feel quite confident we'll get there. The process to get there, we were leaning into pricing. We took four rounds of pricing, which is very consistent with what you saw broadly in our industry to recover from this inflation. As we move forward though, now and get back into what I described as we believe a more normalized cost environment, typically, our cost savings efforts is more than enough to cover normal levels of inflation and allows a little bit extra that we can either invest back in the business, take to the bottom-line to further expand EBIT margin. And that's where that long-term goal of 25 basis points to 50 basis points was generated, which is normal level of cost inflation, which for us tends to be about $75 million a year. Our cost savings more than cover that and we use the extra to modestly improve margins each year. That's where we're going. We're not there yet. We're still working on recovering from the inflationary cycle, not was through pricing, but it's certainly moving in the right direction. So we will get back to fully recovering these gross margins over time. And then I expect assuming that the commodity environment gets to a more normalized level, that's how you should expect to see us continue to grow margins over the long term as our margin transformation efforts more than offsetting regular levels of inflation.\nOlivia Tong: Got it. And then just a point of clarification on your call for higher advertising in the second half --. Are you talking about higher as a percentage of sales sequentially or that the year-over-year change in second half is higher than it was in the first half? And how much of that is due to the clear pullback in spend in first half when you had -- you're out of stocks versus just desire to have greater programs, greater opportunity to support some of the innovation? Thanks.\nLinda Rendle: Sure. Olivia, if we wind the clock back to the beginning of the fiscal year, we actually had intended to spend more money in advertising and sales promotion in our original guidance, we said about 11%. And -- we still intend to do that. But you're absolutely right that given the cyber attack, the shape of that over the course of the year has changed. So we spent less in the front half of the year, we are spending more in the back half, still with the intention of spending. What we're seeing now is over 11% of sales. I want to be clear on the dynamics there, though. It is about -- we're spending about the same money we had intended. But given what we've talked about from a sales outlook perspective and Argentina it would put us above 11%. But we're still spending about the same amount of money as we intended to when we first gave that guidance. But again, this was more about supporting our brands as consumers are more challenged. We felt good about our innovation plans and we wanted to spend behind them. And again, just the shape of the year has changed given the cyber event.\nOlivia Tong: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. Ms. Rendle, I would now like to turn the program back to you.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks so much, everyone. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress on our next call. Until then, stay well.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Jacobsen",
            "content": "Hey, Peter. You know, as it relates to the outlook and I think specifically your question, organic sales growth in Q4. What I expect to see occurring this quarter is improving volume trends. If you look at our volume performance, we're down about 7% the front half of the year down 4% in Q3. I expect that to continue to improve as we move forward. I also expect we'll see some increased trade spending. We continue to work back towards a more normalized promotional environment. Q3 was still below sort of that normal level, so I think you would expect to see some increased trade spending. And then as a result of the divestiture of Argentina business, it's gotten a lot simpler. I don't expect any FX headwinds. I don't expect any meaningful pricing now. Most of our pricing was in international -- that would all go away. So you should see improving volume trends, a little bit of uptick in trade spending, and that gets you down to probably flat to down a little bit in terms of organic sales growth in Q4. And that would keep us on track to be up about 1% for the year. Yeah, I think there's a few things. You saw where we landed, Peter, in Q3, a little over 42%. We think we'll be closer to 43% when we exit. You know, as Linda said, we're not prepared to provide our outlook for next year. But I would tell you, we fully expect to continue to expand margins in fiscal year \u201825. So we'll exit this year. You know, over the full year, we're probably up around 42%. And I expect a bill on that next year. Thanks, Peter. Andrea, your question on \u201825 and gross margin, you know, as I'm sure you can appreciate, we're still in the process of building our plans right now for \u201825. But where we're sitting at today, I fully expect we're going to be growing top line, expanding margins, growing earnings. And so as you think about how we grow margin, I think to your specific question, certainly top-line growth helps build margin. Additionally, divestiture of our Argentina business, that was [margin-diluted] (ph) to the company. So, divesting that business certainly helps our margin. And then our margin transformation efforts. We think collectively that more than offsets what we believe will be a level of cost inflation but continue to moderate. So, we do not believe right now we're going to be in a deflationary environment next year. There will be some cost inflation, but it continues to moderate. And the actions I just mentioned we think are more than enough to offset that and allow us to continue to build margin next year. But the exact amount we're still working through. Yeah, we don't break that out, Andrea, specifically. But I can tell you it was significantly below the company average in terms of gross margins. You can probably do some math. It was 2% of sales and well below the company average in terms of gross margin. Yeah, thank you. Sure, Chris. The increase you referred to that is primarily driven by inflation in Argentina, you might recall before we divested that business, we were projecting about 300% inflation, and they had a significant devaluation in December. So that was playing through and it's the biggest driver. To your question, as you go forward now that we divest the business, I would not expect to see Logistics and Manufacturing be that level of a drag. Logistics is turning on us, it's fairly benign in terms of year-over-year cost once you strip out Argentina. So, this is one of the additional benefits of not having that business in our portfolio any longer, given the disruptions it had broadly across the P&L. Hi, Dara, what I'd say it's a little too early for us to talk too specifically about the '25. As I said, we're still developing our plan. Maybe the one item, I would just make sure remind folks is, with the divestiture of Argentina business, that's about 2 points of sales. We'll see a portion of that in Q4, but you'll probably still have about 1.5 point headwind next year as a result of that sale. But for the other items, we're going to wait until August to have that conversation because we're still working through our plans. It'd just be too early to talk any detail. Yes, Lauren, happy to take those. As it relates to gross margins \u2013 I'm going to start there and kind of what we're seeing from a cost perspective. We are seeing costs continue to moderate, I think as you saw in Q3, is a fairly small impact, particularly if you look at commodities, we are seeing some commodities become deflationary. You see that a bit in soybean oil, which is something we use in our food business. You're seeing it in other categories, substrates, some chemicals. We are seeing still some cost increases, particularly on petroleum-based products, solvents, diesel. Resins up just a little bit. That's more supply-demand driven more than input costs. And so I'd say, it is definitely going in the right direction. It is a fairly modest hit for us in Q3, and that's certainly been an ongoing improvement. I would say, on the other piece of inflation, which is more wage driven, it's generally playing out as we expected. That tends to show up in manufacturing and warehousing. We're still seeing ongoing inflation there. But on the commodity front, it is certainly easing and as we step out of Argentina, which is a source of inflation, I expect it will be fairly benign by the time we get to Q4 on the commodity side, and then we'll continue to deal with the wage inflation. And then [how] (ph) thing about Argentina next year, I think you said exactly right, is -- as we move forward, a number of the areas you talked about, you will not have that impact going forward. So let me give you an example. You highlighted FX this quarter, to your point it was about 180 basis point hit to margin. That was almost entirely Argentina. As I look forward, even starting in Q4, we should have almost no FX hit to gross margin. So you get that benefit. But keep in mind, that will be offset by other areas, things like pricing, but pricing you see in Q3 was primary Argentina, that will also go away. So you'll strip all that out. Ultimately, the net impact of all that is Argentina was a margin-dilutive business for us. So by stepping out of that, all the different lines, when you look at it in totality, our margins will go up as a result of exiting Argentina. But you'll strip out each one of those elements that Argentina drove. Yes, that's right. I mean you look at the business, it is 2% of sales, and you can probably do the math pretty quickly. It is a very dilutive business to us that when we owned it and represents 2% of our sales. So you can probably do the math, you see there is some modest benefit to our gross margin going forward now is out of the portfolio. Sure, I'll be happy to take that one. As you think about gross margin, and you almost have to separate what we've been doing for the last several years in terms of where I think it's going longer-term. We're still working to recover from the record level of inflation that we've had to absorb. And as I think you know quite well, Olivia, we lost about 800 basis points in gross margin due to this inflationary cycle. And Linda and I both talked quite a bit, we remain committed fully recovering that. To your point, with the work we did last year, the work we're doing this year, we'll get about 650 basis points \u2013 we will recover. We've got more work to do and feel quite confident we'll get there. The process to get there, we were leaning into pricing. We took four rounds of pricing, which is very consistent with what you saw broadly in our industry to recover from this inflation. As we move forward though, now and get back into what I described as we believe a more normalized cost environment, typically, our cost savings efforts is more than enough to cover normal levels of inflation and allows a little bit extra that we can either invest back in the business, take to the bottom-line to further expand EBIT margin. And that's where that long-term goal of 25 basis points to 50 basis points was generated, which is normal level of cost inflation, which for us tends to be about $75 million a year. Our cost savings more than cover that and we use the extra to modestly improve margins each year. That's where we're going. We're not there yet. We're still working on recovering from the inflationary cycle, not was through pricing, but it's certainly moving in the right direction. So we will get back to fully recovering these gross margins over time. And then I expect assuming that the commodity environment gets to a more normalized level, that's how you should expect to see us continue to grow margins over the long term as our margin transformation efforts more than offsetting regular levels of inflation."

            "name": "Linda Rendle",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us today. During the third quarter, we continued to progress our recovery from the August cyber-attack while advancing our Ignite strategy to build a stronger, more resilient company. For the most part, our progress in the third quarter was in-line with our expectations. Sales came in lower, as a few businesses experienced slower supply recovery than we planned. Gross margin came in higher, benefiting from our margin transformation program and a [modernized environment] (ph). Despite lower sales and strong investments in our brands, we finished the quarter ahead of our expectations on adjusted earnings per share. Before we turn to questions, I think stepping back and putting these results in context is important. Given the magnitude of disruption from the cyber-attack, we knew our plans to restore the fundamentals of our business would be complex, and a recovery path would not be linear. We have made tremendous progress and are laser-focused on finishing the job. We tracked well ahead of our expectations in the second quarter and knew we had more work to do as we entered the back half of the year to return our business to the strong trajectory it was on at the start of fiscal year 2024. This included fully rebuilding inventories, restoring normalized service levels, and rebuilding commercial plans for each of our businesses, which we accomplished by the end of the third quarter. These actions unlock our ability to fully restore lost distribution due to the cyber-attack and return to normalized merchandising levels as planned in the fourth quarter. Through Q3, we have regained nearly 90% of the market share we lost and expect to make further progress in Q4. With service levels now normalized and strong investment levels behind our brands, we're confident we can rebuild household penetration and return to volume growth over time. Despite the significant disruption and lost sales we've experienced and based on our team's strong work, we are now positioned to exceed our original gross margin target and meet or exceed our adjusted EPS guidance we provided at the beginning of the year before the cyber-attack. Importantly, our recovery progress to date puts us in a good position to exit fiscal 2024 with strong fundamentals. In addition, we continue to execute well against our IGNITE strategic priorities throughout our recovery. We made substantial progress rebuilding gross margins, continuing to target returning to pre-pandemic levels over time. We launched innovation invested in our brands and capabilities, progressed our streamlined operating model and digital transformation, and completed the divestiture of our Argentina business, which supports our goal of evolving our portfolio to deliver more consistent and profitable growth. In closing, we're taking the right steps to navigate the near-term and continuing to advance our IGNITE strategy. I'm confident we have the right investments and plans to deliver against our strategic and financial objectives and enhance long-term shareholder value. With that, Kevin and I will take your questions. Thanks, Peter. Why don't I get us started and I'll just talk about some of the dynamics that we expect in the fourth quarter. And then I'll hand it to Kevin, and he can talk about the outlook. And of course, you'll appreciate we're not setting guidance for fiscal year \u201825 at this point, but Kevin can certainly give you how we're thinking about the exit. So as it comes to Q4, there are a number of dynamics and things that are important that we plan to do and have the right plans to address. And the first is what you mentioned. We intend to fully restore the temporary distribution we lost as a result of the cyber-attack. And we are well on track to do that. At this point, we know the decisions on the shelf resets from all of our major retailers. We built the inventory in order to supply those distribution losses and are on track to restore that distribution. So certainly, that will help both reported and organic sales as we head into the fourth quarter. The second dynamic is now that we have fully restored our ability to supply and are back to normalized service levels, we are going to return to our merchandising plans, which, if you recall from our earlier conversations, we expect to be higher than they were during the pandemic, basically returning to pre-pandemic levels. And that is on track as well for the fourth quarter, and both of those will support growth. The thing I would mention, And as you can see, the implied range is rather large. And that's because it's still quite variable and volatile what we're dealing with. We're dealing with a complex recovery. shelf resets are all at different times for our retailers. How fast those resets happen. And then, of course, where we are on the purchase cycle with consumers will matter, and that's informing the depth and breadth of that range. But I'll hand that over to Kevin and he can help you think about just how that plays out in the outlook. Sure. All right, I'll get started with that first question. And I think the question was twofold. So I'll start first maybe addressing the areas on supply that we called out that impacted sales for the quarter. And then I'll talk a bit more about the consumer and the confidence that we have about where we are and that we have the right plans in place as we roll into Q4 to continue to accomplish what we intend to do around the consumer and restore our business fundamentals. So in supply recovery, we talked about the last call and actually the call before that we had a couple of businesses that were more challenged given the depth of their portfolio. And that was Glad, and we called out Litter as well. And those continued to be a challenge a bit longer in the quarter than we had originally anticipated at the time of forecast. The good news is that with a few other minor things in businesses, we were able to fully fix all of those by the end of the quarter, and we exited Q3 getting back to normalized service levels to our customers. And so feel good that as we head into Q4, we have the right inventory and we have the right production plans and plans with our retailers to be able to get back all of those distribution points that we lost temporarily and, again, restore merchandising. So again, that was a temporary thing in nature, impacted Q3, but we don't anticipate that it will impact Q4. If you look at the consumer, a few things going on. First, our distribution points are still down versus pre-cyber, which we had anticipated. And we knew that the majority of shelf resets would happen in Q4. That is still going as planned and we expect to fully regain that distribution that we anticipated having at the beginning of the year when we set our original outlook. So on track there. And then I would say we're starting to see the share turnarounds. We've recovered nearly 90% of our share loss. And actually, if you even look at the last few weeks, you've continued to see that trend improve. And in addition, we're rebuilding households. So our households in Q3 are still down versus pre-cyber, which we expected, but improving and moving in the right direction. And if you think about it, we really only had from when we fully restored inventories, and again, haven't fully restored distribution, that's basically one purchase cycle for the consumer in our categories. Purchase cycle is about 90 days. So we've had one chance to influence as that consumer comes back to the shelf, and we're not fully restored yet. What we're laser focused on in Q4, and this is why we have the investment levels that we do, where we've increased our spending on advertising and sales promotion, as well as reduced revenue, ensuring that we have the right spending that in this next purchase cycle, that we can recapture that consumer. We intend to do as much of that as we can in Q4, and we're hoping to get the majority of it done. We're very confident in distribution, very confident in the merchandising, and now we're just watching as the consumer comes back to a fully-stocked shelf. What is their behavior, and do we need to make any tweaks as we head into the beginning of fiscal year \u201825, but feel very good about where we are in restoring the fundamentals and very good that we're beginning to see the consumer come back that we lost during that time. Hi, Chris. Yes, Chris, we -- from all the data that we see, the progress we've made with the consumer and what we anticipate will happen here in Q4, we do not feel like we have a dynamic that the sales miss was due to a consumer issue that we have or not bouncing back to that degree with the household penetration we lost. This was simply we had two very complex businesses, we thought we would make more progress on supply than we did. It went longer, it went through the remainder of the quarter when we thought we would get it done mid-quarter. That impacted our ability really to supply for merchandising mostly. Distribution, we always knew would come back in the fourth quarter because that's when retailers reset their shelves. So the good news is because we were able to fully restore supply by the end of the quarter, we're still on track to recover that distribution. But this really was heightened competition as we weren't able to supply merchandising events and still not in a place where we were fully able to supply on those couple of businesses. But we're through that, we got through that at the end of Q3. We have the ability now to fully supply in Q4. That investment level, we feel is the right investment level. And I'll just be clear, we have not constrained our businesses. We have said they should spend what they need to -- to get these households back. That is contemplated in the outlook that we provided and we believe we have the right spending on both advertising and [self-promotion] (ph) and merchandising. And if we have to make adjustments as we go through the quarter, we will. But right now, we feel like we have the right plans, we are seeing those households come back. Again, we went through one purchase cycle. We're going through another one here in Q4, but all indicators are that we will restore our business. And we feel like the fundamentals will be fully recovered by the end of Q4 and set us up well as we head into fiscal year '25. Sure, Dara. Without obviously, again providing any guidance for 2025 or beyond on specifics. I think I can say with really strong confidence, one based on the track records, if you look, we've delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion behind this toolkit that we have. And what we talked about at CAGNY is important. Pricing and cost savings have been the majority of the tools that we've had, and we put them to good use over the last couple of years as we've dealt with inflation. But we knew that we wanted to take a broader look and the fact that we are implementing a digital transformation, and we have more visibility end-to-end, gave us a great opportunity to look and see where else can we go beyond traditional cost savings. Revenue growth management is certainly one of those tools, price pack architecture within that. And the teams all have plans in place to use those tools to continue to make progress against our commitment that we stand behind to return gross margins to pre-pandemic levels and then grow from there. And we feel very confident in our ability to do that. Kevin and I have talked before, it's really dependent on two things. One how fast we implement this toolbox and feel good about that. But second will be what the cost environment looks like. And as what we continue to look forward, we continue to see inflation in people's reporting. Again, we are not providing any specifics around our business at this point. But the pace of recovery and when we returned to pre-pandemic levels will be those two factors, but we feel very good about what's in our control and that we have the right toolbox to be able to accomplish what we set out to do. Thanks Dara. Sure. We're seeing pressure across all consumer groups. And we are seeing behaviors broadly outside of our categories changing for nearly everyone, as they evaluate what's going on. And as they think about what's happening in the future whether that come down to the interest rate environment, et cetera, cost of housing, a cost of a basket of groceries when they go to the store. So we are seeing that behavior quite broadly, and we called it value-seeking. People are buying larger sizes, they are buying smaller sizes and they are thinking about the trips they take, et cetera. I would say, in particular, we always have our eyes focused on the lower income consumer as they are more pressured. And I -- and to-date, we have stood very well with them. And we tend to do it during times -- tough economic times for low-income consumers because we deliver products at a great value that work really well, and they can't afford to make a mistake in our categories. And so we typically fared-well, and we continue to see that we are doing well with low income consumers. And we haven't seen a material trade to private label that isn't due to the cyber-attack. And of course we are watching that closely as we get our distribution and our merchandising back, but we largely believe private label growth is due to the fact that we weren't on the shelf. And we are seeing Q3 their share was lower than it was in Q2. We are seeing all the right indicators our households are coming back that might have tried private label during that time when we were off the shelf. So we're watching all income tiers always focused on low income, but that was a very general comment to say that all consumers are under more pressure and are certainly evaluating their behaviors and how they are spending their wallet. And then when it comes to our spending plans, we had always anticipated that we would return to pre-pandemic merchandising levels before we even saw a more stressed consumer. Because we just thought that was the right level of spending to ensure we were introducing people to new innovation making sure that we are capturing new behaviors in times where consumers are open to that. For example, when they send their kids back to school or when they send the kids to college. And so we'd always anticipated that, and that -- this promo though does also support our return to share growth and our return from a distribution perspective. So we like that it works doubly hard for us. But I wouldn't say, we are doing this because of our recovery from cyber. We just always anticipated that this merchandising level of return. And then from an advertising and sales promotion level, we did increase that this year because we saw a pressured consumer and wanted to make sure that we were communicating our superior value, et cetera. But these are all within the range of normal spending for us in a given year. We typically spend around 10% in advertising and sales promotion. It will be closer to 11% this year, and we are returning to a level of reduced revenue spending that we've had in the past. So, we don't see any need to go further or deeper than that. We feel like we have the right level. But this really is about more normal course of business than it is that we're seeing consumer behaviors that we need to react to. Sure, Javier. I mean it has certainly been a complex last few years and lots of puts and takes. And so what I would comment on is we intend to grow market share. That is our mid- to long-term goal, and that is the bar we hold for ourselves to say if we are winning with the consumer or not. Clearly, given the cyber-attack, we have not grown market share this year, but we're seeing the trend move in the right place. So for perspective, we lost about 5 points of share, nearly one-third of our market share during the low point from a cyber perspective. And we are back down -- we ended the quarter down about [0.75] (ph). We've made progress since there if you look at the weekly data. But what we first need to do is restore market share and then grow from there, and we believe we have the right plans to do that. If you look at many of our businesses, they are variable versus the market share they had in the past. But in aggregate, we mostly returned and some businesses were higher, for example, on our cleaning business. We made significant progress on market share, even though we had COVID and then, of course, multiple rounds of pricing. And our brands have held up really well. So my evaluation would be heading into the cyber that we were in the right place from a market share. We had plans to grow market share. Cyber has unfortunately caused another place where we took a step back, and we have to rebuild, but I'm confident in our ability to return and then we're working on plans in fiscal year '25 and beyond to deliver that market share growth we aspire to. Yes. I would say, first of all there is a price mix in a trade component of Q3, and certainly, Kevin can walk through that in more detail. But if I just take step back and say, what were the dynamics in Q3 that give us confidence and what were the dynamics that negatively impacted us? It's pretty clear. We weren't able to fully supply on a couple of those businesses that you mentioned, Glad and Litter in particular. And that means we weren't fully available for the consumer, which we don't like. But the good news is, as I've said, we recovered that ability to supply by the end of Q3, and we feel good heading into Q4. And also, there were more competitive dynamics, given that fact that we couldn't fully supply. We saw more merchandising from competitors, et cetera. As it specifically relates to private label, if you look -- there was a stressed consumer prior to the cyber event, and we didn't have any material loss to private label and share during that time, nor have we, in any recessionary time lost any material share to private label. We offer brands with great value. We offer innovation, the consumer trust us, they love our products. They love our brands, and we spend behind those brands to ensure that they understand the superior value we deliver. And we see that beginning to take hold and work in Q3, as we restore distribution and inventories. We saw private label share come down versus Q2 and heading in the right direction back to what we would expect it to be in a more normalized environment. We expect to continue to make progress as we restore distribution in Q4. So I think it would be pretty understandable to say -- when you are not fully on the shelf and you don't have all your distribution, a consumer is going to choose what's on the shelf, and they did. And -- but we feel confident in our brands, confident in our spending plans that we'll restore that back. And history would tell us when we were out of stock in COVID that happens. When we've had product issues where we're out of shelf on time sell, we came back. We restored our share in distribution. We have a long history of doing this, and I remain confident in our ability to do it in Q4 and beyond. Thanks, Filippo. We fully expect to recover in Q4, the distribution against our plan that we had fiscal year '24 that we lost. We view that as temporary. And we have seen the shelf decisions from retailers. They are now in the process of converting their sets. As we speak in some of our categories and some will happen throughout the quarter. So we have strong confidence that we will restore that distribution. And that really was not the Q3 story because we always knew most of that distribution would come back in Q4. That's really more of a supply and service level issue story in Q3. And again, we have fully recovered from that, and we are heading into Q4 in a great place. We're able to fully supply that distribution that we will recover. I'd also just note, I did a recent roadshow with all of our top retailers. And they want our business pack on shelf-two. We are the brand that leads their categories. They're very invested and growing with us. Our conversations we're focused on growing, moving forward, our innovation plans, what we want to do to unlock our joint digital plans now that we're well underway on our digital transformation, now that we know 100 million consumers, how can we personalize better to them. The conversations were very growth-oriented, future focused and they're looking forward to having our full distribution back as well so that we can grow their categories. Sure. You are absolutely right that we talked about international being a portion of that growth. And if you look at the performance of our International over the last couple of years, it certainly has played a role where it's growing faster. But we also talked about having a more consistent less volatile business. And Argentina was a high source of volatility and variability. And certainly, you saw the FX impact play out, and you heard Kevin talk about what we expect moving forward. So that was definitely on our minds to reduce the volatility and variability that we had and then be able to grow from a very solid base. And you might recall from a few years ago, we had purchased the majority ownership of a JV partnership we have in the Middle East, was a good example of looking at markets that we could grow faster in that were more stable and predictable and that has played out very well. We continue to have a really healthy consumer there. Innovation is working well in that marketplace. And so what I'd say is, it's very consistent with what we've said before. We have continued business in Latin America that we feel good about, and we'll continue to grow business in Asia, Europe, the Middle East. And we continue to have growth pockets on businesses like Litter, et cetera, our cleaning business, which is the majority of our business is international and we continue to expect international to be a strong contributor, but it will be much more profitable and stable versus what it was before. Thank you. That's right, Lauren. So we were not able to fully service our retailers throughout Q3 until the end. So at the end of Q3, we restored normal service levels and we entered Q4 with them back to being normalized and that marries with the supply chain comment that we had some constraints, which impacted those service levels throughout the quarter. Sure. Olivia, if we wind the clock back to the beginning of the fiscal year, we actually had intended to spend more money in advertising and sales promotion in our original guidance, we said about 11%. And -- we still intend to do that. But you're absolutely right that given the cyber attack, the shape of that over the course of the year has changed. So we spent less in the front half of the year, we are spending more in the back half, still with the intention of spending. What we're seeing now is over 11% of sales. I want to be clear on the dynamics there, though. It is about -- we're spending about the same money we had intended. But given what we've talked about from a sales outlook perspective and Argentina it would put us above 11%. But we're still spending about the same amount of money as we intended to when we first gave that guidance. But again, this was more about supporting our brands as consumers are more challenged. We felt good about our innovation plans and we wanted to spend behind them. And again, just the shape of the year has changed given the cyber event. Thanks so much, everyone. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress on our next call. Until then, stay well."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference.\nLisah Burhan: Thank you, Jen. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Linda Rendle, our Chair and CEO, and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. I hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website. In just a moment, Linda will share a few opening comments and then we'll take your questions. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements including about our fiscal 2024 outlook. These statements are based on management's current expectations, but may differ from actual results or outcomes. In addition, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section which identifies various factors that could affect such forward-looking statements, which has been filed with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the non-GAAP financial information section of our earnings release and the supplemental financial schedules in the Investor Relations section of our website for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly-comparable GAAP measures. Now, I'll turn it over to Linda.\nLinda Rendle: Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We delivered financial results above our expectations in the second quarter, thanks to very strong progress on our recovery from the August cyberattack, continued advancement of our strategies to drive top-line growth and rebuild margin, as well as the swift and effective management of currency headwinds in Argentina. We are rebuilding retailer inventories ahead of schedule, enabling us to return to merchandising and restore distribution. As a result, we made great strides rebuilding market shares. Importantly, throughout our out-of-stock period and recovery, we've maintained our strong brand superiority results as measured by our consumer value metric. This speaks to the power of our advantaged portfolio, the superior value of our brands and their role in consumers' daily lives. While there is still more work to do, we're on the right path to return our business to the trajectory it was on before the cyberattack. Looking ahead, we expect the operating environment to remain challenging, as consumers remain under pressure and their value-seeking behaviors continue. Nevertheless, we remain committed to growing the top line and rebuilding margins and expect volume to play a stronger role in our top line performance as we lap pricing. We're well-positioned to make further progress in rebuilding distribution and market shares, as well as drive volume and household penetration growth over time through strong demand creation plans. Given the progress we've made in the second quarter, we are also updating our full year 2024 outlook. We have a strong diverse portfolio of trusted brands, we play in essential categories and we're making the right investments guided by our IGNITE strategy to create long-term value for stakeholders. I'm confident that we're taking the appropriate actions to build a stronger, more resilient Company that is positioned to win in the marketplace, and deliver consistent, profitable growth over time. With that, Kevin and I will take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you, Ms. Rendle. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan Chase.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good afternoon there . Linda and Kevin, I just wanted to go back, obviously, an amazing performance you caught up with I think with the second quarter fiscal you caught up with kind of according to my math a minus 2%, pretty much first half against first half of the prior year. And then what are you implying given the Argentine peso depreciation is underlying beta as you put in prepared remarks and your commented it just now but then you have a greater FX headwind. But when you go and flow through everything and according to the new guidance the plus 200 basis points improvement in gross margin. It implies that your gross margin in the back end declines vis-a-vis what you had in the back end of last year. And so I was just trying to reconcile, because your numbers kind of imply profitability going down, the way I understand the transactional FX. But it seems a bit high. If you can kind of walk us through why would that happen given the beats the magnitude of the beats?\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah, Andrea. And maybe let me take a stab at answering some of those questions, and let me know if we missed anything. But as it relates, maybe I'll just start with Argentina might be a good place to start. Because you've heard from many of our peers that's an incredibly difficult environment right now. I think if you just step back and think about our business in Argentina, we've been in there for a very long time, we have very capable leaders managing very strong brands. While there are some negative impact in Argentina flowing through our outlook we provided today, both on the top line in terms of higher FX as well as higher inflation and FX exposure and margin. What you should know is, based on the actions we've taken in Argentina, including incremental pricing, we think we fully cover the negative impacts of Argentina within this outlook with the one exception of the remeasurement loss and I'm happy to talk about that, but setting that remeasurement loss aside, we think we fully contain the Argentina impact in this P&L. As it relates to the back half, you were asking about gross margin, and as you saw, we delivered about 41.5% gross margin in the front half. And if you look at the back half, based on the outlook, it suggests will be fairly similar 41.5% as well. And so we're looking at sequentially fairly consistent trends. If I think about what's changing from the front half to the back half, there's a few items I'd point out. In terms of increased headwinds, we continue to expect higher trade spending in the back half of the year, as we get to a more normalized environment. We also now have lapped all our US pricing. We lapped the last round of pricing in December. So you'll see less benefit from pricing in the US. And then we're expecting more inflation and more FX headwinds coming out of Argentina. We are offsetting that with incremental pricing, we're executing in Argentina, so you'll see international price mix benefits in the back half of the year to a greater degree than the front half of the year, as well as we're projecting improving volumes trend. And so collectively that's offsetting those headwinds, and we're getting to a margin fairly consistent front half versus back half and that puts us in a position to improve margins by 200 basis points on a full year basis. Now, I think maybe the last question you talked about versus prior year, I think you have to be a little careful looking at the comps. If you look at our gross margins in the back half of last year, I think they're up almost 600 basis points. And so we're relatively flat, but on a very strong performance in the prior year. Well, let me stop there. Andrea, let me know if that answered your question.\nAndrea Teixeira: Yeah, that did Kevin. Thank you. And I think one of the kind of like a fine point on that commentary. When you say, in the prepared remarks, I think Linda had mentioned you're confident to regain shelf space and you're looking obviously regained service levels. It sounds to and even in our meeting recently in New York, you kind of alluded to initially that guidance and I think we all in this call appreciated there was a lot of moving pieces and you're conservative. It seems like you're embedding some potential risk at that point of not being able to recover the service levels, now you did recover. So I'm more in the side of like thinking of the strength of what you achieved in six months. I'm thinking more, why not expecting that momentum to continue now, that you potentially could recover some of the shelf space losses that you had, especially now coming up on the spring reset.\nLinda Rendle: Sure, I'll take that and maybe I'll just start with your first important point, which was our expectations in Q2, and what drove the significant over delivery. If you recall, you got it exactly right. At the point where we provided an outlook for Q2, we were at a point where we had just turned back to automated order processing and we knew there'd be a transition time going from manual to automated and that would take us a bit of time to ramp up. We're also heading into key holiday time for retailers, which is a challenging time to ensure that we get the ability to have appointments and ensure that we could deliver what we needed to, in order to deliver what we ended up doing for the quarter, which was every single day shipping significantly above an average day that we would normally ship. And we I think were appropriately cautious given all of those potential headwinds on what we could accomplish. And again, the goal was to restore inventories by the end, the majority by the end of Q2, knowing some of that would flow into Q3 and Q4. So what happened in Q2, we were able to get all of that ramp up and we really leaned into our operating model. We designated a General Manager, who is in-charge of solely getting inventories rebuilt and retailers. And she had a multi-functional team around her to do that. And we were able to quickly ramp up from manual to automated and ship nearly every single day significantly above an average shipping day pre-cyber event, and our retailers were extraordinary. So we were able to get in, we were able to get appointments and the result of that, if you look at distribution, we were down over 30% of our TDP. If you look at average weekly TDPs down over 30% at the height of our out-of-stocks. We've gotten back to mid-single-digits, some business is slightly better than that, some slightly worse, and I can cover that. Market shares at the height of this, we were down over five points. If you look at the four, five weeks ending December, we were down a point. Look at the latest four, five weeks ending January 21st down 0.7, so all that flowed in the right direction, which gives us confidence. But that speaks to with the work we have remaining and we talked about this last quarter. We spoke about the fact that a lot of this was under our control and we were going to maximize that I felt good about what we did in Q2. But we're also dealing with the fact that in order to fully restore distribution, we need to have retailer resets, and those happen mainly in the spring and they vary through the back half of our year. And we intend to finish the job, then. And in addition to that we have to fully restore merchandising. So as we get our business up to the service levels we expect, and to be clear, our service levels are still depressed. They are significantly better. But we need to fully restore those. We'll return to merchandising in the back half and full as well. And with that, we feel good about our plans, we feel like we have the right investment levels. Our brands have maintained their superior value as I said in my opening comments, so feel good about it. But I just want to be clear, we didn't -- the job not done in Q2, tremendous progress, but we have more work to do in the back half.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Peter Grom with UBS.\nPeter Grom: Thanks, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. So I wanted to ask on the organic revenue growth trajectory. Can you maybe just help us understand how you are thinking about volume versus price in the back half of the year. Linda, you mentioned you expect volume to be a stronger contributor to your performance, does that assume a return to growth or just kind of less of a drag versus what we've seen prior to the disruption. And then just on the pricing as well, particularly as you now lapped the US pricing but are taking incremental pricing related to Argentina. Thanks.\nKevin Jacobsen: Sure. Hi, Peter. As it relates to organic sales growth and transitioning from the front half to the back half, you have to think about what the changes are, as it relates to volume, we expect to see improving volume trends in the back half of the year. That's a combination of both continue to recover from a cyber-event as well as now that we've lapped pricing, we'd expect to see improving volume. If you look at the front half, our volume was down high single-digits and so we would certainly expect to see those improving volume trends as we go forward. And then in addition to price mix we've now as I said lapped our US pricing in December, the last of the four rounds we took. And so US will be contributing much less, in fact very little impact to favorable price mix. But we have now leaned into Argentina in November and December we took double-digit price increases both months. And so you will still continue to see positive price mix in the back half of the year in-spite of increased trade spending. So I'd say overall improving volume trends from the front half of the year. Price-mix being a little lower than the front half because we've lapped US pricing, but still fairly strong for us, and that's how we get to an expectation that we'll be growing for the full year low-single digits, and that means the back half would be a bit stronger than where we land in the front half in terms of organic sales growth.\nPeter Grom: Got it. And that's really helpful . And then I guess just, Kevin on the 42% exit rate, I think, I may be reading too much into this, but are you simply just trying to provide some color on the second half phasing, or are you trying to signal how we should be thinking about the gross margin recapture opportunity looking out to fiscal '25.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, it's more about phasing in the back half. Just want to make sure we're highlighting folks for that all that pricing in Argentina to take effect, it will probably be the fourth quarter or it's fully in market. So I'd I expect my fourth quarter gross margin to be a bit stronger than third quarter. But having said that, as you know, Peter, Linda and I remain committed to rebuilding gross margins back to the level we had before the, what I described as you know the super cycle of inflation. Good progress last year. We intend to make more progress this year, but the work is not done. And I fully expect going into '25, we'll continue to expand margins. But importantly we'll do that while we continue to invest to grow the top line and continue to advance our strategic initiatives. So we continue to focus on all three. But as it relates to margin I expect to make solid progress this year and I expect that to continue as we go into '25.\nPeter Grom: Thanks so much. I'll pass it on.\nKevin Jacobsen: Thanks, Peter.\nOperator: And we'll move next to Anna Lizzul with Bank of America.\nAnna Lizzul: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks very much for the question. I wanted to ask on the outlook in the prepared remarks, you mentioned expecting a modest slowdown in category growth rates in the back half of the fiscal year. Are there any particular categories where you expect an outsized impact versus categories that you think are more resilient.\nLinda Rendle: Sure. This assumption on a modest slowdown in categories is one consistent with what we provided as an original outlook to fiscal year '24, as we saw the consumer come under more pressure, and we originally had the assumption of a mild recession which we are no longer assuming, but still assuming that consumer is going to be under more pressure given all the factors in the macro-economy. And so that's consistent with that. And if you look at our categories, given they're all mostly household essential categories, we would expect no large difference in those categories. We might see little nuances here and there, but on average, we expect all of them to be slightly slower. And that's consistent with what we've seen in the past in times like this. But I wouldn't call out anything in particular that would be a wide variance to that assumption.\nAnna Lizzul: Thanks for that. And just a follow-up on the organic sales question earlier on the Lifestyle segment in fiscal Q2, we saw a negative price mix. Can you just tell us what is driving that and should we expect to see negative price mix in the back half of the year on this? Thanks.\nKevin Jacobsen: Sure. As it relates to Lifestyle that was in our Burt's Bees business, we do quite a bit of holiday gift packing and merchandising in the second quarter on that business, and so you have increased promotional activity. And so that was specific to the second quarter. And you may see that occasionally based on merchandising plans as we go forward.\nAnna Lizzul: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey guys. Just maybe looking beyond fiscal '24, I think the tailing question today is probably the earnings outlook as we look out to fiscal '25. I know obviously you won't comment on that directly, but maybe just looking at a couple line items. First, Linda from a top line standpoint, obviously, a lot of moving parts. Are you pretty comfortable now that longer term retailer relationships have not been impacted from a systems issue? Do you have a line of sight to eventually regaining full distribution to Andrea's question understanding the job's not done, but do you think you have that line of sight? And also maybe just an update on the competitive environment near term, are there any pricing or promotional concerns that have cropped up from competitors recently, given some of the volatility that might linger as we look out over the next year or two? And how you think about that?\nLinda Rendle: Sure, thanks for the questions, Dara. So, obviously, as you said, we won't provide any perspective on fiscal year '25, but the thing is that you've outlined are important as we think about closing out this year. And then, of course, the future of our continued commitment to grow top line while rebuilding margins. And what we see from a top line perspective is very strong brands. And I think I'd highlight again what I called out around brand superiority. Even in the out-of-stock issue that we experienced and cyber, we maintained our brand superiority ratings, which is significantly higher than it was pre-pandemic. So our brands continue to remain strong and we feel great about the investments we have in the back half, both increasing our advertising and sales promotion levels and we're going to spend about 11% this year. We continue to expect that. And we do expect trade promotion to increase as Kevin highlighted earlier. And innovation plans. We've also spoken about the fact that during the cyber incident we walled those resources off and so our innovation plans remain on track and we expect innovation across every major brand at Clorox. And we'll continue to invest in those plans. So I feel great about the brand's health going into this. From a category perspective, as we said, we expect to see some moderation in category growth. We tend to fare well in times when the consumers stretched because we offer value superiority. And in fact we're seeing in many cases, people still trading into premium segments of our business, we're seeing that in wipes, we're seeing that in premium litter, we're seeing that in our food business and across many others. So feel really good about where we stand with the consumer, even as they are more challenged and we're not seeing excessive trading to private-label. We did see some during our out-of-stock period, but we're seeing that rebound as we get back on shelf. And then retailers. I'll just take another moment to thank them and I can't thank them enough. They've been tremendous partners. And I say with confidence our relationships are stronger coming out of this. Unfortunate incident than they were heading in and they were strong heading in super grateful for their partnership and what they've done and we're back focused on category growth and focused on finishing the job on distribution. And I have full confidence given the plans that we have that we will restore distribution. It will just be how fast we can do it and on what timing. And again, some of those things are out of our control. But we have the right plans, we have the right relationships and strong brands to get it done.\nDara Mohsenian: Okay. And can you just comment on the promotional environment. And if I can slip in one more Kevin, on the margin front. You talked about leaving the year at 42%, but still well below peak levels of 45% to 46%, if you go back historically. You mentioned in response to Peter's question that there'll be progress in fiscal '25, just help us understand potentially the slope of that gross margin recovery over time, the key drivers and how you think about long-term potential relative to that peak historical level. Thanks.\nLinda Rendle: Sure. On the merchandising and competitive front, we continue to see merchandising levels below what we saw pre-pandemic. And we expect in the back half for those to continue to ramp up. But what I'd say is, some of that was depressed given the fact that we were out-of-stock and not had as much merchandising. But we're not seeing anything in any material way, where we're seeing deep discount price merchandising, where we're seeing a fundamental change. But we would expect that, that level to rise, consistent with a more pressured consumer. And I would say there are little pockets here and there in categories, we're seeing some competition in litter, where there's a bit more aggressive merchandising and price promoting going on, but nothing outside of what we have assumed in our outlook from our categories and competition. And again, we continue to expect merchandising to increase both ours and competition in the back half, but we don't expect that to go to levels beyond what we thought pre-pandemic. And we'll see how that plays out.\nKevin Jacobsen: And then, Dara, on gross margin. Yeah, as I said, getting to about 42 as our exit in Q4, I expect we'll make more progress in fiscal year '25, and I'm sure you can appreciate. I'll refrain from being too specific. We haven't finished our planning yet for '25, but here's what I expect, we will continue to drive cost savings. And as you know, we target 175 basis points of EBIT margin expansion each year. Last couple of years, we've been doing north of 200. So we'll continue to drive cost savings. If you assume we're going to move into a more normalized cost environment, potentially even some cost deflation, you can see how that 200 basis points can quickly start advancing our gross margins. It's not being absorbed by cost inflation. So that will be what we expect going forward. We'll have to see where the cost environment is when we get there. Pricing will play a smaller role as we've now lapped US pricing, we're still doing some pricing international, but that will play a smaller role. As we mentioned, we continue to expect improving volume trends, which will certainly contribute to margin expansion as well. So as I said, we're going to make progress. It's hard to call when we think we'll get back to that initial margin, we talked about 44%. It's hard to call exactly when we'll get there because it's not fully in our control. Some of that's going to be driven on how the cost environment plays out. If we see deflation, it could move more quickly, and if it's still continues to inflate, it may take a little bit longer. And then, I think once we get back into a more normalized environment, typically, our cost savings is more than enough to offset a normal level of cost inflation and we can take a little bit to the bottom line. And that's how you get that 25 bps to 50 bps of EBIT margin expansion each year ongoing. So I think, job one is to get back to that 44%, we remain committed doing that. I think over time you get back to a more modest improvement year after year in a more normalized cost environment.\nDara Mohsenian: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Filippo Falorni with Citi.\nFilippo Falorni: Hey, good afternoon guys. So, Linda, I wanted to go back to your comment of, there is still some jobs to be done in terms of recovering shelf space. Maybe moving in a few categories if I look at the track channel data, there's three big categories where your total distribution points are still below pre-cyber-attack levels particularly trash bags, bleach and cat litter. Maybe you could give us a color like what are your plans are to get the shelf space back.\nLinda Rendle: Sure, Filippo. Just in aggregate, so that we're completely clear, we are still -- have fewer distribution points than we did pre-cyber. But we are close to restoring at an aggregate enterprise level. So as I mentioned earlier, we were down well over 30% in average weekly distribution points at the low point of our out-of-stocks and now we're mid-single digits on average. But you're right to call out that in particular, trash and cat litter, we're actually more on track to what we originally expected in Q2 and we were able to in the rest of the categories accelerate the distribution point recovery. But trash and cat litter were more on the schedule that we had expected them to be in Q2 and there's really two things driving it. The first on cat litter is the ongoing catch up that we're playing as the category has grown so fast to catch up from a supply perspective to demand. We continue to expect to make progress on that this year, but that's part of the reason why cat litter is slightly behind. And then trash. That's a complex category and we prioritized a certain set of items to ensure that those were on-shelf fast. And with that, we have to bring back the full distribution, particularly, I'll call it, large sizes, is one that we have not fully restored yet. We have plans to do that in these upcoming resets. Those are important items in the category and retailers realize that. And we feel we have the right plans in place to get them back, but those are two categories that will look more like we had thought at the beginning of Q2. But just like the rest of the categories. We believe we have the right plans. We will make progress in Q3 and Q4. And we're not seeing anything abnormal from a consumer perspective that gives us any concern of our ability to do that.\nFilippo Falorni: Great. That's super helpful. And then Kevin, two quick follow-ups on the gross margin. First on the commodity line, it was neutral this quarter. You talked about maybe a more favorable environment. Are you expecting some deflation in the second half, meaning a benefit? And then on the manufacturing and logistics, maybe you can walk us through the drivers on that line as well.\nKevin Jacobsen: Sure, Filippo. As it relates to maybe I'll start with all three and just talk about inflation. As you know, we came into the year expecting about $200 million worth of cost inflation. Some of that in commodities, but more of that in manufacturing and logistics, primarily driven by wage inflation. What I would tell you is we're seeing a little bit of improvement in commodities, it's a little bit better than we anticipated. And keep in mind, we forecast, not based on spot rates, but based on forward curves. And so I'd say we're still generally in that $200 million range, but a little bit better news we're seeing on commodities. Now having said that, that's before we factor in, Argentina and sort of the new reality in Argentina. But if I exclude that for a moment, I'd say generally playing out as we expected about $200 million of inflation, mostly in manufacturing and logistics. You don't see it as much when you look at our web attachments in the front half of the year. We had a number of charges last year that we're lapping. We should add more favorability in manufacturing, logistics, but that was offset by inflation in the front half and you get to a pretty neutral outcome is what you're seeing for the front half. And now when you add in Argentina, we're forecasting now almost 300% inflation in that economy. So we are seeing more cost inflation broadly across the supply chain, including commodities. And so I expect to have unfavorable commodity inflation in the back half of the year, a little bit of the US, but more so being driven from Argentina. But what's important to note, and I mentioned this earlier in Argentina, if you step back from all the noise and where it shows up in the P&L, we believe we have a plan to fully cover the negative impact to our P&L through the increased pricing we're taking.\nFilippo Falorni: Got it. Super helpful guys . I'll pass it on.\nKevin Jacobsen: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll move next to Chris Carey with Wells Fargo.\nChristopher Carey: Hi, everybody. So just a couple of question then kind of a broader question. Number one, are you or did you experience any negative impact from a delayed cold flu season that we should anticipate some benefit going into the March quarter. And then to just follow-up there on Argentina, we've seen some companies cap the level of pricing so as not to, I guess, take all of the inflationary pricing that we just need different methodology. Is it fair to assume that you would strive to offset all the inflation in Argentina as it gets worse, just so we know how to kind of try to track this going forward. And I have a follow-up.\nLinda Rendle: Sure. Yeah, Chris, I'll start with the cold and flu. And just so we're all level set. Cold and flu is actually this year very similar to previous cold and flu seasons that we saw before. So definitely different than last year. So started later than last year, but more like an average cold and flu season which we typically see in January and February, so I would say normalized is the assumption that we have. So too early to say what the impacts will be we'll obviously talk that when we talk Q3. But we're looking at an average cold and flu season. And to your point, that means as we lap it the lap looks different because we experienced cold and flu earlier last year. And we'll be experiencing a more normalized, so mostly a Q3 impact for cold and flu that's been contemplated in our outlook. And we have like we normally do normalized assumptions around cold and flu and we'll see how that plays out. But to-date it looks like a very normal cold and flu season. From an Argentina perspective that would certainly be our perspective and as Kevin highlighted we intend right now with the plans that we have and what we're seeing in Argentina to fully offset the impacts through pricing. We'll see what happens as we move forward. That would continue to be our posture. And the reasons and proof points, we believe we can do it our market shares continue to be very strong. Our brands are very strong, we'll watch that closely but based on what we're seeing today, we expect to fully offset the currency headwinds with pricing.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah, Chris. The one item I'd add as it relates to Argentina is on remeasurement. It's worth noting that things you're modeling. In Argentina, you have to remeasure the monetary assets every quarter, and the more devaluation you have the larger charge you take to your P&L. In Q2 we took a $0.10 charge to the P&L. We have in our outlook, the assumption we're going to take about a $0.20 charge in total, we took $0.04 in Q1. So most of the charge we're taking, which is roughly $30 million, we've taken in the front half. But we do expect there'll be some more remeasurement impacts to the P&L in the back half of the year, but it's fairly modest given what we've already taken to-date.\nChristopher Carey: Okay. And then just one additional clarification on some prior questioning. So just to be clear, so you're mostly caught up on inventory levels, but not entirely caught up. And so we're still seeing negative trends on a year-over-year basis from a sales standpoint in the Nielsen data, for example. You should continue to outpace your consumption data for maybe at least another quarter. Is that a fair analysis? And then you would expect some acceleration in consumption going into your fiscal Q4, just any way you could frame that for us would be helpful. Thanks.\nLinda Rendle: What I would say is you've got it right and that you are hearing us correctly that we've restored the vast majority of inventory. We still have work to do to close all the way back to the distribution points that we were at pre-cyber. And so, as I said, we're still down about low-single digits, up from down over 30 points. And then, market share is the same thing I highlighted, we have work left to do, as we do two things, restore those distribution points and return to merchandising and fall on those two things will have an impact and output on share. I'd also say the underlying thing behind this all is, too, we have to do that work on the fundamentals, and we will. We also have to ensure consumers bought other items during this time when we're out-of-stock. And so we're also doing the disciplined work by brand to ensure that we get them back to The Clorox brands they know and love through our marketing efforts, through the efforts that we're talking with shoppers at the point of decide, and all that's going on track, but that's the work that we also have to do, not only just restoring distribution and merchandising, but also ensuring that we're getting that next purchase from people who may have tried something different during our out-of- stock period.\nChristopher Carey: Okay. Thanks so much.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hey everybody. It's a good segue from Chris' question on winning back some of the consumers that you lost. I guess you're holding advertising flat as a percentage of sales, but your outlook for revenues are higher. So from a dollar perspective I suppose that's an increase. Is there an increase or is it about where internally you had expected to spend over the course of the year?\nKevin Jacobsen: Hey, Kaumil, we're expecting increased spending. So as you know, we typically spend about 10% of sales, this year we're targeting 11%, and in fact in the back half it will be closer to 20%, so we're leaning in investing to continue to drive value superiority at an elevated rate. So year-over-year, it will be higher based on the elevated rate of spending we intend to spend.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Got it. That's useful. Thanks. And then maybe a little more information on something you alluded to a few times on consumer pressure. Is it something you're already seeing or something you're planning for the back half and maybe if you could sort of marry that comments with some of what you guys have talked about as it relates to promo activity.\nLinda Rendle: The consumer has been fairly resilient and we've continued to say that, we saw that in the front half of the year. It is a little difficult in our categories to get a completely clean read just to be fair given that we were out-of-stock and so there's a lot of dynamics going on. But as we come back in stock we're seeing largely what we expected from the consumer in their front half which is a lot of resiliency. We continue to see value seeking behaviour. So we're seeing trading up to larger sizes, we're seeing trading into opening price points. Not seeing what we would expect anything different on trading into private label than we would have expected. Again, certainly more people tried private label when we were out-of-stock but we're seeing that reverse as we get back on-shelf. We continue to see a squeeze of other brands. So the leading brands and private-label tend to be the two that are doing well in categories that have multiple brands. So all of those behaviours continued in the front-half. What we expect in the back half is the consumer to continue to be under more pressure. That being said, our categories are fairly resilient, because we're household essential. So we're expecting a moderation, but this is not a reversal of the trends we've seen and we're seeing the shift from price mix being the driver of growth to volume, and that is certainly playing out. If you look at sequential volume improvement trends over the course of time, and if you kind of backup the effects of being out-of-stock from cyber, you're seeing consistently volume improving. At the end of December volumes were down very low-single digits for example, from a consumption perspective, if you look at the MULO universe. And we would expect to see that continue in the back half. So what we just see is consumer under more pressure, value seeking behaviours continue, a slight moderation in our categories, we've assumed all of that in our outlook. We'll continue to moderate. But to-date, the consumer has been resilient. And we think those things will play in through the other assumptions we have, like more merchandising in the back half. And you know competitors focused on ensuring that they are offering a great value to consumers as their wallets are stretched. But it's very, very consistent with what we had expected at the beginning of this year. We don't see any change in behaviour from consumer outside of those assumptions we had six months ago.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Okay, great. Thank you. Well done.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks.\nOperator: And we'll move next to Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nStephen Powers: Hey, thanks and congrats from me, really to you and to the whole Company on pretty remarkable recovery these past several months. One quick follow-up and then a question. The follow-up, just on the categories that Filippo had mentioned, you talked about, there's still some work to do to fully catch up and recover. Is the expectation that as you exit fiscal '24 that you have fully recovered there or is there more work that you expect we should expect carries over into the back half of calendar '24 and fiscal '25?\nLinda Rendle: Hi, Steve, thank you for your nice comments. We really appreciate them. On those categories and I would say just in general, we intend to make as much progress as we possibly can in Q3 and Q4. Will there be some lingering effects that could be outside of our control, if there's a retailer reset or change, perhaps. But we are focused on getting as much of that back in Q3 and Q4 as we can. What I wouldn't say is, I wouldn't commit to any number at this point right now, except, we expect to make continued progress over the course of the next six months. I think for trash and litter, litter has been a challenge for a while, given that we've caught up to supply, so that is the one that we're laser-focused on, and has more to do with bringing new plant up to speed than it has to do with recovering from a cyber-incident itself. So, that will be one that we'll be watching closely and try to make as much progress on. But we are going to make as much progress as possible and we expect significantly more in Q3 and Q4.\nStephen Powers: Okay, very good. And the question I had, if we step back from the last quarter, since August, when we go back to before the summer, we were talking about a lot of things, one of those topics was sort of the ongoing digital transformation of the Company, the operating model change that you guys have been working on sort of long-term strategic arc of business transformation. Has anything over this period since August set you back on that trajectory or have you been able to keep pace so that the progress that was anticipated at the start of the summer is still sort of broadly on track.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks, Steve. And just as a preview, we'll spend a lot more time at CAGNY and have a chance to talk about our overall transformation and in particular, the operating model and digital transformation. So I look forward to talking you all about that then. But right now, what I can say is, we are absolutely deeply committed to the strategic priorities, including those two areas of transformation for the Company. They are critically important for our success, they're about investing in the long-term health of our business and being ready to take on the challenges of the future, and so the commitment is absolutely there. What I'd say is, on the operating model, we were able to proceed even through the cyber-event, and executing that we remain on track to that plan. And as you can imagine from a technology side during a cyber-event, we've had some delays on our ERP. We'll talk to you more about the timeline of that when we finalize it. But we're still committed to the transformation and all of the elements of that. But of course, our team was focused on getting safe and secure and ensuring that we moved from manual to automated processes, as the number one priority and we are now returning to that digital transformation and we'll have more of an update in the coming months.\nStephen Powers: Okay, excellent. I'll see in a couple of weeks.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: And we'll move next to Javier Escalante with Evercore ISI.\nJavier Escalante: Hi. Good evening, everyone. I have -- I'm going to kick a deadish horse here, but I do have a problem with adding up into the second half forecast, particularly for the gross margin. So if you can help us with two items specifically, one is ForEx. How big Argentina can possibly be? Two, if you can help us understand and you mentioned that impact first on sales and gross margin as to basically be flat in the second half. So that's point number one. The other has to do with the job to be done and the two categories that you're investing or you are still about to invest trash bags and cat. They are very competitive, do you have competitors that have a value stand? So to what extent it's not an issue of distribution, but an issue of retailers changing the assortment or value and then you needed to basically buy up space features and things like that that is going to create a negative offset to gross margin. Thank you.\nKevin Jacobsen: Hey, Javier, let me start with your question on FX and how it's impacting sales and gross margin. And when we entered this year, we were anticipating about two points of FX headwinds on the top line, mostly coming out of Argentina. The Argentina economy has declined more than we had anticipated. And as you may have seen in our prepared remarks, we're now anticipating about five points of FX headwinds on the top line that is solely a function of revising our expectations for Argentina. We now have in our outlook an expectation that the currency will devalue about 75%, and that's going to be back half loaded. If you look at the front half we had about three points of FX headwinds, and that puts you into the mid to high single-digit FX headwinds in the back half and again a function of Argentina. And then that also plays through in gross margins. We expect a greater negative hit to gross margins, as it relates to the FX impacts. So if you look at last year, FX was about less than 100 basis point hit, this year will be well north of that closer to 150 basis points or so. And again, it will be more pronounced in the back half of the year. Important to note that, maybe just to finish that up and I'll let Linda addressed the other question was, as I mentioned earlier, in-spite of those negative impacts based on the actions we have already taken and will take primarily as it relates to pricing, we believe, we can offset both the top line FX impact as well as the FX impact to gross margin. And as a result, you can see we're raising our sales expectation, expect to grow margins in-spite of a pretty difficult environment, we're dealing with there.\nLinda Rendle: Javier on the piece that you mentioned on those two particular categories trash and litter that we spoke about. It's exactly what we said it is from a supply perspective, those are two businesses that are a bit more challenged. We feel very confident in the health of our brands there. And as I spoke about from a superiority perspective, consumers just find value not as the lowest price, but of course, what is the overall best offering from them, which price is an element of. We feel great about the superior value of both of those brands when they offer. We continue to see our innovation do very well in both of those categories and we highlighted both of those in CAGNY some of the innovations we have, Glad with Clorox and other launches that we have in Glad that are similar and of course our outstretched cat litter which has done very well and it's held up even through out-of-stocks. We continue to see people trade in to premium cat litters. So we feel confident about our plans. Again, we have the right investment levels. And we're focused on providing exactly what you said, which is the right value to consumers and retailers see that, and we play an important role in their category growth. And I have confidence that we will retain or regain distribution, get back to the proper level of merchandising in these categories. And that will get our ourselves back to where they need to be just in these two categories, it's a little bit extended versus some of our other categories. But I have every confidence in these two that we'll get back, just like we are on the other ones.\nJavier Escalante: Thank you very much.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks, Javier.\nOperator: And we'll hear next from Callum Elliott with Bernstein Research.\nCallum Elliott: Great. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to build on Steve's question and hopefully not to pre-empt your CAGNY presentation too much. But alongside the digital transformation, you guys had other long-term initiatives before the hack that we're also targeting the top line. I think it feels like quite a long time ago now that you raised the long-term top line target to 3% to 5% driven by this push into international and professional. But hoping you can update or update us on those strategic initiatives and where we stand, now that we're hopefully starting to put the hack in the rear-view mirror. Thank you.\nLinda Rendle: Thank you. And we certainly want to get back to where we ended fiscal year '23. We were very proud of the performance and what we had done. And of course we remain deeply committed to what we talked about which is expanding top line over the long-term 3% to 5% and expanding EBIT margins 25 to 50 basis points and we want to get back to that. Exactly as you said and our transformation as a critical component of that and ensuring that we have the right capabilities and processes, and that people at Clorox are more consumer obsessed and we're working faster in a leaner fashion to get there and we'll talk about that. As we spoke about actually at CAGNY, I think, it's two years ago now, what we expected from a growth perspective continues to remain, we continue to see opportunities in international, we continue to expect to see returning to growth in our professional business as that more normalizes. But we spoke about all the other things that we had seen trend-wise. We saw more cat adoptions and so natural category tailwinds for litter. We saw people having increased interest in disinfecting which still remains and we still see that or seeing as we look at the data today. People still have a heightened need to have their spaces cleaned and disinfected. People generally are taking care of their health and wellness more so, things like Brita have natural tailwinds. And water consumption. Our Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements business is the same thing, continues to have natural tailwinds. So we'll speak about all of that at CAGNY, but we remain committed to that 3% to 5% top line over the long-term and to do that in a more profitable and consistent way. And we have all the right levers and are pulling all at the right transformation buckets in order to do that, and I feel we're on the right path to get back to where we were coming out of fiscal year '23.\nCallum Elliott: Thanks, Linda.\nLinda Rendle: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll move next to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thanks, everybody. So I was just looking back and I remember that last quarter when you were talking about the outlook and the recovery plan and expectations. That you said you expected customer inventory levels to be rebuilt by the end of fiscal 2Q. But tying to that was the conversation of mid-single-digit sales growth, right? So now retail inventories are in fact rebuilt, the main thing does it leave? But it was with sales growth that was way higher than mid-single-digit. So can you just tie those two things together for me because, I think the just the visibility in the forecasting I think is an open question. And if you go back even pre-cyber the pattern of exceeding your own outlook was incredible. But you do have to also ask the question of like what happens if it goes the other way, if this is a question of visibility.\nLinda Rendle: Hi, Lauren. Let me try to paint a picture for what happened in Q2. So we're all on exactly the same page. You are right to say that we expect it to build the vast majority of inventories by the end of Q2. What happened is, we did that faster so what you get less of a consumption loss impact in the quarter. So instead of doing that, call it, the last two weeks of December we did that earlier and earlier by categories. So you have less out-of-stocks which significantly increased our top line, and that's really the difference that you see in the quarter. And of course that had positive impacts in terms of the merchandising, we can do and all of the fundamentals from a retailer perspective that we want to return to and gave us great confidence in the back half. Not only do we take our outlook up because we over-delivered in Q2, but we see a stronger back half as a result of that. So that's really the difference is we have less lost consumption because inventories returned faster in the quarter than we had expected.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay. That's fantastic. And then just also on Burt's, I feel like when we all saw you in December, at the time you were talking about the challenge of Burt's and restoring that business just because of the natural complexity of SKUs and the line-up in that business and that holiday merchandising might actually be -- that might be a spot where you'd fall short. When I look at the trends in Lifestyle, right, clearly, Burt's had a great quarter. So there too kind of same story or I'm -- just I'm a little confused on that one, because it felt like that was a business, that was going to be tough to be able to get that merchandising in and holiday is pretty -- it's a important seasonal time for that brand is my understanding.\nLinda Rendle: Yeah, Lauren. You remember correctly from December, we highlighted one of the places that we were focused on actually two places. We talked about cold and flu, if you recall and our push to get as much of that distribution restored to ensure that we could protect cold and flu, which we feel we did. And then second exactly right is Burt's Bees and the importance of the holiday period. We were able to do most of that. I would say for holiday, we didn't get all of it out, but we got the vast majority of holiday out which was good. And that certainly did support a stronger performance on Burt's than we had anticipated. But that was a big challenge, but I would say, unfortunately we didn't get it all out, and that certainly has an impact, but the good news, it was more positive than we even expected back in December for it to be.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay, perfect. And then the final thing, sorry in this vein, but I'm just trying to put the pieces back together, if you will. Logistics that was one area, Kevin, where you had talked also last quarter about that logistics cost would be elevated this quarter because as you mentioned, Linda you're shipping well above normal every day, right and that you're going to end up using a lot more carriers and freight and so on, beyond what you'd normally be contracted for, and that there'll be elevated cost with that. Again, like, I know there's many pieces of that gross margin build, but logistics is one that really jumped out for us, it's being pretty different. So I'm just not -- that's another area of question of kind of what played out differently there, was a retailer fine. I think you mentioned that in the prepared remarks, but that seemed like a pretty significant difference versus something that should have carried elevated cost within the quarter itself.\nKevin Jacobsen: Yeah, Lauren, you remembered exactly correct, when you think about the gross margin for the second quarter came in higher than we expected, both the combination of stronger top line. But exactly what you just highlighted, we did not incur the up charges we anticipated. If you remember, when we were talking last quarter, we said our priority, job one is to get product back on shelf as quick as we can. And we were fully prepared to incur additional logistics manufacturing up charge to get that done. And that will take the form of running the plants more over time, less than full truckloads out of route shipments. We said that was all available and we expect to do some of that to get product there quickly. A credit to our team and as Linda mentioned, and a credit to our retail partners here, as we move more quickly getting productive retailers, we did that in a very efficient manner. We did not have to incur the up charges, we were mostly using our carriers, we're mostly being able to do that in full trucks. And because we got that done even faster than we expected, it didn't bleed onto the full quarter. And so it's really about us executing more effectively than we anticipated going into the quarter. But we went in expecting we would have to spend more and we prepared to do that as we are prioritizing getting product on shelf, it just resulted in the fact we didn't have to.\nLinda Rendle: Yeah. I'll just maybe make another comment on our operating model. Lauren and there were some good questions on our transformation and are we continuing it. And I think one of the things really proud of is one we learned a lot in COVID that we applied to the situation. Unfortunately, we were hoping we'd never have to play it again, but we were ready to go. The second thing is, this is an output of our operating model, getting laser-focused on what matters, putting a business leader in-charge who sees end-to-end who is able to make the calls and trade-offs, and she and her team were able to do just that, to be able to restore inventories and do all those things. Kevin spoke about, not requiring a lot of overtime. Our decision to take, our inventories up in Q1 was an important one, and we knew that we would work those down, but we made that choice early to ensure that we could do as much as we could in Q2. But I would just plug our operating model. That's a real output of what we've been driving and that changed to be bought more business unit focus, more focused on the consumer and customer and fast.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay. All right. Great. Thanks. I really appreciate it.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks, Lauren.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Raymond James.\nOlivia Tong: Great. Thanks. And great work on the improvements. In terms of the macro backdrop you talked about how -- for second half you're now no longer expecting the recession that you had before, but could you just talk about what your expectation target for the current environment to stay the way the second half to be similar to what we saw in the first half or that there is still a step-down just not as much as you had before.\nLinda Rendle: Hey, Olivia. On the macroeconomic and consumer front that's exactly right, we are no longer expecting a mild recession. Of course when we released our outlook six months ago, we said that's an assumption. And if it changes, then we'll adjust. But really what we meant by mild recession and the impact it would have for us is a more stretched consumer, and we continue to see this in environment that leads us to believe that consumers will be more stressed. And if you start to look at categories around us that certainly has been playing out, we feel the impact will be moderate to our categories, given the fact that we play in household essentials. But we are seeing consumers more use of credit. We're seeing them shift their behaviors and showing things that they value and don't value discretionary goods have been down for a while. And we see the cumulative impact of that, as they've gotten down to a place now where their savings were down to pre-pandemic levels, they no longer have that extra disposable cash even though employment remains high. We think that all adds up to a more pressured consumer. And we think the impact of that will be a moderate impact on our categories, as consumers are more conscious about how they spend their dollars. That's really the assumption. Again, the consumer has been resilient to-date, we continue to see that, but we are seeing them in our categories, they are value-seeking . And as I mentioned earlier, they are trading up to larger sizes, they're using opening price points, they are stretching their dollar they might be trading into an item they feel like is more multipurpose. And at the same time we're seeing them given the superior value of our products, they are trading at a premium, because they are not willing to trade-off efficacy, they are not willing to trade-off convenience. So we're seeing all of those things play out. But we just think the consumer will continue to be under more pressure, not in the form of we believe a mild recession anymore, but just all of the other macroeconomic factors that are out there.\nOlivia Tong: Got it. That's very helpful. And then relative to your expectations going into the year, obviously, putting aside the cyberattack. Do you think you'll end the year in line with the your -- start of your target on promotion and merchandising levels? Because I'm trying to understand obviously, there's a lot of puts and takes of where your expectations they're now versus in August before the cyberattack happened. But you had said in the past that perhaps we'd have to do a little bit more promotion, little bit more merchandising just to make sure that given what's happened. Just wondering, today what you're thinking in terms of the level of promotion merchandising relative to where you started the year.\nLinda Rendle: Yeah, on that assumption, certainly we saw a dip in Q2 given the out-of-stock situation. And we had to prioritize, ensuring that we got supply up before we could merchandise. But now that we're returning distribution and market shares, we would expect promotion to pick up and we expect for the back half the same assumption that we had at the beginning of the year, which is higher than it had been, and returning closer to pre-pandemic levels. We don't think that merchandising will exceed pre-pandemic levels, but begin to return to that level. As people are focused on a more stressed consumer and continuing to offer the right value. And of course, doing things like releasing innovation, ensuring we introduce consumers to new items and great innovation. So that's what our expectation continues to be, we'll see merchandising increase than what it was last year, getting closer to pre-pandemic levels and we expect that to happen over the course of Q3 and Q4.\nOlivia Tong: Got it. Thank you so much.\nLinda Rendle: Thanks, Olivia.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. Ms. Rendle I'd now like to turn the program back to you.\nLinda Rendle: Thank you, everyone. As we covered today we've made strong progress on our priorities in the second quarter. While there is still more work to do to fully recover in the market from the cyber incident, we're focused on executing with excellence and delivering on our strategies to drive top line growth and rebuild margins. Guided by our IGNITE strategy, we're confident we have the right plans in place to deliver long-term shareholder value creation. And as I mentioned earlier in the call, we look forward to sharing more with you in our upcoming presentation at the CAGNY Conference in February. Until then please stay well everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Jacobsen",
            "content": "Yeah, Andrea. And maybe let me take a stab at answering some of those questions, and let me know if we missed anything. But as it relates, maybe I'll just start with Argentina might be a good place to start. Because you've heard from many of our peers that's an incredibly difficult environment right now. I think if you just step back and think about our business in Argentina, we've been in there for a very long time, we have very capable leaders managing very strong brands. While there are some negative impact in Argentina flowing through our outlook we provided today, both on the top line in terms of higher FX as well as higher inflation and FX exposure and margin. What you should know is, based on the actions we've taken in Argentina, including incremental pricing, we think we fully cover the negative impacts of Argentina within this outlook with the one exception of the remeasurement loss and I'm happy to talk about that, but setting that remeasurement loss aside, we think we fully contain the Argentina impact in this P&L. As it relates to the back half, you were asking about gross margin, and as you saw, we delivered about 41.5% gross margin in the front half. And if you look at the back half, based on the outlook, it suggests will be fairly similar 41.5% as well. And so we're looking at sequentially fairly consistent trends. If I think about what's changing from the front half to the back half, there's a few items I'd point out. In terms of increased headwinds, we continue to expect higher trade spending in the back half of the year, as we get to a more normalized environment. We also now have lapped all our US pricing. We lapped the last round of pricing in December. So you'll see less benefit from pricing in the US. And then we're expecting more inflation and more FX headwinds coming out of Argentina. We are offsetting that with incremental pricing, we're executing in Argentina, so you'll see international price mix benefits in the back half of the year to a greater degree than the front half of the year, as well as we're projecting improving volumes trend. And so collectively that's offsetting those headwinds, and we're getting to a margin fairly consistent front half versus back half and that puts us in a position to improve margins by 200 basis points on a full year basis. Now, I think maybe the last question you talked about versus prior year, I think you have to be a little careful looking at the comps. If you look at our gross margins in the back half of last year, I think they're up almost 600 basis points. And so we're relatively flat, but on a very strong performance in the prior year. Well, let me stop there. Andrea, let me know if that answered your question. Sure. Hi, Peter. As it relates to organic sales growth and transitioning from the front half to the back half, you have to think about what the changes are, as it relates to volume, we expect to see improving volume trends in the back half of the year. That's a combination of both continue to recover from a cyber-event as well as now that we've lapped pricing, we'd expect to see improving volume. If you look at the front half, our volume was down high single-digits and so we would certainly expect to see those improving volume trends as we go forward. And then in addition to price mix we've now as I said lapped our US pricing in December, the last of the four rounds we took. And so US will be contributing much less, in fact very little impact to favorable price mix. But we have now leaned into Argentina in November and December we took double-digit price increases both months. And so you will still continue to see positive price mix in the back half of the year in-spite of increased trade spending. So I'd say overall improving volume trends from the front half of the year. Price-mix being a little lower than the front half because we've lapped US pricing, but still fairly strong for us, and that's how we get to an expectation that we'll be growing for the full year low-single digits, and that means the back half would be a bit stronger than where we land in the front half in terms of organic sales growth. Yes, it's more about phasing in the back half. Just want to make sure we're highlighting folks for that all that pricing in Argentina to take effect, it will probably be the fourth quarter or it's fully in market. So I'd I expect my fourth quarter gross margin to be a bit stronger than third quarter. But having said that, as you know, Peter, Linda and I remain committed to rebuilding gross margins back to the level we had before the, what I described as you know the super cycle of inflation. Good progress last year. We intend to make more progress this year, but the work is not done. And I fully expect going into '25, we'll continue to expand margins. But importantly we'll do that while we continue to invest to grow the top line and continue to advance our strategic initiatives. So we continue to focus on all three. But as it relates to margin I expect to make solid progress this year and I expect that to continue as we go into '25. Thanks, Peter. Sure. As it relates to Lifestyle that was in our Burt's Bees business, we do quite a bit of holiday gift packing and merchandising in the second quarter on that business, and so you have increased promotional activity. And so that was specific to the second quarter. And you may see that occasionally based on merchandising plans as we go forward. And then, Dara, on gross margin. Yeah, as I said, getting to about 42 as our exit in Q4, I expect we'll make more progress in fiscal year '25, and I'm sure you can appreciate. I'll refrain from being too specific. We haven't finished our planning yet for '25, but here's what I expect, we will continue to drive cost savings. And as you know, we target 175 basis points of EBIT margin expansion each year. Last couple of years, we've been doing north of 200. So we'll continue to drive cost savings. If you assume we're going to move into a more normalized cost environment, potentially even some cost deflation, you can see how that 200 basis points can quickly start advancing our gross margins. It's not being absorbed by cost inflation. So that will be what we expect going forward. We'll have to see where the cost environment is when we get there. Pricing will play a smaller role as we've now lapped US pricing, we're still doing some pricing international, but that will play a smaller role. As we mentioned, we continue to expect improving volume trends, which will certainly contribute to margin expansion as well. So as I said, we're going to make progress. It's hard to call when we think we'll get back to that initial margin, we talked about 44%. It's hard to call exactly when we'll get there because it's not fully in our control. Some of that's going to be driven on how the cost environment plays out. If we see deflation, it could move more quickly, and if it's still continues to inflate, it may take a little bit longer. And then, I think once we get back into a more normalized environment, typically, our cost savings is more than enough to offset a normal level of cost inflation and we can take a little bit to the bottom line. And that's how you get that 25 bps to 50 bps of EBIT margin expansion each year ongoing. So I think, job one is to get back to that 44%, we remain committed doing that. I think over time you get back to a more modest improvement year after year in a more normalized cost environment. Sure, Filippo. As it relates to maybe I'll start with all three and just talk about inflation. As you know, we came into the year expecting about $200 million worth of cost inflation. Some of that in commodities, but more of that in manufacturing and logistics, primarily driven by wage inflation. What I would tell you is we're seeing a little bit of improvement in commodities, it's a little bit better than we anticipated. And keep in mind, we forecast, not based on spot rates, but based on forward curves. And so I'd say we're still generally in that $200 million range, but a little bit better news we're seeing on commodities. Now having said that, that's before we factor in, Argentina and sort of the new reality in Argentina. But if I exclude that for a moment, I'd say generally playing out as we expected about $200 million of inflation, mostly in manufacturing and logistics. You don't see it as much when you look at our web attachments in the front half of the year. We had a number of charges last year that we're lapping. We should add more favorability in manufacturing, logistics, but that was offset by inflation in the front half and you get to a pretty neutral outcome is what you're seeing for the front half. And now when you add in Argentina, we're forecasting now almost 300% inflation in that economy. So we are seeing more cost inflation broadly across the supply chain, including commodities. And so I expect to have unfavorable commodity inflation in the back half of the year, a little bit of the US, but more so being driven from Argentina. But what's important to note, and I mentioned this earlier in Argentina, if you step back from all the noise and where it shows up in the P&L, we believe we have a plan to fully cover the negative impact to our P&L through the increased pricing we're taking. Thank you. Yeah, Chris. The one item I'd add as it relates to Argentina is on remeasurement. It's worth noting that things you're modeling. In Argentina, you have to remeasure the monetary assets every quarter, and the more devaluation you have the larger charge you take to your P&L. In Q2 we took a $0.10 charge to the P&L. We have in our outlook, the assumption we're going to take about a $0.20 charge in total, we took $0.04 in Q1. So most of the charge we're taking, which is roughly $30 million, we've taken in the front half. But we do expect there'll be some more remeasurement impacts to the P&L in the back half of the year, but it's fairly modest given what we've already taken to-date. Hey, Kaumil, we're expecting increased spending. So as you know, we typically spend about 10% of sales, this year we're targeting 11%, and in fact in the back half it will be closer to 20%, so we're leaning in investing to continue to drive value superiority at an elevated rate. So year-over-year, it will be higher based on the elevated rate of spending we intend to spend. Hey, Javier, let me start with your question on FX and how it's impacting sales and gross margin. And when we entered this year, we were anticipating about two points of FX headwinds on the top line, mostly coming out of Argentina. The Argentina economy has declined more than we had anticipated. And as you may have seen in our prepared remarks, we're now anticipating about five points of FX headwinds on the top line that is solely a function of revising our expectations for Argentina. We now have in our outlook an expectation that the currency will devalue about 75%, and that's going to be back half loaded. If you look at the front half we had about three points of FX headwinds, and that puts you into the mid to high single-digit FX headwinds in the back half and again a function of Argentina. And then that also plays through in gross margins. We expect a greater negative hit to gross margins, as it relates to the FX impacts. So if you look at last year, FX was about less than 100 basis point hit, this year will be well north of that closer to 150 basis points or so. And again, it will be more pronounced in the back half of the year. Important to note that, maybe just to finish that up and I'll let Linda addressed the other question was, as I mentioned earlier, in-spite of those negative impacts based on the actions we have already taken and will take primarily as it relates to pricing, we believe, we can offset both the top line FX impact as well as the FX impact to gross margin. And as a result, you can see we're raising our sales expectation, expect to grow margins in-spite of a pretty difficult environment, we're dealing with there. Yeah, Lauren, you remembered exactly correct, when you think about the gross margin for the second quarter came in higher than we expected, both the combination of stronger top line. But exactly what you just highlighted, we did not incur the up charges we anticipated. If you remember, when we were talking last quarter, we said our priority, job one is to get product back on shelf as quick as we can. And we were fully prepared to incur additional logistics manufacturing up charge to get that done. And that will take the form of running the plants more over time, less than full truckloads out of route shipments. We said that was all available and we expect to do some of that to get product there quickly. A credit to our team and as Linda mentioned, and a credit to our retail partners here, as we move more quickly getting productive retailers, we did that in a very efficient manner. We did not have to incur the up charges, we were mostly using our carriers, we're mostly being able to do that in full trucks. And because we got that done even faster than we expected, it didn't bleed onto the full quarter. And so it's really about us executing more effectively than we anticipated going into the quarter. But we went in expecting we would have to spend more and we prepared to do that as we are prioritizing getting product on shelf, it just resulted in the fact we didn't have to."

            "content": "Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We delivered financial results above our expectations in the second quarter, thanks to very strong progress on our recovery from the August cyberattack, continued advancement of our strategies to drive top-line growth and rebuild margin, as well as the swift and effective management of currency headwinds in Argentina. We are rebuilding retailer inventories ahead of schedule, enabling us to return to merchandising and restore distribution. As a result, we made great strides rebuilding market shares. Importantly, throughout our out-of-stock period and recovery, we've maintained our strong brand superiority results as measured by our consumer value metric. This speaks to the power of our advantaged portfolio, the superior value of our brands and their role in consumers' daily lives. While there is still more work to do, we're on the right path to return our business to the trajectory it was on before the cyberattack. Looking ahead, we expect the operating environment to remain challenging, as consumers remain under pressure and their value-seeking behaviors continue. Nevertheless, we remain committed to growing the top line and rebuilding margins and expect volume to play a stronger role in our top line performance as we lap pricing. We're well-positioned to make further progress in rebuilding distribution and market shares, as well as drive volume and household penetration growth over time through strong demand creation plans. Given the progress we've made in the second quarter, we are also updating our full year 2024 outlook. We have a strong diverse portfolio of trusted brands, we play in essential categories and we're making the right investments guided by our IGNITE strategy to create long-term value for stakeholders. I'm confident that we're taking the appropriate actions to build a stronger, more resilient Company that is positioned to win in the marketplace, and deliver consistent, profitable growth over time. With that, Kevin and I will take your questions. Sure, I'll take that and maybe I'll just start with your first important point, which was our expectations in Q2, and what drove the significant over delivery. If you recall, you got it exactly right. At the point where we provided an outlook for Q2, we were at a point where we had just turned back to automated order processing and we knew there'd be a transition time going from manual to automated and that would take us a bit of time to ramp up. We're also heading into key holiday time for retailers, which is a challenging time to ensure that we get the ability to have appointments and ensure that we could deliver what we needed to, in order to deliver what we ended up doing for the quarter, which was every single day shipping significantly above an average day that we would normally ship. And we I think were appropriately cautious given all of those potential headwinds on what we could accomplish. And again, the goal was to restore inventories by the end, the majority by the end of Q2, knowing some of that would flow into Q3 and Q4. So what happened in Q2, we were able to get all of that ramp up and we really leaned into our operating model. We designated a General Manager, who is in-charge of solely getting inventories rebuilt and retailers. And she had a multi-functional team around her to do that. And we were able to quickly ramp up from manual to automated and ship nearly every single day significantly above an average shipping day pre-cyber event, and our retailers were extraordinary. So we were able to get in, we were able to get appointments and the result of that, if you look at distribution, we were down over 30% of our TDP. If you look at average weekly TDPs down over 30% at the height of our out-of-stocks. We've gotten back to mid-single-digits, some business is slightly better than that, some slightly worse, and I can cover that. Market shares at the height of this, we were down over five points. If you look at the four, five weeks ending December, we were down a point. Look at the latest four, five weeks ending January 21st down 0.7, so all that flowed in the right direction, which gives us confidence. But that speaks to with the work we have remaining and we talked about this last quarter. We spoke about the fact that a lot of this was under our control and we were going to maximize that I felt good about what we did in Q2. But we're also dealing with the fact that in order to fully restore distribution, we need to have retailer resets, and those happen mainly in the spring and they vary through the back half of our year. And we intend to finish the job, then. And in addition to that we have to fully restore merchandising. So as we get our business up to the service levels we expect, and to be clear, our service levels are still depressed. They are significantly better. But we need to fully restore those. We'll return to merchandising in the back half and full as well. And with that, we feel good about our plans, we feel like we have the right investment levels. Our brands have maintained their superior value as I said in my opening comments, so feel good about it. But I just want to be clear, we didn't -- the job not done in Q2, tremendous progress, but we have more work to do in the back half. Sure. This assumption on a modest slowdown in categories is one consistent with what we provided as an original outlook to fiscal year '24, as we saw the consumer come under more pressure, and we originally had the assumption of a mild recession which we are no longer assuming, but still assuming that consumer is going to be under more pressure given all the factors in the macro-economy. And so that's consistent with that. And if you look at our categories, given they're all mostly household essential categories, we would expect no large difference in those categories. We might see little nuances here and there, but on average, we expect all of them to be slightly slower. And that's consistent with what we've seen in the past in times like this. But I wouldn't call out anything in particular that would be a wide variance to that assumption. Sure, thanks for the questions, Dara. So, obviously, as you said, we won't provide any perspective on fiscal year '25, but the thing is that you've outlined are important as we think about closing out this year. And then, of course, the future of our continued commitment to grow top line while rebuilding margins. And what we see from a top line perspective is very strong brands. And I think I'd highlight again what I called out around brand superiority. Even in the out-of-stock issue that we experienced and cyber, we maintained our brand superiority ratings, which is significantly higher than it was pre-pandemic. So our brands continue to remain strong and we feel great about the investments we have in the back half, both increasing our advertising and sales promotion levels and we're going to spend about 11% this year. We continue to expect that. And we do expect trade promotion to increase as Kevin highlighted earlier. And innovation plans. We've also spoken about the fact that during the cyber incident we walled those resources off and so our innovation plans remain on track and we expect innovation across every major brand at Clorox. And we'll continue to invest in those plans. So I feel great about the brand's health going into this. From a category perspective, as we said, we expect to see some moderation in category growth. We tend to fare well in times when the consumers stretched because we offer value superiority. And in fact we're seeing in many cases, people still trading into premium segments of our business, we're seeing that in wipes, we're seeing that in premium litter, we're seeing that in our food business and across many others. So feel really good about where we stand with the consumer, even as they are more challenged and we're not seeing excessive trading to private-label. We did see some during our out-of-stock period, but we're seeing that rebound as we get back on shelf. And then retailers. I'll just take another moment to thank them and I can't thank them enough. They've been tremendous partners. And I say with confidence our relationships are stronger coming out of this. Unfortunate incident than they were heading in and they were strong heading in super grateful for their partnership and what they've done and we're back focused on category growth and focused on finishing the job on distribution. And I have full confidence given the plans that we have that we will restore distribution. It will just be how fast we can do it and on what timing. And again, some of those things are out of our control. But we have the right plans, we have the right relationships and strong brands to get it done. Sure. On the merchandising and competitive front, we continue to see merchandising levels below what we saw pre-pandemic. And we expect in the back half for those to continue to ramp up. But what I'd say is, some of that was depressed given the fact that we were out-of-stock and not had as much merchandising. But we're not seeing anything in any material way, where we're seeing deep discount price merchandising, where we're seeing a fundamental change. But we would expect that, that level to rise, consistent with a more pressured consumer. And I would say there are little pockets here and there in categories, we're seeing some competition in litter, where there's a bit more aggressive merchandising and price promoting going on, but nothing outside of what we have assumed in our outlook from our categories and competition. And again, we continue to expect merchandising to increase both ours and competition in the back half, but we don't expect that to go to levels beyond what we thought pre-pandemic. And we'll see how that plays out. Sure, Filippo. Just in aggregate, so that we're completely clear, we are still -- have fewer distribution points than we did pre-cyber. But we are close to restoring at an aggregate enterprise level. So as I mentioned earlier, we were down well over 30% in average weekly distribution points at the low point of our out-of-stocks and now we're mid-single digits on average. But you're right to call out that in particular, trash and cat litter, we're actually more on track to what we originally expected in Q2 and we were able to in the rest of the categories accelerate the distribution point recovery. But trash and cat litter were more on the schedule that we had expected them to be in Q2 and there's really two things driving it. The first on cat litter is the ongoing catch up that we're playing as the category has grown so fast to catch up from a supply perspective to demand. We continue to expect to make progress on that this year, but that's part of the reason why cat litter is slightly behind. And then trash. That's a complex category and we prioritized a certain set of items to ensure that those were on-shelf fast. And with that, we have to bring back the full distribution, particularly, I'll call it, large sizes, is one that we have not fully restored yet. We have plans to do that in these upcoming resets. Those are important items in the category and retailers realize that. And we feel we have the right plans in place to get them back, but those are two categories that will look more like we had thought at the beginning of Q2. But just like the rest of the categories. We believe we have the right plans. We will make progress in Q3 and Q4. And we're not seeing anything abnormal from a consumer perspective that gives us any concern of our ability to do that. Sure. Yeah, Chris, I'll start with the cold and flu. And just so we're all level set. Cold and flu is actually this year very similar to previous cold and flu seasons that we saw before. So definitely different than last year. So started later than last year, but more like an average cold and flu season which we typically see in January and February, so I would say normalized is the assumption that we have. So too early to say what the impacts will be we'll obviously talk that when we talk Q3. But we're looking at an average cold and flu season. And to your point, that means as we lap it the lap looks different because we experienced cold and flu earlier last year. And we'll be experiencing a more normalized, so mostly a Q3 impact for cold and flu that's been contemplated in our outlook. And we have like we normally do normalized assumptions around cold and flu and we'll see how that plays out. But to-date it looks like a very normal cold and flu season. From an Argentina perspective that would certainly be our perspective and as Kevin highlighted we intend right now with the plans that we have and what we're seeing in Argentina to fully offset the impacts through pricing. We'll see what happens as we move forward. That would continue to be our posture. And the reasons and proof points, we believe we can do it our market shares continue to be very strong. Our brands are very strong, we'll watch that closely but based on what we're seeing today, we expect to fully offset the currency headwinds with pricing. What I would say is you've got it right and that you are hearing us correctly that we've restored the vast majority of inventory. We still have work to do to close all the way back to the distribution points that we were at pre-cyber. And so, as I said, we're still down about low-single digits, up from down over 30 points. And then, market share is the same thing I highlighted, we have work left to do, as we do two things, restore those distribution points and return to merchandising and fall on those two things will have an impact and output on share. I'd also say the underlying thing behind this all is, too, we have to do that work on the fundamentals, and we will. We also have to ensure consumers bought other items during this time when we're out-of-stock. And so we're also doing the disciplined work by brand to ensure that we get them back to The Clorox brands they know and love through our marketing efforts, through the efforts that we're talking with shoppers at the point of decide, and all that's going on track, but that's the work that we also have to do, not only just restoring distribution and merchandising, but also ensuring that we're getting that next purchase from people who may have tried something different during our out-of- stock period. Thanks, Chris. The consumer has been fairly resilient and we've continued to say that, we saw that in the front half of the year. It is a little difficult in our categories to get a completely clean read just to be fair given that we were out-of-stock and so there's a lot of dynamics going on. But as we come back in stock we're seeing largely what we expected from the consumer in their front half which is a lot of resiliency. We continue to see value seeking behaviour. So we're seeing trading up to larger sizes, we're seeing trading into opening price points. Not seeing what we would expect anything different on trading into private label than we would have expected. Again, certainly more people tried private label when we were out-of-stock but we're seeing that reverse as we get back on-shelf. We continue to see a squeeze of other brands. So the leading brands and private-label tend to be the two that are doing well in categories that have multiple brands. So all of those behaviours continued in the front-half. What we expect in the back half is the consumer to continue to be under more pressure. That being said, our categories are fairly resilient, because we're household essential. So we're expecting a moderation, but this is not a reversal of the trends we've seen and we're seeing the shift from price mix being the driver of growth to volume, and that is certainly playing out. If you look at sequential volume improvement trends over the course of time, and if you kind of backup the effects of being out-of-stock from cyber, you're seeing consistently volume improving. At the end of December volumes were down very low-single digits for example, from a consumption perspective, if you look at the MULO universe. And we would expect to see that continue in the back half. So what we just see is consumer under more pressure, value seeking behaviours continue, a slight moderation in our categories, we've assumed all of that in our outlook. We'll continue to moderate. But to-date, the consumer has been resilient. And we think those things will play in through the other assumptions we have, like more merchandising in the back half. And you know competitors focused on ensuring that they are offering a great value to consumers as their wallets are stretched. But it's very, very consistent with what we had expected at the beginning of this year. We don't see any change in behaviour from consumer outside of those assumptions we had six months ago. Thanks. Hi, Steve, thank you for your nice comments. We really appreciate them. On those categories and I would say just in general, we intend to make as much progress as we possibly can in Q3 and Q4. Will there be some lingering effects that could be outside of our control, if there's a retailer reset or change, perhaps. But we are focused on getting as much of that back in Q3 and Q4 as we can. What I wouldn't say is, I wouldn't commit to any number at this point right now, except, we expect to make continued progress over the course of the next six months. I think for trash and litter, litter has been a challenge for a while, given that we've caught up to supply, so that is the one that we're laser-focused on, and has more to do with bringing new plant up to speed than it has to do with recovering from a cyber-incident itself. So, that will be one that we'll be watching closely and try to make as much progress on. But we are going to make as much progress as possible and we expect significantly more in Q3 and Q4. Thanks, Steve. And just as a preview, we'll spend a lot more time at CAGNY and have a chance to talk about our overall transformation and in particular, the operating model and digital transformation. So I look forward to talking you all about that then. But right now, what I can say is, we are absolutely deeply committed to the strategic priorities, including those two areas of transformation for the Company. They are critically important for our success, they're about investing in the long-term health of our business and being ready to take on the challenges of the future, and so the commitment is absolutely there. What I'd say is, on the operating model, we were able to proceed even through the cyber-event, and executing that we remain on track to that plan. And as you can imagine from a technology side during a cyber-event, we've had some delays on our ERP. We'll talk to you more about the timeline of that when we finalize it. But we're still committed to the transformation and all of the elements of that. But of course, our team was focused on getting safe and secure and ensuring that we moved from manual to automated processes, as the number one priority and we are now returning to that digital transformation and we'll have more of an update in the coming months. Thanks, Steve. Javier on the piece that you mentioned on those two particular categories trash and litter that we spoke about. It's exactly what we said it is from a supply perspective, those are two businesses that are a bit more challenged. We feel very confident in the health of our brands there. And as I spoke about from a superiority perspective, consumers just find value not as the lowest price, but of course, what is the overall best offering from them, which price is an element of. We feel great about the superior value of both of those brands when they offer. We continue to see our innovation do very well in both of those categories and we highlighted both of those in CAGNY some of the innovations we have, Glad with Clorox and other launches that we have in Glad that are similar and of course our outstretched cat litter which has done very well and it's held up even through out-of-stocks. We continue to see people trade in to premium cat litters. So we feel confident about our plans. Again, we have the right investment levels. And we're focused on providing exactly what you said, which is the right value to consumers and retailers see that, and we play an important role in their category growth. And I have confidence that we will retain or regain distribution, get back to the proper level of merchandising in these categories. And that will get our ourselves back to where they need to be just in these two categories, it's a little bit extended versus some of our other categories. But I have every confidence in these two that we'll get back, just like we are on the other ones. Thanks, Javier. Thank you. And we certainly want to get back to where we ended fiscal year '23. We were very proud of the performance and what we had done. And of course we remain deeply committed to what we talked about which is expanding top line over the long-term 3% to 5% and expanding EBIT margins 25 to 50 basis points and we want to get back to that. Exactly as you said and our transformation as a critical component of that and ensuring that we have the right capabilities and processes, and that people at Clorox are more consumer obsessed and we're working faster in a leaner fashion to get there and we'll talk about that. As we spoke about actually at CAGNY, I think, it's two years ago now, what we expected from a growth perspective continues to remain, we continue to see opportunities in international, we continue to expect to see returning to growth in our professional business as that more normalizes. But we spoke about all the other things that we had seen trend-wise. We saw more cat adoptions and so natural category tailwinds for litter. We saw people having increased interest in disinfecting which still remains and we still see that or seeing as we look at the data today. People still have a heightened need to have their spaces cleaned and disinfected. People generally are taking care of their health and wellness more so, things like Brita have natural tailwinds. And water consumption. Our Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements business is the same thing, continues to have natural tailwinds. So we'll speak about all of that at CAGNY, but we remain committed to that 3% to 5% top line over the long-term and to do that in a more profitable and consistent way. And we have all the right levers and are pulling all at the right transformation buckets in order to do that, and I feel we're on the right path to get back to where we were coming out of fiscal year '23. Thank you. Hi, Lauren. Let me try to paint a picture for what happened in Q2. So we're all on exactly the same page. You are right to say that we expect it to build the vast majority of inventories by the end of Q2. What happened is, we did that faster so what you get less of a consumption loss impact in the quarter. So instead of doing that, call it, the last two weeks of December we did that earlier and earlier by categories. So you have less out-of-stocks which significantly increased our top line, and that's really the difference that you see in the quarter. And of course that had positive impacts in terms of the merchandising, we can do and all of the fundamentals from a retailer perspective that we want to return to and gave us great confidence in the back half. Not only do we take our outlook up because we over-delivered in Q2, but we see a stronger back half as a result of that. So that's really the difference is we have less lost consumption because inventories returned faster in the quarter than we had expected. Yeah, Lauren. You remember correctly from December, we highlighted one of the places that we were focused on actually two places. We talked about cold and flu, if you recall and our push to get as much of that distribution restored to ensure that we could protect cold and flu, which we feel we did. And then second exactly right is Burt's Bees and the importance of the holiday period. We were able to do most of that. I would say for holiday, we didn't get all of it out, but we got the vast majority of holiday out which was good. And that certainly did support a stronger performance on Burt's than we had anticipated. But that was a big challenge, but I would say, unfortunately we didn't get it all out, and that certainly has an impact, but the good news, it was more positive than we even expected back in December for it to be. Yeah. I'll just maybe make another comment on our operating model. Lauren and there were some good questions on our transformation and are we continuing it. And I think one of the things really proud of is one we learned a lot in COVID that we applied to the situation. Unfortunately, we were hoping we'd never have to play it again, but we were ready to go. The second thing is, this is an output of our operating model, getting laser-focused on what matters, putting a business leader in-charge who sees end-to-end who is able to make the calls and trade-offs, and she and her team were able to do just that, to be able to restore inventories and do all those things. Kevin spoke about, not requiring a lot of overtime. Our decision to take, our inventories up in Q1 was an important one, and we knew that we would work those down, but we made that choice early to ensure that we could do as much as we could in Q2. But I would just plug our operating model. That's a real output of what we've been driving and that changed to be bought more business unit focus, more focused on the consumer and customer and fast. Thanks, Lauren. Hey, Olivia. On the macroeconomic and consumer front that's exactly right, we are no longer expecting a mild recession. Of course when we released our outlook six months ago, we said that's an assumption. And if it changes, then we'll adjust. But really what we meant by mild recession and the impact it would have for us is a more stretched consumer, and we continue to see this in environment that leads us to believe that consumers will be more stressed. And if you start to look at categories around us that certainly has been playing out, we feel the impact will be moderate to our categories, given the fact that we play in household essentials. But we are seeing consumers more use of credit. We're seeing them shift their behaviors and showing things that they value and don't value discretionary goods have been down for a while. And we see the cumulative impact of that, as they've gotten down to a place now where their savings were down to pre-pandemic levels, they no longer have that extra disposable cash even though employment remains high. We think that all adds up to a more pressured consumer. And we think the impact of that will be a moderate impact on our categories, as consumers are more conscious about how they spend their dollars. That's really the assumption. Again, the consumer has been resilient to-date, we continue to see that, but we are seeing them in our categories, they are value-seeking . And as I mentioned earlier, they are trading up to larger sizes, they're using opening price points, they are stretching their dollar they might be trading into an item they feel like is more multipurpose. And at the same time we're seeing them given the superior value of our products, they are trading at a premium, because they are not willing to trade-off efficacy, they are not willing to trade-off convenience. So we're seeing all of those things play out. But we just think the consumer will continue to be under more pressure, not in the form of we believe a mild recession anymore, but just all of the other macroeconomic factors that are out there. Yeah, on that assumption, certainly we saw a dip in Q2 given the out-of-stock situation. And we had to prioritize, ensuring that we got supply up before we could merchandise. But now that we're returning distribution and market shares, we would expect promotion to pick up and we expect for the back half the same assumption that we had at the beginning of the year, which is higher than it had been, and returning closer to pre-pandemic levels. We don't think that merchandising will exceed pre-pandemic levels, but begin to return to that level. As people are focused on a more stressed consumer and continuing to offer the right value. And of course, doing things like releasing innovation, ensuring we introduce consumers to new items and great innovation. So that's what our expectation continues to be, we'll see merchandising increase than what it was last year, getting closer to pre-pandemic levels and we expect that to happen over the course of Q3 and Q4. Thanks, Olivia. Thank you, everyone. As we covered today we've made strong progress on our priorities in the second quarter. While there is still more work to do to fully recover in the market from the cyber incident, we're focused on executing with excellence and delivering on our strategies to drive top line growth and rebuild margins. Guided by our IGNITE strategy, we're confident we have the right plans in place to deliver long-term shareholder value creation. And as I mentioned earlier in the call, we look forward to sharing more with you in our upcoming presentation at the CAGNY Conference in February. Until then please stay well everyone."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Clorox Company First Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference. \nLisah Burhan: Thank you, Jen. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. On the call today with me are Linda Rendle, our CEO; and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. I hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website. In just a moment, Linda will share a few opening comments, and then we'll take your questions. \n During this call, we may make forward-looking statements, including about our fiscal 2024 outlook. These statements are based on management's current expectations but may differ from actual results or outcomes. In addition, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section, which identifies various factors that could affect such forward-looking statements, which have been filed with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the non-GAAP financial information section of our earnings release and the supplemental financial schedules in the Investor Relations section of our website for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. \n Now I'll turn it over to Linda. \nLinda Rendle: Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We entered fiscal year 2024 with momentum, supported by strong progress on our priorities over the past several quarters to maintain top line growth while rebuilding margins. Prior to the August cyber-attack, our performance was on track with our expectations with solid consumption and market share trends, including improving volume consumption as we lapped year ago pricing actions. This is a testament to the strength and superior value of our brands and the role they play in our consumers' daily lives. \n In addition, we continue to realize benefits from our margin-enhancing initiatives, including pricing, cost savings and supply chain optimization. However, the cyber-attack caused wide-scale operational disruptions, which adversely impacted our first quarter financial performance. While we're not yet back to normal, we are now on a solid path to operational recovery, but this will take some time. We're laser-focused on our immediate priorities of rebuilding retailer inventories as quickly as possible, preserving merchandising activity and improving our distribution to return to the trajectory we were on prior to the cyber-attack. \n We've proven that we can execute and rebuild inventories, earn back our shelf space and distribution and regain and ultimately drive share growth over time, just as we did coming out of the pandemic, when we restored supply following extraordinary demand for our products. We're confident in our ability to do so again, given the strength and superior value of our brands, the relevance of our IGNITE strategy and the relentless focus of our teams on executing with excellence to win in the marketplace. \n As we navigate the near term, we remain committed to our long-term strategies for growing the top line and rebuilding margins, which includes investing in innovation and brand building, driving our hallmark cost savings program and advancing our digital transformation and streamlined operating model. Looking ahead, the disruption of the last few months does not change The Clorox story. As we execute on our recovery efforts, we're confident that our portfolio of leading brands in essential categories and our IGNITE strategy will enable us to regain market share and deliver consistent profitable growth over time. \n With that, Kevin and I will take your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Peter Grom with UBS. \nPeter Grom: So Kevin, I was hoping to just get some color on the phasing implied in the guidance in the context of the 1Q performance in some of the 2Q commentary. Maybe just to start with gross margin up nicely in 1Q. Can you maybe walk us through the drivers that actually would push gross margin to be flat for the year? And then I know from a sales perspective, it's still a wide range, but it does seem to imply a decline in the back half of the year. Is that just some conservatism? Or are there key reasons behind that? \nKevin Jacobsen: Let me start with gross margin phasing and talk about what we're seeing in Q1 and sort of how we see that playing out as we go forward. The 1 thing to keep in mind is -- and these assumptions really have not changed since we talked last quarter in August, which is, as it relates to pricing, as you may know, we took 4 rounds of pricing. We've now lapped 3 rounds of pricing. So you're going to start to see the benefit of pricing continue to moderate as we move throughout the fiscal year, and we'll lap the fourth round by the end of this quarter. \n And so as we get into the back half of the year, we'll no longer have the benefit of pricing. Now we're still taking pricing internationally. So there'll be some benefit, but not to the degree you're seeing. And as an example, if you look at our most recent quarter, pricing benefit to margin is worth about 470 basis points. So a nice contributor and you'll see that moderate as we go through the year. \n And then the other item I would highlight is, we're going to see our belief is increased merchandising levels. And again, this is not a change in our assumptions. We continue to operate below pre-pandemic levels. Typically, we merchandise about 25%, 27% of our business. And last year, we ended up about 20%. And so we continue to expect that to increase as we go forward. And so our assumption is in the back half of the year that we'll see increased levels of merchandising support that will put a low pressure on margin. \n And then lastly, we continue to believe that we're going to see a consumer that's under more pressure in the back half of the year. And for all the reasons you folks know is we talk about a return to paying student loan, payments, increasing interest rates and the pressure that will put on consumers. And typically, that puts a little bit of pressure on our categories. Now based on the nature of our categories being everyday essential categories, it's not a significant impact. But usually, you could see consumption down 1 or 2 points as a result of that. And that's an assumption we've continued to assume since the beginning of the year, and that will pressure margins a little bit as well. \n Now on the sales, talk a little bit about the back half. Obviously, you folks saw we were down 20% in Q1. And if we deliver our expectation for Q2, which is sales to grow mid-single digits, that would project in the back half of the year on a reported basis, sales being flat to down high single digits. And that's a fairly wide range. I think it's a function of both the macroeconomic uncertainty about how this plays out with the consumer. But then the additional variability we have is we're working to rebuild some of the distribution and share we've lost, we fully expect to rebuild that, but we recognize there will be some variability in the exact pace of that recovery and it's not totally in our control. And so that will have some impact on our sales performance as well. \n But I think, Peter, what's most important is, Linda and I are quite confident we will rebuild back that distribution share we lost as a result of cyber event. But trying to predict the exact pace of that recovery is a little difficult to do. And so we provide a range that we think reflects that variability. \nPeter Grom: And then maybe just a follow-up. I know this may be hard to answer as we're kind of only in the first quarter of this year. But do you have any perspective around whether you think the disruption could have some lasting impacts beyond this year? Maybe from a top line perspective, do you see any risk that there could be shelf-space losses or permanent share shifts, anything from a margin perspective. I guess what I'm really trying to understand is whether you think you can fully recapture the earnings loss from the incident as you think about fiscal '25. \nLinda Rendle: We're really confident there's no structural issues related to this incident. It's short term in nature. And as Kevin highlighted, we have full confidence we'll be able to restore distribution and share over time. And what Kevin highlighted is exactly right. It's about pace. And what we're focused on this year is making progress as quickly as we can, and that starts in Q2 with rebuilding inventories. And we already are shipping well ahead of consumption now as we finished out the end of this month and we intend to continue to do that for the rest of the quarter with the goal of getting back to inventory in retailers as fast as we possibly can. We think we'll get through the bulk of that in Q2. We'll have some left to do in the back half of the year. \n And then, as Kevin said, rebuilding ensuring we have merchandising and distribution back to where it is. We are working as quickly as feasible to get as much of that done in '24 as we possibly can and that's what we're focused on. And we have a history of doing that. If you look back when, for example, Pine-Sol was out due to a product issue, we were able to get that distribution back quickly. If you look at post-COVID, the ramp-up on distribution was fast. And then we had a couple of quarters after that initial ramp-up where we continue to make progress. But what I can say is we intend to do as much of it as we possibly can in fiscal year '24. There's no structural issues related to this in our business. And we have strong confidence that given the superior value of our brands, our investments, and innovation that we will get it back. And again, as Kevin said, it's a matter of timing. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi. \nFilippo Falorni: Linda, maybe just can you give us a little more color on the conversation with key retailers as you go and try to rebuild the shelf space. Is there a requirement of increasing merchandising? It seemed like part of your gross margin outlook as well. Just any color on how those conversations have been going so far. \nLinda Rendle: Yes. Thank you for the question and for the opportunity to once again thank my retailer partners for everything they have done during this time, they have been tremendous. And that is without exception, they have all gone above and beyond to ensure that we're getting as much product as possible to their shoppers. They partnered with us on manual operations, which is not easy for anyone to do. It wasn't easy for us and certainly not easy for retailers. They've been tremendous, and they continue to be tremendous. \n And now our focus is shifting from manual operations to rebuilding that inventory and they have the same goal of building it as quickly as we do, and they are taking every measure on their side to ensure that we have the right appointments et cetera, to do that. And it's a busy season for them with holidays, et cetera, and they're still prioritizing that. And then, of course, our joint focus is on ensuring that we get merchandising for things like cold and flu. We have Burt's holiday merchandising. We're focused and they are focused on ensuring that we meet those deadlines and that we get those in front of consumers and shoppers at that time. \n And then ultimately, what our goal is, and this is really important to retailers, too. Just like coming out of COVID, we had stronger relationships with our retailer partners than we did going in, and they were strong to start. We very much intend to make this a moment to be even stronger with our retailers through transparency, through partnering, through ensuring that we're doing everything feasible to get them what they need. So I feel great about where we are. And again, my thank you to them for everything that they're doing. And we are well on our path to restore where we need to be from an inventory perspective, and then we'll get the hard work back of ensuring we have innovation and great plans with their shoppers, so we can continue to get focused on growing categories once we get past this initial recovery. \nFilippo Falorni: Got it. That's helpful. And then, Kevin, maybe a follow-up on your gross margin question. Your commodity impact in the quarter and the gross margin bridge was 1 of the lowest in a very long time. So like can you give us a sense of whether your expectation on the commodity front for the balance of the year and maybe some help with the phasing. \nKevin Jacobsen: Sure. Happy to, Filippo. We came into the year with an expectation we have about $200 million worth of supply chain inflation. Now that's broader than just commodities. That's inflation across the entire supply chain. And that is still an inflationary environment, but certainly moderating versus what we've seen over the last few years. As you look at that $200 million, about 1/3 of that we anticipate is commodity cost inflation, about 2/3 is in other areas of supply chain, primarily driven by wage inflation that shows up in a lot of different areas. \n As it relates to commodities, we still expect to see commodity cost inflation this year. It has evolved a little bit. We've seen some areas coming in lower than originally anticipated. Chemicals being 1 of those areas, substrate as well. But then there are other items that we are seeing increases and primarily petroleum-based products. So some diesel solvents and even some of the ag products are a little higher, but mostly puts and takes. And so we still expect about $200 million worth of total supply chain inflation and that includes commodities. \n And in terms of phasing, it's pretty consistent through the year. I would think a little bit of increase in the back half of the year, to your point, is fairly modest in Q1, about 20 basis points. And so you'll see a little bit of that back loaded. But again, it's fairly modest relative to what we've been dealing with for the last several years. \nOperator: And we'll hear next from Anna Lizzul with Bank of America. \nAnna Lizzul: I just wanted to ask on regaining distribution. How much of the distribution recovery will need to be driven by innovation and do you already have this innovation in the pipeline? Anything in particular you had in the plan for fiscal '24? \nLinda Rendle: Thanks for the question. So the first priority, of course, will be restoring the distribution of the everyday items we have on the shelf that performed really well from a retailer perspective and consumer perspective. So we want to make sure that we get those back on and because we're very choiceful in how we work with retailers on the distribution and shelving that we have, the items that we have on the shelf deserve to be on there, and we're going to work to get those back on. \n But your point on innovation is exactly right. How we continue to delight consumers and shoppers and drive growth in the category is on innovation. And we had a team of people that we walled off as we were dealing with the initial impacts of this cyber-attack to ensure that we were able to ship the innovation that we have in the back half. And we're happy to report that innovation in the back half will go with plans. And all of our major brands will continue to have innovation that ships at that time, and we're working with retailers to ensure we get that on shelf as quickly as possible and that we get that in front of their shoppers. So we feel very confident about the base distribution that we will rebuild back as well as the strong innovation plans we have on all major brands in the back half and getting that on shelf with retailers. \nAnna Lizzul: And I wanted to ask around advertising and sales promotional spend. You mentioned it will be about 11% of sales. Is this enough given the disruption and potential loss in market share versus a similar percentage of sales that peers are spending on advertising and promotion. \nLinda Rendle: Yes. As you know, we'll continue to spend about 11% of sales on advertising and sales promotion, which was up versus last year where we spent about 10%. And we continue to believe this is the right level of spending to support the brands as we get through this inventory recovery and growth phase as we head into the back half. And of course, we'll make any adjustments that we see necessary by brand, et cetera. And it's also supported, I would note, by continued very strong performance from an ROI perspective. So we're getting more and more for that spend. So not only are we spending at a higher rates but we're also getting more for every dollar that we invest. And we'll continue to monitor that closely. But between that and the increased promotional environment we expect to see, we think we have the right money in the market to ensure that retailers have the right plans and the consumers are seeing our brands from a marketing perspective. \nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. \nLauren Lieberman: I just want to follow up on that -- the gross margin conversation you had an answer to the first question. Because 1 spot where I was a little bit confused is, Kevin, you talked about pricing and merchandising dynamics, most notably for the second half and discussed them as being the same as prior assumptions and most notably to me on the merchandising side. But I'm not -- I feel like there's a disconnect because the prior gross margin pre-cyber, which you know is like a different time and world. I don't think it would have supported the idea of gross margins kind of flattish or flat to down in the back half. So I feel like there's a piece maybe missing outside -- I think you mentioned logistics costs for 2Q. But it does really something else is pressure in gross margins in the second half. So I just wanted to follow up on that point first. \nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, I'd say there's a few items. So you're exactly right. We've always assumed increased merchandising support. That was true back in August and that continues to be the case. The 1 other area, though, that we should talk about is as we're working to rebuild distribution and we're working to rebuild share, we are expecting lower sales in the back half than we were anticipating back in August. So lower sales will have some lower volume deleveraging that will impact margin. And then the other assumptions are generally similar to what we thought back 3 months ago. \nLauren Lieberman: And then pricing, I guess, just to follow on also because if we're assuming that higher merchandising in the second half, that means I'm guessing that price promotion should be a headwind to sales in the back half. Is that right? \nKevin Jacobsen: Well, I'd say merchandising levels overall will be as part of price mix, you'll see that show up. \nLauren Lieberman: So yes, I was just struggling with the shipments, right? So that if shipments this quarter roughly right are down the high 20%, call 30% for rounding sake. Having your net sales only up in the mid- to high single digits in 2Q and saying you're shipping above consumption, it just feels like shipments sprinkle should be higher than that, right? I feel like the thing we're shipping above consumption is almost like a circular logic because Nielsen is informed by what's on the shelf, not necessarily consumer demand. \nKevin Jacobsen: So I can certainly talk about Q2 and our expectation as you mentioned, we're projecting mid-single-digit organic sales growth in Q2. And you're exactly right. We expect, as a result of shipping above consumption, that's certainly going to help the top line relative to Q1. There's 2 items that will partially offset that. The first is we're going to continue to lap the benefit of pricing. And so you'll see that offering a smaller benefit in Q2 sequentially versus Q1. So if you saw in Q1, we had about 8 points of favorable price mix. The quarter before that, we had 16 points. So you'll continue to see that step down in Q2, and that will be a smaller benefit. \n And then the other item is, we are still in a position, particularly in October, we were losing consumption. We were losing sales. While we are shipping above consumption, we have not rebuilt retailer inventory levels yet. We still have auto stocks occurring. And so we are still losing sales, particularly in the month of October, probably bleed a bit into November as well. And so that's still providing a drag on sales in Q1 as well. So when you look at all that together, we think we will have that mid-single-digit growth as a result. \nLinda Rendle: Lauren, I'll add just 1 thing, which is a nuance to your point on shipping above consumption. When we say consumption, we mean what average consumption would have been being fully in inventory. So we're shipping well beyond that level, and that's how we rebuild inventories over time. So it is a meaningful overshipment versus what we normally would. \nLauren Lieberman: Perfect. That definitely helps a lot. And then just the other thing is that it feels like, as I'm trying to piece through the model that selling in admin dollars, and I'm looking at everything versus my like model as of August 3. That you're actually able to take a good amount of cost out of selling and admin. And I was curious, and I'm just looking at straight dollars, not percentage of sales. I'm just curious how much of that you say is related to the operating model changes that were already [ implied ]? Is it -- some of this is maybe more variable, or has there been some belt tightening that goes with this, given the unfortunate cyber situation. \nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, Lauren, this is primarily the nice work we've done on the streamlined operating model work we're doing. As you know, we're targeting to eliminate about $100 million in cost. And I'd say, keep in mind, while we talk quite a bit about the admin savings, this is really about making us a more competitive company by accelerating decision-making and getting decision-making closer to people know their consumer best. But it does generate nice savings for us, and we are very much on track by the end of this year to complete that 2-year program to generate about $100 million in reduced admin savings. And so we started that last year, and you should see us continue to drive admin savings this year as well as we complete the program. \n But even in absolute dollars, you're seeing the dollars start to go down year-over-year in spite of the increased costs we're incurring because of the cyber event. \nLauren Lieberman: Okay, for sure. And why not raise advertising dollars? I would have thought you want to spend -- you'd want to spend more. I get the percent of sales math, but sales are down so much. So I would just would have thought like trying to stay in front of the consumer when, frankly, this year's earnings \"doesn't matter\" all that much because it's a rebuild. Why not flex the advertising higher in the second half once you're back in stock? \nLinda Rendle: Lauren, we had all of those debates to see and prioritize having the right level of spending. And that's exactly the exercise that we undertook. And we think what we have in combination with innovation, with the merchandising spend is the right level, if there's any change to that based off of what we see in the marketplace, we absolutely will make adjustments prioritizing the health of our brands and ensuring that we're in front of our consumer but we feel good about that 11%. It still is slightly higher than it was last year, if you just look at absolute dollars as well. And of course, we're driving our team to try to get as much efficiency impact as they possibly can on that spend as well. But we think it's the right level. And again, as we always do, we will prioritize that. And if there's any adjustment needed based off of the path forward as we rebuild, we will make that, but feel very confident where we are right now. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. \nChristopher Carey: So a couple of quick questions. Number one, are there specific categories where you feel like it will be more challenging to rebuild your shelf than others, should we be thinking about this on a total portfolio basis? Or are there nuances between your various businesses? \nLinda Rendle: Over the long term, Chris, no. We feel confident across all of our categories that we'll be able to rebuild distribution, return to merchandising and, of course, return to the shares that we were before and grow from there. In the short term, though, there are some nuances, and you'll see recovery faster in some businesses than others. And that has to do with the rate of turn from a consumer perspective. So some of our items turn incredibly quickly, and they're heavy and bulky. And so we saw inventories depleted faster in those categories, for example, and those will take a bit longer to restore. And then some of our other categories where the turns are slower. We've had better inventory positions up into this point and the rebuild will be faster. And then some of it has to do with the complexity. \n So for example, Burt's Bees was more significantly impacted because those orders are highly complex. And in a manual environment that took more touches for us to get Burt's shipments out. And so that's 1 we're focused on rebuilding as quickly as we can given that was more impacted than some of our other businesses. And that's exactly the work we're doing right now and prioritizing that with retailers so that we have Burt's holiday merchandising, cold and flu, and we restore inventories in the most critical items that we have. And we're prioritizing that by retailer, by part of the country, by merchandising events. But over the long term, we have full confidence across all of our categories that we'll be able to restore inventory and distribution. \nChristopher Carey: One quick follow-up. I think there are some questions around trying to understand if there's any incremental costs associated with this maybe over the medium term, whether there's a step-up in merchandising in the back half or any other costs on top of that. I guess what I'm hearing is there are not, right? So you don't feel the need to invest more into digital infrastructure to protect against such things, you don't feel like you need to accelerate merchandising spending in the back half of the year to perhaps manage the retailers to give you more shelf space. Am I reading that correctly? It's more you lost the shelf now you're going to come back on, but there's no kind of incremental cost that are going to take time to fade away? \nLinda Rendle: Sure, Chris. First, and clearly, we had incremental costs in Q1 associated with this as we dealt with the cyber-attack itself and the systems issues that we needed to overcome and build. So there was an incremental cost there. Second, on the marketplace piece, we felt like we put a plan in place that took into account what we thought was going to be a more challenging environment. And that plan works very well for us in this environment of rebuilding as well. So we think we have the right tools in place. We believe, again, we have the right level of advertising and sales promotion, promotional dollars invested in that -- on the recovery. \n I would note 1 of the things that we're looking at because we remain deeply committed to our strategic priorities over the long term, including our digital transformation but we are so laser-focused on the inventory rebuild. We have work to do to see how we sequence that out over the future. And if there are any implications or shifts in timing in that, but we're not prepared to talk about that in detail today. Just know that continues to be of the highest importance to our strategy. We're deeply committed to it, and we'll be working out what that means in terms of timing and any implications over the coming quarters. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. \nAndrea Teixeira: So I wanted to go back, sorry, the shipment consumption but tackle it in a different way. So you think that like if you think about units, right, the categories that you compete in, would you say a positive in volumes like in the low single digits, if you -- if my math is correct. And if that's the case, what you're saying is that, yes, the mid- to high single digit given pricing is phasing off a bit and building off. You're saying it might take not 1 quarter, it might take 1 or 2 quarters and some unfortunate like losses that you had in market share or the volume that, that consumer went and couldn't find your product, it's not that they are going to buy 2 of them when they got into the store, right? Those lost sales are the lost sales. So is that the way we should be thinking? \n And then related to that, in a way, a second part of the question is that, is there any way you can quantify, like, if there is any -- how you -- as you get back to shelf, are you getting back that consumer that may have experimented because they couldn't find your product and regaining that consumer back? And what are the tactics that you're using to regain that consumer? \nLinda Rendle: Sure. Let me -- I'll start with the first part of your question. So maybe if we step back and look at what happened over Q1 and what we anticipate is happening over Q2 and beyond. The big picture is that when this first happens and we move to manual operations, which meant there was a period of time we were shipping anything for a very short period of time. And then we began manual operations and we were shipping at a lower rate. We still had inventory in the system for a number of weeks that allow consumers to have no visibility to this whatsoever. They went to the shelf and they had, for the most part, a normal experience and they were buying Clorox products. \n And then over time, depending on the item and category and depending on the inventory that a retailer had and how much we could get to a particular category or a retailer in the manual operations, consumers began to see out-of-stocks. And there's a number of behaviors that happen when they experience that. One can be they delay their purchase. They don't find their Clorox product and they delay. The second thing is they really need the item in that category, and so they purchase a competitive product. And that varies across, again, different categories and depending on where consumer inventories were. \n What that led to, though, is if you look at kind of what we had in Q1, about half of that downside was more than half was the bleed down of customer inventories. And then the rest of that we look at is lost sales. And then as we're rebuilding that inventory back up, you still have lost sales in Q2 at the beginning because we are not fully back. And so that same dynamic happens with the consumer when they go to the shelf. And as we rebuild inventories, we would expect as people who have delayed that purchase cycle or, frankly, haven't even had a purchase cycle yet come back that they'll see our items and continue to buy. \n And those that have switched to a competitive product, we have strong confidence given the superior value and the trust people have in our brands that once we bring those items back, they will return to that. And of course, we'll support that with all of the things that we know how to do really well. Merchandising that reminds them of the benefits of our products at key pulse periods. It is why we are absolutely laser-focused on things like getting cold and flu merchandising, which we begin to ship later this month and ensuring that we have that and people that are looking for Clorox disinfecting products at that time, we want to make sure that we're not disappointing them. We will do that through innovation and giving them new and increased benefits and of course, speaking to them in our strong marketing communications, where we talk about the benefits of our product and the value they offer to consumers. \n And we have strong confidence based off of a number of things in the past, COVID being one, where there was unprecedented demand and we couldn't fully need it. And we were able to, as we restore supply, consumers came back to our items even though they didn't find us on shelf in previous shopping trips that they had. So we're going to employ all the regular tactics that we have under our tool back. We're laser-focused on doing that. \n And then as you think about that consumer coming back, if you look at past history, just like I said with COVID or for example, when we were out of the market in Pine-Sol for a while, as we came back, those tactics worked very well to restore share, maybe Wipes, maybe the best example, we lost 20 share points during the time of the height of the pandemic due to inability to meet that extraordinary demand. \n And once we got our distribution back, which we did, we were able to regain that and then even more. People trusted our brand, and it's what they wanted. And so we have full confidence we'll be able to do that given the strength of our portfolio, the superior value of our brands and our continued focus on investments. \n What I would say is it's all about the pace. We can't completely control the pace of getting back in full distribution, but that's what we are absolutely laser-focused on. Our retailers have the same goal to get us fully back in and that's how we're really thinking about it. It is ensuring we get products back on the shelf, we get back to in market fundamentals and then, of course, doing everything we can to support consumers and what we think is going to be a tougher back half for them just as you look, as Kevin talked about from an economic perspective. \nOperator: Your next question will come from Olivia Tong with Raymond James. \nOlivia Tong Cheang: As you think about sort of rebuilding inventory and market share, how do you ensure that this doesn't impact your ability to stay on pace on innovation and then eventually, your ability to get back to the gross margin recovery path because there's obviously -- you're not quite back there yet. You're still working on that. How is it that you can stay on patient innovation with all the disruption that's happened in the business and potentially some need to rejigger the marketing, promotional dollars, et cetera, in the second half of the year? \nLinda Rendle: Yes. Olivia, it comes back to what we've spoken about before and continues to be of critical importance to us. We are deeply committed to our strategy, and that includes continuing to drive our top line momentum while rebuilding margin and balancing the pace of those 2 things. And that continues to be the center of the focus as we make decisions recovering from the cyber-attack and all the choices that we'll have over the coming quarters to ensure that we're balancing that for consumers. \n So when this first happened, of course, job #1 was to ensure that we had contained the incident, we believe we have. Job #2 was to ensure that we could return operationally, which we did. And of course, we transitioned back to automated and now laser-focused on restoring supply. But at the same time, we knew it was critically important that we could not let go of the long term. And so I mentioned just a little bit earlier that we had taken a group of resources that did not need to be focused on the immediate issue at hand and we ask them to do everything in their power to preserve innovation in the back half. And that was while systems were down. And so they put together a set of plans to do that. And the good news is, we do have the ability to continue with our innovation plans in the back half because we did that. \n And what we believe is we just have to continue to balance those 2 things. We have to balance the short term and laser focus on restoring but we have to make sure that we have that innovation. And that's how we're approaching this internally. We are trying very hard to ensure that the resources focused on the short term are not distracted and the same with the resources on the long term. And if you recall, Olivia, we did this during COVID when the same issue occurred. Demand was so high. We had to ramp up supply. We were dealing with shortages on all of raw materials but we also did the same thing where we put resources aside for innovation to ensure that we preserve that long term. \n So that's what we're going to continue to do as we make choices moving forward is we want to balance short and long term. We want to balance top line momentum with rebuilding margin, and we have every confidence that we can do both of those based off of the plans that we've outlined for fiscal year '24 and beyond. \nOlivia Tong Cheang: Got it. And then just secondly, given the cyber-attacks, and I imagine you took another look at your capabilities and IT infrastructure, obviously in the middle of a program right now. Have you revisited the plan? Do you think there are more needs to be done? And if so, could that potentially extend the project further out? \nLinda Rendle: Yes. So 2 things. Prior to the cyber-attack, we had a number of particular cybersecurity measures in place, including endpoint detection and response tools across our enterprise. And as we experience this, we continue as we bring our systems online to enhance those and taking a series is to further strengthen our security controls. So that's 1 bucket. \n Second, of course, is we are in the middle of our digital transformation, as you note, and we continue to be deeply committed to that digital transformation. We think we have taken into account the broad set of tools and capabilities that we need to put in place to be more effective and efficient as part of that digital transformation. And we think more strongly than ever that is an important to our business and a critical priority to do that. What we are doing now is going through that program and ensuring any learnings we have over the last couple of months we're integrating into it. And then we're taking that into account as we bring the ERP online in the future and as we bring the rest of the tools in place. \n But what I would say at this point is, it's too early to say if there will be any tactical changes that we'll make and how we'll sequence and time that. But what I can reaffirm is our deep commitment to it, how critical we think it is to the company. And it is just more reaffirmed given what we've experienced over the last few months as we've restarted our systems. \nOperator: Your next question will come from Javier Escalante with Evercore ISI. \nJavier Escalante Manzo: I have a question, I guess, is a CFO question. And it has to do with the business planning, forecasting and reporting that you had. How often do you communicate with the segments reporting to you? Because this seems to be kind of like a very simple business, mostly U.S.-driven. And I was surprised by the fact that it took over a month to know that the incident was material. \nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, Javier. What I would say is, I think you saw we communicated in 1 of our previous 8-K that we thought this was going to have a material impact on our results. And so we try to communicate that fairly quickly. But then the next step for us was to determine the actual financial impact and so that's what we communicated in our preannouncement because we thought it was important, given the last outlook we had was what has put out there in August prior to the event. We did not want to wait until our earnings call today to report results. So as soon as we had a fairly good handle on the financial impact we communicated that publicly. Yes, you have to keep in mind the reality is we're working in an environment that had limited systems capabilities. So it was more manual effort. So that takes a little bit longer. But importantly, we thought we want to get out there and provide that information as soon as we could. \n But you have to really work through this, Javier, because what you're really trying to figure out is when you can restructure systems, when you can start rebuilding inventory. And depending on that time line, that will impact the financial performance. So you have to let this play out a bit as we're going through the evaluation of the cyber event itself, developing recovery plan and then determining the financial indications of that recovery plan. So that was all the work that went on. And then as a result of that, we came out with a pre-announcement about a month ago. \nLinda Rendle: Sorry, Javier, I was just going to build on Kevin's response to your question. The other thing I would just note is this is actually a fairly complex business. We compete in 13 categories in over 100 countries around the world. And we're aggregating all that information in a manual environment to understand the impacts. In addition to that, we are working with all of our retailers and supplier partners who then have to transition to a manual process with us and getting our arms around exactly the implications and timing. So I just wanted to note, it is actually a rather complex business and one where -- when we are in a manual environment, you could understand how difficult it would be to have full visibility to all parts of that. And as Kevin said, our commitment was to transparency and giving information as we had it, which you saw in those series of 8-Ks. \nJavier Escalante Manzo: I appreciate that. Now my question was, I used to work for 1 corporation, a large 1 global. And I remember that they used to close the books every month and we re-forecast every month. So basically, that was the question I was asking. So how frequent does the CFO office re-forecast the business plan on a regular basis, understanding that there was a cyber event, which is very unfortunate. \nKevin Jacobsen: Yes, Javier. Let me separate a normal environment versus the cyber environment because I was asked much different. So we -- similar to -- it sounds like the experience we close our books every month, we sell our results every month and we forecast on a regular basis. That's a cadence of anywhere from 5 to 8 forecasts a year. So we have very frequent updates in a normal environment. But as Linda mentioned, in this last period because of the limitation of automated systems, [ in vary ] manual environment. So it has less visibility to our financial performance while our systems were down. And then as we brought those systems back up, we actually communicated as soon as we had a handle on what we thought the financial impact was. \nJavier Escalante Manzo: And right now you have full visibility over your P&L, all the legal entities, all that. \nKevin Jacobsen: We do. We've started up our systems, we're back to an automated environment that includes our ERP system. So yes, we have full visibility as we move forward now. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. Ms. Rendle, I would now like to turn the program back to you. \nLinda Rendle: Thank you, everyone. We look forward to speaking with you again on our next call. And until then, please stay well. \nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Jacobsen",
            "content": "Let me start with gross margin phasing and talk about what we're seeing in Q1 and sort of how we see that playing out as we go forward. The 1 thing to keep in mind is -- and these assumptions really have not changed since we talked last quarter in August, which is, as it relates to pricing, as you may know, we took 4 rounds of pricing. We've now lapped 3 rounds of pricing. So you're going to start to see the benefit of pricing continue to moderate as we move throughout the fiscal year, and we'll lap the fourth round by the end of this quarter. \n And so as we get into the back half of the year, we'll no longer have the benefit of pricing. Now we're still taking pricing internationally. So there'll be some benefit, but not to the degree you're seeing. And as an example, if you look at our most recent quarter, pricing benefit to margin is worth about 470 basis points. So a nice contributor and you'll see that moderate as we go through the year. \n And then the other item I would highlight is, we're going to see our belief is increased merchandising levels. And again, this is not a change in our assumptions. We continue to operate below pre-pandemic levels. Typically, we merchandise about 25%, 27% of our business. And last year, we ended up about 20%. And so we continue to expect that to increase as we go forward. And so our assumption is in the back half of the year that we'll see increased levels of merchandising support that will put a low pressure on margin. \n And then lastly, we continue to believe that we're going to see a consumer that's under more pressure in the back half of the year. And for all the reasons you folks know is we talk about a return to paying student loan, payments, increasing interest rates and the pressure that will put on consumers. And typically, that puts a little bit of pressure on our categories. Now based on the nature of our categories being everyday essential categories, it's not a significant impact. But usually, you could see consumption down 1 or 2 points as a result of that. And that's an assumption we've continued to assume since the beginning of the year, and that will pressure margins a little bit as well. \n Now on the sales, talk a little bit about the back half. Obviously, you folks saw we were down 20% in Q1. And if we deliver our expectation for Q2, which is sales to grow mid-single digits, that would project in the back half of the year on a reported basis, sales being flat to down high single digits. And that's a fairly wide range. I think it's a function of both the macroeconomic uncertainty about how this plays out with the consumer. But then the additional variability we have is we're working to rebuild some of the distribution and share we've lost, we fully expect to rebuild that, but we recognize there will be some variability in the exact pace of that recovery and it's not totally in our control. And so that will have some impact on our sales performance as well. \n But I think, Peter, what's most important is, Linda and I are quite confident we will rebuild back that distribution share we lost as a result of cyber event. But trying to predict the exact pace of that recovery is a little difficult to do. And so we provide a range that we think reflects that variability. Sure. Happy to, Filippo. We came into the year with an expectation we have about $200 million worth of supply chain inflation. Now that's broader than just commodities. That's inflation across the entire supply chain. And that is still an inflationary environment, but certainly moderating versus what we've seen over the last few years. As you look at that $200 million, about 1/3 of that we anticipate is commodity cost inflation, about 2/3 is in other areas of supply chain, primarily driven by wage inflation that shows up in a lot of different areas. \n As it relates to commodities, we still expect to see commodity cost inflation this year. It has evolved a little bit. We've seen some areas coming in lower than originally anticipated. Chemicals being 1 of those areas, substrate as well. But then there are other items that we are seeing increases and primarily petroleum-based products. So some diesel solvents and even some of the ag products are a little higher, but mostly puts and takes. And so we still expect about $200 million worth of total supply chain inflation and that includes commodities. \n And in terms of phasing, it's pretty consistent through the year. I would think a little bit of increase in the back half of the year, to your point, is fairly modest in Q1, about 20 basis points. And so you'll see a little bit of that back loaded. But again, it's fairly modest relative to what we've been dealing with for the last several years. Yes, I'd say there's a few items. So you're exactly right. We've always assumed increased merchandising support. That was true back in August and that continues to be the case. The 1 other area, though, that we should talk about is as we're working to rebuild distribution and we're working to rebuild share, we are expecting lower sales in the back half than we were anticipating back in August. So lower sales will have some lower volume deleveraging that will impact margin. And then the other assumptions are generally similar to what we thought back 3 months ago. Well, I'd say merchandising levels overall will be as part of price mix, you'll see that show up. So I can certainly talk about Q2 and our expectation as you mentioned, we're projecting mid-single-digit organic sales growth in Q2. And you're exactly right. We expect, as a result of shipping above consumption, that's certainly going to help the top line relative to Q1. There's 2 items that will partially offset that. The first is we're going to continue to lap the benefit of pricing. And so you'll see that offering a smaller benefit in Q2 sequentially versus Q1. So if you saw in Q1, we had about 8 points of favorable price mix. The quarter before that, we had 16 points. So you'll continue to see that step down in Q2, and that will be a smaller benefit. \n And then the other item is, we are still in a position, particularly in October, we were losing consumption. We were losing sales. While we are shipping above consumption, we have not rebuilt retailer inventory levels yet. We still have auto stocks occurring. And so we are still losing sales, particularly in the month of October, probably bleed a bit into November as well. And so that's still providing a drag on sales in Q1 as well. So when you look at all that together, we think we will have that mid-single-digit growth as a result. Yes, Lauren, this is primarily the nice work we've done on the streamlined operating model work we're doing. As you know, we're targeting to eliminate about $100 million in cost. And I'd say, keep in mind, while we talk quite a bit about the admin savings, this is really about making us a more competitive company by accelerating decision-making and getting decision-making closer to people know their consumer best. But it does generate nice savings for us, and we are very much on track by the end of this year to complete that 2-year program to generate about $100 million in reduced admin savings. And so we started that last year, and you should see us continue to drive admin savings this year as well as we complete the program. \n But even in absolute dollars, you're seeing the dollars start to go down year-over-year in spite of the increased costs we're incurring because of the cyber event. Yes, Javier. What I would say is, I think you saw we communicated in 1 of our previous 8-K that we thought this was going to have a material impact on our results. And so we try to communicate that fairly quickly. But then the next step for us was to determine the actual financial impact and so that's what we communicated in our preannouncement because we thought it was important, given the last outlook we had was what has put out there in August prior to the event. We did not want to wait until our earnings call today to report results. So as soon as we had a fairly good handle on the financial impact we communicated that publicly. Yes, you have to keep in mind the reality is we're working in an environment that had limited systems capabilities. So it was more manual effort. So that takes a little bit longer. But importantly, we thought we want to get out there and provide that information as soon as we could. \n But you have to really work through this, Javier, because what you're really trying to figure out is when you can restructure systems, when you can start rebuilding inventory. And depending on that time line, that will impact the financial performance. So you have to let this play out a bit as we're going through the evaluation of the cyber event itself, developing recovery plan and then determining the financial indications of that recovery plan. So that was all the work that went on. And then as a result of that, we came out with a pre-announcement about a month ago. Yes, Javier. Let me separate a normal environment versus the cyber environment because I was asked much different. So we -- similar to -- it sounds like the experience we close our books every month, we sell our results every month and we forecast on a regular basis. That's a cadence of anywhere from 5 to 8 forecasts a year. So we have very frequent updates in a normal environment. But as Linda mentioned, in this last period because of the limitation of automated systems, [ in vary ] manual environment. So it has less visibility to our financial performance while our systems were down. And then as we brought those systems back up, we actually communicated as soon as we had a handle on what we thought the financial impact was. We do. We've started up our systems, we're back to an automated environment that includes our ERP system. So yes, we have full visibility as we move forward now."

            "name": "Linda Rendle",
            "content": "Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We entered fiscal year 2024 with momentum, supported by strong progress on our priorities over the past several quarters to maintain top line growth while rebuilding margins. Prior to the August cyber-attack, our performance was on track with our expectations with solid consumption and market share trends, including improving volume consumption as we lapped year ago pricing actions. This is a testament to the strength and superior value of our brands and the role they play in our consumers' daily lives. \n In addition, we continue to realize benefits from our margin-enhancing initiatives, including pricing, cost savings and supply chain optimization. However, the cyber-attack caused wide-scale operational disruptions, which adversely impacted our first quarter financial performance. While we're not yet back to normal, we are now on a solid path to operational recovery, but this will take some time. We're laser-focused on our immediate priorities of rebuilding retailer inventories as quickly as possible, preserving merchandising activity and improving our distribution to return to the trajectory we were on prior to the cyber-attack. \n We've proven that we can execute and rebuild inventories, earn back our shelf space and distribution and regain and ultimately drive share growth over time, just as we did coming out of the pandemic, when we restored supply following extraordinary demand for our products. We're confident in our ability to do so again, given the strength and superior value of our brands, the relevance of our IGNITE strategy and the relentless focus of our teams on executing with excellence to win in the marketplace. \n As we navigate the near term, we remain committed to our long-term strategies for growing the top line and rebuilding margins, which includes investing in innovation and brand building, driving our hallmark cost savings program and advancing our digital transformation and streamlined operating model. Looking ahead, the disruption of the last few months does not change The Clorox story. As we execute on our recovery efforts, we're confident that our portfolio of leading brands in essential categories and our IGNITE strategy will enable us to regain market share and deliver consistent profitable growth over time. \n With that, Kevin and I will take your questions. We're really confident there's no structural issues related to this incident. It's short term in nature. And as Kevin highlighted, we have full confidence we'll be able to restore distribution and share over time. And what Kevin highlighted is exactly right. It's about pace. And what we're focused on this year is making progress as quickly as we can, and that starts in Q2 with rebuilding inventories. And we already are shipping well ahead of consumption now as we finished out the end of this month and we intend to continue to do that for the rest of the quarter with the goal of getting back to inventory in retailers as fast as we possibly can. We think we'll get through the bulk of that in Q2. We'll have some left to do in the back half of the year. \n And then, as Kevin said, rebuilding ensuring we have merchandising and distribution back to where it is. We are working as quickly as feasible to get as much of that done in '24 as we possibly can and that's what we're focused on. And we have a history of doing that. If you look back when, for example, Pine-Sol was out due to a product issue, we were able to get that distribution back quickly. If you look at post-COVID, the ramp-up on distribution was fast. And then we had a couple of quarters after that initial ramp-up where we continue to make progress. But what I can say is we intend to do as much of it as we possibly can in fiscal year '24. There's no structural issues related to this in our business. And we have strong confidence that given the superior value of our brands, our investments, and innovation that we will get it back. And again, as Kevin said, it's a matter of timing. Yes. Thank you for the question and for the opportunity to once again thank my retailer partners for everything they have done during this time, they have been tremendous. And that is without exception, they have all gone above and beyond to ensure that we're getting as much product as possible to their shoppers. They partnered with us on manual operations, which is not easy for anyone to do. It wasn't easy for us and certainly not easy for retailers. They've been tremendous, and they continue to be tremendous. \n And now our focus is shifting from manual operations to rebuilding that inventory and they have the same goal of building it as quickly as we do, and they are taking every measure on their side to ensure that we have the right appointments et cetera, to do that. And it's a busy season for them with holidays, et cetera, and they're still prioritizing that. And then, of course, our joint focus is on ensuring that we get merchandising for things like cold and flu. We have Burt's holiday merchandising. We're focused and they are focused on ensuring that we meet those deadlines and that we get those in front of consumers and shoppers at that time. \n And then ultimately, what our goal is, and this is really important to retailers, too. Just like coming out of COVID, we had stronger relationships with our retailer partners than we did going in, and they were strong to start. We very much intend to make this a moment to be even stronger with our retailers through transparency, through partnering, through ensuring that we're doing everything feasible to get them what they need. So I feel great about where we are. And again, my thank you to them for everything that they're doing. And we are well on our path to restore where we need to be from an inventory perspective, and then we'll get the hard work back of ensuring we have innovation and great plans with their shoppers, so we can continue to get focused on growing categories once we get past this initial recovery. Thanks for the question. So the first priority, of course, will be restoring the distribution of the everyday items we have on the shelf that performed really well from a retailer perspective and consumer perspective. So we want to make sure that we get those back on and because we're very choiceful in how we work with retailers on the distribution and shelving that we have, the items that we have on the shelf deserve to be on there, and we're going to work to get those back on. \n But your point on innovation is exactly right. How we continue to delight consumers and shoppers and drive growth in the category is on innovation. And we had a team of people that we walled off as we were dealing with the initial impacts of this cyber-attack to ensure that we were able to ship the innovation that we have in the back half. And we're happy to report that innovation in the back half will go with plans. And all of our major brands will continue to have innovation that ships at that time, and we're working with retailers to ensure we get that on shelf as quickly as possible and that we get that in front of their shoppers. So we feel very confident about the base distribution that we will rebuild back as well as the strong innovation plans we have on all major brands in the back half and getting that on shelf with retailers. Yes. As you know, we'll continue to spend about 11% of sales on advertising and sales promotion, which was up versus last year where we spent about 10%. And we continue to believe this is the right level of spending to support the brands as we get through this inventory recovery and growth phase as we head into the back half. And of course, we'll make any adjustments that we see necessary by brand, et cetera. And it's also supported, I would note, by continued very strong performance from an ROI perspective. So we're getting more and more for that spend. So not only are we spending at a higher rates but we're also getting more for every dollar that we invest. And we'll continue to monitor that closely. But between that and the increased promotional environment we expect to see, we think we have the right money in the market to ensure that retailers have the right plans and the consumers are seeing our brands from a marketing perspective. Lauren, I'll add just 1 thing, which is a nuance to your point on shipping above consumption. When we say consumption, we mean what average consumption would have been being fully in inventory. So we're shipping well beyond that level, and that's how we rebuild inventories over time. So it is a meaningful overshipment versus what we normally would. Lauren, we had all of those debates to see and prioritize having the right level of spending. And that's exactly the exercise that we undertook. And we think what we have in combination with innovation, with the merchandising spend is the right level, if there's any change to that based off of what we see in the marketplace, we absolutely will make adjustments prioritizing the health of our brands and ensuring that we're in front of our consumer but we feel good about that 11%. It still is slightly higher than it was last year, if you just look at absolute dollars as well. And of course, we're driving our team to try to get as much efficiency impact as they possibly can on that spend as well. But we think it's the right level. And again, as we always do, we will prioritize that. And if there's any adjustment needed based off of the path forward as we rebuild, we will make that, but feel very confident where we are right now. Over the long term, Chris, no. We feel confident across all of our categories that we'll be able to rebuild distribution, return to merchandising and, of course, return to the shares that we were before and grow from there. In the short term, though, there are some nuances, and you'll see recovery faster in some businesses than others. And that has to do with the rate of turn from a consumer perspective. So some of our items turn incredibly quickly, and they're heavy and bulky. And so we saw inventories depleted faster in those categories, for example, and those will take a bit longer to restore. And then some of our other categories where the turns are slower. We've had better inventory positions up into this point and the rebuild will be faster. And then some of it has to do with the complexity. \n So for example, Burt's Bees was more significantly impacted because those orders are highly complex. And in a manual environment that took more touches for us to get Burt's shipments out. And so that's 1 we're focused on rebuilding as quickly as we can given that was more impacted than some of our other businesses. And that's exactly the work we're doing right now and prioritizing that with retailers so that we have Burt's holiday merchandising, cold and flu, and we restore inventories in the most critical items that we have. And we're prioritizing that by retailer, by part of the country, by merchandising events. But over the long term, we have full confidence across all of our categories that we'll be able to restore inventory and distribution. Sure, Chris. First, and clearly, we had incremental costs in Q1 associated with this as we dealt with the cyber-attack itself and the systems issues that we needed to overcome and build. So there was an incremental cost there. Second, on the marketplace piece, we felt like we put a plan in place that took into account what we thought was going to be a more challenging environment. And that plan works very well for us in this environment of rebuilding as well. So we think we have the right tools in place. We believe, again, we have the right level of advertising and sales promotion, promotional dollars invested in that -- on the recovery. \n I would note 1 of the things that we're looking at because we remain deeply committed to our strategic priorities over the long term, including our digital transformation but we are so laser-focused on the inventory rebuild. We have work to do to see how we sequence that out over the future. And if there are any implications or shifts in timing in that, but we're not prepared to talk about that in detail today. Just know that continues to be of the highest importance to our strategy. We're deeply committed to it, and we'll be working out what that means in terms of timing and any implications over the coming quarters. Sure. Let me -- I'll start with the first part of your question. So maybe if we step back and look at what happened over Q1 and what we anticipate is happening over Q2 and beyond. The big picture is that when this first happens and we move to manual operations, which meant there was a period of time we were shipping anything for a very short period of time. And then we began manual operations and we were shipping at a lower rate. We still had inventory in the system for a number of weeks that allow consumers to have no visibility to this whatsoever. They went to the shelf and they had, for the most part, a normal experience and they were buying Clorox products. \n And then over time, depending on the item and category and depending on the inventory that a retailer had and how much we could get to a particular category or a retailer in the manual operations, consumers began to see out-of-stocks. And there's a number of behaviors that happen when they experience that. One can be they delay their purchase. They don't find their Clorox product and they delay. The second thing is they really need the item in that category, and so they purchase a competitive product. And that varies across, again, different categories and depending on where consumer inventories were. \n What that led to, though, is if you look at kind of what we had in Q1, about half of that downside was more than half was the bleed down of customer inventories. And then the rest of that we look at is lost sales. And then as we're rebuilding that inventory back up, you still have lost sales in Q2 at the beginning because we are not fully back. And so that same dynamic happens with the consumer when they go to the shelf. And as we rebuild inventories, we would expect as people who have delayed that purchase cycle or, frankly, haven't even had a purchase cycle yet come back that they'll see our items and continue to buy. \n And those that have switched to a competitive product, we have strong confidence given the superior value and the trust people have in our brands that once we bring those items back, they will return to that. And of course, we'll support that with all of the things that we know how to do really well. Merchandising that reminds them of the benefits of our products at key pulse periods. It is why we are absolutely laser-focused on things like getting cold and flu merchandising, which we begin to ship later this month and ensuring that we have that and people that are looking for Clorox disinfecting products at that time, we want to make sure that we're not disappointing them. We will do that through innovation and giving them new and increased benefits and of course, speaking to them in our strong marketing communications, where we talk about the benefits of our product and the value they offer to consumers. \n And we have strong confidence based off of a number of things in the past, COVID being one, where there was unprecedented demand and we couldn't fully need it. And we were able to, as we restore supply, consumers came back to our items even though they didn't find us on shelf in previous shopping trips that they had. So we're going to employ all the regular tactics that we have under our tool back. We're laser-focused on doing that. \n And then as you think about that consumer coming back, if you look at past history, just like I said with COVID or for example, when we were out of the market in Pine-Sol for a while, as we came back, those tactics worked very well to restore share, maybe Wipes, maybe the best example, we lost 20 share points during the time of the height of the pandemic due to inability to meet that extraordinary demand. \n And once we got our distribution back, which we did, we were able to regain that and then even more. People trusted our brand, and it's what they wanted. And so we have full confidence we'll be able to do that given the strength of our portfolio, the superior value of our brands and our continued focus on investments. \n What I would say is it's all about the pace. We can't completely control the pace of getting back in full distribution, but that's what we are absolutely laser-focused on. Our retailers have the same goal to get us fully back in and that's how we're really thinking about it. It is ensuring we get products back on the shelf, we get back to in market fundamentals and then, of course, doing everything we can to support consumers and what we think is going to be a tougher back half for them just as you look, as Kevin talked about from an economic perspective. Yes. Olivia, it comes back to what we've spoken about before and continues to be of critical importance to us. We are deeply committed to our strategy, and that includes continuing to drive our top line momentum while rebuilding margin and balancing the pace of those 2 things. And that continues to be the center of the focus as we make decisions recovering from the cyber-attack and all the choices that we'll have over the coming quarters to ensure that we're balancing that for consumers. \n So when this first happened, of course, job #1 was to ensure that we had contained the incident, we believe we have. Job #2 was to ensure that we could return operationally, which we did. And of course, we transitioned back to automated and now laser-focused on restoring supply. But at the same time, we knew it was critically important that we could not let go of the long term. And so I mentioned just a little bit earlier that we had taken a group of resources that did not need to be focused on the immediate issue at hand and we ask them to do everything in their power to preserve innovation in the back half. And that was while systems were down. And so they put together a set of plans to do that. And the good news is, we do have the ability to continue with our innovation plans in the back half because we did that. \n And what we believe is we just have to continue to balance those 2 things. We have to balance the short term and laser focus on restoring but we have to make sure that we have that innovation. And that's how we're approaching this internally. We are trying very hard to ensure that the resources focused on the short term are not distracted and the same with the resources on the long term. And if you recall, Olivia, we did this during COVID when the same issue occurred. Demand was so high. We had to ramp up supply. We were dealing with shortages on all of raw materials but we also did the same thing where we put resources aside for innovation to ensure that we preserve that long term. \n So that's what we're going to continue to do as we make choices moving forward is we want to balance short and long term. We want to balance top line momentum with rebuilding margin, and we have every confidence that we can do both of those based off of the plans that we've outlined for fiscal year '24 and beyond. Yes. So 2 things. Prior to the cyber-attack, we had a number of particular cybersecurity measures in place, including endpoint detection and response tools across our enterprise. And as we experience this, we continue as we bring our systems online to enhance those and taking a series is to further strengthen our security controls. So that's 1 bucket. \n Second, of course, is we are in the middle of our digital transformation, as you note, and we continue to be deeply committed to that digital transformation. We think we have taken into account the broad set of tools and capabilities that we need to put in place to be more effective and efficient as part of that digital transformation. And we think more strongly than ever that is an important to our business and a critical priority to do that. What we are doing now is going through that program and ensuring any learnings we have over the last couple of months we're integrating into it. And then we're taking that into account as we bring the ERP online in the future and as we bring the rest of the tools in place. \n But what I would say at this point is, it's too early to say if there will be any tactical changes that we'll make and how we'll sequence and time that. But what I can reaffirm is our deep commitment to it, how critical we think it is to the company. And it is just more reaffirmed given what we've experienced over the last few months as we've restarted our systems. Sorry, Javier, I was just going to build on Kevin's response to your question. The other thing I would just note is this is actually a fairly complex business. We compete in 13 categories in over 100 countries around the world. And we're aggregating all that information in a manual environment to understand the impacts. In addition to that, we are working with all of our retailers and supplier partners who then have to transition to a manual process with us and getting our arms around exactly the implications and timing. So I just wanted to note, it is actually a rather complex business and one where -- when we are in a manual environment, you could understand how difficult it would be to have full visibility to all parts of that. And as Kevin said, our commitment was to transparency and giving information as we had it, which you saw in those series of 8-Ks. Thank you, everyone. We look forward to speaking with you again on our next call. And until then, please stay well."
