And at this time, I'd like to introduce your host for today's call, Shawn Amini, Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead. \nShawn Amini: Good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Texas Pacific Land Corporation's fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Yesterday afternoon, the company released its financial results and filed its Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available on the Investors section of the company's website at www.texaspacific.com. As a reminder, remarks made on today's conference call may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. We do not undertake any obligation to update our forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. For a more detailed discussion of the factors that may affect the company's results, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings. During this call, we will also be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. More information and reconciliations about these non-GAAP financial measures are contained in our earnings release and SEC filings. Please also note, we may at times refer to our company by its stock ticker TPL. This morning's conference call is hosted by TPL's Chief Executive Officer, Ty Glover; and Chief Financial Officer, Chris Steddum. Management will make some prepared comments, after which we will open the call for questions. Now, I will turn the call over to Ty.\nTy Glover: I'm pleased to report that TPL finished 2021 in record fashion. The upward momentum we saw last quarter continued into the fourth quarter, with consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $130 million and daily royalty production of 22,000 barrels of oil equivalent. Likewise, for full year 2021, this was the best year in our company's history by almost any measure. Reflecting back on 2021, the year began with a lot of uncertainty on how the pandemic would turn out. Domestic and global demand for oil products were still far below pre-pandemic levels. Oil prices were below $50 and natural gas under $2.50. Levels I'm not sure anyone in the industry was excited about. But TPL has navigated through the worst of the volatility of 2020 and so we entered 2021 hopeful for a better year. As the year progressed, the global economy and commodity markets did experience some volatility, but overall they continued an upward trend. By midyear, we had $70 oil and $4 natural gas and the industry, particularly in the Permian, seem to find some solid footing. Our source water sales, which are a leading indicator of activity, started to noticeably pick up. You can see rig counts and frac crews also tick up week by week and our regular discussions with operators reaffirm that activity would be supportive of Permian production. While the first half of 2021 could be characterized as slow and steady, the second half of the year is when activity started to ramp up, especially on TPL acreage, compelling full year 2021 royalty production growth of 15% compared to full year 2020 production. Commodity prices also steadily improved throughout 2021, with TPL's full year 2021 all-in average commodity price realization over 80% higher than 2020 realization. Because TPL was completely unhedged for the entirety of the year, we were able to fully benefit from higher commodity prices. The combined impact of higher production and higher commodity prices resulted in TPL's oil and gas royalties more than doubling in 2021 compared to the prior year. Our non-oil and gas royalty revenue stream also saw meaningful growth in 2021. Source water and produced water royalties had year-over-year revenue growth of 24% and 15% respectively. Our easements and surface-related income was down modestly year-over-year, as producers continue to focus development around existing infrastructure and continued to draw down DUCs. In aggregate, our non-oil and gas royalty activities generated $164 million of revenue during 2021. In summary TPL's consolidated 2021 revenues of $451 million are 49% higher than the prior year. Our 2021 total operating expenses only increased by 4% versus 2020. As a result, the majority of revenue growth dropped to our bottom line. Looking ahead, we hope to carry the momentum from the second half of 2021 into 2022. With current commodity prices at levels that we haven't seen in nearly a decade, we see continued strong Permian development activity, including strong completion numbers on our gassy Loving, Northern Reeves and Culberson acreage. We've also seen strong permitting drilling and completion activities on our Midland Basin footprint, particularly the Midland royalty interest that we've acquired over the last few years are seeing strong operator activity. Gas well completions on acquired royalty interest exceeding TPL's legacy Midland and CRIs [ph]. In the Delaware, overall operator development seems to be a bit more skewed towards the New Mexico side, while activity on our Texas Northern Delaware footprint remains solid. For source water, the strong sales volumes we saw through the second half of 2021 have persisted into 2022. Operators continue to drill longer laterals and are deploying more simul fracs and zipper fracs these accelerated completion techniques require millions of barrels of water delivered over the course of just a few days. These types of completion methods benefit TPL, as our extensive source water infrastructure can accommodate the most demanding operators. On the produced water side, we continue to generate high margin and stable revenue stream. Our produced water volumes have moderated somewhat recently, as we see producers focus heavily on the New Mexico side of the Northern Delaware. But we expect produced water volumes to grow, as we are still seeing healthy development activity across both our Delaware and Midland surface acreage. Turning to surface leases easements and materials, which we refer to as SLEM the business has been the slowest to recover from pre-pandemic levels as producers continue to draw down DUCs to focus development around existing infrastructure, which has reduced surface revenue opportunities. We continue to see DUC drawdowns at a pretty healthy clip. As producers continue to add more rigs and as pad development extends beyond existing infrastructure revenue opportunities for SLEM should increase. We also continue to work hard on next-gen opportunities. This past January, we executed an agreement with Texas A&M AgriLife Extension to begin assessing and eventually implementing soil carbon sequestration opportunities across a few land plots spanning approximately 20,000 acres. Our goal with this project is to generate authenticated carbon credit, we can then use to offset our own Scope 1and Scope 2 emissions or also potentially monetize them. We continue to work on many other next-gen opportunities and we hope to share more updates in the near future. On capital allocation our Board raised our base dividend by $0.25 to $3 per share. More broadly our capital allocation priorities are still predicated on long-term value creation, and we continue to see attractive acquisition opportunities in the market. There are a number of structural factors that are motivating sellers, which include upstream, public valuations and significant discounts to historic level institutional capital drying up, for legacy oil and gas assets and zero mandates driving asset portfolio reduction and increasing legislative and regulatory uncertainty and complexity. With our exceptional legacy asset base our ability to manage royalties and surface our strong balance sheet and attractive cost of capital we're in a uniquely advantaged position to purchase assets at attractive prices. All that said, we won't be underwriting acquisitions for the near term or long term $90 oil bed. We remain disciplined and focused. We're not trying to grow for the sake of growth itself. Rather, we want to add more royalty production, more free cash flow, more surface more next-gen cash flows, on a per share basis on a near-term and long-term basis. Our stock price continues to be dislocated while underlying fundamentals remain strong and TPL retained a lot of flexibility to execute buybacks dividends and possibly special dividends. Our capital allocation strategy is agnostic across methods and we will pursue those strategies that will have the most long-term value for shareholders. So if that means buying back stock, then we will buy back a lot of stock. If that means increasing our dividend, we can increase our regular dividend and issue special dividends. Finally, I wanted to spend some time talking about the seismicity issues in the Permian and recent regulatory actions. As many are aware, Texas and New Mexico regulators have established certain seismic response areas or otherwise referred to as SRAs to outline regions experiencing an increase in seismic activity. Seismic activity in these areas has been attributed in part to saltwater disposal wells, otherwise known SWDs. In short, it's generally understood that disposing of produced water in deep subsurface zones along preexisting faults is likely instigating seismic activity. Thus, the primary attention for regulators and the industry is to try and limit SWD injection rates within these sensitive areas. So far, there have been two SRAs in Midland and one in the Delaware imposed by the Texas Railroad Commission. Only the Delaware SRAs that spans Northern, Culberson and Reeves counties overlaps with TPL surface acreage. Regulators here have requested that operators limit daily downhole injection volumes and operators have generally been able to accommodate these limits, without much disruption to ongoing development and production activities. Specific to TPL, the Culberson-Reeves SRA covers a fraction of the SWDs located on TPL surface. Over the years, we've been deliberate in spacing SWDs throughout our surface footprint. As a reminder, TPL does not own or operate disposal wells or related SWD infrastructure. Rather our produced water royalties are derived and governed by previously negotiated long-term contracts. Most of these contracts are acreage dedications covering around 450,000 acres where TPL generates the fee for produced water that is stored directly on or travels across our land. Even if a specific disposal well on or near TPL surface gets shut down, as long as that diverted water crosses our checkerboarded surface footprint to another well on or off TPL surface, we will continue to generate a royalty fee. With this contract structure, no matter what happens to produced water, whether stored transported across treated or read, TPL will generate a fee. As said years ago that, the Delaware's high water cuts would likely necessitate multiple solutions as development increases and our contracts were designed specifically with this in mind, allowing TPL to participate in the value chain regardless of outcome. Longer term, if SWDs or areas adjacent to our surface footprint can shut down or restricted from accepting incremental produced water volumes, the diverted water that ends up crossing TPL surface to access nearby disposal wells or infrastructure will have to pay us a fee. We believe that longer term our produced water royalties will ultimately benefit given that we can provide logistical, solution flexibility across a vast surface footprint. We've already held many discussions with upstream and midstream operators on this issue, and I can assure you that, the industry is committed to finding a sustainable resolution. We're not just seeking ways to deal with current produced water volumes and much of the efforts are also focused on how to proactively implement longer-term best practices to accommodate future development. But it's still early solutions are likely to entail a mix of options such as perhaps storing produced water in shallower geologic zones, taking greater care to space SWDs further, apart and more recycling. We're also actively looking at options beyond just downhole injection that would involve new technologies geared towards reuse and repurposing. Fortunately, for us our surface footprint and vertically integrated model allows us to explore every available option and we can help facilitate and execute on those solutions for the benefit of all stakeholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris to discuss our 2021 fourth quarter and year-end financial results.\nChris Steddum: Beginning with our operating results. Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $147.2 million compared to $74.3 million for the same quarter last year, a 98% year-over-year increase. The increase in revenues is primarily from higher royalty production, higher commodity prices, higher sourced water sales volumes and higher produced water volumes. We were able to fully benefit from rising commodity prices as we were completely unhedged during the quarter and we remain unhedged today. For the fourth quarter of 2021, we had net income of $79 million or $10.21 per share. This compares to $44.8 million of net income or $5.77 per share in the same quarter of the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $130.3 million compared to $61.2 million for the same period last year. Oil and gas royalty production volumes were approximately 22,000 Boe per day in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to 17,000 Boe per day for the fourth quarter 2020. Production this quarter benefited from increased activity on our royalty acreage and from production associated with periods prior to the beginning of the most recent quarter. At the end of the fourth quarter 2021, TPL's royalty acreage had 7.2 net well permits 6.6 net drilled, but uncompleted wells 2.5 net completed wells and 48.1 net producing wells. Moving to the expense side. Our operating expenses were $21.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, up from $19.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Turning to our balance sheet. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had $428 million of cash and cash equivalents, and we continue to carry no debt. In the fourth quarter of 2021, capital expenditures were $4.9 million which was primarily spent on electrifying our water sourcing infrastructure and investments in corporate assets. On February 11th 2022, our Board declared a cash dividend of $3 per common share payable on March 15th to shareholders of record as of March 8th. This represents a $0.25 increase from our most recent regular dividend. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we bought back 6,979 shares of stock at an average per share price of $1,248. With that, operator, we will now take questions.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we'll begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Derrick Whitfield from Stifel. Please go ahead with your question.\nDerrick Whitfield: Sure. Good morning all and congrats on a strong year-end.\nTy Glover: Thanks Derrick. Good morning.\nDerrick Whitfield: With my first question, I wanted to focus on, your views on return of capital in light of the health of your business and your balance sheet. Could you share with us your thoughts on where the best opportunities lie as you balance your growth versus return of capital priorities over the next few quarters? And more specifically, on return of capital, what do you perceive as the best mechanism to affect return of capital in light of your stock performance?\nTy Glover: Yeah. Look, I would say, -- like I said in my prepared remarks as far as return on capital or return of capital, if our stock price continues to remain dislocated for a period of time then we'll look at increasing buybacks. We just raised our regular dividend. And so I think, we've got a lot of flexibility there. And at the end of the day we're a rate of return-driven organization, so just wherever we feel like we can get the best return.\nDerrick Whitfield: Okay. That's certainly fair. And then, with my follow-up, I wanted to focus on corporate governance. It's a topic that's likely received undue attention as a result of your stock and the performance. More specifically, I wanted to ask, if you guys could speak to the process the Board is following to evaluate the Dana McGinnis resignation. And the vote from last year's Annual Meeting to de-stagger the Board and perhaps provide reasonable timeline for the progression of these developments.\nTy Glover: Yeah. So that process is being handled by the Nomination and Governance Committee. As we announced after the voting results were released that process is being handled by the committee which consists of three independent directors. And I would just say one of those directors is our largest shareholder. And the process for both is definitely a priority. It's something that they're working on. And I certainly wouldn't take a lack of public disclosure as an indication of lack of progress. There's a 90-day timeframe there, where the Board has to make that decision and publicly disclose that. And so right now we're waiting on the Nom and Gov Committee to make a recommendation to the Board.\nDerrick Whitfield: Appreciate that, Ty. And if then, I could ask another follow-up or two. I wanted to see if you could broadly speak to your business outlook over the next six to 12 months. As we think about the considerable increase in industry activity we've observed and Chevron and ExxonMobil disclosures, it would seem to us that you guys are positioned for relatively strong double-digit growth. Is that a fair statement?\nChris Steddum: Hi Derrick, this is Chris. I'll maybe field that one. When we look around, I guess, you're correct, you've got a couple of operators out there, like the two you mentioned who are definitely steering people towards pretty strong growth. One thing I would just keep in mind when you think about us and you look at Chevron and Exxon as examples, they are still a meaningful piece of TPL's production profile, water sales and disposal. But each of those tends to hover kind of around the 10% ZIP code. And so although those two are talking about strong growth when we look across the broader portfolio, I think we also tend to see that being offset by some of the other operators who are more single digit to flat profiles. And when I couple that and I look at our near-term inventory, right, so looking at like the current DUC count, we've definitely seen a drawdown that's been occurring over the course of the last year. And at the current rate of drilling, I'm not sure that there's been a replenishment. And so although we certainly have enough DUCs and wells that are in the completed category about to come online to produce some growth, I'm not sure if we feel comfortable saying robust double-digit growth. I think the robust growth we saw last year included a couple of quarters of incredibly strong completion activity like over three net wells. And as we look in the fourth quarter, all the data is not in, but I would suspect we'll be just over two net wells that were completed in the fourth quarter. And so it feels like there may have been a little bit of a slowdown from what was an incredibly fast pace in the middle of 2021. And so when we think about those activity levels, right now I wouldn't say that we see the same levels as we saw in 2021. But I still think it's going to be a strong year, we've got a nice backlog of inventory and so we certainly will expect to see some continued growth.\nDerrick Whitfield: Thanks Chris. And then lastly, Ty thanks for your commentary on seismicity and taking that head on during the call. With the understanding that you guys have tight controls around the density of SWD wells, could you speak to your projected near and longer term business impacts if any?\nTy Glover: Yeah. So I would just say in the SRA that affects our property, the RFC has just implemented recommendations that operators reduce capacity in some of the wells. But I will say that the way that we've contracted that side of the business as far as acreage dedications and big AMIs and the royalty on a lot of the pipelines instead of the wells as water is diverted from one well to another, it doesn't really affect our business because of the way those contracts are structured. And that royalty is either on the pipeline or it's on an AMI, so water can move around within the development area and we will still get that royalty fee. I think some of the issues could be beneficial. Just because of the structure of those contracts we could see some water come to us through some of this increased regulation. So we're in constant communication with our operators with midstream companies and with the RFC to stay ahead of the issue and be a part of the solution because the last thing we want is for it to hold up development. And so I feel like with our involvement and the action that the industry is taking that we will be in a good place and we'll find a good solution for the problem.\nDerrick Whitfield: That\u2019s great guys. Thanks for your time and responses.\nTy Glover: Thanks Derrick\nChris Steddum: Thanks Derrick\nOperator: Our next question comes from Hamed Khorsand from BWS Financial. Please go ahead with your question.\nHamed Khorsand: Hi, good morning. Would you be able to provide some details as to the misstatement on your taxes and how you've justified it going forward as far as the corrections you've made?\nChris Steddum: Yeah, hey, Hamed this is Chris. Yeah, let me give you just a little bit of background and color. As that's come in -- and one of the things that both myself and Stephanie Buffington, our CAO wanted to do was take a look at some of our advisers. And so you guys have probably seen, we engaged Deloitte as our new auditor this year. And we also went and engaged a new tax adviser. And as we worked with that tax adviser looking at both our current taxes and some historical periods, they came to the conclusion that the depletion that had been taken in the past was more than was allowed. So we really diligenced that and wanted to make sure that that conclusion was correct. And the team came to the same conclusion as our tax adviser that it had been incorrectly done in the past. And so what that misstatement is, is a correction of that past depletion amount from 2018 through 2020. And so I think the -- to put it in perspective, you're talking about just over $10 million $12 million $13 million over the course of three years, against billions of dollars' worth of $1 billion worth of revenue. And so in terms of the materiality, it's a fairly immaterial adjustment and that's why it didn't require a full restatement of financials. And so we're looking to put in place a lot of controls now to make sure that something like that won't occur in the future. But I think we're glad that we were able to find it make the correction and move forward. And so I think that's kind of where it stands. That's a little bit of background on what that is and we've definitely got a plan in place to get it all fixed in the future.\nHamed Khorsand: Okay. Great. And then the other question I had was just given where the price of oil is and producers just focusing on the DUCs they already have, is there any actions or strategies you're looking to undertake to take advantage of your land that's not being accessed right now be it either through using your balance sheet to finance producers or anything like that, just given that there's not a lot of drilling or new drilling occurring?\nTy Glover: I would say we're not considering any options as far as like financing and operators drilling program. We have seen a big drawdown in DUCs which means operators are probably going to need to add some rigs this year. So we're just making sure that we can do everything we can to make it easier for them to access and develop our land versus the acreage next door. And so that's what we focused on in the past, making sure they have the appropriate easements and infrastructure in place, making sure they have a sustainable source of water for completion, making sure they have somewhere to go in that produced water so that we can get wells turned online quicker and reduce costs and time lags for the operators. So that's where our focus is just using our assets to make it easier for those guys to develop.\nHamed Khorsand: Okay. And my last question was just given the amount of shares you bought back in this past year, is there a timing or any intention to announce a new stock buyback program? And would it be bigger than what you implemented in 2021?\nChris Steddum: Hamed, I think as Ty said, I mean we're probably not going to give guidance on that. But it's certainly something clearly with where the price is right now that we're going to consider and take a look at. And at the end of the day, that is a Board-level decision and it's certainly something they're focused on and we will communicate once any decision gets made.\nHamed Khorsand: Great. Thank you letting me ask questions.\nChris Steddum: Thanks, Hamed.\nTyler Glover: Thanks, Hamed.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Chris Baker from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.\nChris Baker: Hey, good morning, guys. Derrick covered a lot of this but maybe a few different angles on the big topics. First question is just on the impressive growth in oil and gas production this quarter. I'm just curious if you could share any insight into what drove that result. And perhaps if you could share what the growth would have been on an organic basis, just backing out any accrual noise just in terms of the organic growth profile this year would be great?\nChris Steddum: Sure. Hey, Chris. Yeah, I think one of the big drivers I think as I kind of mentioned when I talked to Derrick is in Q2 and Q3 the level of completions that happened across our property were about as high as they've ever been. Any time we've been over three net completions that has marked really strong performance. In fact, the only time I can think of when we had three net completions was in the first quarter of 2020, right before the pandemic hit. So that was kind of the end of a culmination of a real high activity level through 2019 and early 2020. And so to have two quarters, Q2 and Q3 of 2021 where we also have that level of completion activity. I think that was really the big driver of the robust growth that we saw in 2021. And I would still say, like you see with us and even some of our peers in times of high growth, you definitely get some increasing accrual activity as it comes to like the royalty production. But I would still say, if you compare our full year production number to the 2020 production number, that's a pretty fair comparison of the actual organic growth that you saw across those assets. The vast majority -- sometimes on average you probably have a two-month lag, three-month lag for gas and NGLs, and so sometimes you certainly have checks that come in from beyond that period. But I think if you look at the whole year for 2021 compared to the whole year for 2020 that really should give you a good idea of the growth profile.\nChris Baker: Okay, great. And then, just on the acquisition front, it does seem like the retained cash going towards acquisitions is sort of the strategy today. Any sort of color on factors that you think might have prevented you from deploying capital there? Just curious if you could make any comments around the nice spread that you're seeing in the market.\nTy Glover: Yes. I mean there's definitely a lot of competition in the Permian. Right now people are really paying up for near-term development. I would say, in 2021, we looked at a lot of deals. We said in the past the bar's really high. But we actually evaluated over $2 billion worth of deals in 2021. We didn't transact for a number of reasons. But, I would say I think that should give everyone comfort that we are being disciplined and that we do transact and we won't be overpaying for anything. So -- and you're right about the cash balance. Right now, we haven't authorized any shares. We're very hesitant to use the leverage for M&A. And so, keeping that dry powder for future growth is really the only form of capital that we have right now to grow the business.\nChris Baker: Okay, great. And then just my last question on governance. You guys had mentioned the 90-day mark on the McGinnis end. Any color you can share in terms of the time line to get sort of a firmer view on de-staggering or an outcome in terms of that piece of the annual meeting?\nTy Glover: Yes. I mean that's being handled the same way as Dana McGinnis' resignation by the Nom and Gov Committee. And they're -- right now, they have not provided the Board an update. But as soon as I have an update, you guys will have one shortly thereafter.\nChris Baker: Okay, great. So, fair to think that we'll get some sort of announcement later this year?\nTy Glover: Yes, that's fair.\nChris Baker: Okay, great. Thanks guys.\nTy Glover: Thanks, Chris.\nChris Steddum: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that we'll end today's question-and-answer session as well as today's conference call. We do thank everyone for joining today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

More broadly our capital allocation priorities are still predicated on long-term value creation, and we continue to see attractive acquisition opportunities in the market. There are a number of structural factors that are motivating sellers, which include upstream, public valuations and significant discounts to historic level institutional capital drying up, for legacy oil and gas assets and zero mandates driving asset portfolio reduction and increasing legislative and regulatory uncertainty and complexity. With our exceptional legacy asset base our ability to manage royalties and surface our strong balance sheet and attractive cost of capital we're in a uniquely advantaged position to purchase assets at attractive prices. All that said, we won't be underwriting acquisitions for the near term or long term $90 oil bed. We remain disciplined and focused. We're not trying to grow for the sake of growth itself. Rather, we want to add more royalty production, more free cash flow, more surface more next-gen cash flows, on a per share basis on a near-term and long-term basis. Our stock price continues to be dislocated while underlying fundamentals remain strong and TPL retained a lot of flexibility to execute buybacks dividends and possibly special dividends. Our capital allocation strategy is agnostic across methods and we will pursue those strategies that will have the most long-term value for shareholders. So if that means buying back stock, then we will buy back a lot of stock. If that means increasing our dividend, we can increase our regular dividend and issue special dividends. Finally, I wanted to spend some time talking about the seismicity issues in the Permian and recent regulatory actions. As many are aware, Texas and New Mexico regulators have established certain seismic response areas or otherwise referred to as SRAs to outline regions experiencing an increase in seismic activity. Seismic activity in these areas has been attributed in part to saltwater disposal wells, otherwise known SWDs. In short, it's generally understood that disposing of produced water in deep subsurface zones along preexisting faults is likely instigating seismic activity. Thus, the primary attention for regulators and the industry is to try and limit SWD injection rates within these sensitive areas. So far, there have been two SRAs in Midland and one in the Delaware imposed by the Texas Railroad Commission. Only the Delaware SRAs that spans Northern, Culberson and Reeves counties overlaps with TPL surface acreage. Regulators here have requested that operators limit daily downhole injection volumes and operators have generally been able to accommodate these limits, without much disruption to ongoing development and production activities. Specific to TPL, the Culberson-Reeves SRA covers a fraction of the SWDs located on TPL surface. Over the years, we've been deliberate in spacing SWDs throughout our surface footprint. As a reminder, TPL does not own or operate disposal wells or related SWD infrastructure. Rather our produced water royalties are derived and governed by previously negotiated long-term contracts. Most of these contracts are acreage dedications covering around 450,000 acres where TPL generates the fee for produced water that is stored directly on or travels across our land. Even if a specific disposal well on or near TPL surface gets shut down, as long as that diverted water crosses our checkerboarded surface footprint to another well on or off TPL surface, we will continue to generate a royalty fee. With this contract structure, no matter what happens to produced water, whether stored transported across treated or read, TPL will generate a fee. As said years ago that, the Delaware's high water cuts would likely necessitate multiple solutions as development increases and our contracts were designed specifically with this in mind, allowing TPL to participate in the value chain regardless of outcome. Longer term, if SWDs or areas adjacent to our surface footprint can shut down or restricted from accepting incremental produced water volumes, the diverted water that ends up crossing TPL surface to access nearby disposal wells or infrastructure will have to pay us a fee. We believe that longer term our produced water royalties will ultimately benefit given that we can provide logistical, solution flexibility across a vast surface footprint. We've already held many discussions with upstream and midstream operators on this issue, and I can assure you that, the industry is committed to finding a sustainable resolution. We're not just seeking ways to deal with current produced water volumes and much of the efforts are also focused on how to proactively implement longer-term best practices to accommodate future development. But it's still early solutions are likely to entail a mix of options such as perhaps storing produced water in shallower geologic zones, taking greater care to space SWDs further, apart and more recycling. We're also actively looking at options beyond just downhole injection that would involve new technologies geared towards reuse and repurposing. Fortunately, for us our surface footprint and vertically integrated model allows us to explore every available option and we can help facilitate and execute on those solutions for the benefit of all stakeholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris to discuss our 2021 fourth quarter and year-end financial results. Thanks Derrick. Good morning. Yeah. Look, I would say, -- like I said in my prepared remarks as far as return on capital or return of capital, if our stock price continues to remain dislocated for a period of time then we'll look at increasing buybacks. We just raised our regular dividend. And so I think, we've got a lot of flexibility there. And at the end of the day we're a rate of return-driven organization, so just wherever we feel like we can get the best return. Yeah. So that process is being handled by the Nomination and Governance Committee. As we announced after the voting results were released that process is being handled by the committee which consists of three independent directors. And I would just say one of those directors is our largest shareholder. And the process for both is definitely a priority. It's something that they're working on. And I certainly wouldn't take a lack of public disclosure as an indication of lack of progress. There's a 90-day timeframe there, where the Board has to make that decision and publicly disclose that. And so right now we're waiting on the Nom and Gov Committee to make a recommendation to the Board. Yeah. So I would just say in the SRA that affects our property, the RFC has just implemented recommendations that operators reduce capacity in some of the wells. But I will say that the way that we've contracted that side of the business as far as acreage dedications and big AMIs and the royalty on a lot of the pipelines instead of the wells as water is diverted from one well to another, it doesn't really affect our business because of the way those contracts are structured. And that royalty is either on the pipeline or it's on an AMI, so water can move around within the development area and we will still get that royalty fee. I think some of the issues could be beneficial. Just because of the structure of those contracts we could see some water come to us through some of this increased regulation. So we're in constant communication with our operators with midstream companies and with the RFC to stay ahead of the issue and be a part of the solution because the last thing we want is for it to hold up development. And so I feel like with our involvement and the action that the industry is taking that we will be in a good place and we'll find a good solution for the problem. Thanks Derrick I would say we're not considering any options as far as like financing and operators drilling program. We have seen a big drawdown in DUCs which means operators are probably going to need to add some rigs this year. So we're just making sure that we can do everything we can to make it easier for them to access and develop our land versus the acreage next door. And so that's what we focused on in the past, making sure they have the appropriate easements and infrastructure in place, making sure they have a sustainable source of water for completion, making sure they have somewhere to go in that produced water so that we can get wells turned online quicker and reduce costs and time lags for the operators. So that's where our focus is just using our assets to make it easier for those guys to develop. Yes. I mean there's definitely a lot of competition in the Permian. Right now people are really paying up for near-term development. I would say, in 2021, we looked at a lot of deals. We said in the past the bar's really high. But we actually evaluated over $2 billion worth of deals in 2021. We didn't transact for a number of reasons. But, I would say I think that should give everyone comfort that we are being disciplined and that we do transact and we won't be overpaying for anything. So -- and you're right about the cash balance. Right now, we haven't authorized any shares. We're very hesitant to use the leverage for M&A. And so, keeping that dry powder for future growth is really the only form of capital that we have right now to grow the business. Yes. I mean that's being handled the same way as Dana McGinnis' resignation by the Nom and Gov Committee. And they're -- right now, they have not provided the Board an update. But as soon as I have an update, you guys will have one shortly thereafter. Yes, that's fair. Thanks, Chris."

            "name": "Chris Steddum",
            "content": "Beginning with our operating results. Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $147.2 million compared to $74.3 million for the same quarter last year, a 98% year-over-year increase. The increase in revenues is primarily from higher royalty production, higher commodity prices, higher sourced water sales volumes and higher produced water volumes. We were able to fully benefit from rising commodity prices as we were completely unhedged during the quarter and we remain unhedged today. For the fourth quarter of 2021, we had net income of $79 million or $10.21 per share. This compares to $44.8 million of net income or $5.77 per share in the same quarter of the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $130.3 million compared to $61.2 million for the same period last year. Oil and gas royalty production volumes were approximately 22,000 Boe per day in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to 17,000 Boe per day for the fourth quarter 2020. Production this quarter benefited from increased activity on our royalty acreage and from production associated with periods prior to the beginning of the most recent quarter. At the end of the fourth quarter 2021, TPL's royalty acreage had 7.2 net well permits 6.6 net drilled, but uncompleted wells 2.5 net completed wells and 48.1 net producing wells. Moving to the expense side. Our operating expenses were $21.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, up from $19.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Turning to our balance sheet. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had $428 million of cash and cash equivalents, and we continue to carry no debt. In the fourth quarter of 2021, capital expenditures were $4.9 million which was primarily spent on electrifying our water sourcing infrastructure and investments in corporate assets. On February 11th 2022, our Board declared a cash dividend of $3 per common share payable on March 15th to shareholders of record as of March 8th. This represents a $0.25 increase from our most recent regular dividend. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we bought back 6,979 shares of stock at an average per share price of $1,248. With that, operator, we will now take questions. Hi Derrick, this is Chris. I'll maybe field that one. When we look around, I guess, you're correct, you've got a couple of operators out there, like the two you mentioned who are definitely steering people towards pretty strong growth. One thing I would just keep in mind when you think about us and you look at Chevron and Exxon as examples, they are still a meaningful piece of TPL's production profile, water sales and disposal. But each of those tends to hover kind of around the 10% ZIP code. And so although those two are talking about strong growth when we look across the broader portfolio, I think we also tend to see that being offset by some of the other operators who are more single digit to flat profiles. And when I couple that and I look at our near-term inventory, right, so looking at like the current DUC count, we've definitely seen a drawdown that's been occurring over the course of the last year. And at the current rate of drilling, I'm not sure that there's been a replenishment. And so although we certainly have enough DUCs and wells that are in the completed category about to come online to produce some growth, I'm not sure if we feel comfortable saying robust double-digit growth. I think the robust growth we saw last year included a couple of quarters of incredibly strong completion activity like over three net wells. And as we look in the fourth quarter, all the data is not in, but I would suspect we'll be just over two net wells that were completed in the fourth quarter. And so it feels like there may have been a little bit of a slowdown from what was an incredibly fast pace in the middle of 2021. And so when we think about those activity levels, right now I wouldn't say that we see the same levels as we saw in 2021. But I still think it's going to be a strong year, we've got a nice backlog of inventory and so we certainly will expect to see some continued growth. Thanks Derrick Yeah, hey, Hamed this is Chris. Yeah, let me give you just a little bit of background and color. As that's come in -- and one of the things that both myself and Stephanie Buffington, our CAO wanted to do was take a look at some of our advisers. And so you guys have probably seen, we engaged Deloitte as our new auditor this year. And we also went and engaged a new tax adviser. And as we worked with that tax adviser looking at both our current taxes and some historical periods, they came to the conclusion that the depletion that had been taken in the past was more than was allowed. So we really diligenced that and wanted to make sure that that conclusion was correct. And the team came to the same conclusion as our tax adviser that it had been incorrectly done in the past. And so what that misstatement is, is a correction of that past depletion amount from 2018 through 2020. And so I think the -- to put it in perspective, you're talking about just over $10 million $12 million $13 million over the course of three years, against billions of dollars' worth of $1 billion worth of revenue. And so in terms of the materiality, it's a fairly immaterial adjustment and that's why it didn't require a full restatement of financials. And so we're looking to put in place a lot of controls now to make sure that something like that won't occur in the future. But I think we're glad that we were able to find it make the correction and move forward. And so I think that's kind of where it stands. That's a little bit of background on what that is and we've definitely got a plan in place to get it all fixed in the future. Hamed, I think as Ty said, I mean we're probably not going to give guidance on that. But it's certainly something clearly with where the price is right now that we're going to consider and take a look at. And at the end of the day, that is a Board-level decision and it's certainly something they're focused on and we will communicate once any decision gets made. Thanks, Hamed. Sure. Hey, Chris. Yeah, I think one of the big drivers I think as I kind of mentioned when I talked to Derrick is in Q2 and Q3 the level of completions that happened across our property were about as high as they've ever been. Any time we've been over three net completions that has marked really strong performance. In fact, the only time I can think of when we had three net completions was in the first quarter of 2020, right before the pandemic hit. So that was kind of the end of a culmination of a real high activity level through 2019 and early 2020. And so to have two quarters, Q2 and Q3 of 2021 where we also have that level of completion activity. I think that was really the big driver of the robust growth that we saw in 2021. And I would still say, like you see with us and even some of our peers in times of high growth, you definitely get some increasing accrual activity as it comes to like the royalty production. But I would still say, if you compare our full year production number to the 2020 production number, that's a pretty fair comparison of the actual organic growth that you saw across those assets. The vast majority -- sometimes on average you probably have a two-month lag, three-month lag for gas and NGLs, and so sometimes you certainly have checks that come in from beyond that period. But I think if you look at the whole year for 2021 compared to the whole year for 2020 that really should give you a good idea of the growth profile. Thanks, Chris."

Management will make some prepared comments, after which we will open the call for questions. Now, I will turn the call over to Ty.\nTyler Glover: Thank you, Shawn, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter 2021 was a tremendous quarter. TPL set quarterly records for consolidated adjusted EBITDA and royalty production. This was our second best quarter for revenues in our water business and what a difference a year makes. Compared to the same quarter last year, our total consolidated revenues are up 66%, royalty daily production is up 24%, total water revenues are up 51% and total consolidated free cash flow is up 60%. Although the past 18 months have been among the toughest we\u2019ve seen in the industry, TPL\u2019s vertically integrated business model, high margin cash flows and strong balance sheet allowed us to successfully navigate through the downturn. One metric we focus on and prioritize and I think demonstrates the resiliency and quality of our overall business is our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin. For the first half of 2021, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 83%. Amongst members of the S&P Oil and Gas Exploration & Production Index, which includes TPL, our first half 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin was the highest of the group. If TPL were a member of the S&P 500, our adjusted EBITDA margin would have been in the Top 10 for the same period. For this most recent quarter, our adjusted EBITDA margin has improved even further to 87%. Today, with higher commodity prices and continued growth in the Permian Basin, combined with years of hard work by the TPL team in developing and executing our vertically integrated business model, we\u2019re pleased to be in a position to fully capture the value from our asset base. Our active management approach has taken our legacy asset base, which was both ideally situated yet raw and undeveloped and created multiple high quality cash flow streams. To this point, today, I want to highlight and elaborate on our water business. Our water business is a clear example of the benefits of our active management approach. Prior to active management, TPL had minimal revenues outside of its legacy production royalty interest despite owning close to 1 million surface acres in the Permian.  As drilling and completion techniques continued to improve over the last decade, the vast resource potential underlying our royalty assets became increasingly viable. However, development here is not without challenges, especially in the Western part of the Permian, generally known as the Delaware Basin, where majority of our high interest royalties reside.  On the Delaware side of the Permian, the geography tends to be much more arid and just generally inhospitable compared to the Eastern flank of the basin. In fact, Loving County in Texas, which is considered to be part of the core of the Delaware Basin, is the least populated county in the contiguous United States.  Reeves and Covington counties sits to the West of Loving and these counties are no less desolate and arguably even more arid than Loving. These geographical features are relevant because water is scarce in this part of the Delaware. A well development would be impossible without tremendous amounts of water.  Completing a horizontal well otherwise known as fracking requires approximately 0.5 million barrels of water. This lack of water availability was a major reason development in the Delaware Basin initially lagged behind the development in the Midland Basin. That's why in 2017, we formed Texas Pacific Water Resources. This represented a departure from the legacy way of doing business at TPL, which up to that point was mostly passively run with just a handful of employees.  We went out and hired talented and experienced team of professionals from some of the best companies in the industry to execute our plan. From there, we developed two general sides to our new water business, the first being source water and the second being produced water.  Starting with source water, this is where we provide brackish groundwater and to a lesser extent treated produced water to oil and gas operators for use in their well development activities. As surface owners, TPL has the unique right to water aquifers on our land and across our 880,000 surface acres. We have a handful of locations with productive aquifers. Over the last few years, we've invested approximately 105 million in developing aquifer wells, laying transfer pipelines and pumps, constructing frac water storage ponds. We strategically selected and developed this water infrastructure throughout our acreage footprint to efficiently service the greatest number of oil and gas wells across the Permian Basin.  In order to maximize capital efficiency and margins, we generally required producers to come to our frac water ponds to take delivery of our water. From there, the operators take responsibility for developing the infrastructure and managing the logistics, transferring water from our frac ponds to their well beds.  It's worth noting that today, operators generally develop multiple wells simultaneously on a single development pad. Operators have also become more efficient in completing multiple frac stages for multiple wells in an increasingly condensed amount of time. Laterals are also getting much longer.  Thus, operators often need millions of barrels of water delivered over a course of just a few days, which is no easy task if you're trying to source water from multiple small sources. At TPL, we've sized and developed our source water infrastructure to accommodate the needs of the most demanding producers.  The outcome of this very deliberate effort that our source water business was instrumental in enabling and incentivizing production on our royalty acreage in the Delaware. Although development in the overall Delaware has grown tremendously over the last five years, production on our acreage has grown even more.  Additionally, we often sell water for wells that may not be located on our acreage. So our water has been vital for well development in the Delaware even outside of our footprint. And this also drives additional surface revenue for TPL.  During this most recent quarter, over 70% of our source water sales were for wells that were located off of TPL surface, which is directly attributable to the industry relationships our team has. Historically, we estimate that our market share has been approximately 30% of Northern Delaware source water volumes.  We have capability to deliver over 800,000 barrels of water per day without meaningful additional capital expenditures. This past quarter, we delivered 42 million barrels of water to our customers.  I'm confident that without our source water business, oil and gas production in the Delaware overall and production on TPL\u2019s royalties specifically would be meaningfully less than what it is today.  Our water is vital for Permian producers to develop their acreage and we actively leverage our source water and our surface rights to drive more production onto TPL\u2019s royalty acreage.  Today, we have an extremely talented group of people that focus exclusively on serving our customers to encourage production on our land, and to make sure that we are a reliable partner in delivering water. That's worth noting, because our source water is an operated business, and as such, our cash flow margins are understandably lower than our oil and gas royalties business.  Our source water assets still generate strong cash flow margins and profitability. And our investment in the water business has generated meaningful free cash flow. Layer on the additional impact of using our water to incentivize development onto TPL\u2019s royalty acreage, and our source water business has generated tremendous value for our shareholders.  The other side of the water business is referred to as produced water royalties or also referred to as saltwater disposal royalties. This is where we charge a fee for water from a producing oil and gas well that is disposed of on or crosses our land.  As many are already aware, oil and gas wells in the Delaware are unique and that these wells produce a disproportionately high amount of water along with the oil and natural gas volumes compared to other basins.  This associated water is referred to as produced water, and generally the water must either be injected into a saltwater disposal well or treated for reuse elsewhere. Unlike our source water business, our produced water business requires no capital investment from us. Whereas we operate our source water assets so that we can control our own destiny towards incentivizing development.  Our produced water royalties leverage our expansive checkerboard surface footprint to create value. Our customers are generally either operators that own their own infrastructure, or water midstream companies that specialize in handling produced water on behalf of operators.  Because we don't develop, own or operate saltwater disposal wells or the logistics pipelines, our produced water royalties are high margin fee-based cash flows that require no capital expenditures. And because producing wells are almost never shut in outside of rare circumstances, the volumes are very stable.  2020 was a great example of the resiliency of this business. Despite one of the worst down cycles this industry has ever seen and with severely depressed commodity prices, our produced water revenues in 2020 were 30% higher than in 2019.  Again, our produced water business is a testament to our active management approach. Prior to active management, our produced water royalty cash flows were minimal and little time and effort was spent on maximizing its value.  Today, TPL\u2019s management and water teams dedicated tremendous amount of time and effort enforcing our surface rights, negotiating fees at fair value and monitoring compliance.  In summary, over the last 12 months alone, our water business has generated approximately 113 million in revenues and 50 million in net income. Since 2017, when we started the business, we've generated over $445 million in revenues and 210 million of net income.  The water business generates robust free cash flow and requires relatively modest amounts of maintenance capital, approximately $10 million annually. Our investment in people and capital has been a highly profitable endeavor, and we expect our investment to continue generating strong free cash flow and value for our shareholders.  We're extremely proud of the business we have built. We're focused on making it better and more profitable every day, and we're glad that our shareholders can reap those rewards.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Steddum: Beginning with our operating results, for the third quarter of 2021, we had net income of $83.8 million or $10.82 per share. This compares to 46.3 million of net income or $5.97 per share in the same quarter of the prior year. The increase in net income and earnings per share in the third quarter is primarily due to an increase in royalty and source water revenues compared to the third quarter of 2020.  Total revenue for the third quarter of 2021 was $123.7 million compared to $74.4 million for the same quarter last year, a 66% year-over-year increase. Adjusted EBITDA was $107.6 million compared to $62.3 million for the same period last year.  Oil and gas royalty production volumes were approximately 19.5 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter of 2021 compared to 15.7 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day for the third quarter of 2020.  Production this quarter benefited from the increased activity on our royalty acreage and from production associated with periods prior to the beginning of the most recent quarter. We were able to fully benefit from rising oil, natural gas and NGL prices as we were completely unhedged during the quarter, and we currently remain unhedged today. At the end of the third quarter 2021, TPL\u2019s royalty acreage had 7.3 net well permits, 7.8 net drilled but uncompleted wells, 1.9 net completed wells, and 45.5 net producing wells. Water revenue was $36.9 million in the third quarter of 2021, up from 24.5 million in the prior year. This increase was primarily due to year-over-year increases in both source water sales volumes and produced water royalty volumes.  Moving to the expense side, operating expenses were $20.5 million for the third quarter of 2021, up from $17.6 million in the third quarter of 2020. Turning to our balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter, we had $373 million of cash and cash equivalents and we continue to carry no debt.  In the third quarter of 2021, capital expenditures were $6.6 million which was spent on electrifying our sourcing infrastructure and investments in corporate assets. Looking to the balance of 2021, we anticipate spending an additional $3 million to $5 million of capital on our water sourcing infrastructure.  On October 28, our Board declared a cash dividend of $2.75 per common share payable on December 15 to shareholders of record as of December 8. Through September 30, our year-to-date dividends totaled $8.25 per share. Under our recently authorized share repurchase program, we bought back 6,179 shares of stock at an average price per share of $1,406 during the current quarter.  As of September 30, we have completed $11.2 million of share repurchases and have $8.8 million remaining on the current repurchase authorization. In August, TPL released its inaugural ESG disclosure. We believe this is a reflection of our existing commitments and priorities surrounding sustainability, social responsibility and governance.  We look forward to building upon these objectives, and we believe TPL is uniquely positioned to provide collaborative opportunities with customers and companies that operate on our land to drive sustainability and ensure that our industry benefits all stakeholders.  With that, operator, we will now take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. . Our first question is come from the line of John Annis with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.\nJohn Annis: Good morning all, and congrats on a strong update.\nTyler Glover: Good morning.\nJohn Annis: My first question is around that \u2013 good morning. Based on Q3 commentary from Chevron regarding increase in activity in the Permian and the rig adds from privates, can you frame up how you see activity trending in Q4 and into 2022 based on your latest permit scrapes?\nChris Steddum: Yes, sure, John. Hi, this is Chris. Thanks for the question. So yes, we've definitely have seen and continue to see strong permitting activity. As just as reference, in the first quarter that probably on a net permanent basis remain the best quarter that we saw so far this year. Second quarter was a little bit slower, but then we saw another big uptick in the third quarter. And Chevron, for instance, was one of the companies who filed quite a few permits in 3Q and was definitely up from their level of permitting activity on TPL during the first half of the year. And so with the backlog of permits that we see today, I think we view that as a very positive indication for fourth quarter and continuing on into 2022.\nJohn Annis: Great. And then for my follow up, perhaps for Ty, given the increase in commodity prices, could you speak to the A&D market and the current opportunity set? And then perhaps touching on your appetite to pursue potential opportunities?\nTyler Glover: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. We've looked at quite a few deals lately. As we've said, our bar, just for TPL, is pretty high. And the bid-ask spread on those high quality deals has been a little wider in the past, but we're starting to see that narrow with commodity prices where they're at. We see a lot more deals start to come on, hit the market last couple of months. So that's a big positive for us. We've seen a lot of competition on the smaller deals, but starting to see some bigger deals at the market. So we feel really good about it.\nJohn Annis: Perfect. Thanks for the color. And if I could squeeze one last question and thinking about your strong cash position, could you speak to your view on the progression of your return to capital strategy as we look forward in time?\nChris Steddum: Yes. Again, I think like Ty said, when you think about TPL\u2019s capitalization for one, because we carry no debt and no RBL , maintaining a healthy cash balance has always been, and to the extent that remains the case, will always be a big part of our strategy. And so as Ty has alluded, I think when we think about that cash and balance, from our perspective, it provides a lot of optionality and value to us to be able to utilize that in the near term. And so when we think about it, we think that with the opportunity set in front of us, we like having that large cash balance to be able to utilize, if the right opportunity comes along.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of Hamed Khorsand with BWS Financial. Please proceed with your questions.\nHamed Khorsand: Good morning. I just wanted to see -- given that the dynamics of the players involved in the Permian is changing, how does that change your business in any way, as far as elongating negotiations for royalties? Maybe the new players aren't well versed in how the industry works in the Permian?\nTyler Glover: Hi. This is Ty. I would say, most of the consolidation that we've seen has been between like legacy Permian operators, most of whom we have existing relationships with. We have gained a couple of new additional strong relationships through some of the consolidation. But I think, overall, for us, it's been positive across all of our business lines. Just with where our acreage sits, the relationships we have prioritizes some of our acreage that may not have been previous to some of this consolidation. So I would say, overall, it\u2019s been very positive for TPL.\nHamed Khorsand: And my other question was, do you expect increasing your Delaware Basin acreage use in '22? And how much -- if you can talk about how much that would look like?\nTyler Glover: Yes. As Chris alluded to earlier, we saw strong permitting from our top three with Chevron, EOG and Cimarex in third quarter. That's all Delaware Basin. Occi, Shell and Exxon were four, five and six. A vast majority of that\u2019s Delaware Basin as well. So, yes, I think everything that we're seeing indicates stronger activity in the Delaware going forward.\nHamed Khorsand: Okay, great. Thank you.\nChris Steddum: Thanks, Hamed.\nTyler Glover: Thanks, Hamed.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of Chris Baker with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.\nChris Baker: Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to follow up on the strategic outlook. You talked about wanting to retain cash for the right opportunity, which makes some sense. If I think about the inventory depth today, it's already well ahead of peers and clearly between now and the robust growth this quarter. Could you maybe just talk about the kind of opportunities and what\u2019s sort of at the top of your punch list when it comes to potentially deploying that excess cash?\nTyler Glover: Yes. Like I stated before, our bar\u2019s pretty high. So we're looking for very similar quality to what we already own. We like the vertically integrated nature of our assets. So always interested in integrated assets going forward, something -- or we can buy the surface, the minerals got a water component. I don't think our focus has changed any from what we've talked about in the past. Like I said, on those really high quality assets, the bid-ask spread has been a bit wider in the past, but we're starting to see that narrow. So we feel really good about the opportunity set and our ability to transact in the near term. And that's -- as Chris alluded to, that's why we're going to hold on to some dry powder.\nChris Baker: Great. And then just in terms of -- in the sort of potential for that bid-ask spread to remain wider than you'd like, could you maybe talk about the potential for either a special dividend or perhaps an expanded buyback authorization as a way to return cash that you're not able to deploy?\nChris Steddum: Yes. Hi, Chris. Look, certainly, at some point, if it becomes clear the opportunity set for whatever reason bid-ask spread or other isn't materializing, then I think both of those are on the table. And our Board would certainly take a look and see of those two, which makes the most sense, or it could be an increase in both of those as a way to return the capital to shareholders. And so -- but in the near term, we see a lot of opportunity. And so I think we'd like to continue to retain some of the cash. But certainly, at some point, the right thing to do would be to return it to the shareholder base.\nChris Baker: Okay, great. And then just as a follow up, you guys have talked a bit today about the value of active management, which is great to hear. Just hoping if you could kind of frame up the next-gen wind and solar opportunity, just in terms of extrapolating what looks like a small wind power gen exposure today to say 20% or 30% of the unused surface position? Is it possible just to get some rough goalposts around how large a cash flow stream that could grow to over time?\nTyler Glover: Yes. I don't know if we can give you goalposts today. But what I can say is we've got a team dedicated to renewable and next-gen opportunities. They're having some really good conversations right now regarding things like solar, wind, Bitcoin mining, carbon capture, micro-grids. So a lot of conversations with our operators right now around working together on some of these opportunities. So it just again reinforces the importance of the relationships our team has with our operators in the broader industry. So thanks for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. We appreciate your participation. And with that, that does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a great day.",

            "content": "Beginning with our operating results, for the third quarter of 2021, we had net income of $83.8 million or $10.82 per share. This compares to 46.3 million of net income or $5.97 per share in the same quarter of the prior year. The increase in net income and earnings per share in the third quarter is primarily due to an increase in royalty and source water revenues compared to the third quarter of 2020.  Total revenue for the third quarter of 2021 was $123.7 million compared to $74.4 million for the same quarter last year, a 66% year-over-year increase. Adjusted EBITDA was $107.6 million compared to $62.3 million for the same period last year.  Oil and gas royalty production volumes were approximately 19.5 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter of 2021 compared to 15.7 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day for the third quarter of 2020.  Production this quarter benefited from the increased activity on our royalty acreage and from production associated with periods prior to the beginning of the most recent quarter. We were able to fully benefit from rising oil, natural gas and NGL prices as we were completely unhedged during the quarter, and we currently remain unhedged today. At the end of the third quarter 2021, TPL's royalty acreage had 7.3 net well permits, 7.8 net drilled but uncompleted wells, 1.9 net completed wells, and 45.5 net producing wells. Water revenue was $36.9 million in the third quarter of 2021, up from 24.5 million in the prior year. This increase was primarily due to year-over-year increases in both source water sales volumes and produced water royalty volumes.  Moving to the expense side, operating expenses were $20.5 million for the third quarter of 2021, up from $17.6 million in the third quarter of 2020. Turning to our balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter, we had $373 million of cash and cash equivalents and we continue to carry no debt.  In the third quarter of 2021, capital expenditures were $6.6 million which was spent on electrifying our sourcing infrastructure and investments in corporate assets. Looking to the balance of 2021, we anticipate spending an additional $3 million to $5 million of capital on our water sourcing infrastructure.  On October 28, our Board declared a cash dividend of $2.75 per common share payable on December 15 to shareholders of record as of December 8. Through September 30, our year-to-date dividends totaled $8.25 per share. Under our recently authorized share repurchase program, we bought back 6,179 shares of stock at an average price per share of $1,406 during the current quarter.  As of September 30, we have completed $11.2 million of share repurchases and have $8.8 million remaining on the current repurchase authorization. In August, TPL released its inaugural ESG disclosure. We believe this is a reflection of our existing commitments and priorities surrounding sustainability, social responsibility and governance.  We look forward to building upon these objectives, and we believe TPL is uniquely positioned to provide collaborative opportunities with customers and companies that operate on our land to drive sustainability and ensure that our industry benefits all stakeholders.  With that, operator, we will now take questions. Yes, sure, John. Hi, this is Chris. Thanks for the question. So yes, we've definitely have seen and continue to see strong permitting activity. As just as reference, in the first quarter that probably on a net permanent basis remain the best quarter that we saw so far this year. Second quarter was a little bit slower, but then we saw another big uptick in the third quarter. And Chevron, for instance, was one of the companies who filed quite a few permits in 3Q and was definitely up from their level of permitting activity on TPL during the first half of the year. And so with the backlog of permits that we see today, I think we view that as a very positive indication for fourth quarter and continuing on into 2022. Yes. Again, I think like Ty said, when you think about TPL's capitalization for one, because we carry no debt and no RBL , maintaining a healthy cash balance has always been, and to the extent that remains the case, will always be a big part of our strategy. And so as Ty has alluded, I think when we think about that cash and balance, from our perspective, it provides a lot of optionality and value to us to be able to utilize that in the near term. And so when we think about it, we think that with the opportunity set in front of us, we like having that large cash balance to be able to utilize, if the right opportunity comes along.

            "name": "Tyler Glover",
            "content": "Thank you, Shawn, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter 2021 was a tremendous quarter. TPL set quarterly records for consolidated adjusted EBITDA and royalty production. This was our second best quarter for revenues in our water business and what a difference a year makes. Compared to the same quarter last year, our total consolidated revenues are up 66%, royalty daily production is up 24%, total water revenues are up 51% and total consolidated free cash flow is up 60%. Although the past 18 months have been among the toughest we've seen in the industry, TPL's vertically integrated business model, high margin cash flows and strong balance sheet allowed us to successfully navigate through the downturn. One metric we focus on and prioritize and I think demonstrates the resiliency and quality of our overall business is our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin. For the first half of 2021, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 83%. Amongst members of the S&P Oil and Gas Exploration & Production Index, which includes TPL, our first half 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin was the highest of the group. If TPL were a member of the S&P 500, our adjusted EBITDA margin would have been in the Top 10 for the same period. For this most recent quarter, our adjusted EBITDA margin has improved even further to 87%. Today, with higher commodity prices and continued growth in the Permian Basin, combined with years of hard work by the TPL team in developing and executing our vertically integrated business model, we're pleased to be in a position to fully capture the value from our asset base. Our active management approach has taken our legacy asset base, which was both ideally situated yet raw and undeveloped and created multiple high quality cash flow streams. To this point, today, I want to highlight and elaborate on our water business. Our water business is a clear example of the benefits of our active management approach. Prior to active management, TPL had minimal revenues outside of its legacy production royalty interest despite owning close to 1 million surface acres in the Permian.  As drilling and completion techniques continued to improve over the last decade, the vast resource potential underlying our royalty assets became increasingly viable. However, development here is not without challenges, especially in the Western part of the Permian, generally known as the Delaware Basin, where majority of our high interest royalties reside.  On the Delaware side of the Permian, the geography tends to be much more arid and just generally inhospitable compared to the Eastern flank of the basin. In fact, Loving County in Texas, which is considered to be part of the core of the Delaware Basin, is the least populated county in the contiguous United States.  Reeves and Covington counties sits to the West of Loving and these counties are no less desolate and arguably even more arid than Loving. These geographical features are relevant because water is scarce in this part of the Delaware. A well development would be impossible without tremendous amounts of water.  Completing a horizontal well otherwise known as fracking requires approximately 0.5 million barrels of water. This lack of water availability was a major reason development in the Delaware Basin initially lagged behind the development in the Midland Basin. That's why in 2017, we formed Texas Pacific Water Resources. This represented a departure from the legacy way of doing business at TPL, which up to that point was mostly passively run with just a handful of employees.  We went out and hired talented and experienced team of professionals from some of the best companies in the industry to execute our plan. From there, we developed two general sides to our new water business, the first being source water and the second being produced water.  Starting with source water, this is where we provide brackish groundwater and to a lesser extent treated produced water to oil and gas operators for use in their well development activities. As surface owners, TPL has the unique right to water aquifers on our land and across our 880,000 surface acres. We have a handful of locations with productive aquifers. Over the last few years, we've invested approximately 105 million in developing aquifer wells, laying transfer pipelines and pumps, constructing frac water storage ponds. We strategically selected and developed this water infrastructure throughout our acreage footprint to efficiently service the greatest number of oil and gas wells across the Permian Basin.  In order to maximize capital efficiency and margins, we generally required producers to come to our frac water ponds to take delivery of our water. From there, the operators take responsibility for developing the infrastructure and managing the logistics, transferring water from our frac ponds to their well beds.  It's worth noting that today, operators generally develop multiple wells simultaneously on a single development pad. Operators have also become more efficient in completing multiple frac stages for multiple wells in an increasingly condensed amount of time. Laterals are also getting much longer.  Thus, operators often need millions of barrels of water delivered over a course of just a few days, which is no easy task if you're trying to source water from multiple small sources. At TPL, we've sized and developed our source water infrastructure to accommodate the needs of the most demanding producers.  The outcome of this very deliberate effort that our source water business was instrumental in enabling and incentivizing production on our royalty acreage in the Delaware. Although development in the overall Delaware has grown tremendously over the last five years, production on our acreage has grown even more.  Additionally, we often sell water for wells that may not be located on our acreage. So our water has been vital for well development in the Delaware even outside of our footprint. And this also drives additional surface revenue for TPL.  During this most recent quarter, over 70% of our source water sales were for wells that were located off of TPL surface, which is directly attributable to the industry relationships our team has. Historically, we estimate that our market share has been approximately 30% of Northern Delaware source water volumes.  We have capability to deliver over 800,000 barrels of water per day without meaningful additional capital expenditures. This past quarter, we delivered 42 million barrels of water to our customers.  I'm confident that without our source water business, oil and gas production in the Delaware overall and production on TPL's royalties specifically would be meaningfully less than what it is today.  Our water is vital for Permian producers to develop their acreage and we actively leverage our source water and our surface rights to drive more production onto TPL's royalty acreage.  Today, we have an extremely talented group of people that focus exclusively on serving our customers to encourage production on our land, and to make sure that we are a reliable partner in delivering water. That's worth noting, because our source water is an operated business, and as such, our cash flow margins are understandably lower than our oil and gas royalties business.  Our source water assets still generate strong cash flow margins and profitability. And our investment in the water business has generated meaningful free cash flow. Layer on the additional impact of using our water to incentivize development onto TPL's royalty acreage, and our source water business has generated tremendous value for our shareholders.  The other side of the water business is referred to as produced water royalties or also referred to as saltwater disposal royalties. This is where we charge a fee for water from a producing oil and gas well that is disposed of on or crosses our land.  As many are already aware, oil and gas wells in the Delaware are unique and that these wells produce a disproportionately high amount of water along with the oil and natural gas volumes compared to other basins.  This associated water is referred to as produced water, and generally the water must either be injected into a saltwater disposal well or treated for reuse elsewhere. Unlike our source water business, our produced water business requires no capital investment from us. Whereas we operate our source water assets so that we can control our own destiny towards incentivizing development.  Our produced water royalties leverage our expansive checkerboard surface footprint to create value. Our customers are generally either operators that own their own infrastructure, or water midstream companies that specialize in handling produced water on behalf of operators.  Because we don't develop, own or operate saltwater disposal wells or the logistics pipelines, our produced water royalties are high margin fee-based cash flows that require no capital expenditures. And because producing wells are almost never shut in outside of rare circumstances, the volumes are very stable.  2020 was a great example of the resiliency of this business. Despite one of the worst down cycles this industry has ever seen and with severely depressed commodity prices, our produced water revenues in 2020 were 30% higher than in 2019.  Again, our produced water business is a testament to our active management approach. Prior to active management, our produced water royalty cash flows were minimal and little time and effort was spent on maximizing its value.  Today, TPL's management and water teams dedicated tremendous amount of time and effort enforcing our surface rights, negotiating fees at fair value and monitoring compliance.  In summary, over the last 12 months alone, our water business has generated approximately 113 million in revenues and 50 million in net income. Since 2017, when we started the business, we've generated over $445 million in revenues and 210 million of net income.  The water business generates robust free cash flow and requires relatively modest amounts of maintenance capital, approximately $10 million annually. Our investment in people and capital has been a highly profitable endeavor, and we expect our investment to continue generating strong free cash flow and value for our shareholders.  We're extremely proud of the business we have built. We're focused on making it better and more profitable every day, and we're glad that our shareholders can reap those rewards.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris. Good morning. Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. We've looked at quite a few deals lately. As we've said, our bar, just for TPL, is pretty high. And the bid-ask spread on those high quality deals has been a little wider in the past, but we're starting to see that narrow with commodity prices where they're at. We see a lot more deals start to come on, hit the market last couple of months. So that's a big positive for us. We've seen a lot of competition on the smaller deals, but starting to see some bigger deals at the market. So we feel really good about it. Hi. This is Ty. I would say, most of the consolidation that we've seen has been between like legacy Permian operators, most of whom we have existing relationships with. We have gained a couple of new additional strong relationships through some of the consolidation. But I think, overall, for us, it's been positive across all of our business lines. Just with where our acreage sits, the relationships we have prioritizes some of our acreage that may not have been previous to some of this consolidation. So I would say, overall, it's been very positive for TPL. Yes. As Chris alluded to earlier, we saw strong permitting from our top three with Chevron, EOG and Cimarex in third quarter. That's all Delaware Basin. Occi, Shell and Exxon were four, five and six. A vast majority of that's Delaware Basin as well. So, yes, I think everything that we're seeing indicates stronger activity in the Delaware going forward. Thanks, Hamed. Yes. Like I stated before, our bar's pretty high. So we're looking for very similar quality to what we already own. We like the vertically integrated nature of our assets. So always interested in integrated assets going forward, something -- or we can buy the surface, the minerals got a water component.

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Shaun Animi [ph] of Investor Relations. \nUnidentified Company Representative: Good morning.

Management will make some prepared comments, after which we will open up the call for questions. Now, I will turn the call over to Ty?\nTy Glover: Thanks Shaun, and thank you everyone for joining us today. I'll begin with an overview of our quarterly performance and then I'll turn it over to Chris to discuss our financial results in more detail. Oil and gas royalties had a strong quarter supported by solid activity levels across the Permian Basin and higher oil prices. Production during the quarter averaged approximately 16,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is roughly flat sequentially from first quarter 2021. In an effort to provide investors additional useful information, TPL has disclosed three screen production and realized pricing figures in our recently filed 10-Q and earnings press release. For second quarter 2021, our production mix was 46% oil, 31% natural gas, and 23% natural gas liquids. Our oil price realizations during second quarter 2021 averaged $65 per barrel, which was 18% higher compared to first quarter 2021. TPL did not carry any commodity price hedges during the most recent quarter, so we benefited fully from the oil price rally and we currently remain unhedged. As of June 30th, TPL royalty inventory included 565 gross drilled but uncompleted wells or DUCs and 474 gross permits. From our vantage point, producers remain disciplined especially the publicly traded integrated and large independents. Though not at pre-COVID activity levels these producers still remain active in developing their leasehold and based on trends with new permits and DUCs, we think TPL production in the second half of 2021 will be at least on par compared to first half 2021. Next for our surface leases easements and material sales or SLEM, total revenues were about flat sequentially from the first quarter 2021. We saw a nice uptick in pipeline easement and caliche sales during the second quarter, which generally reflects healthy Permian activity levels. Turning to water. Produced water royalty revenues during the quarter were up over 20% sequentially from first quarter 2021. We benefited from a onetime catch-up payment from a customer, although excluding this benefit produced water revenues were still up nicely from last quarter. Produced water continues to provide stable, high-margin royalty cash flows without the direct exposure to commodity prices. Our source water sales were roughly flat compared to the first quarter 2021. Source water sales volumes were negatively impacted by four to five days of system downtime due to flash flooding. TPL continued efforts to electrify our water operations and we expect to realize cost savings and reduce our emissions once completed. Before I turn it over to Chris, I'd like to summarize the uniqueness of our value proposition and the remarkable opportunity we believe TPL provides. We call ourselves the ETF for the Permian Basin, because we can benefit throughout the entire life cycle of a well, generating multiple cash flow streams through this value chain. Generally, the foreign operator begins development they first call us for easement surface leases and caliche, so they can start constructing and installing vital infrastructure. As development progresses, we often supply the water that is necessary for drilling the well-bore fracking the shale reservoir. As the well begins producing hydrocarbons, it will also flow back water and TPL collects royalties on most produced water that crosses or is disposed of on our land. We leveraged this entire integrated value chain to incentivize timely and efficient development on our royalty acreage. And of course TPL's royalty interest benefit directly from all the oil and gas production that flows from a well. Finally, although there is uncertainty with the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on the global economy and there is always uncertainty with future commodity prices, we are confident about our position in the Permian and we believe the asset quality underlying our royalties and extensive surface acreage footprint will create tremendous value over the long-term. Now, I'll turn it over to Chris to discuss our financials.\nChris Steddum: Thank you Ty. Beginning with our operating results. For the second quarter of 2021, we had net income of $57 million or $7.36 per share. This compares to $27.6 million in net income or $3.56 per share in the same quarter of the prior year. The increase in net income and earnings per share in the second quarter is primarily due to an increase in oil and gas royalty revenue and partially offset by a decrease in easements and surface related income in the second quarter of 2021, compared to the second quarter of 2020. Total revenue for the second quarter of 2021 was $95.9 million, compared to $57.3 million for the same quarter last year. Oil and gas royalty revenue increased 184% to $58.2 million as compared to the prior year quarter. Production volumes were approximately 16,400 Boe per day in the second quarter of 2021 compared to 15,700 Boe per day for the second quarter of 2020. The average realized price of oil was approximately $65 per barrel in the second quarter of 2021, compared to approximately $25 per barrel during the same period last year. Water revenue was $27.9 million in the second quarter of 2021, up from $21.5 million in the prior year. This increase was primarily due to year-over-year increases in both source water sales volumes and produced water royalty volumes. Easements and other surface-related revenue was $9 million, down from $11.7 million in the prior year quarter. This was primarily due to a decrease in pipeline easement income of $3.8 million. Moving to the expense side. Operating expenses were $24.7 million for the second quarter of 2021, up from $22.5 million in the second quarter of 2020. The increase was primarily due to $4.7 million related to severance costs, partially offset by a decrease of $1.5 million in legal expenses and professional fees. Adjusted EBITDA was $80.3 million, compared to $40.6 million for the same period last year. Turning to our balance sheet. At the end of the second quarter, we had $329 million of cash and cash equivalents and we continue to carry no debt. In the second quarter of 2021, capital expenditures were $2.2 million, which was spent primarily for electrifying our water sourcing infrastructure. Looking to the balance of 2021, we anticipate spending an additional $5 million to $7 million of capital on our water sourcing infrastructure. On August 3, our Board declared a cash dividend of $2.75 per share payable on September 15 to shareholders of record as of September 8. Through June 30, our year-to-date dividends totaled $5.50 per share. Under our recently authorized share repurchase program, we bought back 1633 shares of stock, at an average per share price of $1,533. As of June 30, we had $17.5 million remaining on the current repurchase authorization. Finally, TPL recently joined the Russell 1000 Index. This is a great milestone for the company and we're glad to be new members of the index. We look forward to engaging with growing set of investors. With that operator, we will now take questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Chris Baker with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please proceed.\nChris Baker: Hey, good morning, guys. Maybe one for Ty. Just we'd love to hear a bit more about the approach to capital allocation and where you guys see the most attractive opportunities today?\nTy Glover: Yes, Chris, thanks for the question. Look, we're always looking for deals. We're very picky. That's one of the benefits of being TPL, we don't have to buy to grow. So we can be very disciplined in our approach but deal flows up and there are some attractive packages out there. So we're definitely looking.\nChris Steddum: And Chris I would just add the benefit that we have as well with strong cash balances, it just gives us a lot of optionality. So whether that's potential deals in the market, increasing dividends and it just really allows us to pick and choose what's the best return at any given time and we want that optionality.\nChris Baker: That's great. And then just as a follow-up great to see the additional disclosure around volumes. I know you guys said in terms of the near-term production outlook that you expect the second half to be at least flat with the first half. Do you have a sense of how many net wells you need to come online in sort of a maintenance scenario? I'm just trying to frame up that 7.9% net DUC well backlog.\nChris Steddum: Sure. Yes. I think and I'm going to \u2013 when I refer to the net wells right now I'm going to kind of refer to them on like a net normalized basis, because what we've seen through time right, as the lateral lengths have tended to increase. And so, if you just said an average net well is 1.5 miles well, I think something like seven net wells would be enough for us to maintain our production. And maybe some simple math to think about is our base level of production you may lose something like 6,000 Boe, so call it 35% to 40% over the course of the year. And for us each one of those net wells, that's again like 1.5 miles kind of normalized well, it probably does something like 800 to 900 Boe per day on average through the course of the year. So seven of those wells would kind of replace that production you would see through the normal decline. And the one other thing I would reference, if you use that same normalized basis, our DUC number is probably like nine net wells, if you normalize it. So the 7.9 is because on average those wells are a little bit longer than 1.5 miles. So we've got a pretty robust level of current inventory that I think to Ty's point in the earlier comments would certainly support us being able to hold production flat. And at the current rate that we've seen people bringing wells online in 4Q and 1Q and starting to get data coming in in 2Q, they'd probably be a little bit ahead of that pace. \nChris Baker: Okay. Great. Appreciate the color.\nChris Steddum: Thanks a lot, Chris.\nOperator: Our next question is from Hamed Khorsand with BWS Financial. Please proceed.\nHamed Khorsand: Hey, good morning. Just a follow-up on the capital allocation. Would you be willing to go into debt, if there was the appropriate valuable asset that is available to you?\nChris Steddum: Hey Hamed, this is Chris. Look I think in general we've always managed this business without any debt. And we even like having a very strong cash position. And so I would never say never, but I think we tend to err toward a very low leverage profile for TPL. And so I would say that in general we would probably tend to capitalize with cash on the balance sheet for other ways. But if there was an excellent opportunity and it required a little bit of debt financing, we would consider that.\nHamed Khorsand: Okay. And my other question was given the amount of attention in the headlines about the deals being out there, have you seen any kind of change in activity or posturing as far as potential new production or potential new customers for you? Or is this purely being done with the price of oil?\nTy Glover: Yes. I would say through a lot of the consolidation, we now have exposure to a couple operators, so that's been good for TPL. We've gained a couple of really good relationships through some of the consolidation that's happened recently.\nHamed Khorsand: Okay. Thank you.\nTy Glover: Thanks Hamed.\nOperator: Our next question is from Derrick Whitfield with Stifel. Please proceed.\nDerrick Whitfield: Thanks and good morning all.\nTy Glover: Hey Derrick, good morning.\nChris Steddum: Hey Derrick.\nDerrick Whitfield: Shifting back over to the organic growth side of the equation. Could you speak to your expectations for activity based on what you're seeing in your latest permit scrapes? Based on Chevron's Q2 earnings commentary, the activity in your modern Delaware operating areas likely buy higher sooner than what we were expecting. I'd love to get your views on that?\nChris Steddum: Yes, Derrick I would say in general when we look at the permitting activity, it continues to be really robust. It probably really started to pick up in 1Q of 2021. So, we had a pretty robust level of new permits. Really when we look at them though Oxy was actually probably the biggest set of permits that we saw especially in Q1. And then in the second quarter fairly even level of permits across most of our operators. And so I would just kind of again also point back to when you think about the nets, right the net permits that are coming online, it would continue to support the level of new wells that we see brought online new DUCs that are getting drilled. It's probably something in the mid-to net permits that are coming online each quarter. And so in general, I think its -- it continues to be pretty robust and continues to support the current pace of development that we've seen in the last two quarters which has been encouraging.\nDerrick Whitfield: Great. And then my follow-up moving over to the water side of your business. How are you thinking about the trajectory of your 2021 and 2022 capture rates for the SWD and source water businesses?\nTy Glover: Yes. We've got pretty robust capture rates on both the source water and produced water side. Like we said in the prepared remarks, the produced water business just continues to show growth and be a strong business. That thing has been steady even through 2020 and year-to-date this year we just continue to see growth. A lot of that is from volume realization through existing contracts that our team has locked up. We've got very expansive long-term contracts across majority of the Northern Delaware Basin. And the team has done a great job and continues to do a great job locking up additional contracts and bringing wells online into those systems that we have a royalty on. So, very strong business and I think it's going to continue to be strong for us. \nDerrick Whitfield: That's great. Maybe one final question for me. With the understanding that you own a high margin low capital intensity business with the Veresen balance sheet. Could you speak to your appetite to hedge your second half 2021 and 2022 production profile to lock in your relatively strong oil and gas really more specifically prices?\nChris Steddum: Yes. Hey Derrick. TPL we've always managed this business without any without any hedges. And I think one of the benefits of like you said that we do we're fortunate to have a very high-margin business is -- it can withstand the volatility that this industry sometimes brings forth. And 2020 was a great example of that. And despite the fact that we were unhedged at the end of the day, it was one of our best years ever. And so I think a lot of the folks that invest in TPL like the fact that we kind of provide that exposure. And one of the benefits of being unhedged was during this year we've gotten the full exposure to these great recovery and prices really across the board. I mean oil gas NGLs everything is significantly up from last year. And so just given the nature of our business and our ability to weather the storms that come I think we would continue to just remain unhedged. I think 2020 was a great showcase that this business will do just fine even through some difficult times and it's nice to be able to fully realize those good times when the commodity cycle turns the other way. And so I think we would generally continue that approach in the future.\nDerrick Whitfield: Makes sense. And great update today and thanks for your time.\nTy Glover: Thanks Derrick.\nChris Steddum: Thanks Derrick.\nOperator: There are no more questions at this time and this will end today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you very much for your participation and have a great day.",

            "content": "Thanks Shaun, and thank you everyone for joining us today. I'll begin with an overview of our quarterly performance and then I'll turn it over to Chris to discuss our financial results in more detail. Oil and gas royalties had a strong quarter supported by solid activity levels across the Permian Basin and higher oil prices. Production during the quarter averaged approximately 16,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is roughly flat sequentially from first quarter 2021. In an effort to provide investors additional useful information, TPL has disclosed three screen production and realized pricing figures in our recently filed 10-Q and earnings press release. For second quarter 2021, our production mix was 46% oil, 31% natural gas, and 23% natural gas liquids. Our oil price realizations during second quarter 2021 averaged $65 per barrel, which was 18% higher compared to first quarter 2021. TPL did not carry any commodity price hedges during the most recent quarter, so we benefited fully from the oil price rally and we currently remain unhedged. As of June 30th, TPL royalty inventory included 565 gross drilled but uncompleted wells or DUCs and 474 gross permits. From our vantage point, producers remain disciplined especially the publicly traded integrated and large independents. Though not at pre-COVID activity levels these producers still remain active in developing their leasehold and based on trends with new permits and DUCs, we think TPL production in the second half of 2021 will be at least on par compared to first half 2021. Next for our surface leases easements and material sales or SLEM, total revenues were about flat sequentially from the first quarter 2021. We saw a nice uptick in pipeline easement and caliche sales during the second quarter, which generally reflects healthy Permian activity levels. Turning to water. Produced water royalty revenues during the quarter were up over 20% sequentially from first quarter 2021. We benefited from a onetime catch-up payment from a customer, although excluding this benefit produced water revenues were still up nicely from last quarter. Produced water continues to provide stable, high-margin royalty cash flows without the direct exposure to commodity prices. Our source water sales were roughly flat compared to the first quarter 2021. Source water sales volumes were negatively impacted by four to five days of system downtime due to flash flooding. TPL continued efforts to electrify our water operations and we expect to realize cost savings and reduce our emissions once completed. Before I turn it over to Chris, I'd like to summarize the uniqueness of our value proposition and the remarkable opportunity we believe TPL provides. We call ourselves the ETF for the Permian Basin, because we can benefit throughout the entire life cycle of a well, generating multiple cash flow streams through this value chain. Generally, the foreign operator begins development they first call us for easement surface leases and caliche, so they can start constructing and installing vital infrastructure. As development progresses, we often supply the water that is necessary for drilling the well-bore fracking the shale reservoir. As the well begins producing hydrocarbons, it will also flow back water and TPL collects royalties on most produced water that crosses or is disposed of on our land. We leveraged this entire integrated value chain to incentivize timely and efficient development on our royalty acreage. And of course TPL's royalty interest benefit directly from all the oil and gas production that flows from a well. Finally, although there is uncertainty with the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on the global economy and there is always uncertainty with future commodity prices, we are confident about our position in the Permian and we believe the asset quality underlying our royalties and extensive surface acreage footprint will create tremendous value over the long-term. Now, I'll turn it over to Chris to discuss our financials. Yes, Chris, thanks for the question. Look, we're always looking for deals. We're very picky. That's one of the benefits of being TPL, we don't have to buy to grow. So we can be very disciplined in our approach but deal flows up and there are some attractive packages out there. So we're definitely looking. Yes. I would say through a lot of the consolidation, we now have exposure to a couple operators, so that's been good for TPL. We've gained a couple of really good relationships through some of the consolidation that's happened recently. Thanks Hamed. Hey Derrick, good morning. Yes. We've got pretty robust capture rates on both the source water and produced water side. Like we said in the prepared remarks, the produced water business just continues to show growth and be a strong business. That thing has been steady even through 2020 and year-to-date this year we just continue to see growth. A lot of that is from volume realization through existing contracts that our team has locked up. We've got very expansive long-term contracts across majority of the Northern Delaware Basin.

So, very strong business and I think it's going to continue to be strong for us. Thanks Derrick."

            "content": "Thank you Ty. Beginning with our operating results. For the second quarter of 2021, we had net income of $57 million or $7.36 per share. This compares to $27.6 million in net income or $3.56 per share in the same quarter of the prior year. The increase in net income and earnings per share in the second quarter is primarily due to an increase in oil and gas royalty revenue and partially offset by a decrease in easements and surface related income in the second quarter of 2021, compared to the second quarter of 2020. Total revenue for the second quarter of 2021 was $95.9 million, compared to $57.3 million for the same quarter last year. Oil and gas royalty revenue increased 184% to $58.2 million as compared to the prior year quarter. Production volumes were approximately 16,400 Boe per day in the second quarter of 2021 compared to 15,700 Boe per day for the second quarter of 2020. The average realized price of oil was approximately $65 per barrel in the second quarter of 2021, compared to approximately $25 per barrel during the same period last year. Water revenue was $27.9 million in the second quarter of 2021, up from $21.5 million in the prior year. This increase was primarily due to year-over-year increases in both source water sales volumes and produced water royalty volumes. Easements and other surface-related revenue was $9 million, down from $11.7 million in the prior year quarter. This was primarily due to a decrease in pipeline easement income of $3.8 million. Moving to the expense side. Operating expenses were $24.7 million for the second quarter of 2021, up from $22.5 million in the second quarter of 2020. The increase was primarily due to $4.7 million related to severance costs, partially offset by a decrease of $1.5 million in legal expenses and professional fees. Adjusted EBITDA was $80.3 million, compared to $40.6 million for the same period last year. Turning to our balance sheet. At the end of the second quarter, we had $329 million of cash and cash equivalents and we continue to carry no debt. In the second quarter of 2021, capital expenditures were $2.2 million, which was spent primarily for electrifying our water sourcing infrastructure. Looking to the balance of 2021, we anticipate spending an additional $5 million to $7 million of capital on our water sourcing infrastructure. On August 3, our Board declared a cash dividend of $2.75 per share payable on September 15 to shareholders of record as of September 8. Through June 30, our year-to-date dividends totaled $5.50 per share. Under our recently authorized share repurchase program, we bought back 1633 shares of stock, at an average per share price of $1,533. As of June 30, we had $17.5 million remaining on the current repurchase authorization. Finally, TPL recently joined the Russell 1000 Index. This is a great milestone for the company and we're glad to be new members of the index. We look forward to engaging with growing set of investors. With that operator, we will now take questions. And Chris I would just add the benefit that we have as well with strong cash balances, it just gives us a lot of optionality. So whether that's potential deals in the market, increasing dividends and it just really allows us to pick and choose what's the best return at any given time and we want that optionality. Sure. Yes.

I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. Chris Steddum, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Thank you. You may begin.\nChris Steddum: Good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Texas Pacific Land Corporation\u2019s first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Yesterday afternoon, the Company released its financial results and filed its Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

This morning\u2019s conference call is hosted by TPL\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Ty Glover; and Chief Financial Officer, Robert Packer. Management will make some prepared comments, after which we will open up the call for questions. Now, I will turn the call over to Ty?\nTy Glover: Thanks, Chris. And thank you everyone for joining us today. Since this is our first quarterly earnings call. I\u2019d like to begin with some background for those who are new to TPL. Then, I\u2019ll cover our business strategy, our performance during the first quarter and our plans for the road ahead. Lastly, I\u2019ll turn it over to our CFO, Robert Packer, to discuss our financial results in more detail. Texas Pacific, was formed as a trust in 1888 to manage the checkerboard of land assets of the former Texas and Pacific Railway Company. We have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 1927, and in the first quarter of 2021, we completed our reorganization from a trust to a corporation. Today, we own over 880,000 acres across 19 counties in Western Texas, with the majority located within the Permian Basin. We are very unique and that, although we are a-pure play Permian-focused company, we are not an oil producer or exploration company. Rather, we have three core revenue streams, oil and gas royalties; surface management, and water solution. And our customers include nearly every major E&P and midstream company operating in the Permian. We believe this provides exceptionally diversified exposure to best-in-class Permian operators across multiple facets of their operations, with added value in the form of our vast and largely undeveloped royalty acreage, our core surface positioning and our sizable market share in the sourcing of produced water aspect of our water solutions business. We\u2019ll walk through each of these three core revenue streams in turn. Our oil and gas royalties accounted for 59% of our revenues in the first quarter. We own approximately 530,000 gross royalty acres with the vast majority leased for oil and gas development, which entitles TPL to a certain percentage of revenue interest, based on oil and gas production. Our average royalty per acre is 4.4%, which translates to about 23,700 net royalty acres on 8x [ph] basis. Our oil & gas royalties are perpetual real property rights that require no capital expenditure from us for continued development, making this a very high margin business. Fundamental trends in the Permian have been highly supportive for royalties with daily average well production of 150% from 2018 through 2020. At March 31, 2021, Texas Pacific had a robust inventory of 541 drilled but uncompleted wells or DUCs and 488 permits, providing clear visibility into future royalty earnings. New DUCs grew from 91 in the fourth quarter to 152 new DUCs in the first quarter, providing line of sight into future production. New permits grew from 139 in the fourth quarter to 176 in the first quarter. As of March 31st, 17% of all Permian rigs were located on TPL drilling spacing units or DSU, up from 11% of Permian rigs as of December 31st. In terms of spud count, TPL DSUs accounted for 18% of total spuds across the Permian during the first quarter. 14% of all permits approved by the Texas Railroad Commission in the first quarter, intersect TPL DSUs. Importantly, most of our net royalty acres are concentrated within the Northern Delaware region and core of the Midland Basin. This diverse exposure represents a significant competitive advantage for TPL. Overall, our oil and gas royalties are only 10% developed with the Delaware Basin being less developed than the Midland Basin. Within the Texas portion of the Delaware, TPL accounted for 49% of all spuds during the first quarter. We believe this gives us more runway to grow our royalties over time, compared to our peers, as the Delaware should continue to support a high pace of growth and production. In addition to our oil and gas royalties, we also have surface ownership of our land. Over the past decade, technological advances in exploration and development have unlocked a tremendous amount of additional reserves, contributing to a rapid build-out of oil and gas infrastructure across the basin. These activities and others provide TPL enormous optionality to generate additional cash flows utilizing our surface assets. We call this part of our business, S-L-E-M, or SLEM, which stands for surface leases, easements and material sales. We earned income from uses ranging from easements for pipelines, power lines and utilities, agriculture, wind farms, access roads, material sales and various other infrastructure projects. Most of our surface revenues come from pipeline infrastructure, demonstrating our ability to capture value all along the oil and gas supply chain from production to midstream. Surface leases and easements are typically 30-plus-year contracts with recurring payments every 10 years, providing stable cash flows along with escalated renewal fees. Our material sales primarily consist of caliche, which is calcium carbonate used in construction for energy companies and TxDOT infrastructure development. This is another way in which we provide services to the operators beyond just land, helping to relieve their pressure points and further solidify our customer relationships. Out of our SLEM contracts in the first quarter, 64% were for upstream activities and 36% were for midstream, further demonstrating our diversification along the value chain. SLEM accounted for 10% of our revenues in the first quarter of 2021, with renewable energy revenue acting as a hedge against the Texas winter storm, as our wind revenue increased $2 million from Q4 2020, due to increased pricing. Similar to our royalties business, SLEM can achieve organic cash flow growth through new leasing without any additional capital or operating expenditures, meaning margins are effectively 100%. Lastly, our water solutions business accounted for 31% of first quarter revenues. We provide brackish water sourcing and disposal and treatment solutions which are essential to oil and gas development. A major barrier for other water companies in the Permian is highly fragmented land ownership, which limits their ability to move around. They often need to negotiate agreements with multiple landowners for pipeline right-of-way to transport their product to a desired end user, significantly increasing their cost per barrel. Texas Pacific is unique that we own strategically located surface assets, allowing us to provide water services without needing costly leases to transport our product and the ability to move water across the vast majority of the Northern Delaware Basin. In addition, our surface assets, with emphasis on our Stateline ownership, also play a crucial role in capturing produced water volume. Although TPL does not operate any saltwater disposal wells, we have agreements covering over 460,000 acres within Texas where the characteristics of Delaware bedrock produce a high water-to-oil ratio. These long-term contracts, combined with volume stemming from New Mexico, provide immediate revenue with tremendous upside from future development. Our contracts are structured so that TPL has paid a fixed fee per barrel royalty for produced water being disposed of on TPL land or for produced water being transported across TPL surface. These factors enable us to capture a large market share in Permian water solutions at low cost, and we believe we can continue to grow our water business organically with limited CapEx requirements. The water business also creates direct synergies with our oil and gas royalties and surface management business. As we continue to provide water solutions into areas where they were previously unavailable, we enable further development by operators, which in turn drives our royalties and SLEM revenue. This increased development drives more demand for water sourcing and disposal, continuing this virtuous cycle. To summarize, we believe there is no other company that provides the kind of differentiated exposure we provide to the Permian with low risk and low earnings volatility. We are diversified across multiple revenue streams, our customers include numerous blue-chip energy operators, we have exceptionally low capital requirements across our high-margin businesses, and we operate at a scale that gives us significant cost efficiencies. We capitalize on all stages of the development process from exploration and production to midstream, and the synergies among our business lines will help drive further organic growth. Next, I\u2019ll discuss our recent performance and outlook. Robert will go into details shortly, but I\u2019ll provide a few high-level thoughts. Oil and gas markets have continued to normalize after the volatility brought on by COVID-19. Through it all, we continue to generate positive operating results, and in fact, 2020 was our second largest revenue year in the Company\u2019s history. I think, this highlights the premium quality of our assets. First, we\u2019re diversified. While our royalties are tied to oil prices, we\u2019re also anchored by steady cash flows from multiple business activities. Second, we have no debt. Many of the energy companies that ran into trouble last year and at similar points in past cycles were overlevered. We enjoy high margins and have minimal capital needs in order to generate organic growth, and we continue to benefit from our pristine balance sheet. The result is that we\u2019re even better positioned to capitalize on the oil and gas recovery that is now taking place. In the first quarter, oil prices returned to $60 per barrel. As I mentioned, we have an inventory of 541 DUCs and 488 permits, and current market fundamentals are supportive of getting those in-process wells converted into producing wells and contributing to our royalties. Next, I\u2019d like to touch on the impact of the winter storm in February. First and foremost, our thoughts go out to all of those who are still dealing with the long-term effects of the storm. At TPL, we were fortunate to be in a position to help support the energy grid at a time of high stress. As I mentioned before, we have some wind energy exposure within our SLEM business that acted as a hedge against the disruption to production activity. But, I\u2019d like to focus on the steps we took to mitigate the storm\u2019s impact. On the royalty side, we had an estimated five to six days of production loss due to the storm or about 6% of the quarter. As mentioned, we recognized higher-than-average SLEM revenue from our wind leases. The storm was more impactful to our water business, where our downtime was 10.5 days or about 12% of the quarter. We fortunately had preventative steps in place well ahead of the storm, including emergency protocols, winterization efforts and initiatives to protect our infrastructure. As a result, aside from the downtime, we did not incur material costs or damage to our assets from the storm. Texas Pacific Water Resources was the final remaining source of water for producers in the Northern Delaware as the storm hit and the first to resume production. In the first quarter, we are very pleased to have completed our reorganization from a trust to a corporation. We feel this enhanced corporate governance structure better aligns the interest of management, the Board and shareholders. It also allows us to become eligible for certain indexes, which opens us up to a broader base of investors. We view this as a starting point rather than a finish line for continuing to improve our corporate governance. And to that end, we are engaged in implementing a formal environmental, social and governance policy later this year. We look forward to discussing our ESG efforts with you in future messages. Looking ahead, we are focused on increasing efficiencies in our existing business lines and continuing to grow our market share. We may also take advantage of opportunities for bolt-on acquisitions that align with our core revenue streams. As noted, while E&P is dominated by larger players, we operate within a highly fragmented segment of the Permian ecosystem. Historically, we have funded our acquisitions through our cash flow, and we expect this to continue. However, at the end of the day, there is a tremendous amount of value embedded in this portfolio, and we do not need to chase acquisitions in order to achieve outsized growth. We will remain opportunistic, and we have extensive relationships across the Permian which provide us with unique visibility into M&A deal flow. Now, I will turn it over to Robert to discuss our financials.\nRobert Packer: Thank you, Ty. Beginning with our operating results, for the first quarter of 2021, we had net income of $50.1 million or $6.45 per common share. This compares to $57.4 million in net income or $7.40 per sub-share certificate in the same quarter of the prior year, a decrease of $7.3 million or $0.95 per share. For clarity, when the reorganization was completed in January of this year, we converted these sub-share certificates to common shares on a one-to-one basis, so the number of shares outstanding for each period is identical. The decrease in net income and earnings per share is primarily due to a $14 million decrease in water sales revenue, which I\u2019ll detail shortly. This decrease in water sales revenue was partially offset by an increase of $7.2 million in oil and gas royalty revenue in the first quarter of 2021 compared to first quarter of 2020. Now, moving to revenue detail. Total revenue for the first quarter of 2021 was $84.2 million compared to $96.6 million for the same quarter last year. Oil and gas royalty revenue increased 16.9% to $49.5 million as compared to the prior year. This increase was due to an $8.8 million increase in gas royalty revenue, primarily driven by a 121% increase in the average realized price in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to first quarter of 2020. Water sales revenue was $13 million in the first quarter of 2021, down from $27 million in the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to an approximately 41% decrease in the number of sourced and treated barrels of water sold in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to our record level of sales in the first quarter of 2020. This is a direct result of the decreased pace of development employed by operators as they managed their capital allocation following the onset of COVID-19 and the disruption caused by OPEC+ decisions in the first quarter of last year. Produced water royalty revenue was $12.5 million for first quarter of 2021 and 2020. Please note that beginning this quarter, produced water royalties are shown on a separate line on the income statement, to give clarity to the readers of our financials. They were previously included in the easements and other surface related revenue line item. Produced water royalties were impacted by the winter storm, with February volumes down 27% compared to January. Easements and other surface related revenue was $9 million, down from $13.8 million in the prior year quarter. This was primarily due to a decrease in pipeline easement income of $4.9 million, which is again related to the decreased pace of development in first quarter 2021 compared to first quarter of 2020. The decrease was partially offset by a $2 million increase in wind revenue year-over-year as a result of the higher electrical rates during the winter storm. Moving to the expense side. Our largest cost savings were on water service-related expenses, which were $3.3 million, down from $6.8 million in the prior year\u2019s quarter, a decrease of 51.4%. This decrease was primarily a result of the lower water sales volumes previously discussed. In addition, we continue to see cost savings due to our capital spend on electrifying our water sourcing infrastructure. The use of electricity in lieu of diesel-powered generators reduces cost for equipment rental, fuel and maintenance and repairs. Salary and related employee expenses were $10 million, down from $10.6 million in the prior year. G&A expenses were $2.8 million, down from $3 million in the same quarter last year. These contributed to a total reduction in operating expenses from $26.1 million in the first quarter of 2020 to $22.1 million in the first quarter of 2021. Lastly, cash flow from operating activities for the first quarter was $52.4 million. Now, turning to our balance sheet. As of the end of the first quarter, we had $310.7 million of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $29.6 million from year-end 2020. We continue to carry no debt, as Ty mentioned previously. We did not purchase or sell any land or oil and gas royalty interest in the first quarter. In the first quarter of 2021, we invested $2.7 million in capital to maintain and enhance our water sourcing assets. As discussed previously, the bulk of the investment was on electrifying our water sourcing infrastructure to further reduce our water sourcing and transportation costs. Looking forward for the balance of 2021, we anticipate spending an additional $7 million to $9 million of capital on our water sourcing infrastructure. With regard to the dividend, for the first quarter, our Board has declared a cash dividend of $2.75 per common share, payable on June 15th to shareholders of record as of June 8th. The Board will continue to evaluate additional dividends in the future. We did not repurchase any common stock in the first quarter. However, on May 3rd, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program to purchase up to an aggregate of $20 million of our outstanding stock through December 31, 2021. We plan to enter into a 10b5-1 trading plan that would generally permit the Company to repurchase shares at times when it might otherwise be prevented from doing so under securities laws. In conclusion, we will continue to evaluate our options and be disciplined in our capital decisions in order to maximize shareholder value through distributions, share repurchases and select investment activity. Now back to Ty.\nTy Glover: Thanks, Robert. Before we go to Q&A, I want to conclude by thanking Robert for his years of outstanding service to TPL as CFO. As previously announced, Robert will retire at the end of May and will be succeeded by Chris Steddum, our Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. We will miss Robert greatly, and we know that Chris will continue to build on the achievements that Robert has helped us realize. With that, operator, we will now take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Derrick Whitfield with Stifel. You may proceed with your question.\nDerrick Whitfield: Good morning all, and congrats on a strong quarter and update. It\u2019s certainly a nice start for your first call.\nTy Glover: Thanks, Derrick.\nDerrick Whitfield: With my first question, I wanted to focus on your return of capital strategy, and thinking about your share buyback announcement and your strong cash position. Could you speak to your long-term strategic view on return of capital, and what\u2019s the right balance between stock repurchases and dividends?\nTy Glover: Yes. Hey Derrick, this is Ty. Thanks for the question. To give you a little bit of color on that, TPL has increased its dividend consistently over the last 17-plus years. We\u2019ve paid a dividend much longer than that. I mean, ultimately, those decisions are made at the Board level. But, we\u2019re very confident that our Board is focused on making the best capital allocation decisions for our shareholders.\nDerrick Whitfield: And as my follow-up and perhaps focusing with you, Ty, shifting over to growth regarding the potential outside growth opportunities referenced in your press release and prepared comments. Could you speak to your appetite for acquisitions and the parameters you would use to assess such opportunities?\nTy Glover: Yes, for sure. I mean, look, we\u2019re definitely going to evaluate assets across all of our revenue streams, oil and gas royalties, the SLEM business, the water company. I think, there\u2019s going to be opportunities across all three of those. I mean, ultimately, we\u2019re focused on core Permian assets. We want exposure to Tier 1 operators, because we feel like those assets perform best through the cycle. Our focus is on assets that have good visibility to development timing and fit in well with our existing portfolio of high-quality Permian assets. Historically, we funded these types of transactions through our cash flow. But, I think we\u2019re in a very unique position where we don\u2019t need to chase acquisitions in order to achieve growth. So, we\u2019re going to remain opportunistic and stay very patient and disciplined.\nDerrick Whitfield: Certainly makes sense. And shifting over to production visibility, could you share your thoughts on your production profile for the balance of the year, based on your current DUC backlog and rig activity and additionally, perhaps comment on your permits and if they support a sustained level of rig activity?\nChris Steddum: Hey Derrick, this is Chris. I\u2019ll take that question. As I look back, starting in September, we probably started to see about 50 completions happening every month, and that continued definitely through January. With the February storm, it probably slowed down a little bit. But, if you kind of think about our DUC inventory, which is a little bit above 500 DUCs, that certainly is enough to get you through the end of the year at that pace if the operators want it to continue. And to Ty\u2019s point, when you think about the permitting pace, I think we saw something like 170 new permits over the course of the first quarter. And so, again, that would definitely support kind of the pace that we\u2019ve seen at the end of the year. So, we feel really good that given the current DUC count and permit count, we\u2019ve got good visibility for them to continue on kind of the pace that we saw at the end of last year.\nDerrick Whitfield: Great. And then, as my final question, really more housekeeping in nature. Could you offer your production split by product for Q1 and comment on the winter storm Uri impact on royalty production?\nChris Steddum: Yes. Sure, Derrick. This is Chris again. For Q1, we saw our oil production was probably about 43% to 44% of the total production, gas was just slightly above 30%, and NGLs were the balance. And I think, when you think about the impact, as Ty has said in his prepared remarks, for February, for most of the operators, I think, five to six days of downtime in terms of production is kind of what we\u2019ve tended to see. If you look at our produced water royalties as another good analog, it was down about 27%, and that would translate to about six or seven days. And so I think across the board, when you think of that kind of five to seven-day window of downtime for production, I think, that\u2019s probably what\u2019s the expectation should be for February.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Baker with Credit Suisse. You may proceed with your question.\nChris Baker: Hey. Good morning, guys. And thanks for those on the call. Derrick covered most of it, but I was just hoping that since this is the sort of first public call, you could reflect a bit on the different pieces of the portfolio, how they performed last year, given 2020 was pretty challenging. But, just any color around sort of the different moving pieces there would be helpful.\nTy Glover: Yes. As I mentioned -- this is Ty. As I mentioned earlier, 2020 was actually our second best year in the Company\u2019s history. So, as a whole, our asset performed pretty well. One thing that we saw that I would highlight was the produced water royalty side of the business. That side of the business actually saw roughly 30% over the year. So, it was actually a very nice hedge for some of the other businesses that didn\u2019t perform quite as well. And then, like we mentioned earlier, the wind revenue in February, I think just -- a lot of the hidden value in TPL and the natural hedges that are built into the business are a huge highlight and competitive advantage for TPL over some of the others in the industry.\nChris Baker: That\u2019s great. And just as a follow-up, we\u2019ll look forward to getting the formal ESG report later this year. But, could you just maybe expand on how you guys are thinking about ESG? I think, relative to E&Ps, at least from my view, the lack of Scope 1 emissions is a pretty clear differentiator. But, just wondering how you guys are thinking about that potential opportunity.\nTy Glover: Yes. Look, again, this is Ty. I mean, we see it as a big opportunity for us. We\u2019re very excited about it. I think, the reduction in flaring that we\u2019ve seen as a percentage of our production, just with the infrastructure that we\u2019ve helped to plan and get built out on our property, has been a big win for us over the last few years, a great opportunity for us to work with our operators and kind of be a problem solver there as well and just increase that relationship. So, again, yes, we look forward to get that message out there and super excited about it.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of today\u2019s question-and-answer session. This does conclude today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. And enjoy the rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ty Glover",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. And thank you everyone for joining us today. Since this is our first quarterly earnings call. I'd like to begin with some background for those who are new to TPL. Then, I'll cover our business strategy, our performance during the first quarter and our plans for the road ahead. Lastly, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Robert Packer, to discuss our financial results in more detail. Texas Pacific, was formed as a trust in 1888 to manage the checkerboard of land assets of the former Texas and Pacific Railway Company. We have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 1927, and in the first quarter of 2021, we completed our reorganization from a trust to a corporation. Today, we own over 880,000 acres across 19 counties in Western Texas, with the majority located within the Permian Basin. We are very unique and that, although we are a-pure play Permian-focused company, we are not an oil producer or exploration company. Rather, we have three core revenue streams, oil and gas royalties; surface management, and water solution. And our customers include nearly every major E&P and midstream company operating in the Permian. We believe this provides exceptionally diversified exposure to best-in-class Permian operators across multiple facets of their operations, with added value in the form of our vast and largely undeveloped royalty acreage, our core surface positioning and our sizable market share in the sourcing of produced water aspect of our water solutions business. We'll walk through each of these three core revenue streams in turn. Our oil and gas royalties accounted for 59% of our revenues in the first quarter. We own approximately 530,000 gross royalty acres with the vast majority leased for oil and gas development, which entitles TPL to a certain percentage of revenue interest, based on oil and gas production. Our average royalty per acre is 4.4%, which translates to about 23,700 net royalty acres on 8x [ph] basis. Our oil & gas royalties are perpetual real property rights that require no capital expenditure from us for continued development, making this a very high margin business. Fundamental trends in the Permian have been highly supportive for royalties with daily average well production of 150% from 2018 through 2020. At March 31, 2021, Texas Pacific had a robust inventory of 541 drilled but uncompleted wells or DUCs and 488 permits, providing clear visibility into future royalty earnings. New DUCs grew from 91 in the fourth quarter to 152 new DUCs in the first quarter, providing line of sight into future production. New permits grew from 139 in the fourth quarter to 176 in the first quarter. As of March 31st, 17% of all Permian rigs were located on TPL drilling spacing units or DSU, up from 11% of Permian rigs as of December 31st. In terms of spud count, TPL DSUs accounted for 18% of total spuds across the Permian during the first quarter. 14% of all permits approved by the Texas Railroad Commission in the first quarter, intersect TPL DSUs. Importantly, most of our net royalty acres are concentrated within the Northern Delaware region and core of the Midland Basin. This diverse exposure represents a significant competitive advantage for TPL. Overall, our oil and gas royalties are only 10% developed with the Delaware Basin being less developed than the Midland Basin. Within the Texas portion of the Delaware, TPL accounted for 49% of all spuds during the first quarter. We believe this gives us more runway to grow our royalties over time, compared to our peers, as the Delaware should continue to support a high pace of growth and production. In addition to our oil and gas royalties, we also have surface ownership of our land. Over the past decade, technological advances in exploration and development have unlocked a tremendous amount of additional reserves, contributing to a rapid build-out of oil and gas infrastructure across the basin. These activities and others provide TPL enormous optionality to generate additional cash flows utilizing our surface assets. We call this part of our business, S-L-E-M, or SLEM, which stands for surface leases, easements and material sales. We earned income from uses ranging from easements for pipelines, power lines and utilities, agriculture, wind farms, access roads, material sales and various other infrastructure projects. Most of our surface revenues come from pipeline infrastructure, demonstrating our ability to capture value all along the oil and gas supply chain from production to midstream. Surface leases and easements are typically 30-plus-year contracts with recurring payments every 10 years, providing stable cash flows along with escalated renewal fees. Our material sales primarily consist of caliche, which is calcium carbonate used in construction for energy companies and TxDOT infrastructure development. This is another way in which we provide services to the operators beyond just land, helping to relieve their pressure points and further solidify our customer relationships. Out of our SLEM contracts in the first quarter, 64% were for upstream activities and 36% were for midstream, further demonstrating our diversification along the value chain. SLEM accounted for 10% of our revenues in the first quarter of 2021, with renewable energy revenue acting as a hedge against the Texas winter storm, as our wind revenue increased $2 million from Q4 2020, due to increased pricing. Similar to our royalties business, SLEM can achieve organic cash flow growth through new leasing without any additional capital or operating expenditures, meaning margins are effectively 100%. Lastly, our water solutions business accounted for 31% of first quarter revenues. We provide brackish water sourcing and disposal and treatment solutions which are essential to oil and gas development. A major barrier for other water companies in the Permian is highly fragmented land ownership, which limits their ability to move around. They often need to negotiate agreements with multiple landowners for pipeline right-of-way to transport their product to a desired end user, significantly increasing their cost per barrel. Texas Pacific is unique that we own strategically located surface assets, allowing us to provide water services without needing costly leases to transport our product and the ability to move water across the vast majority of the Northern Delaware Basin. In addition, our surface assets, with emphasis on our Stateline ownership, also play a crucial role in capturing produced water volume. Although TPL does not operate any saltwater disposal wells, we have agreements covering over 460,000 acres within Texas where the characteristics of Delaware bedrock produce a high water-to-oil ratio. These long-term contracts, combined with volume stemming from New Mexico, provide immediate revenue with tremendous upside from future development. Our contracts are structured so that TPL has paid a fixed fee per barrel royalty for produced water being disposed of on TPL land or for produced water being transported across TPL surface. These factors enable us to capture a large market share in Permian water solutions at low cost, and we believe we can continue to grow our water business organically with limited CapEx requirements. The water business also creates direct synergies with our oil and gas royalties and surface management business. As we continue to provide water solutions into areas where they were previously unavailable, we enable further development by operators, which in turn drives our royalties and SLEM revenue. This increased development drives more demand for water sourcing and disposal, continuing this virtuous cycle. To summarize, we believe there is no other company that provides the kind of differentiated exposure we provide to the Permian with low risk and low earnings volatility. We are diversified across multiple revenue streams, our customers include numerous blue-chip energy operators, we have exceptionally low capital requirements across our high-margin businesses, and we operate at a scale that gives us significant cost efficiencies. We capitalize on all stages of the development process from exploration and production to midstream, and the synergies among our business lines will help drive further organic growth. Next, I'll discuss our recent performance and outlook. Robert will go into details shortly, but I'll provide a few high-level thoughts. Oil and gas markets have continued to normalize after the volatility brought on by COVID-19. Through it all, we continue to generate positive operating results, and in fact, 2020 was our second largest revenue year in the Company's history. I think, this highlights the premium quality of our assets. First, we're diversified. While our royalties are tied to oil prices, we're also anchored by steady cash flows from multiple business activities. Second, we have no debt. Many of the energy companies that ran into trouble last year and at similar points in past cycles were overlevered. We enjoy high margins and have minimal capital needs in order to generate organic growth, and we continue to benefit from our pristine balance sheet. The result is that we're even better positioned to capitalize on the oil and gas recovery that is now taking place. In the first quarter, oil prices returned to $60 per barrel. As I mentioned, we have an inventory of 541 DUCs and 488 permits, and current market fundamentals are supportive of getting those in-process wells converted into producing wells and contributing to our royalties. Next, I'd like to touch on the impact of the winter storm in February. First and foremost, our thoughts go out to all of those who are still dealing with the long-term effects of the storm. At TPL, we were fortunate to be in a position to help support the energy grid at a time of high stress. As I mentioned before, we have some wind energy exposure within our SLEM business that acted as a hedge against the disruption to production activity. But, I'd like to focus on the steps we took to mitigate the storm's impact. On the royalty side, we had an estimated five to six days of production loss due to the storm or about 6% of the quarter. As mentioned, we recognized higher-than-average SLEM revenue from our wind leases. The storm was more impactful to our water business, where our downtime was 10.5 days or about 12% of the quarter. We fortunately had preventative steps in place well ahead of the storm, including emergency protocols, winterization efforts and initiatives to protect our infrastructure. As a result, aside from the downtime, we did not incur material costs or damage to our assets from the storm. Texas Pacific Water Resources was the final remaining source of water for producers in the Northern Delaware as the storm hit and the first to resume production. In the first quarter, we are very pleased to have completed our reorganization from a trust to a corporation. We feel this enhanced corporate governance structure better aligns the interest of management, the Board and shareholders. It also allows us to become eligible for certain indexes, which opens us up to a broader base of investors. We view this as a starting point rather than a finish line for continuing to improve our corporate governance. And to that end, we are engaged in implementing a formal environmental, social and governance policy later this year. We look forward to discussing our ESG efforts with you in future messages. Looking ahead, we are focused on increasing efficiencies in our existing business lines and continuing to grow our market share. We may also take advantage of opportunities for bolt-on acquisitions that align with our core revenue streams. As noted, while E&P is dominated by larger players, we operate within a highly fragmented segment of the Permian ecosystem. Historically, we have funded our acquisitions through our cash flow, and we expect this to continue. However, at the end of the day, there is a tremendous amount of value embedded in this portfolio, and we do not need to chase acquisitions in order to achieve outsized growth. We will remain opportunistic, and we have extensive relationships across the Permian which provide us with unique visibility into M&A deal flow. Now, I will turn it over to Robert to discuss our financials. Thanks, Robert. Before we go to Q&A, I want to conclude by thanking Robert for his years of outstanding service to TPL as CFO.

Yes. Hey Derrick, this is Ty. Thanks for the question. To give you a little bit of color on that, TPL has increased its dividend consistently over the last 17-plus years. We've paid a dividend much longer than that. I mean, ultimately, those decisions are made at the Board level. But, we're very confident that our Board is focused on making the best capital allocation decisions for our shareholders. Yes, for sure. I mean, look, we're definitely going to evaluate assets across all of our revenue streams, oil and gas royalties, the SLEM business, the water company.

So, again, yes, we look forward to get that message out there and super excited about it."

            "content": "Thank you, Ty. Beginning with our operating results, for the first quarter of 2021, we had net income of $50.1 million or $6.45 per common share. This compares to $57.4 million in net income or $7.40 per sub-share certificate in the same quarter of the prior year, a decrease of $7.3 million or $0.95 per share. For clarity, when the reorganization was completed in January of this year, we converted these sub-share certificates to common shares on a one-to-one basis, so the number of shares outstanding for each period is identical. The decrease in net income and earnings per share is primarily due to a $14 million decrease in water sales revenue, which I'll detail shortly. This decrease in water sales revenue was partially offset by an increase of $7.2 million in oil and gas royalty revenue in the first quarter of 2021 compared to first quarter of 2020. Now, moving to revenue detail. Total revenue for the first quarter of 2021 was $84.2 million compared to $96.6 million for the same quarter last year. Oil and gas royalty revenue increased 16.9% to $49.5 million as compared to the prior year. This increase was due to an $8.8 million increase in gas royalty revenue, primarily driven by a 121% increase in the average realized price in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to first quarter of 2020. Water sales revenue was $13 million in the first quarter of 2021, down from $27 million in the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to an approximately 41% decrease in the number of sourced and treated barrels of water sold in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to our record level of sales in the first quarter of 2020. This is a direct result of the decreased pace of development employed by operators as they managed their capital allocation following the onset of COVID-19 and the disruption caused by OPEC+ decisions in the first quarter of last year. Produced water royalty revenue was $12.5 million for first quarter of 2021 and 2020. Please note that beginning this quarter, produced water royalties are shown on a separate line on the income statement, to give clarity to the readers of our financials. They were previously included in the easements and other surface related revenue line item. Produced water royalties were impacted by the winter storm, with February volumes down 27% compared to January. Easements and other surface related revenue was $9 million, down from $13.8 million in the prior year quarter. This was primarily due to a decrease in pipeline easement income of $4.9 million, which is again related to the decreased pace of development in first quarter 2021 compared to first quarter of 2020. The decrease was partially offset by a $2 million increase in wind revenue year-over-year as a result of the higher electrical rates during the winter storm. Moving to the expense side. Our largest cost savings were on water service-related expenses, which were $3.3 million, down from $6.8 million in the prior year's quarter, a decrease of 51.4%. This decrease was primarily a result of the lower water sales volumes previously discussed. In addition, we continue to see cost savings due to our capital spend on electrifying our water sourcing infrastructure. The use of electricity in lieu of diesel-powered generators reduces cost for equipment rental, fuel and maintenance and repairs. Salary and related employee expenses were $10 million, down from $10.6 million in the prior year. G&A expenses were $2.8 million, down from $3 million in the same quarter last year. These contributed to a total reduction in operating expenses from $26.1 million in the first quarter of 2020 to $22.1 million in the first quarter of 2021. Lastly, cash flow from operating activities for the first quarter was $52.4 million. Now, turning to our balance sheet. As of the end of the first quarter, we had $310.7 million of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $29.6 million from year-end 2020. We continue to carry no debt, as Ty mentioned previously. We did not purchase or sell any land or oil and gas royalty interest in the first quarter. In the first quarter of 2021, we invested $2.7 million in capital to maintain and enhance our water sourcing assets. As discussed previously, the bulk of the investment was on electrifying our water sourcing infrastructure to further reduce our water sourcing and transportation costs. Looking forward for the balance of 2021, we anticipate spending an additional $7 million to $9 million of capital on our water sourcing infrastructure. With regard to the dividend, for the first quarter, our Board has declared a cash dividend of $2.75 per common share, payable on June 15th to shareholders of record as of June 8th. The Board will continue to evaluate additional dividends in the future. We did not repurchase any common stock in the first quarter. However, on May 3rd, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program to purchase up to an aggregate of $20 million of our outstanding stock through December 31, 2021. We plan to enter into a 10b5-1 trading plan that would generally permit the Company to repurchase shares at times when it might otherwise be prevented from doing so under securities laws. In conclusion, we will continue to evaluate our options and be disciplined in our capital decisions in order to maximize shareholder value through distributions, share repurchases and select investment activity. Now back to Ty."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Texas Pacific Land Corporation's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. This conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Shawn Amini, Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nShawn Amini: Thank you for joining us today for Texas Pacific Land Corporation's fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings conference call. Yesterday afternoon, the company released its financial results and filed its Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is available on the Investors section of the company's website at www.texapacific.com. As a reminder, remarks made on today's conference call may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. We do not undertake any obligation to update our forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. For a more detailed discussion of the factors that may affect the company's results, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings. During this call, we will also be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. More information and reconciliations about these non-GAAP financial measures are contained in our earnings release and SEC filings. Please also note, we may at times refer to our company by its stock ticker, TPL. This morning's conference call is hosted by TPL's Chief Executive Officer, Ty Glover; and Chief Financial Officer, Chris Steddum. Management will make some prepared comments, after which, we will open the call for questions. Now, I will turn the call over to Ty.\nTy Glover: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2022 was a consecutive record year for TPL. Full year 2022 revenue of $667 million exceeded the previous record by over $170 million. We not only generated record revenues from our oil and gas royalties, but our combined water sales, produced water royalties and easements and service-related income also had its best year ever, generating over $200 million of revenue. We achieved a full year consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin of 89% as we continue to efficiently convert revenue into cash flow. We returned $335 million of capital back to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, and we exited the year with zero debt and over $500 million of cash on the balance sheet. The company also made progress towards expanding our revenue opportunities beyond our legacy business. In 2022, we increased our contracted renewable production on our surface by 37% year-over-year. We signed agreements for the potential development of carbon capture, battery storage and bitcoin mining facilities, and we continue to have a lot of good discussions on other interesting fronts. On the topic of carbon capture, we were glad to strike an agreement last month with Ozona. We've been impressed with Ozona's expertise and initiatives, and it's encouraging to see these projects move closer towards reality. Our goal at TPL is to help lay the groundwork as the carbon capture industry scales up and position ourselves to be a key part of the solution and value chain. Another opportunity that we've been working to exploit is sand deposits located on our acreage. We recently executed four separate contracts on in-basin wet sand mines. This reflects years of effort by the team here in conducting geologic studies to identify sand deposits, to assess the feasibility of utilizing wet sand for well completion and to proactively initiate discussions with operators and customers to underwrite development. These potential projects would generate direct revenue benefit to TPL. They would also deliver the dual benefit of sourcing a critical input used in the development of TPL royalty acreage, while also significantly reducing truck congestion and associated emissions compared to using sand sourced and transported from out of basin. Yesterday, we announced an agreement with bpx, a subsidiary of BP, to provide comprehensive source water, produced water offtake and surface access across approximately 270,000 acres spanning Culberson, Loving and Reeves Counties. This agreement will facilitate bpx's oil and gas development of a high-quality resourcebase in the Delaware Basin, while providing TPL incremental value across multiple water and surface revenue streams. We have known and worked with the BP team for a long time, and we're very excited to see them ramp Permian development. I also want to spend some time today discussing some broader Permian topics pertinent to TPL. First is the potential trend of declining well productivity. TPL of course doesn't operate owned gas wells, so we don't have the detailed perspective that our operators do, but we do monitor what's going on in our backyard. What we've observed is that operators continue to experiment with optimal development strategy, especially for acreage prospected for multiple zones. Trend seems to be that an increasing number of operators are moving towards co-development of multiple zones within a section, as opposed to drilling one zone first and then returning at a later time to develop the other zones. We'd note that, a large portion of our operators have been deploying the former co-development strategy for quite some time, resulting thus far in consistently robust well productivity. In addition, laterals on our acreage continue to trend longer. Fourth quarter 2022 was the first quarter where new permitted wells, new spuds, new completions and new producing wells each averaged over 10,000 feet. Overall, we continue to see strong well performance and productivity across our acreage. One other industry focal point is the increasing price differential between local Permian natural gas and coastal markets. As many are aware, natural gas pipeline capacity out of the Permian remains tight. Some relief will come this year, with a couple of pipeline capacity expansions and repairs. That said, we have started to see natural gas pricing realizations weaken, especially among smaller independent and private producers. Although, marginally weaker gas realizations will negatively impact our royalty revenue, it presents significant upside for TPL on the surface side. Insufficient takeaway capacity means that the industry has an incentive to develop additional new midstream infrastructure. And given our vast checker-boarded surface footprint, this presents pipeline easement opportunities for TPL to pursue. Any revenue that we lose from weaker gas differentials, we could potentially more than offset with incremental easements. This is another example of the benefit of our active management approach and the natural hedges that we've built into the business here. Another item, we are watching closely is the evolving practice of handling produced water, especially in response to the previous seismic response areas, otherwise referred to as SRAs. As a reminder, these SRAs were enacted by the State Railroad Commission in response to previous seismic activity. Among the biggest impact of the SRAs was the reduction of injection rates into deep-formation saltwater disposal wells otherwise referred to as SWDs. As a result, deep-formation SWDs have generally experienced much lower utilization, and we've concurrently seen a large increase in demand for shallow-formation SWD permits on our surface. Going back to the inception of our water business, we've been very deliberate in limiting the amount of deep SWD permitting on TPL. This helps to preserve viability of third-party infrastructure operating on our surface, while also keeping with our focus on sustainability and safety. Just to reiterate TPL does not own or operate SWDs. Rather, we have negotiated with various operators a type of surface use agreement that pays TPL royalty for any produced water barrels that are either stored directly on or that cross TPL's surface. These agreements in aggregate cover acreage spanning approximately 0.5 million acres in West Texas. Contracts also contain strong indemnification language protecting TPL interest as operator and water midstream companies continue to build and develop infrastructure on our surface. It's not an accident, how we set up the water business here at TPL, and this all serves as a testament to our water team for their skill and foresight. Looking forward to 2023, although we do not control the direction of commodity prices which directly impacts a large portion of our revenues the TPL team remains committed to sustaining our positive momentum. Our assets are positioned in the heart of one of the best resource plays found anywhere in the world, and should development slow down in response to lower commodity prices or other constraints the immense resource still remains in the ground and available to be exploited in the future when commodity prices strengthen. Finally, I want to thank all the employees here at TPL for their diligent work and commitment. In 2022, we had zero spills, zero reportable safety incidents, reduced our Scope one emissions by 34%. So not only did our employees help the company achieve record revenues, industry-leading consolidated adjusted EBITDA margins and record earnings and free cash flow per share, but they did it safely efficiently and with a stakeholder mentality. With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris to discuss our financial results.\nChris Steddum: Thanks, Ty. The total revenue for fiscal year 2022 was $667 million, a 48% year-over-year increase. Net income of $446 million during fiscal year 2022, was also a corporate record and this represents a 65% increase compared to prior year net income. The strong performance was driven not only by higher commodity prices and higher royalty production, but also year-over-year revenue increases of 25% for source water, 24% increase in produced water royalties, and 28% increase in easements and other surface-related income. Excluding ad valorem taxes, a new expense we started to accrue in 2022, our total consolidated operating expenses increased 9% year-over-year. The increase was mostly driven by an approximately $4 million increase, in water service-related expenses as a result of higher source water sales volumes. Royalty production for the full year and for the fourth quarter of 2022, each came in at approximately 21,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day. On a sequential quarter-over-quarter basis, oil and gas royalty production declined by approximately 9%. On a year-over-year basis, royalty production grew by approximately 15%. As we regularly discussed in the past, quarterly oil and gas royalty production will normally have some embedded volatility related to the timing of when we receive our royalty revenue check stubs, versus when that production actually occurred in the field. To that end, let me provide some additional context on what we can expect for production going forward. Based on our internal data to date in 2022, we had new permits of 876 gross and 10.9 on a net basis. For spuds in 2022, so far our tally show 835 gross and 10.3 net. We consider these to be very strong levels, not just for 2022, but also to support 2023 development activity. Data that occurred during the fourth quarter, tends to lag a few months for new completion and new producing wells. But if we look at third quarter 2022 data, which has been more fully reported we show new completions of 262 gross and 3.1 net and new producing wells of 208 gross and 2.7 net. Again, this represents very robust levels for the company and supports strong production levels. I mentioned earlier, current commodity prices across the board have declined from the elevated levels we saw for much of 2022, and natural gas takeaway is tight. We have seen this diminished price realizations most especially for smaller independents and privates that generally, don't have as much committed pipe capacity. Those factors among others could contribute to a moderated growth trajectory in the short term for the Permian, as a whole. At TPL, we do have a few things working in our favor. First, activity on our acreage is dominated by large integrated and large independent energy companies, which tend to have more contracted pipeline takeaway capacity and more resilient capital budgets, through periods of commodity price volatility. Second, our Northern Delaware royalty acreage, which has significantly higher net royalty interest, compared to our Midland royalty acreage, continues to receive a lot of attention from operators. Our land and water teams continue to be as busy as ever. And although, quarterly production figures can jump around somewhat quarter-to-quarter, we have strong conviction that TPL's royalty production continues to trend upward. In conclusion, last week we announced that our Board has approved increasing our quarterly dividend by $0.25 to $3.25 per share. For the fourth quarter of 2022, we repurchased approximately 12,000 shares for approximately $29 million. Starting in 2023, we now have an expanded $250 million share repurchase plan that replaces our previous $100 million repurchase plan. We intend to repurchase shares under this plan throughout the year, and the expanded size of this plan provides us the ability to accelerate share repurchases depending on factors such as commodity prices, market volatility and the relative attractiveness of special dividends and other value-enhancing options. Our high-margin capital-light and net cash position ensures the company will have substantial free cash flow, even during potential prolonged periods of depressed commodity prices and those unique virtues provide us with a lot of flexibility, and opportunity to actively allocate capital to enhance shareholder value, through virtually any commodity price environment. With that, operator, we will now take questions. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Derrick Whitfield with Stifel. Please proceed\nDerrick Whitfield: Good morning, all.\nA \u2013 Ty Glover: Good morning, Derrick\nA \u2013 Chris Steddum: Good morning, Derrick\nDerrick Whitfield: Good morning. For my first question I wanted to focus on the growth outlook for your business segments. With the understanding, that you don't provide quarterly guidance, how should we think about the near-term production trajectory in light of your line of sight activity and what appears to be a one-off quarter in Q4? \nChris Steddum: Yes. Thanks, Derrick. Like we said in the comments, any given quarter there is going to be some volatility. The timing under which some of these wells get completed and where rigs are related to our interest can certainly cause some volatility quarter-to-quarter. But I still think our general view is TPL can continue to outperform the Permian as a whole over the near to medium-term. And some of the things we also look at that encourage us that we're still in a real strong position. When we exited 4Q 2022, when I look at our normalized DUC count, it's basically as high as it's ever been. And so to your point when we think about near-term inventory, that DUC count is really that near-term inventory we have available to draw from and where most of our production for the coming year is going to come from. And so the fact that we've got a really nice set of normalized net DUCs gives me a lot of encouragement about the production that will be coming here in the near-term for us.\nTy Glover: Derrick, I would just add. One of the main things that gives us that comfort that Chris was talking about are these broad development agreements like we announced yesterday that we put in place with bpx. We've talked about these agreements in the past that cover these large AMIs. So if you look at that one that's a multifaceted agreement that covers surface use source water sales, produced water off-take, recycling treatment. So getting an agreement in place with a major operator like bpx that covers that much acreage. Now we've got most of our acreage in the Delaware with most of our major operators covered with a development agreement similar to this. And so that really gives the operator like bpx the certainty that they need for their operations so that they can ramp up development across their leasehold and it also makes sure that TPL is involved in the entire value chain produced from that development. So we're really excited about that. We think it's going to create a lot of value for both companies. Something that we've been working on for a long time and I'm really excited to see it finally come together.\nDerrick Whitfield: That's great. Maybe Ty just to clarify too on the bpx announcement. Does that add third-party services across your footprint? Meaning new acreage dedications that you wouldn't have had otherwise, or really simply just facilitate bpx's ability to grow by streamlining the processes. \nTy Glover: Yes. I think it's a bit of both. So it adds to the ongoing relationship that we've had with bpx and then just opening up more acreage for them setting out terms of development ahead of time so that they can move faster.\nDerrick Whitfield: Terrific. And as my follow-up I wanted to reference some of your prepared comments on SLEM and specifically, the wet sand opportunity. Could you perhaps elaborate on the potential of that development and when we could first expect meaningful revenue? \nTy Glover: Yes. So we announced four sand mines that we've contracted. We've done a lot of work over the last couple of years geologic studies coring, locating the sand deposits that we have on TPL's surface. So we've got four sands. We're still working on locating additional sand deposits so we think there's future potential there as well. I think we'll start to see some revenue this year from the mines that we've contracted. And probably within a couple of years I think that's probably going to add somewhere around $20 million in revenue for the company. And so I think there's a lot of benefit to in-basin wet sand mining right? You're getting closer to the development, so you're reducing truck traffic, you're saving money, reducing emissions, making the roads safer to travel, you're not running a dryer. So the end user, which is the operator is able to save money, which increases their efficiency for development and should attract additional development to our acreage.\nDerrick Whitfield: Very helpful. Thanks for your time and thoughts.\nTy Glover: Thanks Derrick.\nOperator: Our next question is from Hamed Khorsand with BWS Financial. Please proceed.\nHamed Khorsand: Good morning. First off I just want to ask about this bpx agreement. How -- where are these or how abundant are these? And why would a company want to use so many acres from you, or is that more of a highlight of the assets that you own?\nTy Glover: Yeah. So the acreage announced that 270,000 acres, bpx has leasehold spread all within that AMI. And this actually covers parts of three different counties. So they're not necessarily going to be using all 270,000 acres, it just gives them the right to use our surface for certain things gives us the ability to supply them water increase water offtake things like that. So we're not necessarily using all of those acres, but it just gives both parties certain rights within that AMI.\nHamed Khorsand: Okay. Are there deals like of this size out there? Are there other more of these size deals out there?\nTy Glover: I mean, we've announced in the past that we've got large AMI agreements like this with multiple operators on our acreage. There's still some acreage probably left out there. But I think especially in the Delaware, we've probably got most of our acreage with most of our operators contracted under some sort of broad agreement like this.\nHamed Khorsand: And the other question I had was about new sources of revenue in your existing acreage. Are you putting more emphasis on trying to develop the acreage for traditional oil, or how much of your time and resources are you applying for new revenue sources?\nTy Glover: That's a good question. I mean, obviously, we focus a lot on the legacy business. But in the last couple of years we've got an internal team that's focused solely on next-gen opportunities and creating revenue outside of that legacy footprint. So I think more and more we can continue to focus on those non-legacy type opportunities.\nHamed Khorsand: Okay. And my last question is any methodology to the current stock buyback program? You haven't really utilized the $250 million yet.\nChris Steddum: Yeah. Well, I mean, I think that program just started off. And so I think as we've said in some of the prepared remarks and press releases, a lot of it is going to be opportunistic. And we're going to look at a variety of different factors to determine when to deploy that capital over the coming year and years. And -- but I think we're going to continue to be good stewards of that capital as we have in the past and try to use it for what we think is best for the shareholders. And as we said, there can be a variety of different things. It can be regular dividends, special dividends and buybacks. And so we just continue to try to optimize it in what is a volatile market and try to use it as best we can.\nHamed Khorsand: A follow-up guys. What is your preferred cash level? I mean, you're adding quite a bit every quarter.\nChris Steddum: Yeah. Look I think -- we think that having a robust cash balance especially in times like these where there's a lot of uncertainty provide us with really good opportunities. And again as we've shown in the past when we think the time is right we can take that cash and return it to shareholders in lots of different efficient ways. But as of right now, we felt like a good use of that cash is to hold some on the balance sheet because we think there may be some good opportunities coming up in the near-term to utilize it.\nHamed Khorsand: Okay. Thank you.\nTy Glover: Thanks, Hamed.\nChris Steddum: Thanks, Hamed.\nOperator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",

As we regularly discussed in the past, quarterly oil and gas royalty production will normally have some embedded volatility related to the timing of when we receive our royalty revenue check stubs, versus when that production actually occurred in the field. To that end, let me provide some additional context on what we can expect for production going forward. Based on our internal data to date in 2022, we had new permits of 876 gross and 10.9 on a net basis. For spuds in 2022, so far our tally show 835 gross and 10.3 net. We consider these to be very strong levels, not just for 2022, but also to support 2023 development activity. Data that occurred during the fourth quarter, tends to lag a few months for new completion and new producing wells. But if we look at third quarter 2022 data, which has been more fully reported we show new completions of 262 gross and 3.1 net and new producing wells of 208 gross and 2.7 net. Again, this represents very robust levels for the company and supports strong production levels. I mentioned earlier, current commodity prices across the board have declined from the elevated levels we saw for much of 2022, and natural gas takeaway is tight. We have seen this diminished price realizations most especially for smaller independents and privates that generally, don't have as much committed pipe capacity. Those factors among others could contribute to a moderated growth trajectory in the short term for the Permian, as a whole. At TPL, we do have a few things working in our favor. First, activity on our acreage is dominated by large integrated and large independent energy companies, which tend to have more contracted pipeline takeaway capacity and more resilient capital budgets, through periods of commodity price volatility. Second, our Northern Delaware royalty acreage, which has significantly higher net royalty interest, compared to our Midland royalty acreage, continues to receive a lot of attention from operators. Our land and water teams continue to be as busy as ever. And although, quarterly production figures can jump around somewhat quarter-to-quarter, we have strong conviction that TPL's royalty production continues to trend upward. In conclusion, last week we announced that our Board has approved increasing our quarterly dividend by $0.25 to $3.25 per share. For the fourth quarter of 2022, we repurchased approximately 12,000 shares for approximately $29 million. Starting in 2023, we now have an expanded $250 million share repurchase plan that replaces our previous $100 million repurchase plan. We intend to repurchase shares under this plan throughout the year, and the expanded size of this plan provides us the ability to accelerate share repurchases depending on factors such as commodity prices, market volatility and the relative attractiveness of special dividends and other value-enhancing options. Our high-margin capital-light and net cash position ensures the company will have substantial free cash flow, even during potential prolonged periods of depressed commodity prices and those unique virtues provide us with a lot of flexibility, and opportunity to actively allocate capital to enhance shareholder value, through virtually any commodity price environment. With that, operator, we will now take questions. Yes. Thanks, Derrick. Like we said in the comments, any given quarter there is going to be some volatility. The timing under which some of these wells get completed and where rigs are related to our interest can certainly cause some volatility quarter-to-quarter. But I still think our general view is TPL can continue to outperform the Permian as a whole over the near to medium-term. And some of the things we also look at that encourage us that we're still in a real strong position. When we exited 4Q 2022, when I look at our normalized DUC count, it's basically as high as it's ever been. And so to your point when we think about near-term inventory, that DUC count is really that near-term inventory we have available to draw from and where most of our production for the coming year is going to come from. And so the fact that we've got a really nice set of normalized net DUCs gives me a lot of encouragement about the production that will be coming here in the near-term for us. Yeah. Well, I mean, I think that program just started off. And so I think as we've said in some of the prepared remarks and press releases, a lot of it is going to be opportunistic. And we're going to look at a variety of different factors to determine when to deploy that capital over the coming year and years. And -- but I think we're going to continue to be good stewards of that capital as we have in the past and try to use it for what we think is best for the shareholders. And as we said, there can be a variety of different things. It can be regular dividends, special dividends and buybacks. And so we just continue to try to optimize it in what is a volatile market and try to use it as best we can. Yeah. Look I think -- we think that having a robust cash balance especially in times like these where there's a lot of uncertainty provide us with really good opportunities. And again as we've shown in the past when we think the time is right we can take that cash and return it to shareholders in lots of different efficient ways. But as of right now, we felt like a good use of that cash is to hold some on the balance sheet because we think there may be some good opportunities coming up in the near-term to utilize it. Thanks, Hamed."

This morning's conference call is hosted by TPL's Chief Executive Officer, Ty Glover; and Chief Financial Officer, Chris Steddum. Management will make some prepared comments, after which, we will open the call for questions. Now I will turn the call over to Ty.\nTy Glover: Thanks, Shawn. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Third quarter 2022 represents another well-rounded performance across the TPL business. Consolidated revenues increased 8% and net income increased 9% sequential quarter-over-quarter, driven by growing oil and gas royalty production, outstanding source water and produced water performance and continued strong SLEM activity. Royalty production for the third quarter of approximately 23,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day is a new corporate record. On the water side, during this most recent quarter, we sourced and treated over 40 million barrels of water. Since the water business inception, TPL has sourced or treated over 500 million barrels of water, which we estimate is responsible for over 1,000 new well completions in the Permian, with many of these on TPL royalty acreage. On the produce side, we generated contracted royalty volumes on approximately 190 million barrels of water. Recall, we don't own or operate any saltwater disposal infrastructure. Rather, we collect a contracted royalty fee on produced water that is injected in or crosses our surface. Over half our produced water volumes that we generated royalty on last quarter were actually injected into SWDs located off of TPL surface. Last quarter, we saw a nice uptick in SLEM revenues, and that strong performance carried over into third quarter. Activity is up across the board in SLEM, with large year-over-year increases for wellbore easements, pipeline easements and material sales. Just on the land side alone, this past quarter, we papered up 233 new contracts, which is nearly double what we did during the same quarter last year. Recent highlights include two separate contracts for mobile mini sand mines. These sand mines not only help support completion activities in the Permian, but because the sand is developed and sourced in-basin, it reduces the amount of heavy truck traffic in the region. And of course, TPL will generate a royalty for every ton extracted, with zero CapEx or operating expenses required from us. Our land managers do an incredible job overseeing a vast acreage footprint and working every day with operators to stay in front of their needs and to help facilitate development. In addition to our core active management activities on the land side, we've had a team tasked specifically to pursue alternative and next-generation uses for our nearly 1 million-acre surface asset. Investments in time and resources we've dedicated to this venture over the past few years are bearing results. Yesterday, we announced that TPL signed an agreement with Samsung Solar Energy 2, LLC to begin evaluating the siting in grid-connected batteries located on TPL's surface. Preliminary studies have begun to evaluate project viability throughout West Texas, where an abundant amount of transmission infrastructure overlaps with TPL. These battery projects could help enhance grid reliability and encourage further renewables development across TPL's footprint. TPL is thrilled to have someone looking to develop these next-generation projects on our surface, and we look forward to collaborating together to hopefully bring these projects to fruition. We also continue to make good progress on the solar and wind front. This year, we've increased the amount of solar and wind projects contracted on our surface by over 30% from what we had coming into the year. In summary, our surface asset is unique not only for its size, but also because it contains water rights and aquifers, exposure to excellent solar and wind resource, materials deposits, electrical grid access, connectivity to gas processing facilities, subsurface pore space, among many other desirable features. Our employees leverage their extensive relationships with Permian producers and across the energy industry to source and collaborate on new projects. The access to all these things at massive scale makes us an attractive partner for interesting opportunities, and we're having a lot of good conversations with developers, engineers, entrepreneurs and companies on a wide array of new technologies and ideas. Changing gears, I'd like to remind everyone that our annual meeting is in two weeks. Proxy materials have been filed with the SEC and distributed to shareholders, and I would encourage everyone to carefully review the materials and vote. If any shareholders have any questions or issues, please do not hesitate to contact Investor Relations. And finally, I want to thank all the employees here at TPL. Our team does an amazing job of proactively serving our customers while also creating real value for our shareholders. Their tireless efforts and consistent performance are the engine of this company, and I'm proud to work with them every day. With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris to discuss our quarterly results.\nChris Steddum: Thanks, Ty. Total revenue for the third quarter of 2022 was $191 million, which was driven by increases across all of our major revenue streams on a sequential quarter-over-quarter basis. Oil and gas royalty revenue was up 7% quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to higher royalty production, though partially offset by lower crude oil and NGL prices. Crude and NGL price realizations declined sequentially by 13% and 15%, respectively, while natural gas realizations increased 21%. Third quarter royalty production increased 18% sequentially to approximately 23,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was driven by strong operator activity, especially in our Loving and Reeves County royalty acreage. As Ty mentioned, our land and water teams remain very busy working with operators on facilitating upstream development. New permits and spuds so far in 2022 are tracking well ahead of 2021 levels. For permits, we are averaging about 80 gross and 1 net new well per month this year. For spuds, we are averaging about 70 gross and 0.9 net new wells every month. Lateral lengths also continue to get longer with the average permitted well on our royalty acreage now over 10,000 feet long. Well statuses on TPL acreage as of quarter end included 5.6 net permitted wells, 6.9 net DUCs, 2.9 net completed wells and 55 net producing wells. I'll note that the sequential decline in net permitted wells was largely from removing permits that we viewed to be stale or likely to lapse, and this represented about 1.8 net wells. This decline refers to the well status on a static basis, which is not to be confused by the strong activity for new permits we've seen throughout 2022. Our $100 million buyback authorization was active during the quarter, and we repurchased approximately 19,000 shares for approximately $33 million. We intend for the buyback program to remain active through the end of the year. In addition, yesterday, we announced that our Board has authorized a new $250 million share repurchase authorization which will take effect after the expiration of our existing buyback program at the end of the year. As many of you know, share buybacks have long been an important part of TPL's history, and buybacks remain an important aspect of our capital allocation toolbox. We're glad to put this new program in place, and we believe it further enhances TPL's ability to optimize capital returns for our shareholders. Fundamentals at TPL remain excellent, and we continue to generate high-quality, high-margin cash flows with minimal capital needs and a fortress debt-free balance sheet and the robust free cash flow generated by the business affords a tremendous amount of flexibility as we look to maximize shareholder value. With that, operator, we will now take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Derrick Whitfield from Stifel. Please go ahead.\nDerrick Whitfield: Good morning, all. And congrats on your strong operational update.\nTy Glover: Thanks, Derrick.\nDerrick Whitfield: With my first question, I wanted to focus on the annual meeting, regarding the proposed 3-for-1 share split and the share issuance authorization. Could you speak to your capital priorities broadly and the strategic importance of the share issuance in light of your approved share repurchase?\nTy Glover: Yes. Thanks, Derrick. I mean, look, a share authorization just provides a normal course financing tool and gives us additional means to potentially grow the company in an accretive, value-enhancing way. Like you mentioned, it also allows us to affect the 3:1 stock split. So I would just add that this is not a change in strategy, it just gives us additional flexibility and optionality to continue to execute that same strategy that's created tremendous value for our shareholders. We've got a long history of strong performance and capital stewardship. It's something that we've engaged our shareholders on. We've sought advice from government experts on best practices to institute it, and it's something that we feel really good about. So it's all about just adding flexibility and optionality for the company moving forward.\nDerrick Whitfield: That makes sense, Ty. And maybe shifting over to the Samsung Solar Energy agreement. Should we assume that this is a capital-light arrangement similar to other SLEM arrangements?\nTy Glover: Yes, that's correct. I can't say too much beyond what's in the press release, but it's going to be a similar structure to these types of deals that we've done in the past, very capital-light. I'd also just say that this is a great example of the optionality in surface ownership and also the benefit of having a team with a large network of industry relationships. So pretty excited about it. Thing's got a lot of potential to scale up, so.\nDerrick Whitfield: Perfect. And perhaps for Chris, regarding your prepared comments on permits, net of the true-up that you put into play for Q3. Could you give us a sense of the sequential increase in permit activity in comparing Q2 versus Q3?\nChris Steddum: Yes. Thanks, Derrick. When we've looked at kind of like new well activity, what I would say is the way we always, I think, kind of think about these numbers as we compare to 1Q 2020, which was really like the high watermark that we have seen from activity levels across the board. And so when you look at both gross wells, net wells, net normalized wells, this year has generally been in line with those numbers. And so from a new permit activity standpoint, something a little bit in the 225 region was kind of like the high watermark that we've seen, and we have consistently been at or above that all year, including Q3. And so 3Q is slightly -- on the permitting front, it's slightly below 1Q, 2Q on a gross basis. But still, if you look at in context, like historical averages, it's a very strong quarter on the permitting front. So really, that decrease in the net static number, during COVID and everything, there was a little bit of a pause and a delay, and so we were hesitant to pull out older permits. But at this point, I think when we look at them, it's unlikely those stale permits are going to kind of make it into the queue, so to speak. Again, it's not that those wells won't be drilled. It's just once we deem a well is in the queue, you reasonably expect it to get drilled in the next year or two. And we felt it was prudent at this point to kind of pull some of those older ones out. I'm sure they'll work their way back into the queue, but that's really what that adjustment was.\nDerrick Whitfield: That makes sense. And if I could ask one final question. With the understanding that you don't provide quarterly guidance, how should we think about the near-term production trajectory for you guys, kind of thinking into year-end? And the netbacks you'd likely see as a result of the volatility we're experiencing with Waha?\nChris Steddum: Yes, that's a good question. I mean, on the production front, again, I think as we kind of alluded to last time, all of the numbers as far as activity levels have continued to be very strong, the DUCs, the completions. And when we do a look-back at kind of actual production that's come through, the trend has continued to be up through the summer, it appears. And so when we look at the continued activity levels being as strong as they are, I think that's fairly supportive of the continued strong production outlook going through the end of the year. As far as netbacks, that becomes a little more difficult. I think it's clear right now, if you look at kind of the forward expectations, that Waha differential is probably expected to kind of be weaker on a go-forward basis with some of the constraints. Having said that, through our operators, we've always tended to get better realizations on gas than Waha. It usually kind of comes in between Waha and NYMEX. And so when we look at that, granted, you've seen very big differentials in Waha as of late. But our expectation would be that kind of that in between Waha and NYMEX, it's probably still a good number. But with those volatile jumps, it does become difficult to predict. But through time, where there's been other ones similar to this in the past, what has held true is our realizations kind of tend to be in between those two marks. And so we would suspect that will continue.\nDerrick Whitfield: That makes sense. Great update. And thanks for your time.\nChris Steddum: Thanks Derrick.\nTy Glover: Thanks Derrick.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hamed Khorsand from BWS Financial. Please go ahead.\nHamed Khorsand: Good morning. So the first question I had was this return on -- or increase in daily barrels per day. Was that primarily driven by the mobile sand mines that you have on your land? And do you own those? Or are you able to move those around as you see that other customers need them?\nTy Glover: Yes, Hamed, thanks for the question. The increase in production was not related to the mobile sand mines. We've just recently contracted those. We do not own them. We're just working with a strategic partner there to have our sand deposits developed. And so we will be strictly a royalty owner on those mines.\nHamed Khorsand: Okay. And then the other question I had was, do you think that the share splits that you're proposing improves the index that you'll be in, for your stock?\nChris Steddum: Hamed, I would say, look, the share split, the hope would be to -- we've had it analyzed by some of our consultants and banks. The hope would be that it would allow for an increase in the liquidity of TPL's stock and some trading improvements. But as far as index eligibility for future indices and things of that sort, we already have pretty strong metrics. And so our -- I think this is more an enhancement just on the trading. It's not an attempt for us to be included in any index. I think we believe we already generally qualify for most of the indices, and we'll work our way on to new ones in the future.\nHamed Khorsand: Okay. My last question was you sold some land this quarter. Any reason -- particular reason why? Was it just the price? And if you're selling, does that essentially mean you wouldn't be buying at this moment in the market?\nTy Glover: No. I mean, look, the reason that we made those two land sales, I mean, yes, it was robust pricing, but those were kind of specialty sales. So one was for a cryogenic processing plant. The other was for the expansion of an existing substation. And so if you kind of think about those two facilities, right, not only were we able to get a robust price per acre for the land, but that also attracts additional infrastructure and development to those areas. And so like on a cryo plant, for instance, that plant is going to draw additional pipeline easement revenue to our surface. So I think we had something, like $0.75 billion in easement revenue kind of immediately associated with that cryo plant. And in the future, that just continues to draw development from our midstream operators to that particular area. And then the expansion of the existing substation, that's just allowing that operator to expand their power infrastructure in the area, which is also very good for future development. So I wouldn't say that, that pricing reflects the overall market out there and would keep us from being a buyer.\nHamed Khorsand: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I would like to take the opportunity to thank you for your participation. The conference of Texas Pacific Land Corporation has now concluded. Have a wonderful day.",

And so 3Q is slightly -- on the permitting front, it's slightly below 1Q, 2Q on a gross basis. But still, if you look at in context, like historical averages, it's a very strong quarter on the permitting front. So really, that decrease in the net static number, during COVID and everything, there was a little bit of a pause and a delay, and so we were hesitant to pull out older permits. But at this point, I think when we look at them, it's unlikely those stale permits are going to kind of make it into the queue, so to speak. Again, it's not that those wells won't be drilled. It's just once we deem a well is in the queue, you reasonably expect it to get drilled in the next year or two. And we felt it was prudent at this point to kind of pull some of those older ones out. I'm sure they'll work their way back into the queue, but that's really what that adjustment was. Yes, that's a good question. I mean, on the production front, again, I think as we kind of alluded to last time, all of the numbers as far as activity levels have continued to be very strong, the DUCs, the completions. And when we do a look-back at kind of actual production that's come through, the trend has continued to be up through the summer, it appears. And so when we look at the continued activity levels being as strong as they are, I think that's fairly supportive of the continued strong production outlook going through the end of the year. As far as netbacks, that becomes a little more difficult. I think it's clear right now, if you look at kind of the forward expectations, that Waha differential is probably expected to kind of be weaker on a go-forward basis with some of the constraints. Having said that, through our operators, we've always tended to get better realizations on gas than Waha. It usually kind of comes in between Waha and NYMEX. And so when we look at that, granted, you've seen very big differentials in Waha as of late. But our expectation would be that kind of that in between Waha and NYMEX, it's probably still a good number. But with those volatile jumps, it does become difficult to predict. But through time, where there's been other ones similar to this in the past, what has held true is our realizations kind of tend to be in between those two marks. And so we would suspect that will continue. Thanks Derrick. Hamed, I would say, look, the share split, the hope would be to -- we've had it analyzed by some of our consultants and banks. The hope would be that it would allow for an increase in the liquidity of TPL's stock and some trading improvements. But as far as index eligibility for future indices and things of that sort, we already have pretty strong metrics. And so our -- I think this is more an enhancement just on the trading. It's not an attempt for us to be included in any index. I think we believe we already generally qualify for most of the indices, and we'll work our way on to new ones in the future."

I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Shawn Amini, Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nShawn Amini: Good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Texas Pacific Land Corporation's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Yesterday afternoon, the company released its financial results and filed its Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission that's available on the Investors section of the company's website at www.texaspacific.com. As a reminder, remarks made on today's conference call may include forward-looking statements.

Please also note, we may at times refer to our company by stock ticker, TPL. This morning's conference call is hosted by TPL's Chief Executive Officer, Ty Glover; and Chief Financial Officer, Chris Steddum. Management will make some prepared comments, after which we will open the call for questions. Now I will turn the call over to Ty.\nTy Glover: Thank you, Shawn. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Second quarter 2022 results demonstrate a business operating at a high level. All of TPL's major revenue streams reported double-digit percentage growth on a sequential quarter-over-quarter basis, the total consolidated revenue growing 20%. Adjusted EBITDA of $158 million represents a new corporate record, and our adjusted EBITDA margin of 90% demonstrates our continued focus on maintaining a lean cost structure in generating high margins. During this most recent quarter alone, we returned over $200 million back to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks while still maintaining a balance sheet with 0 debt, retaining nearly $400 million of cash. Although our royalty production came in slightly lower sequentially, this quarter is a great example of the resiliency and the numerous high-quality revenue streams the company benefits from beyond just oil and gas royalties. Source water revenues were up 18%, reduced water royalty revenues were up 26% and revenues for surface leases, easements and materials, which we refer to as SLEM, were up 52%. SLEM and source water sales, in particular, are generally good leading indicators for royalty production with the increased business activity this quarter, providing confidence that we'll continue to see strong development on our royalty acreage. On the source water side, sales volumes increased 40% sequentially with increases across all the major channels, brackish, brokered and treatment. Due to high water demand, we have increased our CapEx budget to accommodate new frac ponds, tanks, pipes and pumps. We now expect full year CapEx of approximately $18 million to $20 million. In particular, demand from the Midland Basin and Reeves County is very strong. We're still observing some operator supply chain issues in the field, so they do seem to be easing slightly. However, excess DUC balances appear close to depleting, and we're now seeing some friction and delays related to scheduling as operators try to manage quick turnaround timing and finishing new spuds in advance of plant completion. On the produced water side, increased revenues were largely driven by higher volumes from new tie-ins and overall increased injection demand. Now turning to SLEM. The large percentage increase in revenues this quarter was particularly encouraging. For the last couple of years, performance in that business has been flat as operators generally concentrated development around existing infrastructure. However, in the second quarter, we saw broad strength in SLEM with meaningful higher demand for new surface, subsurface wellbore easement, pipeline easements and caliche. SLEM activity is strong across both our Delaware and Midland surface position with demand from both upstream and midstream operators. All of this activity is broadly suggestive of continued strong development pacing on and around our royalty acreage. The outlook for the oil and gas industry remains promising, and our shareholders should continue to benefit from the free cash flow afforded by ongoing development in the Permian and high commodity prices. That said, at TPL, we're also excited about the future beyond just oil and gas. We continue to dedicate meaningful time and resources towards finding and executing on next-generation opportunities that can leverage our unique and expansive surface position in West Texas. During the quarter, we revealed a couple of projects that we've been working on for quite some time. We announced the bitcoin mining venture with Mawson Infrastructure Group and JAI Energy to develop a 60-megawatt facility on TPL surface. Once complete, the facility will generate a unique high-margin royalty stream for TPL. We also announced an agreement with Milestone Carbon to evaluate the potential to sequester captured CO2 on TPL acreage. Milestone team is amongst the best in the industry, and we look forward to working with them in potentially bringing more carbon capture opportunities to the Permian. TPL continues to have numerous constructive conversations on a wide array of next-gen opportunities. We look forward to advancing these projects as we strive to maximize the value of TPL's expansive surface footprint. On the ESG front, we have posted updated 2021 data on our website with reduced Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 6% year-over-year, and we hope with our continued electrification and efficiency efforts, we can improve that further. We continue to make progress across multiple ESG initiatives, and we encourage everyone to visit the ESG portion of our website for more disclosures. An update on the governance side. Board has approved a proposal to amend the company's charter to declassify the board, which will be included in the proxy materials for the company's 2022 Annual Meeting. We're pleased to see our Board make progress on this item, and we look forward to hosting our annual meeting this upcoming November. Finally, I want to thank all the employees here at TPL. Without their dedication, hard work and talent, this outstanding performance we've had across the entire business would not be possible. We ask a lot from our field and corporate employees and they consistently rise to the challenge. With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris to discuss our quarterly results.\nChris Steddum: Thanks, Ty. Total revenue for the second quarter of 2022 was $176 million, which was driven by double-digit percentage increases across all of our major revenue streams on a sequential quarter-over-quarter basis. Oil and gas royalty revenue was up 16% quarter-over-quarter primarily due to higher commodity prices but partially offset by lower royalty production. Second quarter royalty production of 19,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day did come in slightly lower compared to last quarter, though oil production was slightly higher at approximately 8,900 barrels of oil per day. Commodity price realizations continue to be excellent as each oil, natural gas and NGL price realizations increased by double-digit percentages sequential quarter-over-quarter, which we fully benefited from as we are still completely unhedged. As Ty alluded, the strong performance in water and SLEM are encouraging data points as we look ahead to the second half of the year. To elaborate a bit more on the outlook, our well inventory data is also aligned in what we consider to be a positive trajectory for the overall business. We've seen a meaningful uptick in new permits during the first half of the year with over 500 gross well permits through June compared to approximately 750 gross well permits for all of 2021. We averaged approximately 70 gross spuds per month year-to-date through June, which represents an approximate 37% increase compared to the 2021 average of approximately 55 gross spuds per month. Our data suggests a bit of a slowdown during the first quarter of 2022 for new completions compared to the pacings during the second half of 2021. However, we do maintain a higher-than-normal inventory of completed but unproductive wells, and we expect these to turn to sales once those wells are tied in. Our $100 million buyback authorization was active during the quarter, and we repurchased approximately 17,000 shares for approximately $26 million. We intend for the buyback program to remain active through the end of the year. We continue to evaluate our capital allocation priorities and with a large cash balance and a business that continues to generate robust free cash flow, we retain a tremendous amount of flexibility as we look to maximize shareholder value. With that, operator, we will now take questions.\nOperator:  Our first question comes from the line of Annis of Stifel.\nJohn Annis: Congrats on a strong update. Can you provide some additional detail on SLEM strength this quarter? As you mentioned in your prepared remarks, that business has been flat for a while. Is there anything you can share on the outlook?\nTy Glover: Yes. Look, I would just say that's very promising usually when we see a ramp in SLEM, that operators getting prepared for additional development in those areas. I would also say that the additional revenue we saw this quarter in that business line was spread out kind of over surface -- wellbore easements, pipeline easements, electric easements, material sales. It kind of hits across the entire business segment. I think that's good news. That's kind of signals to us that maybe it's more of a durable trend than just spotty activity. But the land easement has been really busy lately working on a lot of projects. So I think we're going to continue to see some strength in that area of the business.\nJohn Annis: Got it. Then under the next-gen opportunities, can you share how those came about? And any initial thoughts on revenue potential and timing for those things?\nTy Glover: Yes. So look, we've got a team -- part of our BD team internally is dedicated to just seeking out next-gen opportunities. And so those opportunities came through. The team just reaching out within the different industries and kind of trying to track down different opportunities for us to expand the use of our surface. So with the bitcoin mining deal with Mawson and JAI, I think Mawson recently put out a press release back in May that, that facility would be operational by Q4 of '22. So that's very promising. On the carbon capture side, we're having some really good conversations there. We announced the deal, so letter of intent we signed with Milestone. So they're going to do some studies on some of our properties to see if it's viable for carbon sequestration. So I think we'll continue to see some promising conversations regarding that area of the business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Khorsand of BWS Financial.\nHamed Khorsand : First off, I just want to ask about the easement revenue bumping up. Were there any onetime revenue in that number? Or was this purely because of increased activity?\nTy Glover: Yes. So what we saw was it was really just increased activity. I mean, obviously, like a material sale is a onetime event, but we continue to see strong material sales. As far as the pipeline easement itself, most of those return easement a lot of well connects, gathering lines being put in place. So rather than like a big onetime long-haul perpetual easement like we've seen in the past, most of this has been recurrent revenue.\nHamed Khorsand : And the commentary around the increase in CapEx to support the water business. Is that because you have clarity as far as how much demand you're expecting over the next year?\nTy Glover: Yes. So if you look at like our original budget, it was kind of in that $12 million to $14 million range. So we continue to see a lot of demand in the water business. The water team has done a fantastic job of signing additional contracts this year. And so we're going to have to spend some additional capital on infrastructure to kind of support those new contracts as well as additional demand from existing customers. So that additional capital is going to go towards things like frac ponds, treatment tanks, some additional pipe to accommodate that demand and not just 2022 demand, but also just kind of in preparation for 2023 demand. And we're also seeing some supply chain issues like pumps that used to take 6 to 8 weeks are now taking 10 to 12 months to procure. So we're trying to stay ahead of those bottlenecks and just make sure that we're ready to support the ramp development from our operators.\nHamed Khorsand : And my last question was on that topic of the supply chain. Is there any kind of time line or estimates when these bottlenecks could smooth out for you and the operators on your land?\nTy Glover: No, I mean it's -- I don't know exactly what that time line looks like. It seems like things are starting to ease a little bit. But as far as what that time line looks like, I don't have a good answer for you there.\nOperator:  Our next question comes from the line of Baker of Credit Suisse.\nChristopher Baker: Congrats on the strong water services results. Great to see those investments in electrification start to pay off in the margin profile. My question was just around whether or not you still see the company as a natural consolidator of minerals longer term, just given the recent Reuters report around bringing minerals potentially pursuing a sale of the company?\nTy Glover: I would say we continue to look at ways to add value for our shareholders. Part of that strategy is evaluating potential acquisitions, not only on the mineral, but things to look at potential surface and water acquisitions as well.\nChristopher Baker: Great. It makes sense. And then just could you remind us -- obviously, there's no debt today, but any guidelines in terms of doing a larger scale deal just around sort of net debt leverage you would be comfortable with for the company?\nChris Steddum: Yes, Chris, I mean, a lot of that depends on the nature of the assets that you're buying. But I think we've been pretty clear in the past that very low to 0 leverage is what we think is appropriate for this type of business. And so that's likely what you should expect where we do so.\nChristopher Baker: Okay. And by low -- sorry, just to clarify sort of like sub-1x or 1.5x? Is there like a ballpark number that you talked about in the past, perhaps?\nChris Steddum: Yes. I don't think we've specifically talked about a number, but -- and I'm not sure I'd be comfortable giving exact guidance on that because when you're talking about theoretical things, it's always difficult. But I think we would be on the lowest end of what you would see out there, which is kind of where we sit today anyway, so.\nChristopher Baker: Sure, sure. And just if I could squeeze in one more. Obviously, some great announcements in terms of CCS study and bitcoin mining, et cetera. As you think about these alternative surface uses, any guideposts -- or goalposts, I guess, you could share in terms of what the aggregate cash flows could be from those efforts over the next few years?\nChris Steddum: I mean, Chris, that's a difficult thing to say. I mean as we said, like even just on the carbon capture, they're evaluating the viability right now. And so until some of those studies are completed, I think that's a very difficult thing to project. But look, I would say stay tuned, we'll give more information as it becomes available. But the team is working very hard to procure new revenue streams on the surface, and we think they're going to bear fruit.\nOperator: And there are no further questions in the queue. That does conclude today's question-and-answer session as well as today's presentation. We do thank you for your participation. That does conclude today's call. Have a great rest of the day, everyone.",

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Yesterday, we announced a special dividend of $20 per share, and this special dividend is incremental to the $100 million share repurchase plan that we announced in March. We're excited that our shareholders will benefit from this increased return of capital driven by strong Permian activity, commodity prices that are some of the best we've seen in a decade, and a balance sheet that is debt free. Looking forward to the rest of 2022, we're bullish that our underlying business fundamentals will remain constructive. We're seeing more rigs added on to our surface and looking at our water sales schedule we can see that producers are intent on maintaining and growing completions pacing throughout the year.  In our surface leases, easements, and materials business, which we refer to as SLEM, we are seeing a noticeable uptick in request for new infrastructure and well pad, especially in the Northern Delaware. All of these signs are a good leading indicator for future development activity. As we look at our well inventory, we have yet more reasons to be encouraged. Permitting activity and drilling activity have moved higher.  For the first quarter of 2022, our data indicates that we had 200 gross spuds on our royalty acreage, which is the highest level since the pandemic. Although some of the increased drilling can be attributed to the fact that operators have less inventory of DUCs to complete, we also continue to see strong overall completions as well. In particular, we're seeing a nice ramp in activity in Loving County. Overall, it was a solid quarter for the Water segment. We did have a couple of frac jobs get deferred where we had source water sales lined up, but the deferrals mostly related to operator struggles with procuring frac sand. The outlook for water in both the sourced and produced side remained strong, and we expect volumes to increase throughout the year, though maybe not without a few hiccups here and there as operators navigate various supply chain and labor constraints.  We're also excited about our updated alliance with Aris, which we announced last month. We've worked with Aris for a long time, and we consider them to be a great partner. In our expanded agreement, we believe that we'll be able to serve operators more efficiently and effectively, as we can leverage our combined competencies and assets to provide operators supply assurances on the source side, and also have readily available solutions on the produced water side so that we can help keep operators' oil and gas development moving along. We have a lot of exciting projects in the next-gen pipeline as well. In fact, just recently, we signed an agreement with Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. to put a behind-the-meter solar project on our surface in Culberson County.  The project will support oil and gas development for a large energy multinational company operating in the region. This project does not require any capital from us, and we will receive annual payments with inflation escalators. We continue to have numerous constructive conversations for similar behind-the-meter solar projects with producers that are on our surface, and we're excited to participate as the domestic oil and gas industry continues to evolve its best practices and show leadership in minimizing Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions associated with development. We are also advancing discussions on utility scale renewable projects, Bitcoin mining, carbon capture and many other innovative and unique opportunities.  We'll share updates and details as we get things signed up, and I'm hopeful we'll be able to cross the finish line on some of these projects in the near term. A few weeks ago, we issued a press release and an 8-K with an update on our Board of Directors and the evaluation of the classification process.  I'm excited to welcome Rhys Best and Karl Kurz as new Board members. Both Rhys and Karl are highly experienced, and they will bring a lot of skills and insights to our boardroom. We're excited about the business and what we can accomplish, and I think our shareholders are going to benefit tremendously from having them on our Board. On the declassification side, our Board and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee continue to work through that. I don't have specific timing to share at this time, but I know our Committee is committed to working diligently and quickly on the matter, and the Board and the Committee have more to share later this year as they make progress.  Wrapping it all up, the business is in a great place today. We're thrilled to be returning a significant amount of cashback to shareholders through a regular dividend through this most recent special dividend and through our recent share buyback program. As many of you know, we have a high margin, low capital intensity business, which means our revenues dropped to free cash flow in a very efficient manner. And as we progress through the year, our business will continue generating more free cash flow. There's certainly room for more dividends and buybacks beyond what we've announced up to today, and it's our priority to make sure our shareholders benefit from the constructive industry environment and the strong underlying business performance.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris to discuss our quarterly results.\nChris Steddum: Thanks, Ty. Total revenue for the first quarter of 2022 was $147 million. On a sequential quarter basis, our revenues were about flat compared to fourth quarter of 2021. Although this most recent quarter benefited from higher oil prices, royalty production was down modestly on a sequential quarter basis. Recall, last quarter benefited from higher-than-normal prior period production. And as Ty mentioned, our well inventory data suggests strong activity on our royalty acreage. We feel good about the growth trajectory of our royalty production for the next year, and over the long term, those certain quarters will be influenced by various factors such as the specific tracks of land, each new well crosses, and also timing related to when we actually receive cash royalty receipts.  Our crude oil price realizations continue to be strong. Generally, we receive $1 or $2 less than WTI Midland. Our gas realizations have improved over the last 6 months or so, and we see some of our larger operators with pricing of both Henry Hub and Waha spot prices. And overall, we've been receiving Henry Hub spot pricing or better. Our NGL price realizations tend to fluctuate between 40% to 50% of WTI, though our NGL realizations this quarter were a bit weaker than normal due to some cash royalty receipts we received for NGL production associated from earlier months with lower pricing. I also want to point out that there's a new operating expense line item for ad valorem taxes, which we accrued an approximate $2 million charge for some background, which we also detailed in our last 10-K filing.  When the company was a trust, there was a legacy agreement where the mineral estate paid ad valorem taxes associated with our NPRIs, following our reorganization to a C-corp, there is a dispute with a mineral estate on whether they were still obligated to pay those taxes for the C-Corp. Out of prudence, we began accruing for these taxes in our GAAP financial statements. Adjusted EBITDA and net income for the quarter were $130 million and $98 million, respectively. We ended the quarter with approximately $507 million of cash though that is before the effect of the $20 per share special dividend we announced with earnings and before our previously announced $100 million share buyback program was active. The buyback program cleared its 30-day cooling-off period in early April, and is currently active.  And with that, operator, we will now take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from John Annis with Stifel.\nJohn Annis: For my first question, could you offer color on Q1 oil production and how you see overall production trends playing out for the year? And then on the water side of the business, could you expand on your prepared remarks and speak to the demand for source water more broadly?\nChris Steddum: This is Chris. Yes. I think like Ty kind of mentioned in his prepared remarks, when we look at permitting activity that we saw in 1Q '22, and we look at the new DUCs that were drilled during 1Q '22, those were some of the highest activity levels for both of those that we've seen really since pre-pandemic, probably 1Q 2020. And so that backdrop is definitely encouraging when we think about what is the near-term inventory that the operators are going to be going after for the rest of the year. And so that makes us feel pretty good about the position we're in.  I think as we've mentioned, in 4Q '21, we had some prior period production that probably acted to increase that production a little bit above normal. And I think we're at the point now where some of that's caught up. And so hopefully, we'll have some normalized quarters here for the rest of the year. And I might let Ty talk to some of the water activity levels.\nTyler Glover: Yes. Thanks. Yes. I would say on the source water side of the business, we had a couple of things happen. First, we had, like I said earlier, a few fracs get deferred. And so those frac jobs got pushed on our schedule, mostly because operators were unable to procure frac sand. So I would say that those jobs were pushed back timing-wise. So we do expect the volumes to come to us at some point this year. Secondly, the seismic response areas are definitely creating some limitations on downhole injection of produced water in some regions.  So as we see that downhole capacity reduced, some of that incremental produced water is being recycled and competes against some of our source water for completion activity. That being said, we can compete on the recycling side as well, especially with the rights we've secured to pull water off, most of the produced water gathering infrastructure that we have on our lands. And we're definitely seeing an uptick in activity in that part of the business as well. So we have seen some near-term disruption. But I think longer term, the water business will continue to perform very well.\nJohn Annis: Great. I appreciate the color. For my follow-up, can you share with us your thoughts on where the best opportunities lie as you balance your growth versus return of capital priorities? Even after the special dividend, and if we assume you complete the $100 million buyback, it still looks like you're going to be generating a substantial amount of free cash flow?\nTyler Glover: Yes. Look, I mean there's still some deals out there. We're running through some of those deals, but I would say, given the current environment with $100 crude and $7 gas, our willingness to transact is probably a little bit diminished at this moment, but also say, sellers are maybe a little aggressive on their ask in this kind of environment. But look, we put in place the $100 million buyback program, which is now active. Obviously, we have our regular dividend, which we raised this year, and we just did the special. And so I think we've got a lot of flexibility, and our intent is just to maintain that flexibility. And I think we've got a nice mix of buybacks and dividends going right now. So going forward, we'll continue to evaluate the market environment and the industry fundamentals. And like I said, just maintaining that flexibility to keep going.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Hamed Khorsand with BWS Financial.\nHamed Khorsand: The first question I had was the drilling activity you're seeing, is there any way for you to know if this is because the producers are low on inventory or if this is price driven?\nChris Steddum: Hamed, when you say low on inventory, are you kind of referring to their inventory? And if they're just trying to backfill some of the DUCs?\nHamed Khorsand: Yes. Their inventory. Exactly.\nChris Steddum: Yes. I think so. I mean we definitely have seen a DUC drawdown that had been occurring. And so I think one of the questions, at least on our acreage is at some point, are they going to kind of continue that drawdown, or what's the point where they start to backfill it. And so 1Q definitely seem to be a quarter where they've started to kind of backfill and increase back up that kind of current inventory that's available. And so some of it's just timing, but I think it is probably safe to say we have seen a trend of DUCs getting drawn down over the last few quarters, and this would be one of the first quarters where they've kind of replenished that. \nHamed Khorsand: Okay. And my other question was, given the sand-sourcing issue, is that broad amongst your customers who pay you royalties? Or is this really just a one-off where the producer is just not adequately ready for the lack of sand availability?\nTyler Glover: Yes. Hamed, thanks. I would say it's a pretty broad issue across the basin that we're seeing. I think maybe some of your smaller operators are suffering with it a little more than maybe your larger operators that have a broader supply chain team. But I think it's something that everybody is struggling with a little bit at the moment. When you look at the last few years, and all the bankruptcies that happened in the sand market, there's definitely a short supply. There's also a short supply of their truckers to get that sand where it needs to go. And so it's an overall basin-wide problem, but I think everybody is moving in the right direction to solve that issue.\nHamed Khorsand: And would this hamper the value you represent from drilling costs since sand is going to take the overall cost up?\nTyler Glover: Yes. I mean there's definitely some issues there, but I think most operators have baked that into their guidance for the year.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Chris Baker with Credit Suisse.\nChristopher Baker: I guess just maybe on the volume side. So it looks like 1Q oil declined 13% versus 4Q, and you mentioned the accrual. But I'm just curious on a run rate basis, if you back out the accrual, did the asset generate growth quarter-over-quarter?\nChris Steddum: Chris, that I'm sure as you and lots of folks know, we're always a little bit in the past when it comes to royalty, revenues and production that we're seeing. And so I think what we probably have seen with the data that we have is -- obviously, oil production was growing through the broad part of 2021. Fourth quarter, it may have started to see a level out. And this quarter, I think it's a bit early to say. The checks that have come in are really only from the first kind of 1 month, 1.5 months.  But I would say that, that decline that you see in the financials is probably not representative of the background real month date production. I don't believe that, that pullback was nearly as much as 13%. I don't have a good number, unfortunately, to give you, and it will probably take us a few more months for some of the additional checks to come in. I have a really good feel on what that trend was. But it would be our belief that it was certainly not a 13% decline.\nChristopher Baker: Yes. No, that makes sense. And then, I guess, just on the $20 special, obviously, a positive surprise there. Could you just maybe share some of your thinking around how you got to $20 as sort of the right number? I'm just curious if you kind of think about this relative to the cash balance or maybe looking to return some percentage of cash. Obviously, peers have pretty explicit targets there. But just how do you kind of frame that up as we perhaps look out to 2023, and think about what another special next year could look like?\nChris Steddum: Yes. Sure, Chris. I think there's a lot of factors. I don't know that there's any one particular factor being in a business with high commodity price volatility, which can lead to volatility of revenues. I think our belief is having flexibility with your capital allocation plan is a good way to manage a business like this. And so I think when we thought about returning that excess capital when we started the year, oil was in a very different place. And I think when we started the year, we definitely felt like we had a nice robust cash balance that will allow us to remain opportunistic, and achieve some of the goals for the year. But then as the year progressed, we saw a pretty tremendous improvement in pricing across the board, really oil, gas and NGLs.  And so as we kind of get a bit of a reset and looked at the type of cash flow generation that was going to create, it just seemed like the right time really for 2 reasons, like Ty said, for one, in this higher price environment, I think our desire to transact on acquisitions, especially cash acquisitions has diminished. And so that being the case and also having in a pretty nice buyback program, I think the logical path was to do a special. And so I don't know if I can give you an exact mathematical formula as to how to calculate what a future special might be, but I think that those are some of the ways we would look at it, and work with the Board to kind of determine what might be an appropriate return of capital when the business is really generating strong cash flows.\nChristopher Baker: Okay. Great. Yes, that makes sense. And then you touched on M&A earlier, but there was obviously a little bit of royalty acquisitions this quarter. Any additional detail you can share on what you bought and why that kind of made sense just in terms of the acquisition sort of punchless, if you will? Whether that's cash flow accretion or enhancing NRIs and DSUs you already own? Or any color there in terms of the acquisitions this quarter would be great?\nTyler Glover: Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris. That was a really small deal. It was all Midland Basin, heavy DUCs, really good operators, really good area, mostly up in Martin, Howard, Glasscock Counties. So we just felt like the quality was too good to pass. And it was small enough that we were able to pick it up. And honestly, I wish it was a little bigger. But yes, quality was just too good to pass off.\nChristopher Baker: Okay. Great. And if I could just squeeze one more in. Just on the Aris enhanced alliance there. Is the expectation that, that would help put upward pressure on water capture rates? Or I guess any -- and I apologize if I missed this earlier, but any additional sort of, I guess, color on how that's going to show up eventually in the financials?\nTyler Glover: Yes. Like I said earlier, we've had a relationship there for a long time. They've been really a good partner. So this transaction just expands that existing relationship, and kind of capitalizes on the synergies that we have as partners to provide better and more efficient services for our operators. So I think longer term, the deal helps both Aris and TPL compete for volumes and provide better solutions for operators. So obviously, that's going to provide incremental volumes and cash flows for us. It also helps us drive some efficiencies on the source water side of the business as well. And maybe most importantly, just ensures that our operators have both the source water and the produced water takeaway they need to keep running the drill bit.\nOperator: Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thanks, Shawn. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Yesterday, we announced a special dividend of $20 per share, and this special dividend is incremental to the $100 million share repurchase plan that we announced in March. We're excited that our shareholders will benefit from this increased return of capital driven by strong Permian activity, commodity prices that are some of the best we've seen in a decade, and a balance sheet that is debt free. Looking forward to the rest of 2022, we're bullish that our underlying business fundamentals will remain constructive. We're seeing more rigs added on to our surface and looking at our water sales schedule we can see that producers are intent on maintaining and growing completions pacing throughout the year.  In our surface leases, easements, and materials business, which we refer to as SLEM, we are seeing a noticeable uptick in request for new infrastructure and well pad, especially in the Northern Delaware. All of these signs are a good leading indicator for future development activity. As we look at our well inventory, we have yet more reasons to be encouraged. Permitting activity and drilling activity have moved higher.  For the first quarter of 2022, our data indicates that we had 200 gross spuds on our royalty acreage, which is the highest level since the pandemic.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Shawn Amini, Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nShawn Amini: Thank you for joining us today for Texas Pacific Land Corporation's fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Yesterday afternoon, the company released its financial results and filed its Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is available on the Investors section of the company's website at www.texaspacific.com. As a reminder, remarks made on today's conference call may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. We do not undertake any obligation to update our forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. For a more detailed discussion of the factors that may affect the company's results, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings. During this call, we will also be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. More information and reconciliations about these non-GAAP financial measures are contained in our earnings release and SEC filings. Please also note, we may at times refer to our company by its stock ticker, TPL. This morning's conference call is hosted by TPL's Chief Executive Officer, Ty Glover, and Chief Financial Officer, Chris Steddum. Management will make some prepared comments, after which we'll open the call for questions. Now, I'll turn the call over to Ty.\nTy Glover: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. TPL ended 2023 with the best quarter we had all year. Performance was led by oil and gas royalty production of approximately 26,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which represents 20% sequential quarter-over-quarter growth and a new company record. We also received excellent contributions from our surface and water related businesses, as they accounted for over 40% of quarterly consolidated revenues. For produced water, we generated a royalty fee on 2.7 million barrels per day during the quarter, also a record. On sourced water, we recorded 517,000 barrels per day of sales volumes, of which 62% were off of our footprint, as demand for both brackish and treated water remain elevated. Our surface leases, easements and materials segment, which we refer to by its acronym SLEM, generated $19 million of revenues, representing 5% growth sequential quarter-over-quarter. Performance for full year 2023 highlights the virtues of TPL's unique business model, especially during periods of volatile commodity prices. Despite oil prices falling by 18% year-over-year and natural gas prices declining by 64%, our water and SLEM businesses collectively grew revenues by 30%. For fiscal year 2023, our sourced water revenues grew by 32% year-over-year, produced water royalties grew by 17% and SLEM grew by 48%. This strong performance from our water and surface endeavors helped to substantially offset the negative impact from lower commodity prices. Overall, TPL's business continues to operate efficiently, with fiscal year 2023 adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow margins of 86% and 66%, respectively. As we look ahead to 2024, TPL is well positioned to benefit from ongoing activity in the Permian Basin. Our land and water teams remain busy, and thus far, customers have indicated intentions to maintain strong levels of development on our royalty and surface acreage. Supermajor operators, in particular, continue to execute on robust, growth-oriented development pacing. This is especially relevant for TPL as these large operators account for majority of the development on TPL's royalty acreage. With respect to recent commodity price volatility, it's important to remember that TPL's royalty and surface acreage overlaps with some of the most highly economic shale within both the Delaware and Midland Basin and North America more broadly. Should we see prolonged period of weak commodity prices, we would expect operators to maintain healthy development levels across their core Permian leaseholds while triaging other parts of their non-Permian portfolio. Should oil prices remain supportive at current levels or higher, then we'd expect activity levels to support higher production. We're optimistic and encouraged by what we see so far, and we're looking forward to maximizing our opportunities for this year. Chris will have more to share later on our outlook for the Permian and for TPL's business into 2024. I would also like to spend some time this morning reiterating and elaborating on TPL's capital allocation priorities. First, our North Star is maximizing shareholder value. That's always been the goal and that dictates everything we do here. On that point, we believe the key to maximize TPL shareholder value is to maximize free cash flow per share. Cash is finite. Over the long term, what a company can pay in dividends, repurchase in shares and invest in itself are fundamentally limited to the cash it generates. Thus, if we can expand free cash flow on a per share basis and not just near term but also long term productive capacity for future free cash flow per share, then we'll be able to sustainably and consistently increase our capacity to return greater amounts of capital back to shareholders. The more cash we can ultimately return to shareholders, the more valuable the enterprise. If maximizing free cash flow per share is the goal, the question then becomes, how do we achieve it? Our primary options are to invest in organic opportunities, buyback our stock, acquire external assets or pay dividends or some combination thereof. Each one of those options contains an economic and strategic reality. Our job is to determine the long-term returns for each option and then allocate capital accordingly. If we can do that well, we create shareholder value. In practice, there are no simple answers, but we try and solve these items with a fundamental bottoms-up intrinsic value approach. So, let's quickly go through our capital allocation options, deconstruct how we evaluate returns and where those returns and priorities stand today. Starting with organic investment. Here, we look at what opportunities are available to leverage the company's existing assets, people and expertise to expand its business. Potential organic investments are predicated on generating double-digit returns on capital, while also balancing our preference for high-margins and a capital-light business model. Our investment into the water business serves as a great case study. For most of TPL's long history going as far back as 19th century, there was basically zero organic investment. In 2017, that changed as we began to take advantage of TPL's unique ownership of both royalty and surface acreage. Without diving too deeply into the commercial and competitive dynamics that drove why we structured the individual pieces to make up the water business, namely an operated source water business and a contracted throughput royalty for produced water, the key takeaway is that each business was deliberately and carefully commercialized to provide the optimal balance between generating high returns on investment, moderating capital requirements, enhancing the overall business profile, and ultimately, maximizing long-term free cash flow per share. Since 2017, we have cumulatively invested approximately $140 million of capital into the water business. The water business in return has generated about $470 million of cumulative after-tax cash flow. And that does not include any of the significant benefits we derive both from sourcing water for our operator completion activities or from facilitating essential produced water solutions for oil and gas wells on TPL royalty acreage. For fiscal year 2023, our water services and operations segment closed with a net PP&E balance of about $84 million, from which we generated $99 million of net income during the year, resulting in excellent returns on capital. As it stands today, we've developed the largest sourced water network in the broader Northern Delaware Basin. We invest approximately $5 million to $10 million annually towards various growth and cost savings initiatives, with each project individually assessed to determine economics as we continue to explore various opportunities and ideas to enhance our business. Overall, the growth of the water business has provided us with substantial free cash flow growth to the overall enterprise. With that growth in free cash flow over the years, TPL has been able to pay out increasingly larger dividends and execute on larger buybacks, all the while maintaining high cash flow margins, low capital intensity and a net cash balance sheet. Beyond water, we're also searching for new opportunities to leverage our surface ownership. Many fan lines we've discussed in the past are a good example. Consistent with our current makeup, the overwhelming preference is to commercialize new projects in a capital-light high-cash flow margin manner. To the extent there's a project that can provide both exceptional returns and is strategically critical within the context of the overall enterprise, then we have the wherewithal to strategically deploy capital just like we did for the water business. Next, let's discuss share repurchases. When you buy back company shares, you're basically still buying assets. It's just that these assets are already owned by the company. The question is, what is the return generated by buying back your own shares? We look at share buybacks in a similar manner as we look at purchasing external assets. If buying back TPL stock, we're buying a claim on over 20,000 net royalty acres on an [indiscernible] basis and nearly 1 million surface acres. Those assets will generate a cash flow stream. What we do is go piece by piece and evaluate the full cash flow potential over the life of each asset. After aggregating the various components of the business, we can measure that value against the price to acquire. That price for a buyback is our publicly traded share price. There's just as much art and science to this, given all the various inputs, and we do our best to generate reasonable assumptions. We run various scenarios, sensitizing important factors, commodity prices, of course, being a major item. We have reservoir engineers on staff to assess resource potential track-by-track for our royalty acreage. We run a bottoms-up lifecycle analysis across our water and [spud] (ph) businesses. We also own a forever land asset that we are actively working to monetize and that is basically an option value for future revenue potential. So, we account for that. After aggregating everything, we have an internal appraisal of our intrinsic value. We can then measure that against the stock market's appraisal of those exact same assets. If we can generate a double-digit IRR at a mid-cycle oil price of approximately $75 oil and $3 gas, then buybacks become an extremely attractive option to deploy significant capital. We still have over $200 million remaining on our current buyback authorization, but we have the tools in place to quickly execute a robust share repurchase program. Beyond just these opportunistic parameters, we do anticipate maintaining some level of buybacks throughout the year. There are still benefits to buying more of the assets we know so well and to just being in the market supporting stock. We have a long history of repurchasing shares. We recognize that has been an important element of the TPL story through the years and that's something we want to reinforce. On that point, we received feedback from some investors on why TPL doesn't just stick to what it did in the past and just use all of its cash to buy back shares. After all, that strategy was a core factor in driving some phenomenal returns through the decades. It's a fair point and it's worth diving into the buyback strategy of TPL of yesteryear versus the buyback strategy today. For most of its existence, when TPL was effectively just a liquidating trust, the strategy back then was to take the modest cash it generated from some vertical oil and gas wells, raising leases and asset sales and to use those proceeds to repurchase shares. With the benefit of hindsight, those buybacks worked incredibly well because few knew or understood that one day modern horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing would unlock the ocean of oil that was locked in the shale lying underneath the trust's royalty acreage. Thus, you were buying back assets that would later become some of the best shale assets at a valuation that only reflected some minor ancillary operations. It was quite a deal. Today, the extent and quality of the shale resource on TPL land is widely recognized. So much so that our stock trades at a meaningful premium to peers. That's also become evident recently with nearly $100 billion of Permian lease operator acquisitions occurring just in the last few months. Although, we resolutely believe TPL has a unique irrevocable set of assets and an outstanding team that justifies a premium, buying back our stock today isn't the same steal that it was decades ago, not to say that it isn't a good deal today. Buyback economics from decades past aside, we will not hesitate to aggressively ramp buybacks when the opportunity arises. Furthermore, if returns across organic CapEx, M&A, dividends or buyback were all equivalent, our preference would be to lean into buybacks. Our bias is buybacks. Turning to external acquisitions. Over the last few years, we've been candid in our interest in evaluating potential opportunities. We have a huge service and royalty footprint. We have a talented team of industry professionals. We have capabilities to monetize land like few others can, and we have the technology and systems to efficiently scale. It's for all of those reasons why we believe we're in a prime position to consolidate high-quality Permian surface and royalty assets. We approach M&A similar to buybacks. We evaluate each asset from a bottoms-up intrinsic value approach. The same assumptions we use to value our own assets, whether it's commodity prices, track-by-track resource potential or surface and water opportunities, we use to analyze third-party assets. Again, the goal here is to generate at least double-digit IRRs in invested capital and incremental free cash flow per share. For any package that's of meaningful interest to us, in addition to extensive financial analysis, we also perform significant asset and operational due diligence. Because TPL already owns great assets, we have no interest in diluting down our asset quality, our growth prospects or our unique business model. For any deal, the economics have to work, it has to make us a better enterprise and it has to enhance shareholder value. It's a very high bar and we'll keep it high. And finally, if the company only has modest opportunities to deploy capital towards organic or external growth and if buybacks are relatively less attractive, then dividends are another effective way to return capital back to shareholders. A good example was back in May of 2022, WTI crude was over $100, nat gas over $7, both basically at highs over the last decade. Valuations then for external assets were based on essentially peak commodity prices and peak multiples. Buybacks during this time were also relatively less attractive given this above-cycle commodity price. We had modest capital needs for our organic endeavors. Without great options to use the capital ourselves, we paid a $20 per share special dividend and gave back cash back to shareholders. If we find ourselves in a similar situation in the future, then large special dividends are readily available. Our capital allocation strategy will adapt as industry and market fundamentals evolve. Our cash balance at year-end has grown to $725 million, as we've harvested cash flows over the last couple of years during this period of relatively high commodity prices and as we've held back on large procyclical spending. Today, commodity prices are lower and we have an opportunity to deploy substantial capital countercyclically as weaker competitors pull back as valuations fall and as opportunities grow, or if commodity prices rise, our business will benefit tremendously. We're very much in a position of strength and the company will excel in most any environment. With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Steddum: Thanks, Ty. Consolidated revenues during the fourth quarter of 2023 were approximately $167 million, representing 6% sequential quarter-over-quarter growth. Adjusted EBITDA was $151 million, and free cash flow was $116 million. Free cash flow for the quarter grew 15% on a year-over-year basis, driven by higher royalty production, sourced water sales, produced water royalties and SLEM revenues, and partially offset by lower oil, natural gas and NGL prices. Since Ty has already reviewed some of our other highlights for the quarter and full year 2023, I'll spend some time now on how we're thinking about things for 2024. As it relates to development in the overall Permian, our general view is that if oil prices stay around or above $75 per barrel, that is generally constructive for continued growth. If oil prices weakened to $70 or less for an extended period of time, we would expect overall Permian activity levels to slow and overall production volume to flatten. Specific to TPL, our business overall tends to be dominated by supermajors and large independents, which tend to maintain development plans even during times of sideways commodity prices. Over 50% of our current drilled but uncompleted wells, otherwise known as DUCs, are held by supermajor Chevron, Exxon, Conoco, BP and Occidental. 80% of our current DUCs are held by operators with an enterprise value of at least $15 billion. Although rig counts have fallen in the overall Permian compared to a year ago, we have seen rig counts on our acreage remains stable. New spud activity on a net basis in the fourth quarter was a company record and our overall near-term well inventory remains robust. We are seeing persistent strong activity in Loving in Northern Culberson and in the Central Midland subregion. In addition, continued operator efficiencies have condensed permit to production pacing even despite wells with increasingly longer lateral lengths. Our water team today is just as busy as last year and indications that they've received from operators is that development activity will remain at high levels. Our land agents also remain active as demand for pipeline easements, surface leases, wellbore easements, and caliche is strong. As we previously indicated, we believe that TPL royalty production can grow at a level that exceeds overall Permian growth, although like we've experienced over the past year or so, short-term quarter-to-quarter performance, can be somewhat volatile due to greater co-completion developments, operator short-term development patterns, specific net revenue interest for various tracks and check spud timing. To conclude, TPL is in a great spot today. Our balance sheet arguably has never been stronger. The business still maintains strong cash flow and profitability margins. TPL still remains unhedged on commodity prices, so we capture the full upside as commodity prices improve. And if commodity prices weaken, then we have ample means and multiple ways to take advantage. And with that, operator, we will now take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Hamed Khorsand with BWS Financial. Please go ahead.\nHamed Khorsand: Hey, good morning. So first off, could you just talk a little bit more about the water business and what you're doing there as far as the cost structure goes? I noticed that if I combine both water line items on the sales side and then look at your cost basis, the cost has more than outpaced the sales growth. So, if you could just comment there on what your expectations are?\nChris Steddum: Yeah. Hi, Hamed. This is Chris. I think as Ty had said in his prepared remarks, at the end of the day, what we are trying to do is grow our free cash flow. And last year was a bit unique. There was a few times where depending on where that water was moving and some of the contracts, it was a little bit more expensive. As we continue to reach out further into the basin, some of the expenses to get water to the further reaches of the Permian have increased. On the flip side, we continue to electrify a lot of the operations, which helps regulate and even bring down some of the costs through the ability to automate systems, have less personnel required to run them. But at the end of the day, the cost to deliver some of that water as we expand has come down. But I think the good news is that still leads to increased cash flow for the business.\nHamed Khorsand: Okay. And then, my other question was, as far as the oil side of the business goes, oil and gas, was there any supply chain issues that you can see that could hamper production, or are you just seeing that production can stay steady with weather as electricity is permitting?\nTy Glover: I think most of the supply chain issues that we've seen over the last few years have been worked out. Obviously, there's still a lot of infrastructure buildout that needs to be done in the Permian. But talking to our operators and midstream operators as well, I think infrastructure planning is going well and companies seem to be making the right moves to prevent those bottlenecks in the future. So, I think most of those issues overall have been worked out.\nHamed Khorsand: And then last question is on your easement side. Is there anything of a one-time nature there this past quarter that won't repeat in Q1 or in 2024?\nTy Glover: I mean, for the most part, big part of that is pipeline easements, material sales have increased as well, but those should be ongoing. Like I said, talking to our midstream operators, there's still a lot of infrastructure buildout that they have planned for 2024. Material sales continue to be strong. We're growing our sand royalties as well. So, I would anticipate that staying strong through 2024 and really over the next few years.\nHamed Khorsand: Great. Thank you.\nTy Glover: Thanks, Hamed.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Nate Pendleton with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nNate Pendleton: Good morning, and congrats on the strong quarter. Starting with production. Coming off a strong Q4 and understanding that historically production has been lumpy, how should we think about the production trajectory heading into Q1 versus full year?\nChris Steddum: Yeah, hey. I think what you said is right. We still expect that production is going to kind of remain lumpy through time. Just the nature of how the wells get completed, the big co-completions, the way that operators are moving around and which pads they select can have a lot of impact quarter-to-quarter as to what our production looks like. But again, I think we would just reaffirm a couple of things that Ty had mentioned in the prepared remarks. One would be, we still think overall, over the long term, we've got a good chance to outperform the overall Permian in terms of production. And when we look at 2024 and we look at kind of our current backlog of net wells, it looks really strong. We've seen a big build of DUCs occurring. And so, all of those things would lead us to believe that, at least over the course of the year, there's going to be plenty of inventory to continue to deliver strong production results. But as to whether that happens each quarter like clockwork is always a more difficult thing to predict. And so, I think there is going to be some lumpiness when exactly that occurs. It's hard to know. But the overall trend we still feel really good about. And I think like we said, if we have a supportive commodity price environment this year, we would expect a continued strong production performance.\nNate Pendleton: Got it. Thanks. And then, staying on the activity trends with your net well inventory that you mentioned, with that around 17 net wells in various stages of development entering 2024, can you provide a rule of thumb for the number of net wells that would need to be turned in line to hold production flat, all else equal?\nChris Steddum: Yeah. I think in the past, we probably said that, that number was something like eight net wells. But obviously, as your production base grows, that number is going to trend up. So, I think we would tell you now but something in the neighborhood of probably nine net wells is going to roughly be your hold flat number that you need. But as you stated, with 17 right now in the backlog, that certainly feels pretty good to us as far as having plenty of inventory available to again support strong production.\nNate Pendleton: Got it. Thanks for that. And then, shifting over to the water business. Looking back at some of your acquisitions over the past year, can you provide any color on how you see the A&D market for additional SWD infrastructure? And what opportunities there are to further expand your leading position there?\nTy Glover: Yeah. Most of our focus on the produced water side has been acquiring additional pore space. So, you saw a couple of surface acquisitions of pore space easement that we did last year. And so, we just want to make sure that we stay out in front of our operators' needs and have the appropriate amount of pore space available to meet those needs. So, that's kind of how we view our part in that business is just continuing with the same business model, being a pore space owner and using our network and relationships to put people together to make sure that water has a place to go and just support the overall development of the basin.\nNate Pendleton: Got it. Thanks. And then, you mentioned pore space. So, staying on that for just a second and taking the CCS angle, now that the U.S. EPA has started approving Class VI permits, and there are some operators injecting CO2 for storage today in Class II wells that qualify for the same credits, can you provide any updates on how you are viewing that opportunity given your expansive ownership?\nTy Glover: Yeah. I mean we've talked a little bit about it in the past. We think it's a great opportunity for us as well. We view it similar in business model to the produced water, where we'll continue to be a pore space owner. No real interest in building out any infrastructure in that space, but leasing on our pore space for royalty, I think it's a great opportunity for the company. And so, I think any time we can add pore space, whether it be for produced water or carbon sequestration, it just continues to add more runway to our business long term.\nNate Pendleton: Got it. And the last one for me, is there any update you can provide regarding the status of the appeal related to the stockholders' agreement litigation?\nTy Glover: Not too much other than oral arguments were yesterday. So, at this point, we're just waiting on a decision from the court.\nNate Pendleton: Got it. Appreciate you taking my questions.\nTy Glover: Thank you.\nChris Steddum: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, as there are no further questions, that concludes the conference of Texas Pacific Land Corporation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

We have reservoir engineers on staff to assess resource potential track-by-track for our royalty acreage. We run a bottoms-up lifecycle analysis across our water and [spud] (ph) businesses. We also own a forever land asset that we are actively working to monetize and that is basically an option value for future revenue potential. So, we account for that. After aggregating everything, we have an internal appraisal of our intrinsic value. We can then measure that against the stock market's appraisal of those exact same assets. If we can generate a double-digit IRR at a mid-cycle oil price of approximately $75 oil and $3 gas, then buybacks become an extremely attractive option to deploy significant capital. We still have over $200 million remaining on our current buyback authorization, but we have the tools in place to quickly execute a robust share repurchase program. Beyond just these opportunistic parameters, we do anticipate maintaining some level of buybacks throughout the year. There are still benefits to buying more of the assets we know so well and to just being in the market supporting stock. We have a long history of repurchasing shares. We recognize that has been an important element of the TPL story through the years and that's something we want to reinforce. On that point, we received feedback from some investors on why TPL doesn't just stick to what it did in the past and just use all of its cash to buy back shares. After all, that strategy was a core factor in driving some phenomenal returns through the decades. It's a fair point and it's worth diving into the buyback strategy of TPL of yesteryear versus the buyback strategy today. For most of its existence, when TPL was effectively just a liquidating trust, the strategy back then was to take the modest cash it generated from some vertical oil and gas wells, raising leases and asset sales and to use those proceeds to repurchase shares. With the benefit of hindsight, those buybacks worked incredibly well because few knew or understood that one day modern horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing would unlock the ocean of oil that was locked in the shale lying underneath the trust's royalty acreage. Thus, you were buying back assets that would later become some of the best shale assets at a valuation that only reflected some minor ancillary operations. It was quite a deal. Today, the extent and quality of the shale resource on TPL land is widely recognized. So much so that our stock trades at a meaningful premium to peers. That's also become evident recently with nearly $100 billion of Permian lease operator acquisitions occurring just in the last few months. Although, we resolutely believe TPL has a unique irrevocable set of assets and an outstanding team that justifies a premium, buying back our stock today isn't the same steal that it was decades ago, not to say that it isn't a good deal today. Buyback economics from decades past aside, we will not hesitate to aggressively ramp buybacks when the opportunity arises. Furthermore, if returns across organic CapEx, M&A, dividends or buyback were all equivalent, our preference would be to lean into buybacks. Our bias is buybacks. Turning to external acquisitions. Over the last few years, we've been candid in our interest in evaluating potential opportunities. We have a huge service and royalty footprint. We have a talented team of industry professionals. We have capabilities to monetize land like few others can, and we have the technology and systems to efficiently scale. It's for all of those reasons why we believe we're in a prime position to consolidate high-quality Permian surface and royalty assets. We approach M&A similar to buybacks. We evaluate each asset from a bottoms-up intrinsic value approach. The same assumptions we use to value our own assets, whether it's commodity prices, track-by-track resource potential or surface and water opportunities, we use to analyze third-party assets. Again, the goal here is to generate at least double-digit IRRs in invested capital and incremental free cash flow per share. For any package that's of meaningful interest to us, in addition to extensive financial analysis, we also perform significant asset and operational due diligence. Because TPL already owns great assets, we have no interest in diluting down our asset quality, our growth prospects or our unique business model. For any deal, the economics have to work, it has to make us a better enterprise and it has to enhance shareholder value. It's a very high bar and we'll keep it high. And finally, if the company only has modest opportunities to deploy capital towards organic or external growth and if buybacks are relatively less attractive, then dividends are another effective way to return capital back to shareholders. A good example was back in May of 2022, WTI crude was over $100, nat gas over $7, both basically at highs over the last decade. Valuations then for external assets were based on essentially peak commodity prices and peak multiples. Buybacks during this time were also relatively less attractive given this above-cycle commodity price. We had modest capital needs for our organic endeavors. Without great options to use the capital ourselves, we paid a $20 per share special dividend and gave back cash back to shareholders. If we find ourselves in a similar situation in the future, then large special dividends are readily available. Our capital allocation strategy will adapt as industry and market fundamentals evolve. Our cash balance at year-end has grown to $725 million, as we've harvested cash flows over the last couple of years during this period of relatively high commodity prices and as we've held back on large procyclical spending. Today, commodity prices are lower and we have an opportunity to deploy substantial capital countercyclically as weaker competitors pull back as valuations fall and as opportunities grow, or if commodity prices rise, our business will benefit tremendously. We're very much in a position of strength and the company will excel in most any environment. With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris. I think most of the supply chain issues that we've seen over the last few years have been worked out. Obviously, there's still a lot of infrastructure buildout that needs to be done in the Permian. But talking to our operators and midstream operators as well, I think infrastructure planning is going well and companies seem to be making the right moves to prevent those bottlenecks in the future. So, I think most of those issues overall have been worked out. I mean, for the most part, big part of that is pipeline easements, material sales have increased as well, but those should be ongoing. Like I said, talking to our midstream operators, there's still a lot of infrastructure buildout that they have planned for 2024. Material sales continue to be strong. We're growing our sand royalties as well. So, I would anticipate that staying strong through 2024 and really over the next few years. Thanks, Hamed. Yeah. Most of our focus on the produced water side has been acquiring additional pore space. So, you saw a couple of surface acquisitions of pore space easement that we did last year. And so, we just want to make sure that we stay out in front of our operators' needs and have the appropriate amount of pore space available to meet those needs. So, that's kind of how we view our part in that business is just continuing with the same business model, being a pore space owner and using our network and relationships to put people together to make sure that water has a place to go and just support the overall development of the basin. Yeah. I mean we've talked a little bit about it in the past. We think it's a great opportunity for us as well. We view it similar in business model to the produced water, where we'll continue to be a pore space owner. No real interest in building out any infrastructure in that space, but leasing on our pore space for royalty, I think it's a great opportunity for the company. And so, I think any time we can add pore space, whether it be for produced water or carbon sequestration, it just continues to add more runway to our business long term. Not too much other than oral arguments were yesterday. So, at this point, we're just waiting on a decision from the court. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Ty. Consolidated revenues during the fourth quarter of 2023 were approximately $167 million, representing 6% sequential quarter-over-quarter growth. Adjusted EBITDA was $151 million, and free cash flow was $116 million. Free cash flow for the quarter grew 15% on a year-over-year basis, driven by higher royalty production, sourced water sales, produced water royalties and SLEM revenues, and partially offset by lower oil, natural gas and NGL prices. Since Ty has already reviewed some of our other highlights for the quarter and full year 2023, I'll spend some time now on how we're thinking about things for 2024. As it relates to development in the overall Permian, our general view is that if oil prices stay around or above $75 per barrel, that is generally constructive for continued growth. If oil prices weakened to $70 or less for an extended period of time, we would expect overall Permian activity levels to slow and overall production volume to flatten. Specific to TPL, our business overall tends to be dominated by supermajors and large independents, which tend to maintain development plans even during times of sideways commodity prices. Over 50% of our current drilled but uncompleted wells, otherwise known as DUCs, are held by supermajor Chevron, Exxon, Conoco, BP and Occidental. 80% of our current DUCs are held by operators with an enterprise value of at least $15 billion. Although rig counts have fallen in the overall Permian compared to a year ago, we have seen rig counts on our acreage remains stable. New spud activity on a net basis in the fourth quarter was a company record and our overall near-term well inventory remains robust. We are seeing persistent strong activity in Loving in Northern Culberson and in the Central Midland subregion. In addition, continued operator efficiencies have condensed permit to production pacing even despite wells with increasingly longer lateral lengths. Our water team today is just as busy as last year and indications that they've received from operators is that development activity will remain at high levels. Our land agents also remain active as demand for pipeline easements, surface leases, wellbore easements, and caliche is strong. As we previously indicated, we believe that TPL royalty production can grow at a level that exceeds overall Permian growth, although like we've experienced over the past year or so, short-term quarter-to-quarter performance, can be somewhat volatile due to greater co-completion developments, operator short-term development patterns, specific net revenue interest for various tracks and check spud timing. To conclude, TPL is in a great spot today. Our balance sheet arguably has never been stronger. The business still maintains strong cash flow and profitability margins. TPL still remains unhedged on commodity prices, so we capture the full upside as commodity prices improve. And if commodity prices weaken, then we have ample means and multiple ways to take advantage. And with that, operator, we will now take questions. Yeah. Hi, Hamed. This is Chris. I think as Ty had said in his prepared remarks, at the end of the day, what we are trying to do is grow our free cash flow. And last year was a bit unique. There was a few times where depending on where that water was moving and some of the contracts, it was a little bit more expensive. As we continue to reach out further into the basin, some of the expenses to get water to the further reaches of the Permian have increased. On the flip side, we continue to electrify a lot of the operations, which helps regulate and even bring down some of the costs through the ability to automate systems, have less personnel required to run them. But at the end of the day, the cost to deliver some of that water as we expand has come down. But I think the good news is that still leads to increased cash flow for the business. Yeah, hey. I think what you said is right. We still expect that production is going to kind of remain lumpy through time. Just the nature of how the wells get completed, the big co-completions, the way that operators are moving around and which pads they select can have a lot of impact quarter-to-quarter as to what our production looks like. But again, I think we would just reaffirm a couple of things that Ty had mentioned in the prepared remarks. One would be, we still think overall, over the long term, we've got a good chance to outperform the overall Permian in terms of production. And when we look at 2024 and we look at kind of our current backlog of net wells, it looks really strong. We've seen a big build of DUCs occurring. And so, all of those things would lead us to believe that, at least over the course of the year, there's going to be plenty of inventory to continue to deliver strong production results. But as to whether that happens each quarter like clockwork is always a more difficult thing to predict. And so, I think there is going to be some lumpiness when exactly that occurs. It's hard to know. But the overall trend we still feel really good about. And I think like we said, if we have a supportive commodity price environment this year, we would expect a continued strong production performance. Yeah. I think in the past, we probably said that, that number was something like eight net wells. But obviously, as your production base grows, that number is going to trend up. So, I think we would tell you now but something in the neighborhood of probably nine net wells is going to roughly be your hold flat number that you need. But as you stated, with 17 right now in the backlog, that certainly feels pretty good to us as far as having plenty of inventory available to again support strong production. Thanks."

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Shawn Amini, Finance and Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Amini, you may begin.\nShawn Amini: Thank you for joining us today for Texas Pacific Land Corporation\u2019s Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Yesterday afternoon, the company released its financial results and filed its Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is available on the Investors section of the company\u2019s website at www.texaspacific.com. As a reminder, remarks made on today\u2019s conference call may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. We do not undertake any obligation to update our forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.

Please also note, we may at times refer to our company by its stock ticker, TPL. This morning\u2019s conference call is hosted by TPL\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Ty Glover; and Chief Financial Officer, Chris Steddum. Management will make some prepared comments, after which we will open the call for questions. Now, I will turn the call over to Ty.\nTy Glover: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. TPL delivered another strong quarter, driven by improving commodity prices and continued performance of our surface and water assets. Starting with oil and gas royalties, revenues increased 6% sequential quarter-over-quarter as lower royalty production was more than offset by higher oil, natural gas and NGL prices. This past quarter, we\u2019ve heard from operators that development activities were negatively impacted by infrastructure downtime and electricity challenges during the summer heat waves. With those issues having subsided and with some additional natural gas takeaway capacity coming online, we think infrastructure and logistics will be less of a constraint for development in the near term. For our surface leases, easements and materials segment, which we refer to as SLEM, we continue to benefit from broad strength across our various endeavors there. In particular, pipeline easements have been robust, driven by expanding infrastructure development in the Permian. For source water, year-to-date revenues have already eclipsed what we did in all of 2022. Though down from our record sales volumes off the prior sequential quarter, third quarter 2023 source water sales volumes of approximately 545,000 barrels per day represent high utilization across our system. In particular, demand for treated water remains elevated, with this past quarter representing record revenues and volumes. On the produced water side, volumes have grown steadily and quarterly revenues are up 9% year-over-year. Produced water volumes continue to grow across the Permian, of which TPL continues to capture a significant portion through our large AMI agreements across our surface. To give some additional visibility on TPL\u2019s production outlook, I wanted to take some time this morning to provide recent well development trends on our royalty acreage. Starting with our near-term well inventory, at the end of the third quarter 2023, TPL had 6.7 net permits, 7.9 net drilled but uncompleted wells also referred to as DUCs and 5.2 net completed wells. This near-term inventory totals 19.9 net wells, which represents a 29% increase from second quarter 2023 levels. Although we had relatively lower net new producing wells added in this most recent quarter, the higher balance of completed wells represents a level much higher than what we\u2019ve generally seen historically, which gives some visibility into near-term production trends as those get turned to sales soon. For wells already turned to sales in 2023, the timing of completion to initial production has averaged around 20 days, which is significantly longer than prior year averages of approximately 3 to 5 days. We believe this timing delay is in large part attributable to more operators utilizing co-development strategies as more wells are fracked together within a pad and then those group of wells are collectively not turned to sales until after the last well has been completed. All else being equal, the effect of this is that the production contribution from new wells becomes lumpier in the short term. It\u2019s also worth noting that timing of permit to spud and spud to completion have compressed considerably in 2023 versus prior years. In total, for wells turned to sales in 2023, the average permit to production timing is approximately 10 months, whereas in \u201822, it was approximately 11 months and in 2021, it was approximately 13 months. With respect to rigs, although rig counts in the overall Permian have declined by approximately 10% compared to last year, we\u2019ve recently seen more rigs operating on TPL acreage. Last year at this time, we estimated that there were approximately 42 rigs operating on TPL acreage, whereas today, we estimate we currently have more than 50 rigs. These rig totals align with our well data, with third quarter 2023 new spud activity right around record levels on a gross and net basis. In addition, new permit activity on our acreage is elevated as third quarter 2023 represents a record for new permits both on a gross and net basis. With a strong backlog of completed wells and inventory, high levels of ongoing new permits, accelerated development timing of converting permit to sales and currently supportive oil and natural gas prices, those fundamentals in aggregate underpin what we believe to be constructive backdrop for development on TPL royalty acreage and the Permian more broadly. Of course, commodity prices can change and development schedules can evolve. But as we\u2019ve shown before, TPL is well positioned to succeed through almost any environment. Before concluding my remarks, I also wanted to mention that next week, TPL will be hosting its 2023 Annual Meeting in Dallas. I want to remind and encourage shareholders to review the proxy materials, which you can find on our website and on the SEC website and to submit votes. If anyone needs any assistance, please reach out to Investor Relations. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Steddum: Thanks, Ty. Third quarter 2023 total consolidated revenue and net income were $158 million and $106 million, respectively. Total adjusted EBITDA was $141 million, which is 6% higher compared to the prior sequential quarter, and adjusted EBITDA margin was approximately 89%. During the quarter, the company benefited from higher commodity prices and lower operating expenses, though partially offset by lower royalty production and lower source water sales. Free cash flow was approximately $106 million, and we exited the quarter with approximately $660 million of cash on the balance sheet. Royalty production of approximately 21,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day represented a 12% decrease on a sequential quarter basis. Our realized price per barrel of oil equivalent increased 19% to approximately $45. Benchmark prices for each oil, gas and NGLs, each rose over the prior sequential quarter, and our realizations relative to the benchmark prices also improved. For this quarter, we have maintained our $3.25 per share dividend. We also spent approximately $6 million to repurchase approximately 3,600 shares of our common stock. And with that, operator, we will now take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Derrick Whitfield with Stifel.\nDerrick Whitfield: For my first question, I wanted to focus on your Q3 production and your 6- to 12-month production trajectory. Regarding the quarter, Ty, do you have a sense on the production impact split between elevated temperatures and brownouts versus delayed TILs due to larger pad development? And secondarily, with the record amount of completion on line-of-sight inventory as well as you have exiting the quarter, how should we think about the trajectory as we exit this year and into next?\nTy Glover: Derrick, will you repeat the first part of your question?\nDerrick Whitfield: Sure. Just on the production impact for the quarter, you talked about in your prepared remarks, there were elevated temperatures and brownouts, and then you also talked about some delayed TILs due to larger pad development. So I wanted to get a sense from you if you have a view on the split between those 2 categories.\nTy Glover: I don\u2019t have the exact split, but I think we were probably more heavily impacted by the delay in TILs just because we had a lot of mega pads this last quarter, where we had quite a few wells being drilled from the same pad. And so like I mentioned in my prepared remarks, what happens there is they wait until all of those wells are completed to bring them online. And so that makes the near-term production a little bit lumpier, and that\u2019s what we saw this quarter. We did see some effects of the heat waves with some problems with electricity and some compressor stations going down. And I think you\u2019ll see some midstream operators talk about those issues as well this quarter. For the second part of that question, Chris, do you want to take that?\nChris Steddum: Yes. So Derrick, to your point, I think we have had a little bit of lumpiness in our production over the last couple of quarters. Really strong last quarter, down a little bit this quarter. And I think as we always say, I mean, our view is we want to look toward the long-term trend. Because as Ty has mentioned, I think, especially as you see some of these operators move these large pads, it\u2019s going to introduce a little more volatility in the production quarter-to-quarter. But I think in our view, nothing has really changed and how we think about long-term or let\u2019s say, medium-term production. Everything still looks good. I think we still expect overall to see production growth in the coming year. Again, like we said, that really high amount of permits, the quicker turnaround of permits and DUCs, all of those things continue to be positive indicators. And I think as some of these big pads get brought online and we get through some of those temperature issues and pipeline constraint issues, we\u2019re going to see that production come to market to the benefit of TPL.\nDerrick Whitfield: Terrific. And then maybe shifting over to capital. Could you comment on the surface acreage you sold and the importance of the disposal and groundwater rights purchase?\nTy Glover: Yes. I\u2019ll take that one. The surface that we sold, so that acreage was in Culberson County. So this is way out, like oil and gas fairway, rangeland that -- one big issue that it had was it had a conservation easement on it. So this is acreage that wasn\u2019t part of the original land grant, but that the company has owned for a while. And so because of that conservation easement and because of the remoteness, we just didn\u2019t see any commercial opportunities. And so we had the opportunity to sell it to a local rancher. And so that\u2019s kind of where we were at on that. So moving on to the pore space that we purchased. We feel like pore space is just becoming more and more valuable as we see produced water volumes continue to grow in the basin, and then also looking at other uses of pore space, carbon sequestration, things like that. We just feel like any time that we can add to our pore space inventory at attractive prices, then that\u2019s a really good opportunity and really good use for our capital.\nDerrick Whitfield: That makes sense. And one last, if I could. During Q2, that was really a banner quarter for you guys in the water business based on the amount of off-lease activity you experienced. Could you offer any perspective on how much -- or how off-lease performed this quarter?\nTy Glover: So really, I mean, right there, in line with last quarter, definitely over half of our sales were off of our footprint. We also continue to see increases in our treatment. And so third quarter was no different. I think as far as volumes on the treatment side, it was a record quarter for us. And I would just mention too, that -- I talked about this a little bit in the past, but most of the produced water gathering infrastructure on our land, we have the exclusive right to take water off of that system, treat it and resell it. So through good contract structure, we\u2019re very well positioned to keep providing brackish water and/or ramp up our treatment based on each operator\u2019s needs. And we continue to grow further and further outside of our footprint. The water team has done a really good job of contracting additional sales and expanding our footprint, so...\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Hamed Khorsand with BWS Financial.\nHamed Khorsand: Just a follow-up on this water topic. Given production having declined this past quarter and how your customers or the land leasers are operating, would that imply that water sales could actually ramp up as you see these wells come online, it was just a delay factor?\nTy Glover: So water sales is typically paralleled with completions activity. But I think, like Chris mentioned earlier, when you look at the wells that have been recently spud in this last quarter and our permit count being up so high, I think that is definitely an indicator that there will be a lot of completions activity in the coming quarters, which is really good for water sales, both on the brackish and treatment side as well as the produced water side of the business because once you get that flow back, that water has got to go somewhere. And so to answer your question, the things that we\u2019ve talked about on the call here are good indicators for future water revenue.\nHamed Khorsand: Okay. And then what\u2019s been the big contributor to the easement revenue line this year? And how tangible is it that it will continue to stay with the business?\nTy Glover: So probably the biggest contributors this year, especially over the last couple of quarters have been pipeline easements and material sales. So we\u2019re seeing a lot of infrastructure build out, a lot of gas gathering lines. We\u2019ve had a nice ramp in transmission lines as well as new gas connects and facilities, compressor stations, things like that. And I think that\u2019s going to continue. We\u2019re seeing operators move further away from existing infrastructure into new areas where there are requirements for new roads and gathering infrastructure and facilities. And that was one thing that we saw a little bit of a bottleneck on last quarter, was there were some areas where wells were not turned in line because of a lack of infrastructure. And so the same operators that we talk to that gave us that feedback were the same operators that had a big ramp in easements for say, like gas takeaway. And then on the material sales side, we\u2019ve expanded caliche sales up into New Mexico, which has been a really nice bump for us. We\u2019ve also got 2 of the sand mines that we signed towards the end of the last year that are actually active now, and we\u2019ve seen a nice bump in sand royalties. I think we were just under $1 million for sand royalties this last quarter. So that\u2019s progressing well. We\u2019ve got a couple of other sand leases that should be operational soon. And as we continue to expand our rock crushing activities and things like that, I think we\u2019ll continue to see strong SLEM activity in the future.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

In particular, pipeline easements have been robust, driven by expanding infrastructure development in the Permian. For source water, year-to-date revenues have already eclipsed what we did in all of 2022. Though down from our record sales volumes off the prior sequential quarter, third quarter 2023 source water sales volumes of approximately 545,000 barrels per day represent high utilization across our system. In particular, demand for treated water remains elevated, with this past quarter representing record revenues and volumes. On the produced water side, volumes have grown steadily and quarterly revenues are up 9% year-over-year. Produced water volumes continue to grow across the Permian, of which TPL continues to capture a significant portion through our large AMI agreements across our surface. To give some additional visibility on TPL's production outlook, I wanted to take some time this morning to provide recent well development trends on our royalty acreage. Starting with our near-term well inventory, at the end of the third quarter 2023, TPL had 6.7 net permits, 7.9 net drilled but uncompleted wells also referred to as DUCs and 5.2 net completed wells. This near-term inventory totals 19.9 net wells, which represents a 29% increase from second quarter 2023 levels. Although we had relatively lower net new producing wells added in this most recent quarter, the higher balance of completed wells represents a level much higher than what we've generally seen historically, which gives some visibility into near-term production trends as those get turned to sales soon. For wells already turned to sales in 2023, the timing of completion to initial production has averaged around 20 days, which is significantly longer than prior year averages of approximately 3 to 5 days. We believe this timing delay is in large part attributable to more operators utilizing co-development strategies as more wells are fracked together within a pad and then those group of wells are collectively not turned to sales until after the last well has been completed. All else being equal, the effect of this is that the production contribution from new wells becomes lumpier in the short term. It's also worth noting that timing of permit to spud and spud to completion have compressed considerably in 2023 versus prior years. In total, for wells turned to sales in 2023, the average permit to production timing is approximately 10 months, whereas in \u201822, it was approximately 11 months and in 2021, it was approximately 13 months. With respect to rigs, although rig counts in the overall Permian have declined by approximately 10% compared to last year, we've recently seen more rigs operating on TPL acreage. Last year at this time, we estimated that there were approximately 42 rigs operating on TPL acreage, whereas today, we estimate we currently have more than 50 rigs. These rig totals align with our well data, with third quarter 2023 new spud activity right around record levels on a gross and net basis. In addition, new permit activity on our acreage is elevated as third quarter 2023 represents a record for new permits both on a gross and net basis. With a strong backlog of completed wells and inventory, high levels of ongoing new permits, accelerated development timing of converting permit to sales and currently supportive oil and natural gas prices, those fundamentals in aggregate underpin what we believe to be constructive backdrop for development on TPL royalty acreage and the Permian more broadly. Of course, commodity prices can change and development schedules can evolve. But as we've shown before, TPL is well positioned to succeed through almost any environment. Before concluding my remarks, I also wanted to mention that next week, TPL will be hosting its 2023 Annual Meeting in Dallas. I want to remind and encourage shareholders to review the proxy materials, which you can find on our website and on the SEC website and to submit votes. If anyone needs any assistance, please reach out to Investor Relations. With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris. Derrick, will you repeat the first part of your question? I don't have the exact split, but I think we were probably more heavily impacted by the delay in TILs just because we had a lot of mega pads this last quarter, where we had quite a few wells being drilled from the same pad. And so like I mentioned in my prepared remarks, what happens there is they wait until all of those wells are completed to bring them online. And so that makes the near-term production a little bit lumpier, and that's what we saw this quarter. We did see some effects of the heat waves with some problems with electricity and some compressor stations going down. And I think you'll see some midstream operators talk about those issues as well this quarter. For the second part of that question, Chris, do you want to take that? Yes. I'll take that one. The surface that we sold, so that acreage was in Culberson County. So this is way out, like oil and gas fairway, rangeland that -- one big issue that it had was it had a conservation easement on it. So this is acreage that wasn't part of the original land grant, but that the company has owned for a while. And so because of that conservation easement and because of the remoteness, we just didn't see any commercial opportunities. And so we had the opportunity to sell it to a local rancher. And so that's kind of where we were at on that. So moving on to the pore space that we purchased. We feel like pore space is just becoming more and more valuable as we see produced water volumes continue to grow in the basin, and then also looking at other uses of pore space, carbon sequestration, things like that. We just feel like any time that we can add to our pore space inventory at attractive prices, then that's a really good opportunity and really good use for our capital. So really, I mean, right there, in line with last quarter, definitely over half of our sales were off of our footprint. We also continue to see increases in our treatment. And so third quarter was no different. I think as far as volumes on the treatment side, it was a record quarter for us. And I would just mention too, that -- I talked about this a little bit in the past, but most of the produced water gathering infrastructure on our land, we have the exclusive right to take water off of that system, treat it and resell it. So through good contract structure, we're very well positioned to keep providing brackish water and/or ramp up our treatment based on each operator's needs. And we continue to grow further and further outside of our footprint. The water team has done a really good job of contracting additional sales and expanding our footprint, so... So water sales is typically paralleled with completions activity. But I think, like Chris mentioned earlier, when you look at the wells that have been recently spud in this last quarter and our permit count being up so high, I think that is definitely an indicator that there will be a lot of completions activity in the coming quarters, which is really good for water sales, both on the brackish and treatment side as well as the produced water side of the business because once you get that flow back, that water has got to go somewhere. And so to answer your question, the things that we've talked about on the call here are good indicators for future water revenue. So probably the biggest contributors this year, especially over the last couple of quarters have been pipeline easements and material sales. So we're seeing a lot of infrastructure build out, a lot of gas gathering lines. We've had a nice ramp in transmission lines as well as new gas connects and facilities, compressor stations, things like that. And I think that's going to continue. We're seeing operators move further away from existing infrastructure into new areas where there are requirements for new roads and gathering infrastructure and facilities. And that was one thing that we saw a little bit of a bottleneck on last quarter, was there were some areas where wells were not turned in line because of a lack of infrastructure. And so the same operators that we talk to that gave us that feedback were the same operators that had a big ramp in easements for say, like gas takeaway. And then on the material sales side, we've expanded caliche sales up into New Mexico, which has been a really nice bump for us. We've also got 2 of the sand mines that we signed towards the end of the last year that are actually active now, and we've seen a nice bump in sand royalties. I think we were just under $1 million for sand royalties this last quarter. So that's progressing well. We've got a couple of other sand leases that should be operational soon. And as we continue to expand our rock crushing activities and things like that, I think we'll continue to see strong SLEM activity in the future."

            "content": "Thanks, Ty. Third quarter 2023 total consolidated revenue and net income were $158 million and $106 million, respectively. Total adjusted EBITDA was $141 million, which is 6% higher compared to the prior sequential quarter, and adjusted EBITDA margin was approximately 89%. During the quarter, the company benefited from higher commodity prices and lower operating expenses, though partially offset by lower royalty production and lower source water sales. Free cash flow was approximately $106 million, and we exited the quarter with approximately $660 million of cash on the balance sheet. Royalty production of approximately 21,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day represented a 12% decrease on a sequential quarter basis. Our realized price per barrel of oil equivalent increased 19% to approximately $45. Benchmark prices for each oil, gas and NGLs, each rose over the prior sequential quarter, and our realizations relative to the benchmark prices also improved. For this quarter, we have maintained our $3.25 per share dividend. We also spent approximately $6 million to repurchase approximately 3,600 shares of our common stock. And with that, operator, we will now take questions. Yes. So Derrick, to your point, I think we have had a little bit of lumpiness in our production over the last couple of quarters. Really strong last quarter, down a little bit this quarter. And I think as we always say, I mean, our view is we want to look toward the long-term trend. Because as Ty has mentioned, I think, especially as you see some of these operators move these large pads, it's going to introduce a little more volatility in the production quarter-to-quarter. But I think in our view, nothing has really changed and how we think about long-term or let's say, medium-term production. Everything still looks good. I think we still expect overall to see production growth in the coming year. Again, like we said, that really high amount of permits, the quicker turnaround of permits and DUCs, all of those things continue to be positive indicators. And I think as some of these big pads get brought online and we get through some of those temperature issues and pipeline constraint issues, we're going to see that production come to market to the benefit of TPL."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Shawn Amini, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nShawn Amini: Thank you for joining us today for Texas Pacific Land Corporation Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Yesterday afternoon, the company released its financial results and filed its Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is available on the Investors section of the company's website at www.texaspacific.com. As a reminder, remarks made on today's conference call may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. We do not undertake any obligation to update our forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. For a more detailed discussion of the factors that may affect the company's results, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings. During this call, we will also be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. More information and reconciliations about these non-GAAP financial measures are contained in our earnings release and SEC filings. Please also note that we may at times refer to our company by stock ticker, TPL. This morning's conference call is hosted by TPL's Chief Executive Officer, Ty Glover; and Chief Financial Officer, Chris Steddum. Management will make some prepared comments after which we will open the call for questions. Now I will turn the call over to Ty.\nTy Glover: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. TPL delivered an impressive quarter, capturing opportunities underpinned by robust Permian activity. We set new company records for quarterly oil and gas royalty production, source water revenues and produced water revenues. Easements and surface-related income, which we refer to as SLEM, had its best quarterly revenue performance since 2019. Unlike our oil and gas royalty revenues, which are predominantly derived from our perpetual royalty interest carved from a mineral state, water and SLEM revenues originate from our ownership of the surface estate. That surface ownership is unique compared to other public oil and gas, mineral royalty and lease interest companies. Combining our surface ownership with active management, TPL extracts multiple incremental cash flow streams. These surface-derived opportunities have been thoughtfully commercialized to maintain our capital light, high margin business philosophy which ultimately contributes substantial free cash flow to the overall entity while also accelerating development of our oil and gas royalty interest. This most recent quarter is a great example of the built-in hedges that protect TPL during periods of volatile commodity prices. Although oil and gas royalty production this quarter increased 26% year-over-year, our oil and gas royalty revenues were still down 32% due to WTI crude oil and Henry Hub natural gas prices that declined approximately 32% and 71% respectively. However, for that same quarterly year-over-year comparison, our source water revenues were up 69%, produced water revenues up 12% and SLEM revenues were up 34%. During this last quarter, these surface-derived revenue streams in aggregate comprise 48% of TPL's overall consolidated revenue and helped maintain strong consolidated earnings and free cash flow despite much lower commodity prices. For SLEM, specifically, we're seeing broad strength across each subcategory. Pipeline easements, electric line easements and caliche sales have been especially good as operators deplete duct inventory and push development across broader areas. Our team of land agents and GIS specialists have done a tremendous job working with upstream, midstream and other operators to accommodate their development needs and procure revenue opportunities for our surface. Turning to water, during the quarter, we averaged over 700,000 barrels per day of source water sales volumes driven by robust brackish and treated water demand. Year-to-date, through second quarter 2023, total source, treated, and brokered water volumes are up 31% year-over-year. For the last 12 months, we've sold nearly 200 million barrels of water, and many of those barrels were used to complete oil and gas wells on TPL royalty acreage. Produced water volumes during the quarter averaged approximately 2.3 million barrels per day. Just as a reminder, TPL contracts with operators and other third parties for use of our surface for produced water facilities, including disposal wells, we generate a contracted fee for produced water barrels. Produced water volumes for second quarter 2023 are up 15% year-over-year. This was by far our best ever quarterly revenue and free cash flow performance for the water business, contributing just under $60 million of high margin revenue while only spending less than $2 million in CapEx. The cumulative efforts of prior capital investments and commercial negotiations going back to the inception of our dedicated in-house water business in 2017 are paying substantial dividends today. In many of our water contracts with operators, we have negotiated exclusive offtake of produced water across large areas of mutual interest. This is an important feature because it provides TPL holistic control over both source and produced water throughout the basin and across our surface. It allows us to continue sales of brackish water while also providing us incremental upside and opportunities to reuse and treat produced water for completion activities. Our operations team also deserves tremendous credit for procuring and moving water for our customers at volume levels we've never done before. TPL continues to demonstrate its ability to offer a full spectrum of reliable water services. During the last quarter, we spent approximately $20 million to acquire 12,000 surface acres in Andrews County along the Texas New Mexico State Line. This acreage fits nicely with our current surface footprint and will provide incremental opportunities for our teams to pursue and commercialize. As previously disclosed, on November 22, 2022, the company filed a complaint Delaware Chancery Court to resolve a disagreement with Horizon Kinetics, LLC, Horizon Kinetics Asset Management, LLC, SoftVest Advisors, LLC, and SoftVest L.P. over their voting commitments pursuant to a stockholders agreement with the company. We recently concluded the trial, and we're now waiting for the court to issue its opinion. We expect that to happen in due course, and we will update our stockholders when we have more to share. Also, the company recently announced that it has nominated Marguerite Woung-Chapman and Robert Roosa as two Independent Director nominees for election at the upcoming 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Both candidates bring a strong mix of industry skills and experience. Current Directors and Co-Chairs of the Board, David Barry and John Norris have decided to retire and not stand for reelection at the 2023 Annual Meeting. Dave and John have been involved with the company for decades, back to its days as a trust. They have always been great stewards for the company and have played a pivotal role in helping the company achieve the success it enjoys today. Without their support, TPL would not have a water or surface business or the professional administration anywhere near the scale and expertise it has today. They saw and understood the potential that TPL's unique assets possessed, and they took a chance to support a pivot to active management. On behalf of the entire management team here at TPL, we are thankful for their service, guidance, leadership and friendship over the years, and they will leave behind an exceptional legacy at TPL. With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Steddum: Thanks, Ty. Total revenues for the second quarter of 2023 were $161 million, representing a 10% increase from the first quarter 2023 revenues. As previously discussed, revenues benefited from higher royalty production, source water sales, produced water royalties and SLEM revenues, though partially offset by lower oil and gas prices. Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow for the quarter were $134 million and $105 million, respectively. Consolidated CapEx was $1.4 million, with most of the spend related to the water business. We ended the quarter with $609 million of cash on the balance sheet. Royalty production of approximately 24,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day represents a 19% increase on a sequential quarter basis. Although we continue to maintain that individual quarterly production figures can be lumpy, the underlying production on our royalty acreage continues to trend upward. This is further supported by new well data as recent permits, spuds and completions remain high across both our Midland and Delaware footprints. In particular, activity in Central Midland, Loving, Reeves and Culberson Counties are especially strong. Our oil price realizations remain high with second quarter 2023 average realized oil price of $73 per barrel, which represents an approximate 100% realization relative to WTI Cushing price per barrel. However, our natural gas and natural gas liquids realizations weakened this quarter relative to prior quarter realizations. Infrastructure constraints and downtime, among other factors, continued to suppress local West Texas price realizations for many operators. For TPL, this is somewhat mitigated as we benefit from additional infrastructure build-out through our SLEM business as new pipelines, processing facilities and other logistics assets generate easement and lease opportunities. In addition, our royalty acreage is dominated by super majors and large independent E&Ps that tend to own and/or commit to new infrastructure, which generally provides them better netbacks compared to smaller public and private operators. As more infrastructure is developed and completed, we would expect our realizations to improve. For this quarter, we have maintained our $3.25 per share dividend. We also spent approximately $20 million to repurchase approximately 14,000 shares. And with that, operator, we will now take questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I will announce the first questioner, which is Derrick Whitfield from Stifel. Please go ahead.\nDerrick Whitfield: Good morning all and congrats on a strong quarter.\nTy Glover: Thanks, Derrick. Good morning.\nChris Steddum: Thanks, Derrick.\nDerrick Whitfield: For my first question, I wanted to focus on the substantial strength in water resources this quarter with the understanding that source water is activity driven, and this is the best quarter you posted in the history of the business. So I wanted to ask if you could elaborate on some of the drivers underpinning the strength to allow us to better assess sustainability post Q2?\nTy Glover: Yes. Look, the water team did a phenomenal job this past quarter. We saw strength across brackish water sales, treatment volumes as well as produced water. The team really pushed the limits of our system delivering over 700,000 barrels a day. And there's a couple of reasons for that increase in volume this quarter. One is increased activity in contracted areas of mutual interest. So we've talked about those types of agreements in the past, where we contract a big area of mutual interest with our operators and they're obligated to purchase water from us. The team also did a fantastic job of selling water outside of our footprint. So this quarter, over 60% of our water sales were off of TPL acreage. And that's purely from our business development team and water team expanding our reach beyond our footprint. So I think we'll continue to see strong activity levels throughout the year. This quarter may be a high watermark for the year. But when we look at our backlog of sales, we continue to see some strength in the near-term.\nDerrick Whitfield: That's great. And maybe along the same lines, how should we think about your production trajectory, given the strength of Q2 production and your line of sight activity?\nChris Steddum: Derrick, I'll take that one. When we look at the underlying production data on kind of a production day basis. It supports what we're seeing. And like we said, any given quarter can always be a little bit lumpy. But when we kind of look at the average of the first half of '23, we think that's probably a pretty good reflection of where the business is at. And as we've kind of stated when we look at some of the near-term inventory DUCs completions that are occurring we feel good that the trajectory for the rest of the year should include some continued growth. So that's how we're kind of thinking about it right now.\nDerrick Whitfield: Chris, maybe asked slightly differently from my side. When we look at your line of sight activity, how many of those net wells would be required to maintain production?\nChris Steddum: Yes. Derrick, it's a good question. And those numbers always move around as production grows. But when we think about it, I think something probably in the neighborhood of like eight net wells, give or take, that's probably about the level we would need for flat production and maintenance.\nDerrick Whitfield: All right. That's very helpful. And maybe just one final follow-up from my side. Regarding the surface acquisition you announced in Q2, could you briefly touch on the strategic importance of that area? And perhaps more broadly also just touch on the competitive landscape for surface and royalty opportunities across the basin?\nTy Glover: Yes, that particular acquisition is a little over 12,000 acres in Andrews County along the state line, so non-marketed deal that we sourced through internal relationships here in the team. But really, when we buy a surface, we're thinking about how does that potential acquisition fit into our current footprint, and then also just our broader asset portfolio. And then really, what are the commercial opportunities that we see to take a raw piece of land like that and commercialize it. So what kind of surface opportunities, source water, produced water, other next-gen opportunities, we think we could commercialize both in near-term and long-term. But we really like the optionality that that state line acreage gives us. If you look at some of our past surface acquisitions, they've been along the state line. Those have been great investments. And with all of the activity that crosses the state line from New Mexico into Texas, we just feel like that's a really good option for us. I think the -- as far as the overall market, it's very competitive on the royalty side right now. On the surface side, probably a little less competitive, maybe fewer opportunities out there to take an asset that's been underutilized and realize some additional value through commercialization. But we do think there's still a lot of opportunity left.\nDerrick Whitfield: That's great. Terrific color. Thanks for your time.\nTy Glover: Thanks, Derrick.\nOperator: The next question comes from Hamed Khorsand from BWS Financial. Please go ahead.\nHamed Khorsand: Good morning. So my first question was on the water side. What would the hindrance be to grow further? I mean, if you're doing record pace now, you obviously have a greater capacity than you first thought. So why do you think Q2 was the high watermark?\nTy Glover: Well, look, I don't know that it necessarily will be the high watermark. But when you have a quarter like this, looking at the back half of the year, our water sales usually taper off towards the end of the year just because there's less activity in the fourth quarter. To have a quarter like this, deliver these kind of volumes is fantastic. The team continues to work hard to source additional barrels off of our footprint. We're also seeing increased activity on our footprint. So I think sales will continue to be strong.\nHamed Khorsand: And on the easement side of the business, I saw in the Q that you had an increase related to pipeline easement. Will that be recurring, that $2.4 million?\nTy Glover: So most of our pipeline easements are on term agreements that will recur. I assume that's what you're asking, if those are recurring agreements. The majority of those are, yes.\nHamed Khorsand: Yes. Okay. And then what's the appetite to do more of these land acquisitions? And what's the attractiveness that you need to do something like this again?\nTy Glover: Well, our appetite is strong. We're always looking. Like I said earlier, we're looking for assets that have maybe yet to be commercialized or maybe that's just been unrealized. Looking for something that we feel like the expertise that we have here on our team can add some additional value through commercialization, whether that's on the water side of the business, the SLEM side of the business, just anything that we feel like the knowledge that we have in-house could create some additional value or the relationships that we have throughout the industry could create some additional value. That's what we're looking for.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow for the quarter were $134 million and $105 million, respectively. Consolidated CapEx was $1.4 million, with most of the spend related to the water business. We ended the quarter with $609 million of cash on the balance sheet. Royalty production of approximately 24,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day represents a 19% increase on a sequential quarter basis. Although we continue to maintain that individual quarterly production figures can be lumpy, the underlying production on our royalty acreage continues to trend upward. This is further supported by new well data as recent permits, spuds and completions remain high across both our Midland and Delaware footprints. In particular, activity in Central Midland, Loving, Reeves and Culberson Counties are especially strong. Our oil price realizations remain high with second quarter 2023 average realized oil price of $73 per barrel, which represents an approximate 100% realization relative to WTI Cushing price per barrel. However, our natural gas and natural gas liquids realizations weakened this quarter relative to prior quarter realizations. Infrastructure constraints and downtime, among other factors, continued to suppress local West Texas price realizations for many operators. For TPL, this is somewhat mitigated as we benefit from additional infrastructure build-out through our SLEM business as new pipelines, processing facilities and other logistics assets generate easement and lease opportunities. In addition, our royalty acreage is dominated by super majors and large independent E&Ps that tend to own and/or commit to new infrastructure, which generally provides them better netbacks compared to smaller public and private operators. As more infrastructure is developed and completed, we would expect our realizations to improve. For this quarter, we have maintained our $3.25 per share dividend. We also spent approximately $20 million to repurchase approximately 14,000 shares. And with that, operator, we will now take questions. Thanks, Derrick. Derrick, I'll take that one. When we look at the underlying production data on kind of a production day basis. It supports what we're seeing. And like we said, any given quarter can always be a little bit lumpy. But when we kind of look at the average of the first half of '23, we think that's probably a pretty good reflection of where the business is at. And as we've kind of stated when we look at some of the near-term inventory DUCs completions that are occurring we feel good that the trajectory for the rest of the year should include some continued growth. So that's how we're kind of thinking about it right now. Yes. Derrick, it's a good question. And those numbers always move around as production grows. But when we think about it, I think something probably in the neighborhood of like eight net wells, give or take, that's probably about the level we would need for flat production and maintenance."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Shawn Amini of Investor Relations. Thank you and you may proceed sir.\nShawn Amini: Thank you for joining us today for Texas Pacific Land Corporation's first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Yesterday afternoon, the company released its financial results and filed its Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is available on the Investors section of the company's website at www.texaspacific.com. As a reminder, remarks made on today's conference call may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. We do not undertake any obligation to update our forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. For a more detailed discussion of the factors that may affect the company's results, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings. During this call, we will also be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. More information and reconciliations about these non-GAAP financial measures are contained in our earnings release and SEC filings. Please also note, we may at times refer to our company by its stock ticker, TPL. This morning's conference call is hosted by TPL's Chief Executive Officer, Ty Glover; and Chief Financial Officer, Chris Steddum. Management will make some prepared comments, after which, we will open the call for questions. Now, I will turn the call over to Ty.\nTy Glover: Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. TPL delivered another strong quarter as our non-oil and gas royalty businesses helped to mitigate the impact of lower oil and gas prices. During first quarter 2023 WTI Cushing Oil and Henry Hub natural gas prices were down 19% and 43%, respectively, compared to the same time period last year, and as a result of that direct exposure to prices, our oil and gas royalty revenues were down 14%. However, on a year-over-year basis, for first quarter 2023, our sourced water sales were up 15%. Produced water royalties were up 35%, and our easement and other surface-related income was up 63%. When commodity prices come under pressure, these non-oil and gas royalty revenue streams are especially valuable as they provide the company built-in hedges and countercyclical revenues. This quarter, nearly 40% of our revenues were outside of oil and gas royalties. As many of you know, TPL has not historically hedged our commodity price exposure related to royalties. For us, the non-oil and gas royalty cash flow streams and our debt-free balance sheet are the hedge. Even during a long period of severely depressed prices, TPL has shown it can generate substantial positive free cash flow. 2020 was a great example of that. And when the cycle inevitably turns, as it did last year, our hedge-free position ensures that we capture maximum upside. Despite some recent turbulence with oil and gas prices, the long-term outlook for TPL remains strong, underpinned by the Permian is arguably the best resource play in North America. We remain optimistic based on our conversations with our customers across surface and water. From our internal data, leading indicators, such as new permitting and drilling activity remain at historically strong levels. As we've said in the past, quarter-to-quarter performance may fluctuate, but we continue to expect royalty production and overall activity to trend upwards over the long-term. As previously disclosed on November 22, 2022, the company filed a complaint and Delaware Chancery Court to resolve a disagreement with Horizon Kinetics LLC, Horizon Kinetics Asset Management LLC, SoftVest Advisors LLC, and SoftVest, L.P. over their voting commitments pursuant to a stockholders' agreement with the company. The Delaware Court of Chancery held a one-day trial on April 17th, 2023. Following post-trial briefing, the company anticipates the court to issue a decision. With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Steddum: Thanks Ty. Total revenues for the quarter of 2023 were $146 million, representing a 4% decline sequentially from fourth quarter 2022 revenues. Revenues were impacted by lower oil and gas prices and royalty production, though offset by higher sourced water sales, produced water volumes and easements and other surface-related income. Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow for the quarter were $116 million and $88 million respectively. We ended the quarter with $591 million of cash on the balance sheet. TPL's near-term inventory outlook remains strong with approximately five net permits, 7.8 net DUCs, and 3.3 net completed wells at the end of the quarter. As Ty referenced earlier, our preliminary data shows first quarter 2023 as the second best quarter ever for new permits on a net lateral feet basis. For new spuds, first quarter 2023 would be a record on a net lateral feet drilled basis, which is driven by both higher gross new spuds and also longer lateral lengths now approaching nearly 11,000 feet on average. We continue to evaluate our capital allocation priorities as company and industry fundamentals evolve. For this quarter, we have maintained our $3.25 per share dividend. Our previously announced $250 million buyback authorization began on January 1st of this year, and as we move out of a blackout period, we have room to lean more heavily on that program. With a large cash balance, zero debt and a business that continues to generate ample free cash flow, we retain tremendous amount of flexibility to be opportunistic as we look to maximize shareholder value. And with that, operator, we will now take questions.\nOperator: Thank you very much. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Derrick Whitfield from Stifel. Please proceed with your question Derrick.\nDerrick Whitfield: Good morning Ty and Chris.\nTy Glover: Good morning Derrick.\nChris Steddum : Good morning.\nDerrick Whitfield: My first question, I wanted to focus on the growth outlook of your oil and gas royalty segment. With the understanding that you don't provide quarterly guidance in Q1 was negatively impacted by less spills. How should we think about the near-term production trajectory in light of your line of sight activity, which increased sequentially? And separately, could you comment on the degree you guys were impacted by the issues Chevron experienced during Q4 earnings and outlined further at its Analyst Day. It does appear there was a higher-than-expected depletion effects after long-sitting DUCs, but that appears to be one-time in nature. But again, any color you could offer would be greatly appreciated.\nChris Steddum: Hey Derrick. I might tackle the first part of the question. So, when we think about our production outlook, I think what we've said in the past is that we still expect TPL to outperform the basin over kind of the near and medium term. And so I think we still feel that, that will be the case. And to your point, when we look at kind of the net normalized DUCs permits, all of those numbers are effectively at all-time highs right now. And so certainly, from a near-term inventory perspective, we feel like TPL is in a great spot right now. And so there's certainly plenty of near-term inventory to give a positive production outlook for the rest of the year. Now, look, the pace at which the operators are going to take down that inventory, that's always the difficult part to predict. But as far as what we've got out there, it looks great. It looks strong. DUCs look great. And I think at the end of the day, what we kind of have seen as we've gotten the data in as the fourth quarter, right, the amount of wells turned in line was just a little bit lower and that happens quarter-to-quarter like we say, it is going to be somewhat volatile in the short-term. But in the long-term, I think our outlook still remains strong, and we think we'll continue to outpace the basin. And I don't know, Ty, if you wanted to talk any about some of the operator?\nTy Glover: Yes, I'll take a stab at the second part of your question there. I think what you're referring to is some of the well results that Chevron had I would say that while Chevron owns the minerals under a large portion of our position, most of that has been leased out or farmed out. And so we actually have a fairly small exposure to Chevron operations overall, if you look at what they operate as a percentage of our entire position. So, I'm not sure if that's helpful.\nDerrick Whitfield: It is. Thanks Ty. And then maybe shifting over to the SLEM business, you guys experienced one of the strongest quarters since 2019. In addition to record activity, are there other noticeable drivers that we should be thinking about?\nTy Glover: Yes, I would say the main drivers on the ramp in SLEM has been an increase in pipeline easements. As we've seen gas take away tighten, we're starting to see more requests for gathering infrastructure. Our team has done a really good job in the field with rock sales. So, we've opened up some new caliche pits. We're crushing rock now. We've expanded sales into New Mexico. And so we've seen a nice ramp in rock sales as well. We had a little bit of sand royalty towards the end of the quarter. So, expect that to ramp up as well here in the near future.\nDerrick Whitfield: And perhaps one last if I could. Just with respect to your trial versus Horizon Kinetics, what should we expect from the post-trial briefing schedule, meaning I'm not asking you to project an outcome, but does a favorable outcome allow you to advance Proposal 4, assuming you have a shareholder approval?\nTy Glover: Say the last part of that question one more time, Derrick, sorry.\nDerrick Whitfield: Sure. So, with respect to the decision that comes out of the post-trial briefing schedule with Horizon Kinetics, what should we expect from that? And by that, I mean, I'm not asking you to project an outcome of the trial, but does a favorable outcome allow you to advance Proposal 4, assuming you have shareholder approval?\nTy Glover: Yes, that's correct.\nDerrick Whitfield: Hey, terrific. That\u2019s all for me guys. Thanks.\nTy Glover: Thanks Derrick.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Hamed Khorsand from BWS Financial. Please proceed with your question Hamed.\nHamed Khorsand: Good morning. The first question I had was on just the legal expense line. Is that an accrued expense? What should we expect in Q2? And is that a normal number? I mean it seems quite excessive.\nChris Steddum: Hey Hamed, that is an accrued expense. And look, we really can't comment on expectations of what the spend may be in the future. And so that's kind of where it's at right now.\nHamed Khorsand: Okay. And then on the revenue side, could you just talk about this one-time revenue that was disclosed in the Q, what sparked it and what your future revenue would be if there is any from this arbitration?\nChris Steddum: Yes. The -- effectively, it was a stipulation that -- based on what we felt that Chevron was, I guess, over deducting some expenses in the past. So, all of that revenue is associated with past period where they had probably overcharged on some of the expenses on the gas and NGL side. And so I think the right way to think about it is, it's effectively a kind of a one-time payment to rectify that.\nHamed Khorsand: Okay. So, I assume that the oil revenue would have been down another $8 million on a normalized basis then?\nChris Steddum: Yes, that's the right way to think about it. And again, it's just -- I guess, as we said in some of our prepared remarks compared to last year and even last quarter, across the board, we've seen quite a bit of commodity price weakness.\nHamed Khorsand: Okay. And then my last question was that also in the Q, you disclosed that there was a $3.6 million put into the Water Resource business. What was that for? And is the business itself generating positive free cash flow?\nChris Steddum: Yes. So the capital is basically in line with the capital we probably spend each quarter. Usually, it's been about a $12 million capital spend for most years. The right way to think about that is some of it is the continued electrification of our operations. So, we are approaching the end of that electrification process. Some of that is purchasing different like lay-flat hoses and operating equipment that we need day-to-day. And you could think of that type of stuff is more like a maintenance capital, right? So, those would be dollars that we would probably continue to spend in the future to maintain the business and our equipment. And then some of it is, I think we've probably said in the past, the supply chains have slowed down for some of the key items that you need to operate. And so we have also gone out and probably purchased in advance or at least further in advance than we normally would some of the key infrastructure items, tanks and hoses that we know we're going to need in the future to fulfill customer orders. And so that's kind of what that number is and the right way to think about it. And if you look at the financials, that business had $20 million of positive net income this quarter. And also free cash flow -- positive free cash flow.\nHamed Khorsand: I appreciate it. Thank you.\nTy Glover: Thanks Hamed.\nChris Steddum: Thanks Hamed.\nOperator: Thank you very much. That was our final question and that concludes the Q&A session as well as the teleconference for today. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your participation, and you may now disconnect your lines.",

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our strong third quarter 2024 performance underscores the success of our active management strategy focused on maximizing oil and gas royalties, surface and water assets with acquisition activity over the last couple of years set to provide incremental growth tailwinds. In addition, TPL continues to benefit from activity levels in the Permian Basin, which remain resilient despite fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices. To start, TPL's oil and gas royalty production of approximately 28,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day represents a corporate record, driven by our Central Midland and oily Loving subregions. For water sales, revenues were up 37% year-over-year as the size and scale of our operations provide a meaningful competitive advantage as operator customers look for delivery assurance. Continued deployment of co completions and simul and trimul fracking placed tremendous volume demands for water delivered over a relatively short period and our substantial investment in brackish and treated water infrastructure has established one of the few systems in the Permian capable of this type of volume intensity. This was also another record quarter for our produced water royalty revenues with produced water royalty volumes up 46% year-over-year as our expanding set of commercial arrangements with third-party customers continues to drive increased market capture. In our conversations with investors, our produced water royalties is by far the most misunderstood aspect of our business. Today, I'd like to spend some time elaborating on this topic, especially given the growth we've seen to date and also given the robust outlook over the near term and long term, underpinned by acquisitions we made last year. Our produced water royalties business is often conflated with traditional saltwater midstream and disposal operations. In traditional saltwater disposal operations, otherwise known by its acronym, SWD, an operator will collect water produced via an oil and gas well at a centralized storage facility, transport it typically via pipeline to an SWD facility, where it is then injected thousands of feet below the surface. From a high level, TPL's role in the disposal of produced water is providing SWD operators access to our surface and our core space and in return, we charge a produced water royalty. TPL does not currently operate SWD infrastructure. To receive these produced water royalties, we have negotiated separate individualized commercial agreements with each operator that wants to operate SWD infrastructure on our land. These agreements often cover massive acreage extents and can take months or even years to negotiate. Since we started in 2017, the team has easily spent more hours negotiating, structuring and executing produced water royalty agreements than any other part of the business. The effort was well worth it as these produced water royalties provide TPL with a commercially unique, extremely high-quality cash flow stream. In 2016, before active management, TPL generated virtually 0 produced water royalties. Fast forward to today, and TPL is positioned to collect royalties on well over 1 billion barrels of produced water for the full year 2024, which will in turn generate around $100 million of royalty revenues. And because of how we've structured these agreements, this revenue stream incurs 0 capital expenditures and 0 operating expense burden outside of personnel salaries and legal expenses that go into negotiating the agreements. In effect, the hundreds of millions or likely billions of dollars this business will cumulatively generate in the years to come, flows directly to TPL's bottom line, representing nearly pure margin. By applying our historical earnings trading multiple to the current produced water royalties annualized run rate cash flow, it's easy to see the immense value this business has created for shareholders. It's also worth noting that our agreements provide TPL with extremely robust indemnification against spills, accidents, injuries or other types of liabilities. In addition to benefiting from the significant financial upside, we've also been very intentional in protecting TPL interest from potential risks. Furthermore, these produced water realty agreements enhance our water sales business. Many of our contracts include provisions providing TPL the exclusive right to offtake produced water barrels within an area of mutual interest for treatment and resale. This allows TPL to procure produced water from an operator's system, treat it to a customer's specifications and sell the recycled water for well completions. In such circumstances, TPL is paid twice on a single barrel, once through a produced water royalty and again through a treated water sale. This feature has been especially critical for TPL as operators have been increasingly using raw or treated produced water for well development over the last few years. Looking ahead, recent strategic acquisitions will provide incremental produced water growth opportunities. Last year, we spent nearly $40 million across multiple transactions to acquire over 50,000 acres of surface acreage and core space. These acquisitions were strategically targeted given their location along the East state line of Texas and Mexico in Andrews and Winkler counties. This location is significant as this acreage is outside the core oil and gas development areas of the Permian Basin, where produced water disposal zones will not interfere with drilling and completion operations. Over the last year, our business development teams have been working diligently to commercialize this otherwise raw land. We have since signed an agreement with one of the largest midstream operators serving the broader Delaware market to bring produced water into these new tracks with initial volumes expected in fourth quarter 2024. We are also in advanced discussions with other parties for additional access, and we expect that the aggregate contribution for current and future agreements will support multiple hundreds of thousands of produced water barrels per day. These strategic surface acquisitions play a critical role for TPL as we look to deliver produced water solutions for the broader oil and gas industry. At the same time, they generate substantial incremental cash flows for TPL and help ensure that our oil and gas royalty interests remain undeterred by development constraints. Next, I'd like to spend some time discussing our most recent acquisition activity that we announced this past August and October. In total, we closed on three separate transactions totaling nearly $0.5 billion. The first asset was over 4,000 surface acres in Martin County, which is strategically located in the core of the Midland Basin. These surface assets provide numerous revenue streams across brackish water, produced water and other surface-related activities. The next asset we closed on was over 4,000 net royalty acres standardized to an 1/8th located in Culberson County. This acquired acreage was especially attractive given the royalty acreage overlap drilling spacing units where we already have an interest in with our legacy royalties. Meaning we essentially acquired a higher net revenue interest in current and future well locations we already own. The third asset we closed on was over 7,000 net royalty acres located primarily in the Midland Basin in Martin, Midland and other counties. These assets represent some of the best geology for oil development found anywhere in the Lower 48 and it significantly expands our net royalty acreage on the Midland side of the Permian Basin. All of these assets, both individually and on an aggregate basis, high grades TPL's asset portfolio. These newly acquired assets are on par with or even exceed the quality of our legacy portfolio. They are expected to be highly accretive to our near-term financial and operating metrics on a per share basis while also enhancing and extending our growth runway given the remaining undeveloped inventory on the royalty acreage and the untapped commercial potential on the surface acreage. We expect the two royalty acquisitions to add upwards of approximately 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the near term, which represents an over 10% increase to our current oil and gas royalty production. Aggregating all three deals, we expect them to generate double-digit cash flow yield at a flat $70 oil price. As a result of the overall business performance and the additional free cash flow per share accretion these acquisitions provide, we announced yesterday that the Board has approved a 37% increase of our regular quarterly dividend to $1.60 per share. We continue to identify acquisition opportunities that could be excellent additions to the TPL portfolio. Our team brings exceptional technical, financial and operating capabilities across land, water and royalties and with a fortress balance sheet and a net cash position coupled with our free cash flow proficiency, we are well positioned to evaluate, execute and consolidate high-quality assets. As always, we remain intently focused on maximizing intrinsic value per share with a disciplined capital allocation approach aimed on maximizing returns over the long term. Next, I want to provide an update on our desalination efforts. We are making progress with equipment procurement, manufacturing and testing as we work towards our 10,000 barrel per day test facility, which we refer to as Phase 2b. We still expect completion of this facility in the middle of next year. We have also advanced various operating optimizations, cost efficiencies and economic analysis. Currently, we expect the total cost of Phase 2b to be approximately $25 million, with $10 million incurred in 2024 and the remaining balance in 2025. As an alternative to a direct grid connection, we are also evaluating a direct natural gas power generation option with a tie-in to a nearby nat gas pipeline which would require additional capital investment of approximately $10 million. Negotiations are ongoing with third-party partners and customers as we evaluate various commercial structures. As we've discussed in the past, we believe produced water desalination and beneficial reuse will potentially play a critical role in providing sustainable produced water solutions that will allow the Permian to maintain robust development activity. And finally, I want to remind TPL shareholders that we will be having our annual meeting tomorrow in Dallas. If you haven't already, I would encourage shareholders to submit their proxy votes soon. You can find the generic proxy statement posted on the TPL website or via the SEC website. If you have any questions, please contact Investor Relations. With that, I'll hand the call over to Chris.\nChris Steddum : Thanks, Ty. Consolidated revenues during the third quarter 2024 were approximately $174 million. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $144 million and adjusted EBITDA margin was 83%. Diluted earnings per share was $4.63, which was up slightly versus the same period last year. Performance year-over-year benefited from higher oil and gas royalty production, which increased 29%, higher water sales volumes, which increased 32%, and higher produced water royalty volumes which increased 46%. Results were offset by lower realized oil and natural gas prices, which declined by 8% and 65%, respectively. Royalty production of approximately 28,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day represents 13% growth on a sequential quarter-over-quarter basis. Production continues to benefit from strong activity levels across our Northern Delaware and Midland Basin footprint with strong contributions from Exxon, Occidental, Coterra, BP and Diamondback. Our recent M&A activity that closed during the third quarter 2024 added approximately 900 barrels of oil equivalent per day and $3 million of cash flow. As Ty mentioned earlier, on a full quarterly run rate basis we expect our recent royalty and minerals acquisitions to add over 3,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day with an approximate 50% oil cut and the rest split relatively evenly between gas and NGLs. As of quarter end, we had 6.9 net permitted wells, 11.8 net drilled but uncompleted wells and 3.4 net completed but not producing wells. That amounts to 22.1% net line of sight inventory, which is the highest ever for TPL. The recent minerals and royalties acquisitions that closed in October is not reflected in the well statistics. We anticipate this acquisition to add approximately 1.5 net wells to our line of sight inventory. While we continue to monitor activity on our acreage and in the broader Permian amid recent commodity price volatility, current activity levels remain robust from our vantage point. Finally, our balance sheet remains incredibly strong with 0 debt and in a net cash position. While commodity prices are beyond our control, we remain focused on maximizing value where we can. The business has been set up to thrive in virtually any commodity price environment and regardless of which way the macroeconomic environment unfolds, TPL will be operating from a position of strength and will look to be opportunistic. And with that, operator, we will now take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Derrick Whitfield from [Texas Pacific Land Corporation].\nDerrick Whitfield: Congrats on your quarter and recent acquisitions.\nTyler Glover: Thanks, Derek.\nDerrick Whitfield: Starting on M&A, could you help frame what led you to be more active as of recent and your view on the opportunity set that meets your checklist?\nTyler Glover: Yes, sure. I think we've talked about it for the last couple of years, like we have a lot of interest in owning more assets that look just like what we own today. I mean we love surface, minerals, water. The overall environment has been pretty good for M&A lately where commodity prices are, sellers are willing to sell, and it's an attractive time to buy. So those deals were directly sourced, nonmarketed deals, but just really attractive asset classes, high-quality long-duration cash flows, very similar to what we own today. I mean a lot of the interest we bought was actually in DSUs that we already own. So some intelligence there on development timing and pretty easy to manage when you're just going in and changing decimal places in the database that we already have. So again, just really high quality, very attractive assets that are really easy to integrate into our management system.\nDerrick Whitfield: Terrific. And then maybe shifting over to the surface side of the business. I mean there's been a tremendous uptick in interest in surface rights since the LandBridge IPO. Given that you guys own one of the largest surface acre spreads in Texas, could you speak to the level of non-oil and gas revenue you're generating to date and the potential you see in opportunities surrounding AI, data centers, renewable energy, crypto mining, et cetera?\nTyler Glover: Yes. I mean surface is a fantastic asset. I think the thing we like about it the most is just the optionality that you have. Minerals are a great asset as well, but you don't have as much control over the actual development. Whereas surface, you can be more proactive and kind of have more control over how and when that asset is developed. So as far as non-oil and gas revenue, it's pretty immaterial today, but we've signed a lot of contracts in the last couple of years. I think we've got over 700 megawatts of solar that we've contracted in the last 24 months that's in development phases. We've got seven utility-scale battery projects going. I think we've got four Bitcoin mines, like 78 megawatts that are active today with another 50 in development stages. So I think there's a lot of opportunity outside of oil and gas. We've seen an increase in wind power interest lately. And then there's been a lot of talk about data centers, as you know, I think Diamondback and Permian Resources have mentioned that lately. But that's something that we've been working on for some time now. And if you think about data centers as compute centers, then we've actually got a couple of small compute centers in the form of Bitcoin mining, like I mentioned, that are up and running with a couple more in negotiations. So we know what it takes to negotiate these things and every deal is unique, but if you think about the large data center you might see for hyperscalers, those are still in the early days of development for the Permian. And I would just say that there's a lot of conversations taking place within the industry and definitely within TPL. And we feel that we're positioned as well as anyone in West Texas to provide land and water solutions as those opportunities unfold. And so we've got a lot of experience negotiating and contracting compute facilities, but also all the things that might be ancillary to a data center, things like solar, wind, gas generation, pipeline and electric easements, water, grid-scale batteries, like I mentioned, and carbon capture. So we've signed contracts. We're cash flowing along a lot of those items already today. So again, TPL just has a lot of positive attributes for data centers and nobody has more land than us in West Texas. So another thing, too, is if we need to buy more land to accommodate a data center, then we have proven that, that's not hard for us to do so. I think there's also a lot of other parts of the country that are also attractive for data centers. So we're working hard to make TPL as attractive as possible. But again, we're just -- we're having a lot of good discussions, and we'll definitely update you guys along the way.\nDerrick Whitfield : Terrific. And maybe just staying on water. A few of your midstream peers are pursuing mineral extraction opportunities with iodine and lithium. Is there a royalty opportunity for you guys on that front?\nTyler Glover: Robert, do you want to take that one?\nRobert Crain : Yes, sure. We talk about beneficial extraction of the produced water. A lot of folks are chasing it. I think those conversations are very similar to the very early stages of large data centers, judging that opportunity. What we've done, I'll say, from a long time out is to start identifying and cataloging by strata and by spatial area, what those concentrations are and in a compounded in a raw and then in a compounded environment, is that marketable? We -- I think we have a good line of sight internally on what are those analytes that can be compounded in our commercial at scale. And we continue to evaluate it. And then conversations regarding that, whatever beneficial use comes of that water and how that goes into play. I think it's still developing in the regulatory world on ownership of produced water and is going to kind of to be determined on the ownership of produced water and any downstream revenues that are associated with it.\nDerrick Whitfield: And finally, if I could, just referencing the new midstream agreement you mentioned in your prepared remarks that will bring additional produced water in Q4. How material of a step-up in SWD volumes is that?\nTyler Glover: I think that contract is a couple of hundred thousand barrels a day. And if you look at our run rate, we're just under 4 million barrels a day on average today.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. The conference of Texas Pacific Land Corporation has now concluded. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Tyler Glover",
            "content": "Thanks, Shawn. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our strong third quarter 2024 performance underscores the success of our active management strategy focused on maximizing oil and gas royalties, surface and water assets with acquisition activity over the last couple of years set to provide incremental growth tailwinds. In addition, TPL continues to benefit from activity levels in the Permian Basin, which remain resilient despite fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices. To start, TPL's oil and gas royalty production of approximately 28,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day represents a corporate record, driven by our Central Midland and oily Loving subregions. For water sales, revenues were up 37% year-over-year as the size and scale of our operations provide a meaningful competitive advantage as operator customers look for delivery assurance. Continued deployment of co completions and simul and trimul fracking placed tremendous volume demands for water delivered over a relatively short period and our substantial investment in brackish and treated water infrastructure has established one of the few systems in the Permian capable of this type of volume intensity. This was also another record quarter for our produced water royalty revenues with produced water royalty volumes up 46% year-over-year as our expanding set of commercial arrangements with third-party customers continues to drive increased market capture. In our conversations with investors, our produced water royalties is by far the most misunderstood aspect of our business. Today, I'd like to spend some time elaborating on this topic, especially given the growth we've seen to date and also given the robust outlook over the near term and long term, underpinned by acquisitions we made last year. Our produced water royalties business is often conflated with traditional saltwater midstream and disposal operations. In traditional saltwater disposal operations, otherwise known by its acronym, SWD, an operator will collect water produced via an oil and gas well at a centralized storage facility, transport it typically via pipeline to an SWD facility, where it is then injected thousands of feet below the surface. From a high level, TPL's role in the disposal of produced water is providing SWD operators access to our surface and our core space and in return, we charge a produced water royalty. TPL does not currently operate SWD infrastructure. To receive these produced water royalties, we have negotiated separate individualized commercial agreements with each operator that wants to operate SWD infrastructure on our land. These agreements often cover massive acreage extents and can take months or even years to negotiate. Since we started in 2017, the team has easily spent more hours negotiating, structuring and executing produced water royalty agreements than any other part of the business. The effort was well worth it as these produced water royalties provide TPL with a commercially unique, extremely high-quality cash flow stream. In 2016, before active management, TPL generated virtually 0 produced water royalties. Fast forward to today, and TPL is positioned to collect royalties on well over 1 billion barrels of produced water for the full year 2024, which will in turn generate around $100 million of royalty revenues. And because of how we've structured these agreements, this revenue stream incurs 0 capital expenditures and 0 operating expense burden outside of personnel salaries and legal expenses that go into negotiating the agreements. In effect, the hundreds of millions or likely billions of dollars this business will cumulatively generate in the years to come, flows directly to TPL's bottom line, representing nearly pure margin. By applying our historical earnings trading multiple to the current produced water royalties annualized run rate cash flow, it's easy to see the immense value this business has created for shareholders. It's also worth noting that our agreements provide TPL with extremely robust indemnification against spills, accidents, injuries or other types of liabilities. In addition to benefiting from the significant financial upside, we've also been very intentional in protecting TPL interest from potential risks. Furthermore, these produced water realty agreements enhance our water sales business. Many of our contracts include provisions providing TPL the exclusive right to offtake produced water barrels within an area of mutual interest for treatment and resale. This allows TPL to procure produced water from an operator's system, treat it to a customer's specifications and sell the recycled water for well completions. In such circumstances, TPL is paid twice on a single barrel, once through a produced water royalty and again through a treated water sale. This feature has been especially critical for TPL as operators have been increasingly using raw or treated produced water for well development over the last few years. Looking ahead, recent strategic acquisitions will provide incremental produced water growth opportunities. Last year, we spent nearly $40 million across multiple transactions to acquire over 50,000 acres of surface acreage and core space. These acquisitions were strategically targeted given their location along the East state line of Texas and Mexico in Andrews and Winkler counties. This location is significant as this acreage is outside the core oil and gas development areas of the Permian Basin, where produced water disposal zones will not interfere with drilling and completion operations. Over the last year, our business development teams have been working diligently to commercialize this otherwise raw land. We have since signed an agreement with one of the largest midstream operators serving the broader Delaware market to bring produced water into these new tracks with initial volumes expected in fourth quarter 2024. We are also in advanced discussions with other parties for additional access, and we expect that the aggregate contribution for current and future agreements will support multiple hundreds of thousands of produced water barrels per day. These strategic surface acquisitions play a critical role for TPL as we look to deliver produced water solutions for the broader oil and gas industry. At the same time, they generate substantial incremental cash flows for TPL and help ensure that our oil and gas royalty interests remain undeterred by development constraints. Next, I'd like to spend some time discussing our most recent acquisition activity that we announced this past August and October. In total, we closed on three separate transactions totaling nearly $0.5 billion. The first asset was over 4,000 surface acres in Martin County, which is strategically located in the core of the Midland Basin. These surface assets provide numerous revenue streams across brackish water, produced water and other surface-related activities. The next asset we closed on was over 4,000 net royalty acres standardized to an 1/8th located in Culberson County. This acquired acreage was especially attractive given the royalty acreage overlap drilling spacing units where we already have an interest in with our legacy royalties. Meaning we essentially acquired a higher net revenue interest in current and future well locations we already own. The third asset we closed on was over 7,000 net royalty acres located primarily in the Midland Basin in Martin, Midland and other counties. These assets represent some of the best geology for oil development found anywhere in the Lower 48 and it significantly expands our net royalty acreage on the Midland side of the Permian Basin. All of these assets, both individually and on an aggregate basis, high grades TPL's asset portfolio. These newly acquired assets are on par with or even exceed the quality of our legacy portfolio. They are expected to be highly accretive to our near-term financial and operating metrics on a per share basis while also enhancing and extending our growth runway given the remaining undeveloped inventory on the royalty acreage and the untapped commercial potential on the surface acreage. We expect the two royalty acquisitions to add upwards of approximately 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the near term, which represents an over 10% increase to our current oil and gas royalty production. Aggregating all three deals, we expect them to generate double-digit cash flow yield at a flat $70 oil price. As a result of the overall business performance and the additional free cash flow per share accretion these acquisitions provide, we announced yesterday that the Board has approved a 37% increase of our regular quarterly dividend to $1.60 per share. We continue to identify acquisition opportunities that could be excellent additions to the TPL portfolio. Our team brings exceptional technical, financial and operating capabilities across land, water and royalties and with a fortress balance sheet and a net cash position coupled with our free cash flow proficiency, we are well positioned to evaluate, execute and consolidate high-quality assets. As always, we remain intently focused on maximizing intrinsic value per share with a disciplined capital allocation approach aimed on maximizing returns over the long term. Next, I want to provide an update on our desalination efforts. We are making progress with equipment procurement, manufacturing and testing as we work towards our 10,000 barrel per day test facility, which we refer to as Phase 2b. We still expect completion of this facility in the middle of next year. We have also advanced various operating optimizations, cost efficiencies and economic analysis. Currently, we expect the total cost of Phase 2b to be approximately $25 million, with $10 million incurred in 2024 and the remaining balance in 2025. As an alternative to a direct grid connection, we are also evaluating a direct natural gas power generation option with a tie-in to a nearby nat gas pipeline which would require additional capital investment of approximately $10 million. Negotiations are ongoing with third-party partners and customers as we evaluate various commercial structures. As we've discussed in the past, we believe produced water desalination and beneficial reuse will potentially play a critical role in providing sustainable produced water solutions that will allow the Permian to maintain robust development activity. And finally, I want to remind TPL shareholders that we will be having our annual meeting tomorrow in Dallas. If you haven't already, I would encourage shareholders to submit their proxy votes soon. You can find the generic proxy statement posted on the TPL website or via the SEC website. If you have any questions, please contact Investor Relations. With that, I'll hand the call over to Chris. Thanks, Derek. Yes, sure. I think we've talked about it for the last couple of years, like we have a lot of interest in owning more assets that look just like what we own today.

This morning's conference call is hosted by TPL's Chief Executive Officer, Tyler Glover and TPL's Chief Financial Officer, Chris Steddum. Management will make some prepared comments, after which we will open the call for questions. Now I will turn the call over to Ty.\nTyler Glover: Thanks, Shawn. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Our second quarter 2024 results demonstrate the overall strength of our business as TPL has positioned itself at the forefront of the Permian Basin's emergence as a world-class resource. Performance was led by another outstanding quarter from our Water Services and Operations segment. We set corporate records across virtually every major water performance indicator, water sales revenues, water sales volumes, produced water royalties revenues, produced water royalties volumes, total water segment revenues, total water segment free cash flow and total water segment net income. Our prior investments in the people and commercial development continues to provide a substantial windfall for the company. Honing in on water sales, our team has successfully captured opportunities both on and off TPL acreage with sales volumes averaging 800,000 barrels per day during this quarter. Upstream operators utilizing simul-frac, trimul-frac and co-completions as part of their development strategies, are driving robust demand for TPL water as our strategically located infrastructure network has the size and reach to reliably accommodate ever-increasing demand for both brackish and recycled water. Our top 5 customers for water sales this quarter were Exxon, Conoco, Occidental, EOG and BP. Customer quality doesn't get much better than that. On the produced water side, we are reaping the benefits of our prior and ongoing commercial and contracting efforts as upstream and midstream operators drive produced water volumes into TPL's surface acreage. We collected a royalty on over 300 million barrels of produced water this quarter, which represents a 43% increase versus the same quarter last year. Our top customers here again represent some of the highest quality operators in the Permian, names like Conoco, BP, Coterra and Occidental. For our produced water desalination and beneficial reuse endeavors, procurement and process and equipment testing continues on our 10,000 barrel per day test facility, which we refer to as Phase IIb. We still expect completion of this facility in the middle of next year. CapEx related to these efforts is approximately $4 million year-to-date. On the beneficial reuse side, our alfalfa plot is currently operational and going very well, and we continue to make good progress on various permitting processes with regulatory agencies. As we discussed last quarter, we believe produced water desalination and beneficial reuse will potentially play a critical role in providing sustainable produced water solutions that will allow the Permian to maintain robust development activity. Oil and gas royalty production of approximately 24,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day was up slightly from the previous sequential quarter. Encouragingly, our line of sight inventory has expanded to 19.8 net wells, comprised of 6.3 net permits, 9.5 net drilled uncompleted wells and 4 net completed but not producing wells. Furthermore, we saw a large ramp in new permit activity during second quarter with 344 gross and 5 net new permits. Permitting activity was especially strong in our Loving Northern Reeves and Central Midland subregions. This level of near-term inventory and new activity gives us a lot of confidence our royalty production can sustain an attractive growth trajectory. For the second quarter 2024, oil and gas royalties comprised 52% of TPL's total consolidated revenues, which makes it the single largest revenue source TPL has. Although commodity price volatility over the last year or so has dampened top line revenue growth versus recent prior years, we still very much consider oil and gas royalties to be one of the highest quality cash flow streams, not just within the energy industry, but in the market more broadly. As many of you know, oil and gas royalties provide owners a fixed percentage of revenues and production from oil and gas wells, but without being burdened by any capital costs and almost none of the operating costs. Although they do bear exposure to fluctuating commodity prices, their high-margin capital-light attributes, meaning that even during periods of depressed commodity prices, royalties can still generate significant positive free cash flow. This is especially pertinent during periods of high and persistent inflation like we've experienced over the last few years. Rising development expenditures and labor expenses effectively raises the global oil supply cost curve. Thus, for operators to hit the same pre-inflationary return targets, they would need higher commodity prices. In other words, operators are constantly fighting a battle where cost inflation diminishes their returns and less commodity prices eventually rise commensurately. However, from the royalty owners perspective, higher upstream development costs do not directly impact our economics. Over the long term, as commodity prices potentially reset higher in response to a structurally higher global supply cost curve, then royalty owners capture the incremental revenue upside without bearing the burden of higher expenses. As we've discussed many times before, over the years, we've actively searched for external assets that look like TPL across surface water and royalties. On the royalty side, specifically, TPL is well positioned to consolidate a vast opportunity set of Permian Minerals and Royalties. Our current royalty position of 500,000 gross royalty acres provides unique advantages spanning across both the Midland and Delaware portions of the Permian Basin. With our industry-leading actively managed surface and water business, we have developed deep relationships with virtually every upstream, midstream and water operator as well as land and mineral estate owners across the basin, giving TPL unique access to off-market packages and extensive intel [ph] on development patterns. For potential mineral and royalty acquisitions, we evaluate each package with a bottoms-up intrinsic value approach. The goal with any acquisition is to generate at least double-digit IRRs on invested capital and to generate increased long-term free cash flow per share. Because TPL already owns great assets, we have no interest in diluting down our asset quality, our growth prospects or our unique business model. Any asset acquisition has to enhance the quality of our overall asset portfolio. It has to augment our growth runway. It has to support our high-margin capital life business model and ultimately, it has to increase TPL's intrinsic value per share. To this end, we employ an excellent team across M&A, reservoir engineering, GIS and minerals and royalties management, all with extensive industry experience. We have internally developed robust technology-driven data management systems that allow us to efficiently process, monitor and manage our mineral and royalty assets, which means we can roll out mineral and royalty assets in a very efficient manner without a proportionate increase in costs. The opportunity set for minerals and royalties is quite large. Although TPL's royalty acreage overlaps with some of the highest quality subregions in the Permian, there is still plenty of opportunity to consolidate royalties, both within our existing acreage footprint, but also within other Permian subregions that also contain excellent resource quality. Just within our existing asset footprint, we can buy royalties that are literally identical to what we already own. For example, in our core Texas Northern Delaware acreage, our typical royalty interest for a 1 mile by 1 mile section is generally 116th [ph] or 6.25%. With well laterals today typically extending out to 2 miles, a common drilling section unit or DSU is generally comprised of 2 adjacent sections. Thus for a 2-mile well lateral, our section would be one half of that DSU. So our net revenue interest in that would be one half of 6.25%, resulting in a net revenue interest of 3.125%. In the state of Texas, where the vast majority of mineral and royalty rights are privately owned, the total aggregate mineral and royalty interest is generally 25%. TPL's average net revenue interest across our entire portfolio is likely between 1% and 2%, which means that the other 23 or so percent are held by third parties. In other words, just on the DSUs that overlap with existing TPL royalty acreage, third-party ownership of those minerals and royalties is approximately 10 times TPL's net ownership. Looking beyond our current royalty footprint on the Midland side of the Permian, TPL's royalty position is much more fragmented with much smaller net revenue interest compared to our Texas Northern Delaware footprint. There are numerous subregions within the Midland that contains superb shale reserves where TPL does not have a meaningful position and adding resources here could be just as lucrative and high quality as our current portfolio. On the Delaware side, TPL's core Texas Northern Delaware royalty position stopped at the state line of Texas and New Mexico. Arguably the biggest and most lucrative wells in TPL's portfolio reside in this region. However, the excellent geology that lies under our Texas position extends well into New Mexico, where TPL does not currently own royalties. The resource quality on the New Mexico side is every bit as good as the Texas side and the rock there is widely considered some of the absolute best shale reserves found anywhere in North America, potentially adding mineral and royalty resources there would further high-grade our current royalty position. One last way to contemplate the sheer size of the overall consolidation opportunities to consider that the Permian currently produces north of 6 million barrels of crude oil per day. Assuming that the aggregate mineral and royalty interest held by third parties is around 20% across Texas and New Mexico and excluding production on federal and state lands would imply that roughly 1 million barrels per day of crude oil production is held by private mineral and royalty owners. Contrast that with TPL's current net crude oil royalty production of approximately 11,000 barrels per day. In other words, TPL's royalty production, ourselves one of the largest royalty owners in the country still only represents a miniscule fraction of the total production accruing to mineral and royalty owners in the Permian. In summary, we believe Permian oil and gas royalties are some of the most attractive assets investors can own. The opportunity set to acquire high-quality mineral and royalty assets is immense. And with TPL's extensive network and deep relationships from our legacy royalty and surface ownership, we have a unique combination of off-market deal access, technical wherewithal and a fortress balance sheet to roll out Permian minerals and royalties that public equity investors would not otherwise have access to. As our current royalty and surface footprint is already a free cash flow machine and with plenty of runway for future growth, we can remain selective. We don't need to acquire anything to grow. Any M&A pursuits can be purely opportunistic. We can discerningly consolidate assets that will enhance the company's intrinsic value per share, and we can and will remain disciplined. This has been the same strategy we've deployed for years now, and it's one that has served TPL and our shareholders well. And now as the Permian has emerged as an unequivocally world-class resource basin, TPL has never been in a better position to beneficially exploit this tailwind in our own backyard. Finally, I want to give shareholders a heads up that TPL will be ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange next Monday, August 12. TPL common stock and its predecessor subshares from our trustees have been listed on the NYSE since June 27, 1888, making this our 136-year anniversary. We're told by the NYSE that TPL is their seventh longest listed company. This also comes off our recent inclusion into the S&P 400, which is another great milestone. There are not many companies that have had a history as long-standing or colorful as TPL. And even though TPL may be one of the oldest public companies in existence, there's still a lot to be excited about for our future. The enterprise today is as strong and as profitable as it's ever been. The opportunity set has never been greater, and the company is primed to last another 100-plus years. With that, I'll hand the call over to Chris.\nChris Steddum: Thanks, Ty. Consolidated revenues during the second quarter of 2024 were approximately $172 million. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $153 million, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 89%. Diluted earnings per share was $4.98, which represents 14% year-over-year growth. Performance year-over-year was driven by high royalty production, water sales and produced water royalties. As discussed last quarter, weak natural gas prices at the Waha hub, which is the local pricing hub in West Texas led to low realized natural gas prices. Average benchmark Waha prices during second quarter 2024 were negative, and that negative pricing has persisted into early third quarter so far. Weak pricing is in a large part due to insufficient natural gas pipeline capacity out of the Permian Basin. However, the Matterhorn natural gas pipeline is expected in service later this year and once in service, we would expect to see reduced locational basis differentials. Last June, we announced that we had set a target cash and cash equivalents balance of approximately $700 million. Above this targeted level, TPL will seek to deploy the majority of its free cash flow towards share repurchases and dividends. In conjunction with this announcement, we also declared a $10 per share special dividend. Our cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the second quarter 2024 as of June 30 was approximately $895 million, though the $10 per share special dividend was paid in July with a total outlay of approximately $230 million. The target cash balance is intended to provide a framework and some predictability on how the company will allocate cash. The company continues to generate substantial free cash flow while maintaining a pristine balance sheet. Even beyond this most recent special dividend, the company still retains tremendous optionality to return additional capital to stockholders and to invest in attractive growth opportunities. We're very much in a position of strength to maximize shareholder value, and we're excited about the opportunities and option value our business can generate. And with that, operator, we will now take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nate Pendleton with Texas Capital. Please proceed with your question.\nNate Pendleton: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Starting on the quarter, you posted really strong revenue and volume numbers for both water sales and produced water. Can you speak to the drivers of the sequential increases we are seeing there? And can you touch on the sustainability of those results given the couple of quarters of increases?\nTyler Glover: Yes, Nate, thanks for the question. I think on the source water side, 73% of our sales this quarter were off of our footprint outside of TPL's acreage. So that number continues to grow. We were over 70% last quarter as well. So the team has done a really good job of just expanding our reach, selling water further and further outside of our footprint. The team has also done a really good job of building additional storage and infrastructure that's allowing us to sell more barrels per day. And then I think just with simul-frac and trimul-frac, the volumes needed delivered to location are continuing to grow. And that's a real advantage for us because we're one of the few water service operators that have the ability to actually supply those kind of volumes. I think on the produced water side, we've had a few new tie-ins this quarter that brought some water in. But a lot of that additional volume is in areas where we have existing contracts. And so we're seeing some really robust activity in those areas where we've got some of those larger AMI style [ph] agreements that we've talked about in the past. And then with co completions, you're just -- you're seeing some lumpier volumes as well, and we're very well positioned to take those volumes. We've got a lot of active capacity, a lot of permitted capacity. And so there's definitely some room to grow from an infrastructure standpoint. And even though we don't operate that infrastructure, our BD and water teams do a great job of making sure we're working with our water midstream partners to make sure that additional capacity is available for operators in those areas to meet their needs and make sure we don't bottleneck. So I think it is sustainable. We've had a really strong first half of the year. I think we'll continue to see good pace of development. Back half of the year could be a little softer than the first half, but I think overall, we're setting up to have a really nice 2024, both on the source water and the produced water side.\nNate Pendleton: Definitely. Thanks for all that detail. And regarding the increasing net well inventory you referenced in your prepared remarks, how do you view the outlook for activity in the near term? And can you speak to how you expect the oil cut to trend over time?\nChris Steddum: Hey, Nate. This is Chris. Yes, when we look at that near-term inventory, it's obviously very encouraging, and it sets us up for a lot of potential growth over the near term. Now obviously, a lot of those DUCs and permits have to be converted. But I think the good news is, like we said, we have 4 cups and those tend to come on fairly quickly and the checks get in the mail a few months after that. So that -- I think that speaks to a strong position for the remainder of the year and the permits and DUCs if those get converted ought to present a pretty strong position for the beginning of 2025. As far as the oil cut, I think something kind of in the mid-40% is a pretty reasonable number to expect. It can bump around. As new wells come on, they tend to have higher oil cuts and then over time, oil decreases. But overall, we've consistently kind of been in that mid-40% oil cut range. And I think that's a pretty reasonable place to expect it to continue over the near term.\nNate Pendleton: Got it. Thank you. And going back to the prepared remarks regarding the minerals A&D [ph] market. Can you provide some perspective on what the ideal deal sizes your team is looking at and some of the key criteria that your team is using to assess potential deals across the portfolio?\nTyler Glover: Yes. I mean I would say we're definitely more focused on deal quality than deal size. I mean, some deals are small enough. They're not worth the brain damage and your larger deals have less competition. But again, just to reinforce, we're focused more on deal quality than deal size.\nNate Pendleton: Okay. Got it. Thank you. Regarding recent earthquakes in the Permian, can we get your perspective on what you're hearing from the industry and any potential impacts on your acreage that you can speak to?\nTyler Glover: Yes. There was recently a 5.0 in Scurry County, which is a good way is probably 100 miles for many of our closest operations. So we haven't been affected by that one. Robert Crain is on the call. I'll kick that over to you, Robert, just to talk about some of the others that we've had and kind of how you view that in relation to our operations.\nRobert Crain: Yes. Thanks, Ty. Real quick on the Scurry Counties, as I mentioned, good distance away from any of our operational areas. Road Commission is investigating. And I think it's in nature, it's going to be a little bit different from some of the seismic activity that you see more in our acreage mainly due to the lower water injection rates over there and a possible contribution from EOR activities that are occurring in that area. But when we go back to the historic seismic activity that we've seen in the Delaware and the Midland Basin, on a significant decline. The operators and regulators worked very well together to identify the cause of those being deep disposal and you've seen significant curtailments and shut-ins of the majority of deep disposal wells and all of the contributing deep-disposal wells, its been a benefit to us. As you've seen now those deep disposal volumes need to go into more shallow formations, a good deal of which are located on our properties.\nNate Pendleton: That's really encouraging. Thanks for all that color. And then last one for me. Regarding your prior announcement to target cash position of $700 million on the balance sheet. Can you provide some perspective on how you arrived at that level and how the team makes the decision between using that cash for share buybacks or dividends for a given period?\nChris Steddum: Yes. Nate, this is Chris. I think the way that we've kind of targeted the absolute number is just thinking about opportunistically how much cash would you want to have to kind of be -- to be effective in the market. And that could be both for potential buybacks as well as potential M&A. And we felt like that level of cash gave us a significant advantage in the market that if there were great opportunities out there, we would be in a position to act quickly on them. And then as far as like how it gets deployed, I think we've spent a lot of time talking about it, but it's really just fundamentally return driven. We're looking to see where we can get the best risk-adjusted returns. And if that's buybacks, we're going to put more of that money toward buybacks if that's potentially adding third-party acreage, whether it's surface, royalties, water related, we're going to try to put more of that money there. And if we think that neither of those two opportunities are sufficiently attractive, then a lot of times that gets moved toward a dividend. So that's kind of the framework that we've tried to always use is try to put it towards the best risk-adjusted returns. And again, like we said, once we feel like we kind of have that sufficient capital to be competitive and effective, then at that point, it just makes sense to return all the remaining excess cash flow, which continues to be very robust to our shareholders.\nNate Pendleton: Makes sense. Appreciate your time.\nTyler Glover: Thanks, Nate.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Hamed Khorsand with BWS Financial. Please proceed with your question.\nHamed Khorsand: Hey, good morning. So my first question was regarding the -- your intention or evaluation of acquiring more royalty interest. Is it feasible to actually acquire anything in the Permian, just given what you've said, it is a premier asset area? Or are you trying to leverage the lower nat gas prices at the moment to find deals out there?\nTyler Glover: Good morning, Hamed. Thanks for the question. The Permian is a premier basin, but we're still seeing a lot of opportunity to acquire high-quality assets, like I talked about a little bit in the prepared remarks. A lot of those assets are within the same footprint that we already own a lot of times in the same DSU. And so that market is still very fragmented, and there are a lot of interest trading hands. So I think we'll continue to see a lot of opportunity on that front. And with the intelligence that we gained through our surface and water business and access to off-market deals, I think we've got an advantage on a lot of other buyers in the basin as well.\nHamed Khorsand: Okay. And then on the water segment side, what is the -- is it -- what is the issue? Is it competition? Is it other sources as far as not being able to sell as much water to the people on your land that you have to go outside of your -- the area that you cover?\nTyler Glover: Well, I think if I understand your question correctly, is there competition for wells being completed on our land. I think to answer that, the reason that we're selling more and more water off of our footprint is just to expand the business, capture more of the overall Permian market. So we're still sourcing a ton of completions and providing volumes on our land. We just continue to expand our infrastructure and network to sell more water off of our land, and that's how we've been able to capture more of the overall market to increase our overall daily production and sales, and that's why you're seeing the increase in revenue. And a big shout out to the team, the water team and the BD team, I think we started last year at roughly 50% of our sales were off of our footprint, and they've been able to grow that to 73% this quarter. So they've done a tremendous job there.\nHamed Khorsand: Great. Thank you.\nTyler Glover: Thanks, Hamed.\nOperator: Thank you. We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And with that, the conclusion of today's call. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thanks, Shawn. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Our second quarter 2024 results demonstrate the overall strength of our business as TPL has positioned itself at the forefront of the Permian Basin's emergence as a world-class resource. Performance was led by another outstanding quarter from our Water Services and Operations segment. We set corporate records across virtually every major water performance indicator, water sales revenues, water sales volumes, produced water royalties revenues, produced water royalties volumes, total water segment revenues, total water segment free cash flow and total water segment net income. Our prior investments in the people and commercial development continues to provide a substantial windfall for the company. Honing in on water sales, our team has successfully captured opportunities both on and off TPL acreage with sales volumes averaging 800,000 barrels per day during this quarter. Upstream operators utilizing simul-frac, trimul-frac and co-completions as part of their development strategies, are driving robust demand for TPL water as our strategically located infrastructure network has the size and reach to reliably accommodate ever-increasing demand for both brackish and recycled water. Our top 5 customers for water sales this quarter were Exxon, Conoco, Occidental, EOG and BP. Customer quality doesn't get much better than that. On the produced water side, we are reaping the benefits of our prior and ongoing commercial and contracting efforts as upstream and midstream operators drive produced water volumes into TPL's surface acreage. We collected a royalty on over 300 million barrels of produced water this quarter, which represents a 43% increase versus the same quarter last year. Our top customers here again represent some of the highest quality operators in the Permian, names like Conoco, BP, Coterra and Occidental. For our produced water desalination and beneficial reuse endeavors, procurement and process and equipment testing continues on our 10,000 barrel per day test facility, which we refer to as Phase IIb. We still expect completion of this facility in the middle of next year. CapEx related to these efforts is approximately $4 million year-to-date. On the beneficial reuse side, our alfalfa plot is currently operational and going very well, and we continue to make good progress on various permitting processes with regulatory agencies. As we discussed last quarter, we believe produced water desalination and beneficial reuse will potentially play a critical role in providing sustainable produced water solutions that will allow the Permian to maintain robust development activity. Oil and gas royalty production of approximately 24,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day was up slightly from the previous sequential quarter. Encouragingly, our line of sight inventory has expanded to 19.8 net wells, comprised of 6.3 net permits, 9.5 net drilled uncompleted wells and 4 net completed but not producing wells. Furthermore, we saw a large ramp in new permit activity during second quarter with 344 gross and 5 net new permits. Permitting activity was especially strong in our Loving Northern Reeves and Central Midland subregions. This level of near-term inventory and new activity gives us a lot of confidence our royalty production can sustain an attractive growth trajectory. For the second quarter 2024, oil and gas royalties comprised 52% of TPL's total consolidated revenues, which makes it the single largest revenue source TPL has. Although commodity price volatility over the last year or so has dampened top line revenue growth versus recent prior years, we still very much consider oil and gas royalties to be one of the highest quality cash flow streams, not just within the energy industry, but in the market more broadly. As many of you know, oil and gas royalties provide owners a fixed percentage of revenues and production from oil and gas wells, but without being burdened by any capital costs and almost none of the operating costs. Although they do bear exposure to fluctuating commodity prices, their high-margin capital-light attributes, meaning that even during periods of depressed commodity prices, royalties can still generate significant positive free cash flow. This is especially pertinent during periods of high and persistent inflation like we've experienced over the last few years. Rising development expenditures and labor expenses effectively raises the global oil supply cost curve. Thus, for operators to hit the same pre-inflationary return targets, they would need higher commodity prices. In other words, operators are constantly fighting a battle where cost inflation diminishes their returns and less commodity prices eventually rise commensurately. However, from the royalty owners perspective, higher upstream development costs do not directly impact our economics. Over the long term, as commodity prices potentially reset higher in response to a structurally higher global supply cost curve, then royalty owners capture the incremental revenue upside without bearing the burden of higher expenses. As we've discussed many times before, over the years, we've actively searched for external assets that look like TPL across surface water and royalties. On the royalty side, specifically, TPL is well positioned to consolidate a vast opportunity set of Permian Minerals and Royalties. Our current royalty position of 500,000 gross royalty acres provides unique advantages spanning across both the Midland and Delaware portions of the Permian Basin. With our industry-leading actively managed surface and water business, we have developed deep relationships with virtually every upstream, midstream and water operator as well as land and mineral estate owners across the basin, giving TPL unique access to off-market packages and extensive intel [ph] on development patterns. For potential mineral and royalty acquisitions, we evaluate each package with a bottoms-up intrinsic value approach. The goal with any acquisition is to generate at least double-digit IRRs on invested capital and to generate increased long-term free cash flow per share. Because TPL already owns great assets, we have no interest in diluting down our asset quality, our growth prospects or our unique business model. Any asset acquisition has to enhance the quality of our overall asset portfolio. It has to augment our growth runway. It has to support our high-margin capital life business model and ultimately, it has to increase TPL's intrinsic value per share. To this end, we employ an excellent team across M&A, reservoir engineering, GIS and minerals and royalties management, all with extensive industry experience. We have internally developed robust technology-driven data management systems that allow us to efficiently process, monitor and manage our mineral and royalty assets, which means we can roll out mineral and royalty assets in a very efficient manner without a proportionate increase in costs. The opportunity set for minerals and royalties is quite large. Although TPL's royalty acreage overlaps with some of the highest quality subregions in the Permian, there is still plenty of opportunity to consolidate royalties, both within our existing acreage footprint, but also within other Permian subregions that also contain excellent resource quality. Just within our existing asset footprint, we can buy royalties that are literally identical to what we already own. For example, in our core Texas Northern Delaware acreage, our typical royalty interest for a 1 mile by 1 mile section is generally 116th [ph] or 6.25%. With well laterals today typically extending out to 2 miles, a common drilling section unit or DSU is generally comprised of 2 adjacent sections. Thus for a 2-mile well lateral, our section would be one half of that DSU. So our net revenue interest in that would be one half of 6.25%, resulting in a net revenue interest of 3.125%. In the state of Texas, where the vast majority of mineral and royalty rights are privately owned, the total aggregate mineral and royalty interest is generally 25%. TPL's average net revenue interest across our entire portfolio is likely between 1% and 2%, which means that the other 23 or so percent are held by third parties. In other words, just on the DSUs that overlap with existing TPL royalty acreage, third-party ownership of those minerals and royalties is approximately 10 times TPL's net ownership. Looking beyond our current royalty footprint on the Midland side of the Permian, TPL's royalty position is much more fragmented with much smaller net revenue interest compared to our Texas Northern Delaware footprint. There are numerous subregions within the Midland that contains superb shale reserves where TPL does not have a meaningful position and adding resources here could be just as lucrative and high quality as our current portfolio. On the Delaware side, TPL's core Texas Northern Delaware royalty position stopped at the state line of Texas and New Mexico. Arguably the biggest and most lucrative wells in TPL's portfolio reside in this region. However, the excellent geology that lies under our Texas position extends well into New Mexico, where TPL does not currently own royalties. The resource quality on the New Mexico side is every bit as good as the Texas side and the rock there is widely considered some of the absolute best shale reserves found anywhere in North America, potentially adding mineral and royalty resources there would further high-grade our current royalty position. One last way to contemplate the sheer size of the overall consolidation opportunities to consider that the Permian currently produces north of 6 million barrels of crude oil per day. Assuming that the aggregate mineral and royalty interest held by third parties is around 20% across Texas and New Mexico and excluding production on federal and state lands would imply that roughly 1 million barrels per day of crude oil production is held by private mineral and royalty owners. Contrast that with TPL's current net crude oil royalty production of approximately 11,000 barrels per day. In other words, TPL's royalty production, ourselves one of the largest royalty owners in the country still only represents a miniscule fraction of the total production accruing to mineral and royalty owners in the Permian. In summary, we believe Permian oil and gas royalties are some of the most attractive assets investors can own. The opportunity set to acquire high-quality mineral and royalty assets is immense. And with TPL's extensive network and deep relationships from our legacy royalty and surface ownership, we have a unique combination of off-market deal access, technical wherewithal and a fortress balance sheet to roll out Permian minerals and royalties that public equity investors would not otherwise have access to. As our current royalty and surface footprint is already a free cash flow machine and with plenty of runway for future growth, we can remain selective. We don't need to acquire anything to grow. Any M&A pursuits can be purely opportunistic. We can discerningly consolidate assets that will enhance the company's intrinsic value per share, and we can and will remain disciplined. This has been the same strategy we've deployed for years now, and it's one that has served TPL and our shareholders well. And now as the Permian has emerged as an unequivocally world-class resource basin, TPL has never been in a better position to beneficially exploit this tailwind in our own backyard. Finally, I want to give shareholders a heads up that TPL will be ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange next Monday, August 12. TPL common stock and its predecessor subshares from our trustees have been listed on the NYSE since June 27, 1888, making this our 136-year anniversary. We're told by the NYSE that TPL is their seventh longest listed company. This also comes off our recent inclusion into the S&P 400, which is another great milestone. There are not many companies that have had a history as long-standing or colorful as TPL. And even though TPL may be one of the oldest public companies in existence, there's still a lot to be excited about for our future. The enterprise today is as strong and as profitable as it's ever been. The opportunity set has never been greater, and the company is primed to last another 100-plus years. With that, I'll hand the call over to Chris. Yes, Nate, thanks for the question. I think on the source water side, 73% of our sales this quarter were off of our footprint outside of TPL's acreage. So that number continues to grow. We were over 70% last quarter as well. So the team has done a really good job of just expanding our reach, selling water further and further outside of our footprint. The team has also done a really good job of building additional storage and infrastructure that's allowing us to sell more barrels per day. And then I think just with simul-frac and trimul-frac, the volumes needed delivered to location are continuing to grow. And that's a real advantage for us because we're one of the few water service operators that have the ability to actually supply those kind of volumes. I think on the produced water side, we've had a few new tie-ins this quarter that brought some water in. But a lot of that additional volume is in areas where we have existing contracts. And so we're seeing some really robust activity in those areas where we've got some of those larger AMI style [ph] agreements that we've talked about in the past. And then with co completions, you're just -- you're seeing some lumpier volumes as well, and we're very well positioned to take those volumes. We've got a lot of active capacity, a lot of permitted capacity. And so there's definitely some room to grow from an infrastructure standpoint. And even though we don't operate that infrastructure, our BD and water teams do a great job of making sure we're working with our water midstream partners to make sure that additional capacity is available for operators in those areas to meet their needs and make sure we don't bottleneck. So I think it is sustainable. We've had a really strong first half of the year. I think we'll continue to see good pace of development. Back half of the year could be a little softer than the first half, but I think overall, we're setting up to have a really nice 2024, both on the source water and the produced water side. Yes. I mean I would say we're definitely more focused on deal quality than deal size. I mean, some deals are small enough. They're not worth the brain damage and your larger deals have less competition. But again, just to reinforce, we're focused more on deal quality than deal size. Yes. There was recently a 5.0 in Scurry County, which is a good way is probably 100 miles for many of our closest operations. So we haven't been affected by that one. Robert Crain is on the call. I'll kick that over to you, Robert, just to talk about some of the others that we've had and kind of how you view that in relation to our operations. Thanks, Nate. Good morning, Hamed. Thanks for the question. The Permian is a premier basin, but we're still seeing a lot of opportunity to acquire high-quality assets, like I talked about a little bit in the prepared remarks. A lot of those assets are within the same footprint that we already own a lot of times in the same DSU. And so that market is still very fragmented, and there are a lot of interest trading hands. So I think we'll continue to see a lot of opportunity on that front. And with the intelligence that we gained through our surface and water business and access to off-market deals, I think we've got an advantage on a lot of other buyers in the basin as well. Well, I think if I understand your question correctly, is there competition for wells being completed on our land. I think to answer that, the reason that we're selling more and more water off of our footprint is just to expand the business, capture more of the overall Permian market. So we're still sourcing a ton of completions and providing volumes on our land. We just continue to expand our infrastructure and network to sell more water off of our land, and that's how we've been able to capture more of the overall market to increase our overall daily production and sales, and that's why you're seeing the increase in revenue. And a big shout out to the team, the water team and the BD team, I think we started last year at roughly 50% of our sales were off of our footprint, and they've been able to grow that to 73% this quarter. So they've done a tremendous job there. Thanks, Hamed."

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Shawn Amini, Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Amini. You may begin. \nShawn Amini: Thank you for joining us today for Texas Pacific Land Corporation's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Yesterday afternoon, the company released its  financial results and filed its Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission which is available on the Investors section of the company's website at www.texaspacific.com. In addition, the company has posted an investor presentation that we will be referencing today. \n That presentation related to produce water desalination and beneficial reuse can be found in the Investors section of our website under Presentations. It is also posted under the Events section on our website, which can be accessed through the News & Media tab and then IR calendar.\n As a reminder,  remarks made on today's conference call may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. We do not undertake any obligation to update our forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. For a more detailed discussion of the factors that may affect the company's results, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings.\n During this call, we will also be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. More information and reconciliations about these non-GAAP financial measures are contained in our earnings release and SEC filings. Please also note, we may at times refer to our company by its stock ticker, TPL.\n This morning's conference call is hosted by TPL's Chief Executive Officer, Ty Glover; Executive Vice President of Texas Pacific Water Resources, Robert Crain and TPL's Chief Financial Officer, Chris Steddum. Management will make some prepared comments, after which we will open the call for questions. Now I will turn the call over to Ty. \nTyler Glover: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Driven by the continued strength of our surface-derived cash flows, our first quarter 2024 results are an excellent start to the year. \u201cWater Sales, Produced Water Royalties, and Easements and Other Surface-Related Income and aggregate had revenue growth of 19% sequential quarter-over-quarter, which totaled approximately $81 million and accounted for nearly 50% of total consolidated revenues. \n This was another especially great quarter for water sales as it generated $37 million of revenues, which was nearly a company record. Our source water asset footprint, combined with our excellent staff were able to push volumes throughout the Permian Basin with 72% of volumes occurring outside of TPL's surface acreage. Oil and gas royalty production of approximately 24,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day also represents strong performance. Our near-term inventory of permits and drilled but uncompleted wells remain at robust levels, which combined high activity levels on our water and surface assets indicates royalty production will continue to perform well. \n On capital allocation, the company and our board continue to evaluate all of our options as the business continues to generate considerable free cash flow and maintains a net cash position of $837 million. This affords us tremendous ability to drive value throughout the energy cycle. I do want to spend the majority of my time this morning talking about some exciting news for TPL. As Shawn mentioned, we posted a presentation relating to produced water desalination and beneficial reuse, and I will be referencing those slides. \n Our remarks today will serve 2 purposes. First, to give an update on our technology efforts related to produced water and second, to give an understanding of the state of the produced water market in the Permian today, the latter of which has been getting an increasing amount of attention throughout the industry. Starting with Slide 2, there are 2 components to what we announced yesterday. First, we have developed a promising new energy efficient method of produced water desalination. Although water desalination can be done today utilizing multiple methods and technologies, the challenge has always been doing so cost effectively. \n Desalinating produced water also presents some unique challenges compared to normal ocean or brine water. Over the last few years, our team has been studying a wide array of technologies, helping to find something that could work economically at scale in the oilfield. It may seem both simple, yet counterintuitive, but we wondered if we could leverage a process that happens every day in people's home, water turning into ice. We began to look more closely at this process, which is also referred to as fractional freezing. \n At first glance, it seemed nonsensical to make ice in a desert in West Texas. However, after running in-house experiments and further research, we pursued the idea in earnest. We reached out to a leading industrial technology and manufacturing firm located here in the United States. Over the course of a couple of years, we collaborated on various ideas and techniques. \n After eventually finding success with a prototype, we quickly constructed a small-scale test unit in TPL's R&D facility in Midland. That test trial was a success, and we are moving forward with a larger test facility capable of processing 10,000 produced water barrels per day with expansion potential to 20,000 barrels per day. \n The second aspect of our announcement relates to beneficial reuse. If we're able to desalinate produced water economically at scale, then it opens up a world of possibilities in terms of what to do with that water. We've been conducting detailed studies in our lab to understand whether desalinated produced water could be used to grow various crops and native grasses. Our lab has a greenhouse, which is pictured on this slide. \n Here, we use various local soils and native plants to understand the impact of utilizing fully desalinated and treated water. In addition to the extensive in-house testing and analytic capabilities, we have also partnered with leading research institutions specializing in water quality, soil and plant testing. We have another parallel beneficial reuse program underway, as we are exploring a discharge of desalinated and fully treated water into tributaries that feed into the Pecos River and potentially direct discharge to the surface for aquifer recharge. \n Across both of these beneficial reuse paths, we are working closely with regulators and have made significant progress with both permitting and stakeholder engagement. Robert Crain, who leads our water team will discuss these desalination and beneficial reuse initiatives in greater detail later on this call. Ultimately, if everything goes well, our intent is to bring large-scale produced water desalination solutions to the Permian Basin. \n TPL has created a subsidiary called Transmissive Water Services LLC to house our desalination and beneficial reuse efforts. Transmissive is a wholly owned subsidiary of Texas Pacific Water Resources, LLC, or TPWR, for short, which itself is a wholly owned subsidiary of TPL. We are currently in commercial negotiations with blue-chip upstream operators, as we move towards the next phase of constructing a larger desalination test facility. \n Interest has been incredibly high, as oil and gas operators understand how critical this type of technology is to keep the Permian oil and gas machine going. This first 10,000 barrel per day facility, which we refer to as Phase 2, will cost approximately $20 million on a 100% basis, though our aim is to offset a substantial amount of TPL capital costs with any commercial arrangement. Longer term, our intent and desire is to structure commercial arrangements that align with TPL's ongoing business principles of high-margin capital-light cash flows. \n We've had tremendous success with that model in the past, as our team was able to turn TPL's raw surface acreage ownership into a business that last year collectively generated over $250 million of high-margin revenue. So we have the proven track record. Sure our desalination technology and beneficial reuse advances get to a point where we can help launch a large-scale build-out throughout the Permian Basin. I'm confident in our ability to execute agreements and strategic partnerships in a manner that generates significant shareholder value. \n Turning to Slide 3, titled Produced Water Overview. These next couple of slides are for the benefit of current and prospective investors that may not be completely apprised at the state of the Permian produced water market, but I'd like to provide additional context around what TPL is trying to solve. The term produced water refers to the water that is a co-product from a producing oil and gas well. This water has very high salinity levels and contains oil and suspended solids and heavy metals. Because untreated produced water is not safe for crop irrigation or municipal use, there are 2 methods in which the industry deals with it. \n The most common method is to reinject produced water back subsurface. For many years, the water was injected into subsurface formations, either above or below oil-bearing shale formations. Due to the high levels of development activity and high water cuts experienced in the Permian Basin, the industry has begun to experience constraints concerning traditional disposal into both of these zones. \n The high volumes of deep formation injection is expected to cause seismicity in local areas, as injected water can find its way into natural faults. The Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the oil and gas industry in Texas, has responded by instituting numerous seismic response areas, or SRAs, in certain regions. These SRAs have put restrictions on how much water can be injected. The industry has since pivoted to injections strictly targeting the shallower formations hoping to avoid some of the faulting issues. \n Although injection into shallow formations does work, it presents additional complexity for upstream operators who plan to develop overlapping oil and gas acreage, which they would now potentially be drilling through a more highly pressured zone. The other common solution for produced water today is to reuse or recycle that water for oil and gas completion activities, otherwise known as fracking. \n Upstream operators can use raw produced or lightly treated produced water to complete new wells. However, given the sheer amount of produced water volumes that come from the Permian, even if operators were to use only produced water in their completion activities, the Permian could still have north of 10 million barrels of produced water that would need to find a home. \n Turning to Slide 4. The Permian is recognized as an oil and gas powerhouse. Oil production today is over 6 million barrels per day, which is more than other well-known oil-producing nations such as Iraq, Iran and Kuwait. However, 1 unique aspect of the Permian is its relatively high water-to-oil ratio. The Delaware side of the Permian has an especially high water to oil ratio of nearly 4x. Despite the high water cuts, robust drilling economics in the Delaware has driven a strong ramp in activity, which has generated a commensurate increase in produced water. \n Today, the industry is finding it increasingly difficult to handle all of this water. Given TPL's long-standing actively managed vertically integrated water business, this is a dynamic that we've seen coming for quite some time now. Over the last few years, we actively sought to increase our capabilities across every aspect of produced water solutions. This is why we began investing so much effort into desalination R&D years ago. \n We've also significantly increased our treatment capacity for traditional produced water reuse. And finally, we've made a concerted effort to increase our pore space ownership. Through various bolt-ons, we managed to purchase surface and subsurface pore space easements totaling over 100,000 acres. The pore space we've acquired, combined with our legacy surface position is critical in providing long-term solutions for produced water. \n In evaluating surface acreage to acquire, we often perform extensive pore space due diligence across attributes such as capacity, formation pressures and fault and seismic mapping. Although we are well positioned to facilitate traditional produced water injection for years to come, we knew the industry needed additional solutions. There's still a lot of work and testing to be done with our emerging technology so we are encouraged and excited with what we've seen so far. \n As we presented our technology to potential partners, customers and regulators, the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. We've received immense interest from operators to deploy the test facility near their development areas, not just in the Permian, but also in other major oil and gas basins in the U.S. I'm extremely proud of the team here for their innovation, dedication and talent and their efforts will be critical in sustaining the positive momentum of Permian development over the long term. With that, I will turn the call over to Robert. \nRobert Crain: Thanks, Ty. For those of you that don't know me, I run TPWR. I joined TPL in 2017 and Ty recruited me to help build out TPL's nascent water business. Prior to TPL, I led water resource development efforts for EOG Resources across multiple basins, including the Permian and Eagle Ford, excited to be here today and talk about water. \n Turning to Slide 5, I'll provide an overview of our technology, our targets for desalinization and results to date. As Ty described, we teamed up with a top-tier technology and manufacturing partner that specializes in industrial refrigeration and freezing, where they serve clients across food services, industrial temperature control and nuclear power plants. TPL collaborated with this technology partner to develop a thermal system specifically designed for produced water desalination. \n While our partner retains the patents on the equipment, TPL has the exclusive rights for the equipment used towards produced water applications. In addition, TPL has filed for a process patent, utilizing fractional freeze desalination to treat produced water for beneficial reuse. There are a couple of other competing desalinization technologies on the market today, with many of them focused on heat distillation. Heat distillation can require a temperature change of 120 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit and additional energy to condense the vapor back into liquid form. \n However, our freeze technology uses less energy, as it recovers heat from the incoming produced water and requires temperature change at a fraction of what is required for heat distillation. With our current R&D test unit, we've been running extensive optimization testing, as we closely monitor time spent and pull down in freezing, the progression of ice formation, salinity reduction, anion and cation reduction and energy efficiency among other factors. We had power meters installed at basically every step, so we knew how much power is being used by each piece of equipment. \n We have a better understanding of the various trade-offs such as higher pressure and higher analyte production or reduced power consumption. We have gained a lot of valuable insights that we can now apply as we look to scale up and enhance our next unit. We have a target matrix that we call 75 cube. This represents our high-level goals for desalination. First, it is a 75% volume reclamation, which means if we take 100 barrels of produced water, we can churn out 75 barrels of fully desalinated and treated water. \n But we believe we're well on target to achieve this goal. The second goal is a 75% reduction in analytes. Here, our goal is to remove analytes of concern. Our desalination technology is not just about freezing, rather it's a series of processes as we seek to create a very pure water. Again, we have already far exceeded this goal. And truly, our goal is to treat water not just to meet every regulatory parameter, but to exceed it. The final element of 75 cube is a $0.75 per barrel treatment cost. This is where we have the most work left. \n The biggest operating expense item of any desalinization is energy consumption. As mentioned earlier, we are metering every aspect of our equipment and process. We're working hard to find efficiencies. In addition, we continue to work with the utilities and developers as we seek options and novel solutions for electricity prices. Given the abundance of renewable power of natural gas prices that are negative at times in West Texas, we think we can find creative answers to bring our power cost down. \n We hope with this upcoming Phase 2, 10,000 barrel per day facility that we can make further process optimization and cost improvements. At $0.75 per barrel cost in desalinated high-spec water, we believe our technology becomes economically cost competitive and environmentally superior versus traditional subsurface injection. Our desalinization process produces excellent water quality along the most important parameters. Almost all semi volatile organic compounds, SVOCs, and volatile organic compounds, VOCs are reduced well below the maximum containment levels. \n We have reduced PFAS, radionuclides and metals to trivial levels. In addition, we are working with premier research institutions to examine water analytes that are not traditionally tested. Our goal isn't just to meet the regulatory requirements, we want to exceed across every possible parameter that can be measured and tested. We are striving for the absolute best quality fresh water we can achieve. Turning to Slide 6, where I'll talk about our progress with beneficial reuse. \n There are multiple aspects our beneficial reuse endeavors. First is our greenhouse pilot. This pilot was used to test discharge and irrigation potential for various native plants. In our Midland Yard, we built a greenhouse where we gathered local soils from Loving and Reeves Counties, and then we planted various native plants in Alfalfa. We're working with New Mexico State University, which has 1 of the premier labs and research facilities for plant and soil testing. The results from this pilot have been very positive. Data from this pilot was used for railroad commission, land application permit. And TPL was granted the first permit in the state in February of this year. \n With that permit, TPL is expanding the facility to include an outdoor field of Alfalfa to study the effects in the natural environment. That outdoor plot is currently under construction. TPL will share water, soil and plant data from the Greenhouse pilot with regulatory agencies, operators and universities to help the industry further develop standards and beneficial reuse technologies. Lastly, we have applied for a Texas Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, otherwise referred to as the TCEQ. \n This permit relates to discharging treated desalinated produced water and to tributaries in the upper region of the Pecos River. Given our multistep desalinization process produces high-spec freshwater, we will add that salt and alkalinity to match the Pecos River water quality. We will utilize a batch relief system to thoroughly analyze all water prior to environmental release. TPL's priority is to go above and beyond the standard environmental assessment to assure safety and longevity of the project. \n Now turning to Slide 7 for an environmental and regulatory overview, I've already discussed the latest on our regulatory efforts for the last couple of slides, but I'll just reiterate that TPL is committed to the highest standards of environmental stewardship. \n Our goal is to not just meet the regulatory standards, but to exceed it. As many of you know, TPL owns nearly 1 million surface acres and to surface owners, we have every incentive to maintain and enhance the environmental quality of our acreage. We consider our surface to be extremely valuable, and we've always managed our surface assets to preserve a sustainability attributes for future generation. \n Now turning to Slide 8 for our key milestones accomplished to date and further time line. We've talked a lot about the progress we've made already. We successfully tested a pilot multistep desalinization system. We've made significant headway on the beneficial reuse and regulatory efforts. In terms of our near-term priorities, we are working to move forward with a larger 10,000 barrel per day test facility and to execute 1 or more commercial agreements. We have begun equipment procurement. The facility is expected to cost approximately $20 million on a 100% basis. So our aim is to offset costs with any commercial arrangement. \n Longer term, should the next test facility prove successful, then we would move toward Phase 3, which is the development of a large-scale 100,000 barrel per day facility. With demand for produced water desalination of potentially millions of barrels per day, widespread desalination adoption would require significant investment from the industry. \n If we get to that point, it will very likely require additional commercial arrangements as we do not intend for TPL to be primarily responsible for self-funding and developing this infrastructure. Although the exact commercial arrangements remain to be seen, we have a successful track record of executing contracts that ultimately provide TPL with a very valuable high-margin capital-wide cash flow stream. That said, we have a lot of work to do before we get there. \n We still need to build this initial Phase 2 facility. We have a lot of engineering and technical work ahead of us. We need to keep driving costs down. We have to execute on our various beneficial reuse endeavors. We're very excited with our progress so far. The team here is working incredibly hard. The Permian needs to find a solution for produced water, and I believe TPL is going to play a key role in that future. With that, I will hand the call over to Chris. \nChris Steddum: Thanks, Robert. Consolidated revenues during the first quarter of 2024 were approximately $174 million, representing 4% sequential quarter-over-quarter growth. Adjusted EBITDA was $152 million and free cash flow was $115 million for the first quarter. Free cash flow for the quarter grew 30% on a year-over-year basis, driven by higher royalty production, source water sales, produced water royalties and easements and other surface related income and partially offset by lower natural gas and NGL prices. \n Weak Waha natural gas prices have negatively impacted the natural gas realizations in March and April of this year. We do expect low Waha prices in second quarter 2024 to continue putting downward pressure on gas realizations, though we expect this to be somewhat mitigated by the stronger realizations that super major and large independent operators generally receive. Our realizations on oil continue to be very strong, generally at 100% of WTI Cushing. \n Our near-term well inventory remains elevated relative to historical levels. At the end of the quarter, we had 5.1 net permitted wells, 10.3 net drilled but uncompleted wells and 2.2 net completed, not yet producing wells. This near-term inventory gives us confidence that our royalty production remains on a growth trend. To conclude, TPL is in an enviable position today. \n Our balance sheet is the strongest it's ever been. We still maintain top-tier cash flow and profitability margins. Today's disclosure of our efforts with produced water desalination is a great testament to the team and to the multiple elements of upside the business has with its unique surface ownership. TPL continues to generate substantial free cash flow, and we are in the excellent position to drive value. And with that, operator, we will now take questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes to the line of Hamed Khorsand with BWS Financial. \nHamed Khorsand: First off, I just wanted to ask about your water desalination. What is the reason to highlight it now? Is it the scientific breakthrough or do you think you're at a point where you can get revenue soon? Or is it really just to let investors know about the CapEx that's required going forward? \nRobert Crain: This is Robert. Thank you for the question. I think it's a combination of everything you just said. It is a capital investment, and we felt it prudent to let investors know and shareholders know that it is -- for now, it's a $20 million investment. While we're looking to offset that, TPL will have some capital burden in the near term. \n Additionally, the talk of water in the Permian is another reason and the press that we've been getting on our technology. We've played a very heavy focus on the regulatory front and also on the institutional research front, and we thought it prudent at this time to announce. \nHamed Khorsand: And then as far as water sales is concerned, do you think this is a sustainable level? I mean last year, you had a record number, but it sounded like it was onetime related. Is this more sustainable? \nTyler Glover: Well, I think second quarter of last year was a record quarter for water sales, and we were right there close this quarter. And looking at the sales schedule for second quarter this year, we've got some really strong numbers on the schedule, a lot of wells to be completed. So I think we will continue to put up strong numbers on that front. \nHamed Khorsand: Okay. And last question here is that could you just talk about what your expectations here are with the capital you're adding on to the balance sheet? Is it just focused on the water business that you're now expanding into the technology. There was a Reuters article this past week about OXY looking to sell some land. What are your intentions here? \nTyler Glover: I think our general capital allocation thoughts are really still kind of unchanged from what we talked about during the last earnings call. Certainly, we continue to look and different opportunities are available. It's a constant topic of discussion between management and the board. \n And right now, we're happy with kind of the direction and where that cash is. But it's certainly something that is always a topic. And we're always looking for the best way to deploy that capital when the opportunity arises. \nOperator: Next question comes from the line of John Annis with Stifel. \nJohn Annis: I wanted to focus in on the announcement of your desalination and beneficial reuse efforts, which is really exciting stuff and timely given the growing sensitivities around impacts of oil and gas development in the Permian. To start -- and I apologize in advance for a dense question, but I wanted to try to get a better understanding of the beneficial reuse market and how the value chain works? With the freshwater that's produced from your process, can you talk more about the potential end markets, the size of those markets? Any green incentives that you would be eligible for and any potential applications for your process outside of the oil and gas industry? \nRobert Crain: Sure. This is Robert. I'll take that. There's been a lot of discussion on the beneficial analytes, and any downstream revenues that could come from the distillate water of beneficial reuse technologies. I think they're still emerging. There's a lot of discussion on hydrogen beneficial analytes such as lithium, water rights retention once this water is reintroduced. As those develop, our kind of marching orders was develop a technology and structure a commercial model that stand on its own legs. \n Anything that comes from a downstream revenue perspective will be great, and it will further help the economics of beneficial reuse. But when we look at it right now, we had to develop a treatment technology and a commercial model that fits within the upstream economics. \nJohn Annis: Got it. And then with the $0.75 per barrel treatment costs you provided in the presentation, you mentioned that it becomes competitive with subsurface injection, is that expectation based on the ongoing discussions you're having with customers? And then more broadly, how do you envision those commercial agreements for monetizing the water working? \nRobert Crain: We don't have a firm commercial structure in place. I think this is a new concept for the industry in general. And beneficial reuse is going to be at a higher price per barrel than traditional injection. But it still has to be economic in the sense that it incentivizes the drill bit to continue to turn. The commercial model and the structure of it is still being developed. We're in talks right now with operators what that looks like. \n I think it's going to be a blend at least for TPL. It will be a blend of the traditional water midstream pricing and how we structure TPR from the get-go. TPW and our capital-light [indiscernible] business, we were able to leverage our surface acreage to not have to take the traditional role of water midstream. So our role in that commercial model, I think, is going to be a blend of the two. \nJohn Annis: Makes sense. Then I wanted to understand more about the operational complexities as you scale. What, in your view, are the biggest hurdles or technical challenges as you move from a larger pilot and then ultimately to a commercial scale facility? \nRobert Crain: I think the regulatory piece is initially presenting some hurdles that we've tackled. And I think we're getting over. As we look at any beneficial reuse technology, energy consumption is 75% to 80% of the OpEx of any piece of it. And it's what we mentioned in the talk earlier, continuing to drive down cost on the energy perspective. \n It's why we went with this technology, but that's what -- that's the most work and complexity that we still have to do is be in that energy does take up so much of that OpEx cost is ensuring that we can find an alternative energy source to come in line with those projected OpEx costs. \nJohn Annis: Great. And then shifting back to your core businesses. You were able to achieve significant quarter-over-quarter revenue growth in water. Can you talk more about what drove that growth? And are you seeing any tailwinds on source water demand just with the increase of simul frac development across industry that are generally more water-intensive. \nTyler Glover: Yes. We definitely are seeing some tailwind from simul fracs. Just the volume of water needed delivered to pad per day for those fracs is enormous. And I think the scale that we've built our business to is a huge competitive advantage for us. There's just not a lot of water providers that can provide those kind of volumes, with as far a reach as we have across the basin, especially on the Delaware side. \n So I think there's a lot of factors that are giving strength to that part of the business. Obviously, our BaaS surface footprint and the ability to move water further than other competitors is 1 of those as well. But I think we're going to continue to see strength in that business. And just -- I think the important thing to remember about our water business as well as is we're involved in source water sales for completions. \n We're involved in reuse and treatment. We've got pore space or produced water disposal and now with this beneficial reuse technology that we're working on. We're really setting the company up to be a leader across the water industry as a whole. So no matter which way that aspect of the industry moves, I think TPL is well positioned to continue to gain market share across the board. \nJohn Annis: Terrific. And for my last one, on the governance front, you recently announced the formation of a strategic acquisition committee as a standing committee of the Board. Would this mean that M&A will be a board-led rather than management-led decision? I'm just trying to understand how that dynamic will work. \nTyler Glover: Yes. We've had an ad hoc acquisition committee in the past just to kind of bet projects that management is working on before we take it to the full Board and make sure that we've got buy-in from that committee. So this is just kind of formalizing that with a standing committee. So it gives management the opportunity to vet new projects, get some feedback before we take it to the full Board. So that's the purpose of the committee. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thanks, Robert. Consolidated revenues during the first quarter of 2024 were approximately $174 million, representing 4% sequential quarter-over-quarter growth. Adjusted EBITDA was $152 million and free cash flow was $115 million for the first quarter. Free cash flow for the quarter grew 30% on a year-over-year basis, driven by higher royalty production, source water sales, produced water royalties and easements and other surface related income and partially offset by lower natural gas and NGL prices. \n Weak Waha natural gas prices have negatively impacted the natural gas realizations in March and April of this year. We do expect low Waha prices in second quarter 2024 to continue putting downward pressure on gas realizations, though we expect this to be somewhat mitigated by the stronger realizations that super major and large independent operators generally receive. Our realizations on oil continue to be very strong, generally at 100% of WTI Cushing. \n Our near-term well inventory remains elevated relative to historical levels. At the end of the quarter, we had 5.1 net permitted wells, 10.3 net drilled but uncompleted wells and 2.2 net completed, not yet producing wells. This near-term inventory gives us confidence that our royalty production remains on a growth trend. To conclude, TPL is in an enviable position today. \n Our balance sheet is the strongest it's ever been. We still maintain top-tier cash flow and profitability margins. Today's disclosure of our efforts with produced water desalination is a great testament to the team and to the multiple elements of upside the business has with its unique surface ownership. TPL continues to generate substantial free cash flow, and we are in the excellent position to drive value. And with that, operator, we will now take questions."

            "name": "Robert Crain",
            "content": "Thanks, Ty. For those of you that don't know me, I run TPWR. I joined TPL in 2017 and Ty recruited me to help build out TPL's nascent water business. Prior to TPL, I led water resource development efforts for EOG Resources across multiple basins, including the Permian and Eagle Ford, excited to be here today and talk about water. \n Turning to Slide 5, I'll provide an overview of our technology, our targets for desalinization and results to date. As Ty described, we teamed up with a top-tier technology and manufacturing partner that specializes in industrial refrigeration and freezing, where they serve clients across food services, industrial temperature control and nuclear power plants. TPL collaborated with this technology partner to develop a thermal system specifically designed for produced water desalination. \n While our partner retains the patents on the equipment, TPL has the exclusive rights for the equipment used towards produced water applications. In addition, TPL has filed for a process patent, utilizing fractional freeze desalination to treat produced water for beneficial reuse. There are a couple of other competing desalinization technologies on the market today, with many of them focused on heat distillation. Heat distillation can require a temperature change of 120 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit and additional energy to condense the vapor back into liquid form. \n However, our freeze technology uses less energy, as it recovers heat from the incoming produced water and requires temperature change at a fraction of what is required for heat distillation. With our current R&D test unit, we've been running extensive optimization testing, as we closely monitor time spent and pull down in freezing, the progression of ice formation, salinity reduction, anion and cation reduction and energy efficiency among other factors. We had power meters installed at basically every step, so we knew how much power is being used by each piece of equipment. \n We have a better understanding of the various trade-offs such as higher pressure and higher analyte production or reduced power consumption. We have gained a lot of valuable insights that we can now apply as we look to scale up and enhance our next unit. We have a target matrix that we call 75 cube. This represents our high-level goals for desalination. First, it is a 75% volume reclamation, which means if we take 100 barrels of produced water, we can churn out 75 barrels of fully desalinated and treated water. \n But we believe we're well on target to achieve this goal. The second goal is a 75% reduction in analytes. Here, our goal is to remove analytes of concern. Our desalination technology is not just about freezing, rather it's a series of processes as we seek to create a very pure water. Again, we have already far exceeded this goal. And truly, our goal is to treat water not just to meet every regulatory parameter, but to exceed it. The final element of 75 cube is a $0.75 per barrel treatment cost. This is where we have the most work left. \n The biggest operating expense item of any desalinization is energy consumption. As mentioned earlier, we are metering every aspect of our equipment and process. We're working hard to find efficiencies. In addition, we continue to work with the utilities and developers as we seek options and novel solutions for electricity prices. Given the abundance of renewable power of natural gas prices that are negative at times in West Texas, we think we can find creative answers to bring our power cost down. \n We hope with this upcoming Phase 2, 10,000 barrel per day facility that we can make further process optimization and cost improvements. At $0.75 per barrel cost in desalinated high-spec water, we believe our technology becomes economically cost competitive and environmentally superior versus traditional subsurface injection. Our desalinization process produces excellent water quality along the most important parameters. Almost all semi volatile organic compounds, SVOCs, and volatile organic compounds, VOCs are reduced well below the maximum containment levels. \n We have reduced PFAS, radionuclides and metals to trivial levels. In addition, we are working with premier research institutions to examine water analytes that are not traditionally tested. Our goal isn't just to meet the regulatory requirements, we want to exceed across every possible parameter that can be measured and tested. We are striving for the absolute best quality fresh water we can achieve. Turning to Slide 6, where I'll talk about our progress with beneficial reuse. \n There are multiple aspects our beneficial reuse endeavors. First is our greenhouse pilot. This pilot was used to test discharge and irrigation potential for various native plants. In our Midland Yard, we built a greenhouse where we gathered local soils from Loving and Reeves Counties, and then we planted various native plants in Alfalfa. We're working with New Mexico State University, which has 1 of the premier labs and research facilities for plant and soil testing. The results from this pilot have been very positive. Data from this pilot was used for railroad commission, land application permit. And TPL was granted the first permit in the state in February of this year. \n With that permit, TPL is expanding the facility to include an outdoor field of Alfalfa to study the effects in the natural environment. That outdoor plot is currently under construction. TPL will share water, soil and plant data from the Greenhouse pilot with regulatory agencies, operators and universities to help the industry further develop standards and beneficial reuse technologies. Lastly, we have applied for a Texas Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, otherwise referred to as the TCEQ. \n This permit relates to discharging treated desalinated produced water and to tributaries in the upper region of the Pecos River. Given our multistep desalinization process produces high-spec freshwater, we will add that salt and alkalinity to match the Pecos River water quality. We will utilize a batch relief system to thoroughly analyze all water prior to environmental release. TPL's priority is to go above and beyond the standard environmental assessment to assure safety and longevity of the project. \n Now turning to Slide 7 for an environmental and regulatory overview, I've already discussed the latest on our regulatory efforts for the last couple of slides, but I'll just reiterate that TPL is committed to the highest standards of environmental stewardship. \n Our goal is to not just meet the regulatory standards, but to exceed it. As many of you know, TPL owns nearly 1 million surface acres and to surface owners, we have every incentive to maintain and enhance the environmental quality of our acreage. We consider our surface to be extremely valuable, and we've always managed our surface assets to preserve a sustainability attributes for future generation. \n Now turning to Slide 8 for our key milestones accomplished to date and further time line. We've talked a lot about the progress we've made already. We successfully tested a pilot multistep desalinization system. We've made significant headway on the beneficial reuse and regulatory efforts. In terms of our near-term priorities, we are working to move forward with a larger 10,000 barrel per day test facility and to execute 1 or more commercial agreements. We have begun equipment procurement. The facility is expected to cost approximately $20 million on a 100% basis. So our aim is to offset costs with any commercial arrangement. \n Longer term, should the next test facility prove successful, then we would move toward Phase 3, which is the development of a large-scale 100,000 barrel per day facility. With demand for produced water desalination of potentially millions of barrels per day, widespread desalination adoption would require significant investment from the industry. \n If we get to that point, it will very likely require additional commercial arrangements as we do not intend for TPL to be primarily responsible for self-funding and developing this infrastructure. Although the exact commercial arrangements remain to be seen, we have a successful track record of executing contracts that ultimately provide TPL with a very valuable high-margin capital-wide cash flow stream. That said, we have a lot of work to do before we get there. \n We still need to build this initial Phase 2 facility. We have a lot of engineering and technical work ahead of us. We need to keep driving costs down. We have to execute on our various beneficial reuse endeavors. We're very excited with our progress so far. The team here is working incredibly hard. The Permian needs to find a solution for produced water, and I believe TPL is going to play a key role in that future. With that, I will hand the call over to Chris. This is Robert. Thank you for the question. I think it's a combination of everything you just said. It is a capital investment, and we felt it prudent to let investors know and shareholders know that it is -- for now, it's a $20 million investment. While we're looking to offset that, TPL will have some capital burden in the near term. \n Additionally, the talk of water in the Permian is another reason and the press that we've been getting on our technology. We've played a very heavy focus on the regulatory front and also on the institutional research front, and we thought it prudent at this time to announce. Sure. This is Robert. I'll take that. There's been a lot of discussion on the beneficial analytes, and any downstream revenues that could come from the distillate water of beneficial reuse technologies. I think they're still emerging. There's a lot of discussion on hydrogen beneficial analytes such as lithium, water rights retention once this water is reintroduced. As those develop, our kind of marching orders was develop a technology and structure a commercial model that stand on its own legs. \n Anything that comes from a downstream revenue perspective will be great, and it will further help the economics of beneficial reuse. But when we look at it right now, we had to develop a treatment technology and a commercial model that fits within the upstream economics. We don't have a firm commercial structure in place. I think this is a new concept for the industry in general. And beneficial reuse is going to be at a higher price per barrel than traditional injection. But it still has to be economic in the sense that it incentivizes the drill bit to continue to turn. The commercial model and the structure of it is still being developed. We're in talks right now with operators what that looks like. \n I think it's going to be a blend at least for TPL. It will be a blend of the traditional water midstream pricing and how we structure TPR from the get-go. TPW and our capital-light [indiscernible] business, we were able to leverage our surface acreage to not have to take the traditional role of water midstream. So our role in that commercial model, I think, is going to be a blend of the two. I think the regulatory piece is initially presenting some hurdles that we've tackled. And I think we're getting over. As we look at any beneficial reuse technology, energy consumption is 75% to 80% of the OpEx of any piece of it. And it's what we mentioned in the talk earlier, continuing to drive down cost on the energy perspective. \n It's why we went with this technology, but that's what -- that's the most work and complexity that we still have to do is be in that energy does take up so much of that OpEx cost is ensuring that we can find an alternative energy source to come in line with those projected OpEx costs."

            "name": "Tyler Glover",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Driven by the continued strength of our surface-derived cash flows, our first quarter 2024 results are an excellent start to the year. \u201cWater Sales, Produced Water Royalties, and Easements and Other Surface-Related Income and aggregate had revenue growth of 19% sequential quarter-over-quarter, which totaled approximately $81 million and accounted for nearly 50% of total consolidated revenues. \n This was another especially great quarter for water sales as it generated $37 million of revenues, which was nearly a company record. Our source water asset footprint, combined with our excellent staff were able to push volumes throughout the Permian Basin with 72% of volumes occurring outside of TPL's surface acreage. Oil and gas royalty production of approximately 24,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day also represents strong performance. Our near-term inventory of permits and drilled but uncompleted wells remain at robust levels, which combined high activity levels on our water and surface assets indicates royalty production will continue to perform well. \n On capital allocation, the company and our board continue to evaluate all of our options as the business continues to generate considerable free cash flow and maintains a net cash position of $837 million. This affords us tremendous ability to drive value throughout the energy cycle. I do want to spend the majority of my time this morning talking about some exciting news for TPL. As Shawn mentioned, we posted a presentation relating to produced water desalination and beneficial reuse, and I will be referencing those slides. \n Our remarks today will serve 2 purposes. First, to give an update on our technology efforts related to produced water and second, to give an understanding of the state of the produced water market in the Permian today, the latter of which has been getting an increasing amount of attention throughout the industry. Starting with Slide 2, there are 2 components to what we announced yesterday. First, we have developed a promising new energy efficient method of produced water desalination. Although water desalination can be done today utilizing multiple methods and technologies, the challenge has always been doing so cost effectively. \n Desalinating produced water also presents some unique challenges compared to normal ocean or brine water. Over the last few years, our team has been studying a wide array of technologies, helping to find something that could work economically at scale in the oilfield. It may seem both simple, yet counterintuitive, but we wondered if we could leverage a process that happens every day in people's home, water turning into ice. We began to look more closely at this process, which is also referred to as fractional freezing. \n At first glance, it seemed nonsensical to make ice in a desert in West Texas. However, after running in-house experiments and further research, we pursued the idea in earnest. We reached out to a leading industrial technology and manufacturing firm located here in the United States. Over the course of a couple of years, we collaborated on various ideas and techniques. \n After eventually finding success with a prototype, we quickly constructed a small-scale test unit in TPL's R&D facility in Midland. That test trial was a success, and we are moving forward with a larger test facility capable of processing 10,000 produced water barrels per day with expansion potential to 20,000 barrels per day. \n The second aspect of our announcement relates to beneficial reuse. If we're able to desalinate produced water economically at scale, then it opens up a world of possibilities in terms of what to do with that water. We've been conducting detailed studies in our lab to understand whether desalinated produced water could be used to grow various crops and native grasses. Our lab has a greenhouse, which is pictured on this slide. \n Here, we use various local soils and native plants to understand the impact of utilizing fully desalinated and treated water. In addition to the extensive in-house testing and analytic capabilities, we have also partnered with leading research institutions specializing in water quality, soil and plant testing. We have another parallel beneficial reuse program underway, as we are exploring a discharge of desalinated and fully treated water into tributaries that feed into the Pecos River and potentially direct discharge to the surface for aquifer recharge. \n Across both of these beneficial reuse paths, we are working closely with regulators and have made significant progress with both permitting and stakeholder engagement. Robert Crain, who leads our water team will discuss these desalination and beneficial reuse initiatives in greater detail later on this call. Ultimately, if everything goes well, our intent is to bring large-scale produced water desalination solutions to the Permian Basin. \n TPL has created a subsidiary called Transmissive Water Services LLC to house our desalination and beneficial reuse efforts. Transmissive is a wholly owned subsidiary of Texas Pacific Water Resources, LLC, or TPWR, for short, which itself is a wholly owned subsidiary of TPL. We are currently in commercial negotiations with blue-chip upstream operators, as we move towards the next phase of constructing a larger desalination test facility. \n Interest has been incredibly high, as oil and gas operators understand how critical this type of technology is to keep the Permian oil and gas machine going. This first 10,000 barrel per day facility, which we refer to as Phase 2, will cost approximately $20 million on a 100% basis, though our aim is to offset a substantial amount of TPL capital costs with any commercial arrangement. Longer term, our intent and desire is to structure commercial arrangements that align with TPL's ongoing business principles of high-margin capital-light cash flows. \n We've had tremendous success with that model in the past, as our team was able to turn TPL's raw surface acreage ownership into a business that last year collectively generated over $250 million of high-margin revenue. So we have the proven track record. Sure our desalination technology and beneficial reuse advances get to a point where we can help launch a large-scale build-out throughout the Permian Basin. I'm confident in our ability to execute agreements and strategic partnerships in a manner that generates significant shareholder value. \n Turning to Slide 3, titled Produced Water Overview. These next couple of slides are for the benefit of current and prospective investors that may not be completely apprised at the state of the Permian produced water market, but I'd like to provide additional context around what TPL is trying to solve. The term produced water refers to the water that is a co-product from a producing oil and gas well. This water has very high salinity levels and contains oil and suspended solids and heavy metals. Because untreated produced water is not safe for crop irrigation or municipal use, there are 2 methods in which the industry deals with it. \n The most common method is to reinject produced water back subsurface. For many years, the water was injected into subsurface formations, either above or below oil-bearing shale formations. Due to the high levels of development activity and high water cuts experienced in the Permian Basin, the industry has begun to experience constraints concerning traditional disposal into both of these zones. \n The high volumes of deep formation injection is expected to cause seismicity in local areas, as injected water can find its way into natural faults. The Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the oil and gas industry in Texas, has responded by instituting numerous seismic response areas, or SRAs, in certain regions. These SRAs have put restrictions on how much water can be injected. The industry has since pivoted to injections strictly targeting the shallower formations hoping to avoid some of the faulting issues. \n Although injection into shallow formations does work, it presents additional complexity for upstream operators who plan to develop overlapping oil and gas acreage, which they would now potentially be drilling through a more highly pressured zone. The other common solution for produced water today is to reuse or recycle that water for oil and gas completion activities, otherwise known as fracking. \n Upstream operators can use raw produced or lightly treated produced water to complete new wells. However, given the sheer amount of produced water volumes that come from the Permian, even if operators were to use only produced water in their completion activities, the Permian could still have north of 10 million barrels of produced water that would need to find a home. \n Turning to Slide 4. The Permian is recognized as an oil and gas powerhouse. Oil production today is over 6 million barrels per day, which is more than other well-known oil-producing nations such as Iraq, Iran and Kuwait. However, 1 unique aspect of the Permian is its relatively high water-to-oil ratio. The Delaware side of the Permian has an especially high water to oil ratio of nearly 4x. Despite the high water cuts, robust drilling economics in the Delaware has driven a strong ramp in activity, which has generated a commensurate increase in produced water. \n Today, the industry is finding it increasingly difficult to handle all of this water. Given TPL's long-standing actively managed vertically integrated water business, this is a dynamic that we've seen coming for quite some time now. Over the last few years, we actively sought to increase our capabilities across every aspect of produced water solutions. This is why we began investing so much effort into desalination R&D years ago. \n We've also significantly increased our treatment capacity for traditional produced water reuse. And finally, we've made a concerted effort to increase our pore space ownership. Through various bolt-ons, we managed to purchase surface and subsurface pore space easements totaling over 100,000 acres. The pore space we've acquired, combined with our legacy surface position is critical in providing long-term solutions for produced water. \n In evaluating surface acreage to acquire, we often perform extensive pore space due diligence across attributes such as capacity, formation pressures and fault and seismic mapping. Although we are well positioned to facilitate traditional produced water injection for years to come, we knew the industry needed additional solutions. There's still a lot of work and testing to be done with our emerging technology so we are encouraged and excited with what we've seen so far. \n As we presented our technology to potential partners, customers and regulators, the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. We've received immense interest from operators to deploy the test facility near their development areas, not just in the Permian, but also in other major oil and gas basins in the U.S. I'm extremely proud of the team here for their innovation, dedication and talent and their efforts will be critical in sustaining the positive momentum of Permian development over the long term. With that, I will turn the call over to Robert. Well, I think second quarter of last year was a record quarter for water sales, and we were right there close this quarter. And looking at the sales schedule for second quarter this year, we've got some really strong numbers on the schedule, a lot of wells to be completed. So I think we will continue to put up strong numbers on that front. I think our general capital allocation thoughts are really still kind of unchanged from what we talked about during the last earnings call. Certainly, we continue to look and different opportunities are available. It's a constant topic of discussion between management and the board. \n And right now, we're happy with kind of the direction and where that cash is. But it's certainly something that is always a topic. And we're always looking for the best way to deploy that capital when the opportunity arises. Yes. We definitely are seeing some tailwind from simul fracs. Just the volume of water needed delivered to pad per day for those fracs is enormous. And I think the scale that we've built our business to is a huge competitive advantage for us. There's just not a lot of water providers that can provide those kind of volumes, with as far a reach as we have across the basin, especially on the Delaware side. \n So I think there's a lot of factors that are giving strength to that part of the business. Obviously, our BaaS surface footprint and the ability to move water further than other competitors is 1 of those as well. But I think we're going to continue to see strength in that business. And just -- I think the important thing to remember about our water business as well as is we're involved in source water sales for completions. \n We're involved in reuse and treatment. We've got pore space or produced water disposal and now with this beneficial reuse technology that we're working on. We're really setting the company up to be a leader across the water industry as a whole. So no matter which way that aspect of the industry moves, I think TPL is well positioned to continue to gain market share across the board. Yes. We've had an ad hoc acquisition committee in the past just to kind of bet projects that management is working on before we take it to the full Board and make sure that we've got buy-in from that committee. So this is just kind of formalizing that with a standing committee. So it gives management the opportunity to vet new projects, get some feedback before we take it to the full Board. So that's the purpose of the committee."
