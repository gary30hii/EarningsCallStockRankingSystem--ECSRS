Today's conference is being recorded. \n At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Sabra Purtill, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. \nSabra Purtill: Thank you, Orlando. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. Today's call will cover AIG's fourth quarter and year-end 2020 financial results announced yesterday afternoon. The news release, financial results presentation and financial supplement are available on our website, www.aig.com. Our 10-K for 2020 will be filed on Friday, February 19.  \n Our speakers today include Brian Duperreault, CEO; Peter Zaffino, President and COO of AIG; and Mark Lyons, Chief Financial Officer. Following their prepared remarks, we will have time for Q&A. David McElroy, CEO of General Insurance; Kevin Hogan, CEO of Life and Retirement; and Doug Dachille, our Chief Investment Officer, will be available for Q&A.  \n Today's remarks may contain forward-looking statements, including comments relating to company performance; strategic priorities, including AIG's intent to pursue a separation of its Life and Retirement business; business mix and market conditions, including the effects of COVID-19 on AIG. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. Actual performance and events may materially differ. Factors that could cause results to differ include the factors described in our third quarter 2020 report on Form 10-Q and our annual -- 2019 annual report on Form 10-K and our other recent filings made with the SEC. AIG is not under any obligation and expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  \n Additionally, some remarks may refer to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at www.aig.com.  \n I'll now turn the call over to Brian. \nBrian Duperreault: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'd like to highlight some of the important milestones we achieved in 2020, and then I'll turn it over to Peter to provide more detail on our results for General Insurance and Life and Retirement as well as updates on strategic initiatives such as the separation of the Life and Retirement business and AIG 200. Lastly, Mark will provide a CFO update.  \n 2020 was an extraordinary year during which our company demonstrated tremendous resiliency. We quickly and effectively transitioned more than 90% of our workforce in over 50 countries to remote working. We established a cross-functional task force to implement best practices to protect the health and safety of colleagues while continuing to deliver high-quality service to clients, distribution partners and other stakeholders.  \n AIG continues to effectively manage through COVID-19 and its collateral effects on the global economy because of the strong foundation we began to build beginning in late 2017. We instilled a culture of underwriting excellence, adjusted risk tolerances, implemented best-in-class reinsurance programs, strengthened our vast global footprint, derisked the balance sheet and maintained a balanced and diversified investment portfolio. And in October, we announced our intention to separate the Life and Retirement business from AIG, which was made possible by the work our team has done to strengthen General Insurance in particular and position each business as a market leader.  \n Before I turn it over to Peter, I want to note that this is the last earnings call I will participate in. As you know, we announced that on March 1, I will become Executive Chairman of the Board, and Peter will take over as President and Chief Executive Officer. The transition will be seamless. \n Peter and I have tackled many of the systemic and pervasive fundamental problems from the past, and the company is now positioned for long-term sustainable and profitable growth. While there is still work to be done, I have every confidence that AIG's stakeholders will continue to reap the benefit of the hard work that is taking place across the organization on our journey to make AIG a top-performing company.  \n The turnaround of General Insurance and the enterprise-wide transformation at AIG is on a scale I've not seen in my 45-plus year career. I take great pride in what the team has accomplished. I know that the company and our colleagues will be in great hands with Peter as the CEO of AIG.  \n Now I'll turn the call over to Peter. \nPeter Zaffino: Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, I'd like to cover 4 topics that are key areas of focus for us in 2021 and which we will update you on each quarter: the separation of Life and Retirement from AIG, capital management, progress we've made on AIG 200 and financial and operating highlights for General Insurance and Life and Retirement.  \n 2020 was a pivotal year for AIG, and I'm pleased to report that 2021 has gotten off to a good and fast start due to the momentum we have coming into the new year. Like 2020, this year will be another year of substantial progress for our company.  \n As Brian noted, we made a critical and strategic decision last October to separate the Life and Retirement business from AIG. We could not have made this decision without the significant turnaround taking place in General Insurance and solid performance in Life and Retirement. Our fourth quarter results provided further evidence that each of our businesses remain financially strong, market leaders and well positioned for profitable growth over the long term in their respective markets.  \n Since our last earnings call, we've been working purposefully and with a sense of urgency on several fronts related to separation. We are actively working towards an IPO of up to 19.9% of Life and Retirement with teams focused on stand-alone audited financials, actuarial work and rating agency discussions, among other things. Based on our work to date, we continue to believe that no additional equity capital will be required, given the improvement in our subsidiary capital positions over the last few years.  \n Additionally, in connection with our October announcement, we received inquiries from parties interested in strategically aligning with us and potentially purchasing the 19.9% stake in Life and Retirement. We are pleased with the level of interest and quality of potential partners for Life and Retirement business and believe a sale of a minority stake could be an attractive option for AIG, its shareholders and other stakeholders. We are carefully weighing the relative merits of this path compared to a minority IPO, taking into account the impact on value creation for AIG, execution certainty, regulatory and rating agency implications and delivery of Life and Retirement's growth strategy over the long term. As you know, any decisions we make will be subject to regulatory approvals. Overall, I am very pleased with the progress we are making on the separation, and we'll provide a further update in the near term.  \n Turning to capital management. We ended 2020 with parent liquidity of $10.5 billion, a $2.9 billion increase from 2019. We entered 2021 with significant financial flexibility as a result of our focus on derisking, capital management and liquidity, particularly in 2020 as a result of COVID-19.  \n We will continue to invest in our businesses to support growth and operational transformation, and we will return at least $500 million of capital to our shareholders through stock repurchases in the first half of 2021. This amount will more than offset dilution from stock-based compensation, which, at a minimum, will be a core principle of our capital management strategy going forward.  \n As we move forward on the path to separate Life and Retirement and generate capital, we will continue to focus on delevering and investing in growth in our businesses. We also intend to be active and prudent managers of capital and return it to shareholders when appropriate. Our current expectation is that an initial disposition of 19.9% of Life and Retirement, whether through a minority IPO or sale to a third party, will generate net proceeds such that some portion can be used towards further share repurchases. And while it is not currently a priority, over time, we may consider inorganic growth opportunities that would be accretive to our businesses and growth strategy and otherwise create value for our shareholders and other stakeholders. Once we make a decision on the initial step of the separation of Life and Retirement, we will provide more detail on our medium- and longer-term capital management priorities.  \n Now I'd like to provide an update on AIG 200. As a reminder, AIG 200 has core -- 4 core objectives: underwriting excellence, modernizing our operating infrastructure, enhancing user and customer experience and becoming a more unified company. Throughout 2020, we made measurable progress in spite of the ongoing remote work environment and, in some cases, accelerated certain initiatives. On December 31, we completed the sale of our shared services operations to Accenture, which streamlines our operating model. We've made significant progress in driving improvements in infrastructure and systems architecture while reducing real estate costs and other general operating expenses. We exceeded our target run rate savings for 2020, and the costs required to achieve were lower than initially expected. We exited 2020 with a $400 million run rate benefit, which was 30% ahead of the guidance we provided in 2020.  \n The success of AIG 200 to date demonstrates the discipline and rigor that the team leading the strategic initiative is using. The team is taking decisive action as we execute to position the company for the long term. AIG 200 success to date also reflects the resiliency and flexibility of our global colleagues who have embraced change while making significant contributions to our progress.  \n In 2021, a major focus of AIG 200 will be advancing our digital strategy through effective use of data and process-enabling technologies as well as driving greater operational efficiencies and improved customer experience. We also expect to make significant progress in 2021 on a global data warehouse in support of our finance and underwriting transformations. Our overall target for AIG 200 remain unchanged. We still expect to achieve run rate savings of $650 million by the end of 2021 and to deliver aggregate run rate savings of $1 billion by the end of 2022 against the total investment of $1.3 billion.  \n Turning to our financial results. I'll start with General Insurance. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we saw growth in net premium written in our commercial businesses, with year-over-year net premium written increasing 7% after adjusting for foreign exchange, driven by improved retention and higher rates. North America Commercial grew approximately 10% with meaningful growth from AIG Re, and International was up 5% after adjusting for foreign exchange.  \n As we previously outlined, North America Personal Insurance continued to experience reduced net premium volumes. This was primarily due to our decision to strategically reposition our high net worth business to Syndicate 2019, the partnership we established with Lloyd's, which resulted in higher ceded premium and the impact of COVID-19 on lines such as Travel and Accident & Health. While it's still very early in the year, based on what we are seeing, we expect a similar overall growth trend to continue particularly in commercial, and we will achieve top line growth for the full year 2021.  \n Turning to the combined ratio. We achieved another quarter of positive results in our core business with continued improvement in underwriting margins. In the fourth quarter, the accident year combined ratio excluding CATs improved by 290 basis points to 92.9% compared to 95.8% a year ago. This improvement was led by our commercial businesses, which improved our accident year combined ratio excluding CATs by 440 basis points with International Commercial improving by 490 basis points and North America Commercial improving by 400 basis points. \n The adjusted accident year combined ratio for the full year 2020 was 94.1%, a 190 basis point improvement year-over-year. Commercial's adjusted accident year combined ratio for the full year 2020 was 93.2%, a 340 basis point improvement year-over-year. These combined ratio improvements reflect very strong performance as General Insurance continues to benefit from an improved business mix in the commercial portfolio driven by the strategic underwriting actions we have been taking.  \n Turning to rate. In the fourth quarter, we continue to see considerable improvement and tighter terms and conditions. In commercial, we saw a sustained strong rate momentum and improvement across all lines of business with the exception of workers' compensation.  \n For the fourth quarter, our commercial business achieved rate increases of approximately 15%. North America Commercial rate increases were 21% in the fourth quarter compared to 14% in the prior year quarter. This improvement was driven by Excess Casualty, which saw rate increases of 45%; Financial Lines with rate increases of over 25%, led by 35% increases in D&O; Retail Property and Lexington wholesale property both achieving approximately 30% rate increases; and Lexington casualty with 25% rate increases.  \n International Commercial rate increases remained strong at 14% in the fourth quarter with second half 2020 rate improvement accelerating from the first half of the year. The largest rate increases were in global energy with over 30% increases, Financial Lines with 20% increases, Talbot with over 15% increases and Commercial Property with 15% increase.  \n Turning to Validus Re 1/1 renewals. Overall, we saw solid risk-adjusted rate improvements in U.S. property CAT, U.S. Casualty, international CAT, marine and energy, Financial Lines and specialty lines. For U.S. proportional business, material underlying rate improvement was generally applicable for our assumed portfolio. In international, rate improvements were achieved in essentially every territory.  \n Validus achieved a material increase in net written premium at the January 1 renewal period, which generated better balance across our portfolio, led by international property. New business, along with final signings across our portfolio, were very favorable as well. With respect to reinsurance AIG purchased, overall, we're extremely pleased with the outcome of our January 1 renewals in a challenging market environment. This was a critical year for us to evolve our reinsurance program strategically to reflect our significantly improved underlying portfolio.  \n In General Insurance, we maintained our philosophy of partnership with reinsurers and reducing volatility in the portfolio. We restructured our core placements in every major treaty. Keep in mind that AIG places over 35 treaties at 1/1, so I'll provide a few key highlights.  \n We reduced the aggregate amount of property catastrophe limit purchase as a result of a significantly reduced gross exposure in property PMLs. We reduced the catastrophe per occurrence attachment points in North America from $500 million to $200 million for all territories except the Southeast and Gulf, which remained at $500 million. We reduced the global shared aggregate limit retention in North America from $750 million to $500 million. We purchased a CAT program for PCG, our high net worth business, that protects Syndicate 2019 at AIG without taking on additional net limit. We reduced our overall catastrophe premium cost by over $150 million.  \n In our casualty quota share, we improved the ceding commission by 4 points and reduced our overall cession. We also introduced a new excess layer of $10 million excess of $15 million to remain consistent with our risk appetite. Those were just some of the highlights of our 1/1 renewal season. We are particularly pleased with the ongoing support we receive from the global reinsurance market, particularly our core partners. \n With respect to Life and Retirement, the business continued sequential improvement, generating quarterly adjusted pretax income of $1 billion and adjusted return on segment common equity of 16.4%. For the full year 2020, adjusted pretax income was $3.5 billion and adjusted return on segment common equity was 13.9%. Result for 2020 reflected higher private equity returns and higher call and tender income driven by lower interest rates and tighter credit spreads. This was partially offset by the impact of COVID-19 mortality, lower fair value option bond income and base spread compression. Life and Retirement's strong performance in the face of macroeconomic stress and high levels of volatility during 2020 is a testament to the quality of its balance sheet, diversified product offerings and disciplined risk management. The hedge program performed as expected throughout the year, and the balance sheet remained strong.  \n Life and Retirement has a large and diverse in-force portfolio and, as a result of the Fortitude sale, has relatively limited net exposure to legacy blocks of business, no long-term care exposure and limited risks associated with pre-2010 variable annuity living benefits. This broad portfolio across products and channels was particularly advantageous during 2020. Given the disruption in retail sales during the year, the team focused on attractive opportunities to deploy capital in the Institutional Markets business, resulting in strong growth for both pension risk transfer transactions, direct and through reinsurance; and GIC issuances.  \n Group Retirement maintained steady payroll deduction periodic deposits and improved large group plan retention results. Overall, Life and Retirement remains well positioned to meet the ever-growing needs for protection, retirement savings and lifetime income solutions.  \n As I mentioned, we entered 2021 with significant momentum and a continued sense of urgency on our path to becoming a top-performing company. I'd like to thank our colleagues around the world for their focus and determination in supporting one another while delivering significant value to our stakeholders. Thanks to their efforts, we made tremendous progress in 2020, a year when the world changed for everyone and every organization. The responsibility, accountability and opportunity that commercial enterprises face today surpass anything corporate America and the global business community have ever faced. In the months and years ahead, we will continue to adapt and evolve and introduce a stronger version of AIG as we strive to become a leading global insurance franchise.  \n I'm privileged to be taking on the role of Chief Executive Officer of AIG and appreciate the opportunity to lead this company. I want to thank Brian for his partnership over the many years we've worked together and for asking me to join him at AIG back in 2017. Professionally, the last few years have presented the greatest challenge in my career, but I know that this experience will also be the most rewarding. And I want to extend a special thanks to Brian on behalf of all of our colleagues for his leadership, commitment to solving complex problems and building a foundation of stability that has positioned us well for the future. I look forward to continuing our work together as Brian steps into his new role as Executive Chairman.  \n Now I'll turn it over to Mark. \nMark Lyons: Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Before I go into the fourth quarter results, I want to highlight that we resegmented our financials this quarter and now have 3 business segments: General Insurance, Life and Retirement and Other Operations. The historical recasted information and description of the changes were in the 8-K filed on February 1 and posted on our website and were principally the elimination of the legacy segment and the realignment of its book into Life and Retirement and Other Operations as well as some small shifts within General Insurance.  \n Turning to the quarter. AIG reported adjusted pretax income or APTI of $1.1 billion and adjusted after-tax income of $827 million or $0.94 per diluted share compared to $923 million or $1.03 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019. The key drivers of this quarter were: first, a General Insurance accident year 2020 combined ratio ex CAT of 92.9%, which is a 290 basis point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2019; second, strong Life and Retirement APTI of $1 billion, driven by Individual and Group Retirement as well as Institutional Markets activity and strong net investment income; thirdly, $3.2 billion of consolidated net investment income on an APTI basis, primarily reflecting higher private equity and hedge fund income.  \n Moving to General Insurance. Fourth quarter adjusted pretax income was $809 million, up $31 million year-over-year as increased net investment income from alternatives offset the impact of higher catastrophe losses, which totaled $545 million pretax or 9 loss ratio points this quarter compared to 6.5 loss ratio points in the prior year quarter. The CAT losses were comprised of $367 million of natural CATs primarily related to fourth quarter events Hurricane Zeta, the East Troublesome and Silverado fires and Hurricane Delta, along with revised estimates for Hurricane Sally, which occurred late in the quarter and Hurricane Laura, where Delta has a similar path. \n Additionally, there were $178 million of COVID-related losses primarily related to Travel, Contingency and Validus Re.  Prior year development or PYD was slightly unfavorable this quarter at $45 million compared to favorable development of $139 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter included $51 million of net unfavorable development in North America and $6 million of net favorable development internationally.  \n The North America unfavorable PYD was driven mostly by Financial Lines, EPLI, E&O and mergers and acquisition insurance primarily from accident years 2016 to 2018 and thus not covered by the ADC, with favorable indications primarily in GL, AIGRM, some workers' compensation units and short-tail lines. As an additional lens, the $45 million of unfavorable development was also split as $5 million unfavorable in global Commercial Lines and $40 million unfavorable in global Personal Lines, primarily driven by adverse development in prior year CATs as opposed to attritional losses. As usual, there is net favorable amortization from the ADC, which amounted to $52 million this quarter.  \n I'll point out that our 2020 net premium profile is now skewed towards our international operations, totaling 57% of global net premium. Furthermore, the international book is nearly evenly balanced between Commercial and Personal Lines, and this demonstrates the truly global platform of our General Insurance business, led by an international book that has had better results with less volatility than North America. We expect these proportions to stay approximately the same in 2021 but skewed a bit less towards international as North America Commercial growth strengthens.  \n A key indicator of the turnaround of our General Insurance business is the improvement in the accident year ex CAT combined ratio results for North America and International Commercial Lines. As Peter has noted, North American Commercial had an accident quarter (sic) [ year ] combined ratio ex CAT that was 400 basis points better than last year's quarter to 93.6%, and International Commercial Lines improved their accident year combined ratio ex CAT by 490 basis points to 89.2%. We continue to view the current accident year prudently, with an appropriate view towards the margin of safety as the book has undergone a massive transformation and also anticipate continued margin expansion into 2021, resulting from the favorable global market conditions.  \n As Peter discussed, our Personal Insurance premium and underwriting results continue to be impacted by the repositioning of our high net worth business and the global pandemic. North America Personal Lines was impacted the most with an accident year combined ratio ex CAT of 102.6% versus 92.2% in the prior year quarter and a 55% drop in net premiums written.  \n In 2021, our year-over-year comparisons will begin to improve, although the first quarter will still be unfavorable since COVID was just beginning to impact Travel and Syndicate 2019 was formed in the second quarter of 2020. On the other hand, our International Personal Insurance business continues to perform well with a 93.9% accident year ex CAT combined ratio, which is 130 basis point improvement from 95.2% in 2019, reflecting favorable Japanese auto trends and improving business mix, offset slightly by the Travel book. Expense management also contributed to the improvement with 160 basis point reduction in the General Insurance expense ratio driven by lower acquisition ratio compared to the prior year quarter.  \n Lastly, before we leave General Insurance, we'd like to reiterate our outlook for a sub-90 accident year combined ratio ex CAT by the end of 2022. The 94.1% that we achieved in 2020 is a significant accomplishment, but there is more to come with the significant reunderwriting of the book over the past few years as well as the current very firm commercial lines market. We're highly confident that we will achieve more progress in 2021 and 2022 as we reestablish AIG's leadership in General Insurance.  \n Now turning to Life and Retirement. Adjusted pretax income was $1 billion for the quarter, up 20% compared to the prior year quarter. Total Life and Retirement premium and deposits increased by 4% compared to the prior year quarter driven by 2 large  GIC issuances. In addition, pension risk transfer activity grew sequentially.  \n Life and Retirement continued to see a rebound in retail annuity sales as distribution partners became more accustomed to the new environment with higher sequential sales for both Variable and Index Annuities. Fixed Annuities sales were lower sequentially as Life and Retirement maintained pricing discipline in this challenging rate environment. Although still lower than the prior year, Index Annuities sales continued to grow sequentially, contributing strong positive net flows, helping offset declines in Variable and Fixed Annuity net flows. \n Group Retirement net flows improved from the prior year quarter due to strong group plan acquisition and retention results, reflecting the investments made to modernize that platform. On February 8, AIG announced the sale of its Retail Mutual Fund business. This sale has a nearly immaterial impact on APTI but will benefit our overall net flow metrics, given the platform has generally experienced significant outflows over the last few years.  \n Base investment spreads for Variable and Index Annuities, Fixed Annuities and Group Retirement were virtually flat sequentially. As noted in previous quarters, Life and Retirement's reported base investment spread compression was impacted by substantially lower returns on cash and short-term investments through 2020. Excluding this impact, based on the environment we see today, we continue to expect base spread compression across the portfolio in the range of 8 to 16 basis points annually.  \n Recognizing the limits of sensitivities, especially in times of macroeconomic uncertainty and this higher market volatility, our sensitivity estimates for U.S. equity markets and rates are as follows. We would expect a plus or minus 1% change in equity market returns to respectively increase or decrease adjusted pretax income by approximately $40 million to $50 million annually. A plus or minus 10 basis points movement on the 10-year reinvestment rates would increase or decrease earnings by approximately $10 million to $20 million annually. As always, it is important to note that these market sensitivity ranges are not exact nor linear since our earnings are also impacted by the timing and degree of movements as well as other factors.  \n Moving to Other Operations, which now includes portions of the legacy segment from prior General Insurance exposures, had an adjusted pretax loss of $720 million, inclusive of $292 million of losses for consolidation and eliminations, which this quarter principally reflects realized capital gains on private equities, which are recorded as NII in the subsidiaries but eliminated in Other Operations' APTI and recorded as realized capital gains in net income, not AATI. \n For the quarter, corporate interest expenses were slightly higher than the prior year, reflecting the interest on the $4.1 billion of senior notes issued in May 2020 and Other Operations' GOE was down $38 million from the comparable quarter last year. For 2021, we expect both corporate interest expense and GOE to decrease due to debt repayments and lower corporate expenses. However, we expect continued volatility in asset management and in the consolidation and elimination lines due to returns, interest rates and credit spread volatility.  \n Shifting to investments. Net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.2 billion or $236 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2019, principally due to the June 2020 sale of Fortitude whose investment income was included in the prior year's quarter. Adjusting the fourth quarter 2019 accordingly, this quarter's net investment income on an APTI basis was $262 million or 9% higher than the prior year and reflected the strongest quarterly returns in 2020 for hedge funds and private equity as well as having strong bond tender and call premiums. It's also worth noting that on a full year basis, net investment income on an APTI basis excluding Fortitude was $11.8 billion.  \n Turning to the balance sheet. At December 31, 2020, book value per common share was $76.46, up 3.5% from September 20, 2020, and adjusted book value per share was $57.01, up slightly from September 30.  \n As Peter mentioned, at year-end, AIG parent had cash and short-term liquidity assets of $10.5 billion. And during the quarter, we repaid our December debt maturity of $708 million, bringing our debt leverage for year-end 2020 to 28.4%, which is 220 basis points lower than second quarter of 2020 when we raised $4.1 billion of senior notes to prefinance 2020 and 2021 maturing debt. \n Our primary operating subsidiaries remain profitable and well capitalized. For General Insurance, we estimate the U.S. pool fleet risk-based capital ratio for year-end 2020 to be approximately 455% and Life and Retirement is estimated to be approximately 430%, both above our target ranges and both providing a good absorbency buffer. The impacts from investment downgrades and credit losses to our RBC ratios were less than anticipated, reflecting a high-quality investment portfolio that is positioned well to navigate the uncertain environment. \n And with respect to the capital management in 2021, as intended, we repaid $1.5 billion of maturing senior notes on February 1, which reduces our leverage ratio by about 1.6 points on a pro forma basis, approaching towards our 25% leverage target. In addition, we repurchased approximately 92 million of shares to offset dilution associated with AIG warrants that were exercised prior to expiration on January 19, 2021. As Peter mentioned, we intend to repurchase additional common shares in the first half of 2021 to manage dilution. And in addition, we expect to execute some liability management actions in the first half of 2021 to facilitate the Life and Retirement separation. \n And with that, I'll now turn it back over to Brian. \nBrian Duperreault: Thank you, Mark. Operator, we're ready for the Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. \nElyse Greenspan: My first question, going back, Peter, to some of your introductory comments on Life and Retirement. You pointed to however the 19.9% transaction takes place, that some portion of the proceeds would be able to use for further share repurchases. So I'm just trying to get a sense -- when you make that comment, what are you guys assuming for, I guess, the leverage target for L&R as a stand-alone entity? And then also, is the goal for RemainCo AIG still to get its leverage target within the vicinity of, I think you guys have pointed to, around 25%? \nBrian Duperreault: Okay. So Peter, the question is on the repurchase and leverage at AIG, I believe. So do you want to start? And maybe Mark can jump in if he has to. \nPeter Zaffino: Yes, sure. I think Elyse, what I said in my October comments and then just reinforced and provided a little bit more detail on the prepared remarks is that we have made assumptions in terms of the stand-alone Life and Retirement business with acceptable debt and capital structure that is going to work with the rating agencies. We've also had assumed how we would set up AIG, the remaining company, with the guidance that Mark has given on our delevering. I focused that in my prepared remarks. It's our first priority. And we think that based on the base case, getting Life and Retirement set up, getting the delevering done at AIG, we think we will have capital available for share repurchase. That was the context of the comment I made. I don't know if you want to add anything, Mark. \nMark Lyons: No, I think you covered it, Peter. \nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then my follow-up. You guys gave some pretty healthy price increases for another quarter throughout your Commercial Lines business. We're getting asked questions or I am right in terms of just the pricing cycle and the continued upward momentum from here. So as you guys think about 2021 and beyond, I mean, do you think that we can continue to see this level of price increases throughout your Commercial Lines book in both North America and internationally for the good part of 2021 and perhaps into 2022? \nBrian Duperreault: Peter? \nPeter Zaffino: Thanks, Elyse. Yes, this momentum will continue. As we look into 2021, we expect to see rate increases to continue. We expect to see these rate increases to be above loss cost. We expect that these rate increases will be balanced across our global portfolio and across multiple lines of business. And so this is a very disciplined market, one that our capacity is highly valued. And as we deploy it in property and casualty, we're going to be very disciplined in making sure we get the right price for the exposure, make sure that we're there to solve problems for our broker distribution partners and clients. \nBrian Duperreault: I think Mark wants to add something, Peter. \nMark Lyons: Yes, if I could. Elyse, also, as Peter's kind of noted, we -- the momentum has been strong. We have really seen no evidence of deceleration of it. It's pretty broad-based across all lines and geographies. And I would just remind you that the timing was different internationally versus in North America. So it started a little bit later. So its trajectory is going to be different by definition, and thus far, no slowdowns. \nOperator: And next, we'll hear from Tom Gallagher with Evercore. \nThomas Gallagher: First, Brian, just wanted to say best of luck to you in the new role. \nBrian Duperreault: Thanks. \nThomas Gallagher: And Peter, just wanted to come back on the consideration of the private sale for the 19.9% stake in L&R. Should we think about this as just the sale of the stake? Or are you considering doing something more strategic, including reinsuring a portion of your in-force block or outsourcing investment management functions? Anything you could add? \nBrian Duperreault: Peter? \nPeter Zaffino: Well, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I mean, we have received a number of inbound inquiries, high-quality companies. And those high-quality companies see the real value in our Life and Retirement franchise, a very diversified portfolio, minimal legacy. And so how they are approaching AIG is that they want to do something strategically on the 19.9% because that's what we've outlined. But we are focused on how we drive long-term value for Life and Retirement with any partner that we decide to go with, in the event we do go with that over the initial public offering. And that's -- we're working towards that as a primary focus. So I don't want to go into the specific details because we don't have them. But you should just think about it as, if we did enter into an agreement, it would be about positioning the business for more long-term success. \nThomas Gallagher: Got you. And then just my follow-up is just, I guess, how are you thinking about the adverse development you saw on the '16 to '18 accident years? Particularly, 2016 seems to be a recurring problematic year. Do you feel there's some conservatism in there? How does that inform your picks going forward? Any -- and anything we should be thinking about with regard to what you saw with the year-end review? \nBrian Duperreault: Okay, Tom. Mark, I think it's for you. \nMark Lyons: Yes, happy to. So a few things I could just point out is that in North America, we had -- we recognized in Financial Lines, I'd say on the EPLI side, a little bit on the E&O side and the mergers and acquisitions insurance, some little changes in M&A insurance. Originally, it was a product that was really to sellers and now sellers and buyers. That kind of changes your forecasted utilization and things like that. So there's some recognition there which I think makes some sense. \n In the past, when we've talked about this, we've always focused on like primary D&O and SCAs and so forth. And every assumption that we had on the public side is still coming to bear. No matter how we look at it, our commercial book, our national book, the SCAs continue to drop as the underwriting continues to improve, and that's been a steady pattern. \n What we would say this time is really on the private not-for-profit side, mostly centered in the EPLI, we saw some trends that we recognized. But we think we're in pretty good shape. We think we pretty much nailed it at this point. \n And I would say, the second part of your question, on a go-forward, this book has had such massive transformation that the predictive value, given the turnover of the past to the future, is almost nonexistent. So we use it. We try to carve all those things out, index forward. But the impact of that on such a transformed book is negligible. So the net is we're very comfortable with where '19 and '20 are. \nOperator: And next, we will hear from Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. \nTracy Dolin-Benguigui: Congratulations to both Brian and Peter. \nBrian Duperreault: Thanks, Tracy. \nTracy Dolin-Benguigui: Yes. I have some similar questions about the reserve development. Maybe you could just talk about how you feel about rate adequacy and liabilities since you've had some adverse development in Excess Casualty. And I noticed it is one of the only Commercial Lines where you've actually had net premiums written decline. \nPeter Zaffino: Maybe I'll start. And then -- thanks, Tracy. And then I'll turn over to Mark. Just 2 things to keep in mind. One is the net premium written. What I said in my prepared remarks on how we've restructured the reinsurance fee, $10 million excess of $15 million was purchased in December. So you would have seen that as an impact on net premium written for the casualty lines in the fourth quarter. So that's one. \n And two is I just want to reinforce Mark's point and give you an example in terms of what we're doing with the Excess Casualty book. We had talked about we were, years ago, over 90% lead in what we were doing in Excess Casualty and wanted to make sure that we were getting better balance. And so the team led by Dave McElroy, Barbara Luck have done an amazing job. We now have increased like our mid-excess by over 400% in terms of policy count. So the book is changing and getting better balance across the portfolio. \n And you don't really see that, but I think that's to Mark's point before when he was commenting on the vast changes, the improvement of the portfolio. So that just needs to emerge a little bit over time, but I think we have done some very strong work on the underwriting side. And the balance is much better as we position ourselves for the future. \n Mark, I don't know if you want to add anything in terms of just Excess Casualty specifically. \nMark Lyons: Yes, sure. Two things. One, I'll follow up on your direct question, which is on the rate changes and rate adequacy. \n And secondly, I think on the fin sup, we could have done a little better job. We said Excess Casualty was really the Lexington casualty, which really has primary in it. The traditional admitted casualty book that's either written out of American home or like London or Bermuda has performed very, very well during the year. And so I'm just letting you know that this is not an issue whatsoever. So it's really a combination of Lexington primary and excess. \n But my comments will now address all of that. So as you know, rate changes have not only been large, they've been compound over a period. The terms and conditions which drive this line of business are tighter and tighter. And whether you have a calm or an aggressive view of loss cost trends that could affect casualty businesses, getting further away from risk is the preferred way to go, and that's the strategy that Peter and Dave have put in place, moving that portfolio higher so you're further away from risk in case anything unforeseen happens. \n So we're very comfortable with that. We're very comfortable on -- our indications are that the rate adequacy as opposed to rate change is stronger on new business than it is on renewal business, which you'd expect to be the case in a hard cycle of acceleration like we have. And we continue to see inferior rate adequacy on the business we're not renewing. So that's what I call the implicit lift as opposed to the explicit lift. So we feel good about that. \nTracy Dolin-Benguigui: Okay. Excellent. And at this point, it's been a few months since your initial announcement to separate L&R. And I know you've had a lot of discussions with various market constituents. I'm just wondering, at this stage, how firm is your 19.9% initial sale target. I get your point it would be a full separation, but just wanted to get a sense if you had maybe more flexibility by the rating agencies or you've figured out a way to accelerate your debt structure that could lead to a different path. \nBrian Duperreault: Peter, I think you should address that one. \nPeter Zaffino: Okay. Yes. Thanks, Tracy. The 19.9% remains the base case. We think it's the best way forward for the organization. We're working on all the different work streams that I outlined in my prepared remarks, working with all of our stakeholders and believe that, that will be the path that maximizes value for the organization. \nOperator: And next, we will hear from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. \nYaron Kinar: I'll reiterate the congratulatory comments to Brian and Peter. I guess my first question is on the comment around expectation of similar growth trend in Commercial Lines. Are you saying that you expect commercial net premiums written to be in the high single-digit range in 2021? And I guess what I'm trying to get at is, why wouldn't we see further acceleration from 4Q levels considering that rates remain very robust, you have less reinsurance purchase and potentially we see an economic recovery? \nBrian Duperreault: Peter? \nPeter Zaffino: Thanks, Yaron. It's hard to give specific guidance in terms of whether it's going to be high single digits or even more. I mean we have a lot of momentum in the commercial portfolio. We talked about strong retention, strong rate. \n New business in 2020 was impacted by -- if I look globally, particularly in international and some of the Specialty classes, our new business was very strong but it wasn't at the normal levels that we expect within 2021. And again, we're still in the global pandemic. We'll see -- with the economic recovery, we're cautious but we're optimistic that new business will continue to pick up. And we believe our retentions will get stronger. And so we're very optimistic that we'll have very good growth balance across commercial globally next year. \n I don't know, Dave, if you want to add anything in particular on the new business and your optimism of growth. \nDavid McElroy: Yes. Thank you, Peter. In a simple way, I just -- I think we've had a couple of turns with the book. We look at this as less limit reduction. Okay? And then our new business opportunities have always continued to be, on the commercial side, on a $3 billion range worldwide with the platform that we have. And then I look at our -- the renewal retention rate. Okay? We can forecast rate, but we also have certain positions that we think that we can actually consistently earn those rates going forward. Okay? We are not in a commodity position in our portfolio. And if you look at this worldwide in terms of the different franchises we have, we think that the rate we're looking at and the risk-adjusted rate and the -- and what -- how we're thinking about the portfolio, they are very defendable. \n So there was a lot of work done over the last couple of years, okay, and we freely admit that, in terms of addressing the exposure that might have been an outlier exposure. We feel very comfortable with where we are going into 2021 with a portfolio that we can add to, not only on rate but new business and then our renewal retention. Okay?  And key point, and it's worth saying, the limit reduction that went through in these last 2 years, we are through that portal. And therefore, if anything, we're adding risk, and we're thinking about growth with risk, not just risk on top of limits, on top of accounts, but additional risk with additional clients. \n And that's actually where we think very strongly that the brand and the formidable nature of what is AIG, we will succeed in 2021. Okay? That's very much part of the plan, is that we've taken some of the outlier exposures down to the studs and now we are very comfortable with the portfolio that we have going forward. \nBrian Duperreault: I think Mark wanted to add something too, David. \nMark Lyons: Yes. Yaron, if I could, I'm going to purposely give you an arithmetic view. And it's this -- Peter touched on it a bit with the XOL when he was talking about some of the reinsurance. So loss-occurring contracts, you basically have ceded written all bulleted, right, in the quarter, and then it's earned smoothly. Risk-attaching quota shares, you see the recognition quarter-by-quarter. So from a net earned basis, which is what's going to really matter, you're going to see much more uplift on a net earned basis over the course of the year. The benefit of a smaller cession on the casualty quota share will overwhelm the additional XOL cession. So you'll see that increase, right, but it won't be at 1Q. You're going to see that over the course of the year. \nYaron Kinar: Got it. Very, very helpful comments. And then switching over to L&R. A lot of moving parts this quarter, pandemic mortality, alternative income, a little bit of AIG 200. Can you help us think about kind of the core earnings power of that business, whether as an earnings power or ROE that you talked about in the past? How should we think about that going forward? \nBrian Duperreault: Peter, do you want to take that? \nPeter Zaffino: I'll give it to Kevin. [ That is his work ]. Kevin? \nKevin Hogan: Yes. Thanks, Yaron. So I think Mark's comments highlighted the sensitivities to equity markets and interest rate levels. This year, we did benefit from some strong market support that, frankly, is laid out in the noteworthy items in the earnings deck. And we had a strong year based on where the markets were with both alts and the call and tender income. \n We continue to target low to mid-double-digit returns for the medium term, and our current pricing conditions suggest we are able to continue that. And so I think it's really the alternatives are the big anomaly. This year, we turn those to normalized levels. The call and tender income strength could continue based on where interest rates are, and that's, to a certain extent, the wildcard. \nOperator: And next, we will hear from Josh Shanker with Bank of America. \nJoshua Shanker: I want to just go back to that guidance, and we'll call it guidance, about a 90% accident year ex CAT combined ratio in General Insurance in 2022. Is that a year forecast or was that an exit forecast? \n And the other part -- I'll give both my questions upfront. If you told me we'd have 15% to 20% rate increases in 2020 and maybe in 2021, I would think you could improve the combined ratio by more than 300, 400 basis points in harmony with AIG 200. Do you have any thoughts on those 2 areas? \nBrian Duperreault: So let's have Mark talk about it, the 90%, and then we'll take it from there. Go ahead, Mark. \nMark Lyons: So I think -- Peter and I go back and forth on this. On the 90% which we are, Josh, reiterating, Peter will get into some of the expense ratio aspects of it. \n With regard to loss ratio, that was the second part of it, well, we would expect improving margins as well as we go through '21 and '22. We're viewing that as exit though, Josh. So that's much closer and equivalent to 4Q. But the -- but nevertheless, you have to watch the compound growth or change because as the book continues to improve, and it's improved fabulously, the degree of improvement narrows and narrows and narrows that you can do. So the big, huge changes have already occurred, but we're comfortable on our cadence and approach to get there. Peter? \nPeter Zaffino: Yes. Can I just add to that? Thanks, Josh. I mean a couple of things to keep in mind. One is AIG 200 contributes a meaningful portion of the improvement in expense ratio. Now while I said $400 million was the exit run rate of 2020, that hasn't even fully earned in yet. So we expect the full $1 billion by 2022. So you can just do the math that, that will contribute to the expense ratio and overall combined ratio. \n The other is we think there's 2 components to growth. One is, Dave mentioned it, that we think that the portfolio is in a very good place for top line growth, and we would expect to see that to continue in 2021 and 2022. In addition, contributing to that growth will be we need less reinsurance. I think the terms and conditions that we were able to improve at 1/1 speak volumes in terms of the trajectory and what we would expect for reinsurance going forward. That will contribute. \n I think when we do, and the team has proven it does very good work on operational excellence, that when we separate Life and Retirement AIG RemainCo, we will find ways to improve the expense ratio as we work through the actual separation, and we have a very disciplined expense behavior in the company. And then just the rate above loss cost and as we continue to reposition the portfolio, we think there will be improvement in the loss ratio as we look to the future. So when you add all of those components together, we are very confident that we will be below the 90% as we exit 2022. \nBrian Duperreault: And Josh, don't forget this is a -- Josh, don't forget this is both commercial and personal. It's the entire book of business going below 90%. And the Personal Lines is not getting the kind of rate increases in Commercial. So you just got to put that weighted average in too. \n Do you have -- you asked your questions didn't you, Josh? \nJoshua Shanker: Those were 2. Good luck in your new roles, and congratulations to everyone. \nBrian Duperreault: I appreciate that, Josh. Thank you very much. \nOperator: All right. And we will hear from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. \nErik Bass: I just wanted to follow up on Tom's question about the potential sale of the 19.9% stake in L&R. Can you just discuss how you're thinking about the benefits of that approach versus an IPO and some of the key considerations on which makes more sense for delivering long-term value? \nBrian Duperreault: Peter? \nPeter Zaffino: Yes. And Mark, you can weigh in. I mean certainly, the path with the IPO is very clear with the 19.9% IPO sale. When we look at -- I think the heart of your question on the private is that it has to be a better alternative for us. We have to be more strategic, more financially advantageous and making certain that when we look at the 19.9%, we don't look at that in isolation. We look at the 80.1% and how we position the Life and Retirement business for the future. So those are the things, among other factors, that we will consider in terms of do we go through the IPO or would we do a private sale as we work through the coming months. \nErik Bass: Got it. The next one... \nBrian Duperreault: Yes. Do you have another follow-up there? \nErik Bass: Yes, please. Just one other on Life and Retirement. I was just hoping you could provide some additional detail on the mortality results this quarter. Any sensitivity to general population COVID deaths or maybe another metric to help us think about the potential impacts in 1Q? \nBrian Duperreault: Kevin, do you want to do that? \nKevin Hogan: Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Erik. So look, the reality is it's hard to isolate COVID deaths. So the way we approach it in looking at our portfolio is to focus on the total portfolio actually to expected versus pricing. And in this context, we saw mortality for the year continue to be acceptable relative to our pricing in terms of short-run variances driven by COVID. Either way, we look at this as an earnings and not a capital event, and we haven't seen any data that suggest a change to our long-term assumptions. \n That being said, based on our best understanding of what are the COVID-related deaths, we estimate that up to 40% of the reported claims -- COVID reported claims could be an acceleration of claims we would otherwise expect in the next 5 years. And again, based on our best understanding of the COVID deaths, we estimate our exposure to the population of approximately $65 million to $75 million per 100,000 population deaths, which is a slightly better estimate than what we would have assumed a couple of quarters ago. \nBrian Duperreault: Okay. So thank you all for all your questions. Before I end the call, I want to thank everyone who's been part of the multiyear journey that began when I joined AIG in 2017 to fix the fundamental needed -- fundamentals needed for AIG to once again be a leading insurance franchise. \n What has been accomplished over the last few years would not have been possible without the extraordinary efforts of AIG's exceptional talent at all levels of the organization. And I'm thankful for everyone's dedication and commitment to this great organization. I'm also grateful to the clients and distribution reinsurance partners, shareholders, regulators and many other stakeholders who have actively supported me since I returned to AIG. I look forward to being a part of the next chapter of AIG under Peter's leadership. Be well. Stay safe and healthy. \nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. We do thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'd like to highlight some of the important milestones we achieved in 2020, and then I'll turn it over to Peter to provide more detail on our results for General Insurance and Life and Retirement as well as updates on strategic initiatives such as the separation of the Life and Retirement business and AIG 200. Lastly, Mark will provide a CFO update.  \n 2020 was an extraordinary year during which our company demonstrated tremendous resiliency. We quickly and effectively transitioned more than 90% of our workforce in over 50 countries to remote working. We established a cross-functional task force to implement best practices to protect the health and safety of colleagues while continuing to deliver high-quality service to clients, distribution partners and other stakeholders.  \n AIG continues to effectively manage through COVID-19 and its collateral effects on the global economy because of the strong foundation we began to build beginning in late 2017. We instilled a culture of underwriting excellence, adjusted risk tolerances, implemented best-in-class reinsurance programs, strengthened our vast global footprint, derisked the balance sheet and maintained a balanced and diversified investment portfolio. And in October, we announced our intention to separate the Life and Retirement business from AIG, which was made possible by the work our team has done to strengthen General Insurance in particular and position each business as a market leader.  \n Before I turn it over to Peter, I want to note that this is the last earnings call I will participate in. As you know, we announced that on March 1, I will become Executive Chairman of the Board, and Peter will take over as President and Chief Executive Officer. The transition will be seamless. \n Peter and I have tackled many of the systemic and pervasive fundamental problems from the past, and the company is now positioned for long-term sustainable and profitable growth. While there is still work to be done, I have every confidence that AIG's stakeholders will continue to reap the benefit of the hard work that is taking place across the organization on our journey to make AIG a top-performing company.  \n The turnaround of General Insurance and the enterprise-wide transformation at AIG is on a scale I've not seen in my 45-plus year career. I take great pride in what the team has accomplished. I know that the company and our colleagues will be in great hands with Peter as the CEO of AIG.  \n Now I'll turn the call over to Peter. Thank you, Mark. Operator, we're ready for the Q&A. Okay. So Peter, the question is on the repurchase and leverage at AIG, I believe. So do you want to start? And maybe Mark can jump in if he has to. Peter? I think Mark wants to add something, Peter. Thanks. Peter? Okay, Tom. Mark, I think it's for you. Thanks, Tracy. Peter, I think you should address that one. Peter? I think Mark wanted to add something too, David. Peter, do you want to take that? So let's have Mark talk about it, the 90%, and then we'll take it from there. Go ahead, Mark. And Josh, don't forget this is a -- Josh, don't forget this is both commercial and personal. It's the entire book of business going below 90%. And the Personal Lines is not getting the kind of rate increases in Commercial. So you just got to put that weighted average in too. \n Do you have -- you asked your questions didn't you, Josh? I appreciate that, Josh. Thank you very much. Peter? Yes. Do you have another follow-up there? Kevin, do you want to do that? Okay. So thank you all for all your questions. Before I end the call, I want to thank everyone who's been part of the multiyear journey that began when I joined AIG in 2017 to fix the fundamental needed -- fundamentals needed for AIG to once again be a leading insurance franchise. \n What has been accomplished over the last few years would not have been possible without the extraordinary efforts of AIG's exceptional talent at all levels of the organization.

            "name": "Peter Zaffino",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, I'd like to cover 4 topics that are key areas of focus for us in 2021 and which we will update you on each quarter: the separation of Life and Retirement from AIG, capital management, progress we've made on AIG 200 and financial and operating highlights for General Insurance and Life and Retirement.  \n 2020 was a pivotal year for AIG, and I'm pleased to report that 2021 has gotten off to a good and fast start due to the momentum we have coming into the new year. Like 2020, this year will be another year of substantial progress for our company.  \n As Brian noted, we made a critical and strategic decision last October to separate the Life and Retirement business from AIG. We could not have made this decision without the significant turnaround taking place in General Insurance and solid performance in Life and Retirement. Our fourth quarter results provided further evidence that each of our businesses remain financially strong, market leaders and well positioned for profitable growth over the long term in their respective markets.  \n Since our last earnings call, we've been working purposefully and with a sense of urgency on several fronts related to separation. We are actively working towards an IPO of up to 19.9% of Life and Retirement with teams focused on stand-alone audited financials, actuarial work and rating agency discussions, among other things. Based on our work to date, we continue to believe that no additional equity capital will be required, given the improvement in our subsidiary capital positions over the last few years.  \n Additionally, in connection with our October announcement, we received inquiries from parties interested in strategically aligning with us and potentially purchasing the 19.9% stake in Life and Retirement. We are pleased with the level of interest and quality of potential partners for Life and Retirement business and believe a sale of a minority stake could be an attractive option for AIG, its shareholders and other stakeholders. We are carefully weighing the relative merits of this path compared to a minority IPO, taking into account the impact on value creation for AIG, execution certainty, regulatory and rating agency implications and delivery of Life and Retirement's growth strategy over the long term. As you know, any decisions we make will be subject to regulatory approvals. Overall, I am very pleased with the progress we are making on the separation, and we'll provide a further update in the near term.  \n Turning to capital management. We ended 2020 with parent liquidity of $10.5 billion, a $2.9 billion increase from 2019. We entered 2021 with significant financial flexibility as a result of our focus on derisking, capital management and liquidity, particularly in 2020 as a result of COVID-19.  \n We will continue to invest in our businesses to support growth and operational transformation, and we will return at least $500 million of capital to our shareholders through stock repurchases in the first half of 2021. This amount will more than offset dilution from stock-based compensation, which, at a minimum, will be a core principle of our capital management strategy going forward.  \n As we move forward on the path to separate Life and Retirement and generate capital, we will continue to focus on delevering and investing in growth in our businesses. We also intend to be active and prudent managers of capital and return it to shareholders when appropriate. Our current expectation is that an initial disposition of 19.9% of Life and Retirement, whether through a minority IPO or sale to a third party, will generate net proceeds such that some portion can be used towards further share repurchases. And while it is not currently a priority, over time, we may consider inorganic growth opportunities that would be accretive to our businesses and growth strategy and otherwise create value for our shareholders and other stakeholders. Once we make a decision on the initial step of the separation of Life and Retirement, we will provide more detail on our medium- and longer-term capital management priorities.  \n Now I'd like to provide an update on AIG 200. As a reminder, AIG 200 has core -- 4 core objectives: underwriting excellence, modernizing our operating infrastructure, enhancing user and customer experience and becoming a more unified company. Throughout 2020, we made measurable progress in spite of the ongoing remote work environment and, in some cases, accelerated certain initiatives. On December 31, we completed the sale of our shared services operations to Accenture, which streamlines our operating model. We've made significant progress in driving improvements in infrastructure and systems architecture while reducing real estate costs and other general operating expenses. We exceeded our target run rate savings for 2020, and the costs required to achieve were lower than initially expected. We exited 2020 with a $400 million run rate benefit, which was 30% ahead of the guidance we provided in 2020.  \n The success of AIG 200 to date demonstrates the discipline and rigor that the team leading the strategic initiative is using. The team is taking decisive action as we execute to position the company for the long term. AIG 200 success to date also reflects the resiliency and flexibility of our global colleagues who have embraced change while making significant contributions to our progress.  \n In 2021, a major focus of AIG 200 will be advancing our digital strategy through effective use of data and process-enabling technologies as well as driving greater operational efficiencies and improved customer experience. We also expect to make significant progress in 2021 on a global data warehouse in support of our finance and underwriting transformations. Our overall target for AIG 200 remain unchanged. We still expect to achieve run rate savings of $650 million by the end of 2021 and to deliver aggregate run rate savings of $1 billion by the end of 2022 against the total investment of $1.3 billion.  \n Turning to our financial results. I'll start with General Insurance. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we saw growth in net premium written in our commercial businesses, with year-over-year net premium written increasing 7% after adjusting for foreign exchange, driven by improved retention and higher rates. North America Commercial grew approximately 10% with meaningful growth from AIG Re, and International was up 5% after adjusting for foreign exchange.  \n As we previously outlined, North America Personal Insurance continued to experience reduced net premium volumes. This was primarily due to our decision to strategically reposition our high net worth business to Syndicate 2019, the partnership we established with Lloyd's, which resulted in higher ceded premium and the impact of COVID-19 on lines such as Travel and Accident & Health. While it's still very early in the year, based on what we are seeing, we expect a similar overall growth trend to continue particularly in commercial, and we will achieve top line growth for the full year 2021.  \n Turning to the combined ratio. We achieved another quarter of positive results in our core business with continued improvement in underwriting margins. In the fourth quarter, the accident year combined ratio excluding CATs improved by 290 basis points to 92.9% compared to 95.8% a year ago. This improvement was led by our commercial businesses, which improved our accident year combined ratio excluding CATs by 440 basis points with International Commercial improving by 490 basis points and North America Commercial improving by 400 basis points. \n The adjusted accident year combined ratio for the full year 2020 was 94.1%, a 190 basis point improvement year-over-year. Commercial's adjusted accident year combined ratio for the full year 2020 was 93.2%, a 340 basis point improvement year-over-year. These combined ratio improvements reflect very strong performance as General Insurance continues to benefit from an improved business mix in the commercial portfolio driven by the strategic underwriting actions we have been taking.  \n Turning to rate. In the fourth quarter, we continue to see considerable improvement and tighter terms and conditions. In commercial, we saw a sustained strong rate momentum and improvement across all lines of business with the exception of workers' compensation.  \n For the fourth quarter, our commercial business achieved rate increases of approximately 15%. North America Commercial rate increases were 21% in the fourth quarter compared to 14% in the prior year quarter. This improvement was driven by Excess Casualty, which saw rate increases of 45%; Financial Lines with rate increases of over 25%, led by 35% increases in D&O; Retail Property and Lexington wholesale property both achieving approximately 30% rate increases; and Lexington casualty with 25% rate increases.  \n International Commercial rate increases remained strong at 14% in the fourth quarter with second half 2020 rate improvement accelerating from the first half of the year. The largest rate increases were in global energy with over 30% increases, Financial Lines with 20% increases, Talbot with over 15% increases and Commercial Property with 15% increase.  \n Turning to Validus Re 1/1 renewals. Overall, we saw solid risk-adjusted rate improvements in U.S. property CAT, U.S. Casualty, international CAT, marine and energy, Financial Lines and specialty lines. For U.S. proportional business, material underlying rate improvement was generally applicable for our assumed portfolio. In international, rate improvements were achieved in essentially every territory.  \n Validus achieved a material increase in net written premium at the January 1 renewal period, which generated better balance across our portfolio, led by international property. New business, along with final signings across our portfolio, were very favorable as well. With respect to reinsurance AIG purchased, overall, we're extremely pleased with the outcome of our January 1 renewals in a challenging market environment. This was a critical year for us to evolve our reinsurance program strategically to reflect our significantly improved underlying portfolio.  \n In General Insurance, we maintained our philosophy of partnership with reinsurers and reducing volatility in the portfolio. We restructured our core placements in every major treaty. Keep in mind that AIG places over 35 treaties at 1/1, so I'll provide a few key highlights.  \n We reduced the aggregate amount of property catastrophe limit purchase as a result of a significantly reduced gross exposure in property PMLs. We reduced the catastrophe per occurrence attachment points in North America from $500 million to $200 million for all territories except the Southeast and Gulf, which remained at $500 million. We reduced the global shared aggregate limit retention in North America from $750 million to $500 million. We purchased a CAT program for PCG, our high net worth business, that protects Syndicate 2019 at AIG without taking on additional net limit. We reduced our overall catastrophe premium cost by over $150 million.  \n In our casualty quota share, we improved the ceding commission by 4 points and reduced our overall cession. We also introduced a new excess layer of $10 million excess of $15 million to remain consistent with our risk appetite. Those were just some of the highlights of our 1/1 renewal season. We are particularly pleased with the ongoing support we receive from the global reinsurance market, particularly our core partners. \n With respect to Life and Retirement, the business continued sequential improvement, generating quarterly adjusted pretax income of $1 billion and adjusted return on segment common equity of 16.4%. For the full year 2020, adjusted pretax income was $3.5 billion and adjusted return on segment common equity was 13.9%. Result for 2020 reflected higher private equity returns and higher call and tender income driven by lower interest rates and tighter credit spreads. This was partially offset by the impact of COVID-19 mortality, lower fair value option bond income and base spread compression. Life and Retirement's strong performance in the face of macroeconomic stress and high levels of volatility during 2020 is a testament to the quality of its balance sheet, diversified product offerings and disciplined risk management. The hedge program performed as expected throughout the year, and the balance sheet remained strong.  \n Life and Retirement has a large and diverse in-force portfolio and, as a result of the Fortitude sale, has relatively limited net exposure to legacy blocks of business, no long-term care exposure and limited risks associated with pre-2010 variable annuity living benefits. This broad portfolio across products and channels was particularly advantageous during 2020. Given the disruption in retail sales during the year, the team focused on attractive opportunities to deploy capital in the Institutional Markets business, resulting in strong growth for both pension risk transfer transactions, direct and through reinsurance; and GIC issuances.  \n Group Retirement maintained steady payroll deduction periodic deposits and improved large group plan retention results. Overall, Life and Retirement remains well positioned to meet the ever-growing needs for protection, retirement savings and lifetime income solutions.  \n As I mentioned, we entered 2021 with significant momentum and a continued sense of urgency on our path to becoming a top-performing company. I'd like to thank our colleagues around the world for their focus and determination in supporting one another while delivering significant value to our stakeholders. Thanks to their efforts, we made tremendous progress in 2020, a year when the world changed for everyone and every organization. The responsibility, accountability and opportunity that commercial enterprises face today surpass anything corporate America and the global business community have ever faced. In the months and years ahead, we will continue to adapt and evolve and introduce a stronger version of AIG as we strive to become a leading global insurance franchise.  \n I'm privileged to be taking on the role of Chief Executive Officer of AIG and appreciate the opportunity to lead this company. I want to thank Brian for his partnership over the many years we've worked together and for asking me to join him at AIG back in 2017. Professionally, the last few years have presented the greatest challenge in my career, but I know that this experience will also be the most rewarding. And I want to extend a special thanks to Brian on behalf of all of our colleagues for his leadership, commitment to solving complex problems and building a foundation of stability that has positioned us well for the future. I look forward to continuing our work together as Brian steps into his new role as Executive Chairman.  \n Now I'll turn it over to Mark. Yes, sure. I think Elyse, what I said in my October comments and then just reinforced and provided a little bit more detail on the prepared remarks is that we have made assumptions in terms of the stand-alone Life and Retirement business with acceptable debt and capital structure that is going to work with the rating agencies. We've also had assumed how we would set up AIG, the remaining company, with the guidance that Mark has given on our delevering. I focused that in my prepared remarks. It's our first priority. And we think that based on the base case, getting Life and Retirement set up, getting the delevering done at AIG, we think we will have capital available for share repurchase. That was the context of the comment I made. I don't know if you want to add anything, Mark. Thanks, Elyse. Yes, this momentum will continue. As we look into 2021, we expect to see rate increases to continue. We expect to see these rate increases to be above loss cost. We expect that these rate increases will be balanced across our global portfolio and across multiple lines of business. And so this is a very disciplined market, one that our capacity is highly valued. And as we deploy it in property and casualty, we're going to be very disciplined in making sure we get the right price for the exposure, make sure that we're there to solve problems for our broker distribution partners and clients. Well, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I mean, we have received a number of inbound inquiries, high-quality companies. And those high-quality companies see the real value in our Life and Retirement franchise, a very diversified portfolio, minimal legacy. And so how they are approaching AIG is that they want to do something strategically on the 19.9% because that's what we've outlined. But we are focused on how we drive long-term value for Life and Retirement with any partner that we decide to go with, in the event we do go with that over the initial public offering. And that's -- we're working towards that as a primary focus. So I don't want to go into the specific details because we don't have them. But you should just think about it as, if we did enter into an agreement, it would be about positioning the business for more long-term success. Maybe I'll start. And then -- thanks, Tracy. And then I'll turn over to Mark. Just 2 things to keep in mind. One is the net premium written. What I said in my prepared remarks on how we've restructured the reinsurance fee, $10 million excess of $15 million was purchased in December. So you would have seen that as an impact on net premium written for the casualty lines in the fourth quarter. So that's one. \n And two is I just want to reinforce Mark's point and give you an example in terms of what we're doing with the Excess Casualty book. We had talked about we were, years ago, over 90% lead in what we were doing in Excess Casualty and wanted to make sure that we were getting better balance. And so the team led by Dave McElroy, Barbara Luck have done an amazing job. We now have increased like our mid-excess by over 400% in terms of policy count. So the book is changing and getting better balance across the portfolio. \n And you don't really see that, but I think that's to Mark's point before when he was commenting on the vast changes, the improvement of the portfolio. So that just needs to emerge a little bit over time, but I think we have done some very strong work on the underwriting side. And the balance is much better as we position ourselves for the future. \n Mark, I don't know if you want to add anything in terms of just Excess Casualty specifically. Okay. Yes. Thanks, Tracy. The 19.9% remains the base case. We think it's the best way forward for the organization. We're working on all the different work streams that I outlined in my prepared remarks, working with all of our stakeholders and believe that, that will be the path that maximizes value for the organization. Thanks, Yaron. It's hard to give specific guidance in terms of whether it's going to be high single digits or even more. I mean we have a lot of momentum in the commercial portfolio. We talked about strong retention, strong rate. \n New business in 2020 was impacted by -- if I look globally, particularly in international and some of the Specialty classes, our new business was very strong but it wasn't at the normal levels that we expect within 2021. And again, we're still in the global pandemic. We'll see -- with the economic recovery, we're cautious but we're optimistic that new business will continue to pick up. And we believe our retentions will get stronger. And so we're very optimistic that we'll have very good growth balance across commercial globally next year. \n I don't know, Dave, if you want to add anything in particular on the new business and your optimism of growth. I'll give it to Kevin. [ That is his work ]. Kevin? Yes. Can I just add to that? Thanks, Josh. I mean a couple of things to keep in mind. One is AIG 200 contributes a meaningful portion of the improvement in expense ratio. Now while I said $400 million was the exit run rate of 2020, that hasn't even fully earned in yet. So we expect the full $1 billion by 2022. So you can just do the math that, that will contribute to the expense ratio and overall combined ratio. \n The other is we think there's 2 components to growth. One is, Dave mentioned it, that we think that the portfolio is in a very good place for top line growth, and we would expect to see that to continue in 2021 and 2022. In addition, contributing to that growth will be we need less reinsurance. I think the terms and conditions that we were able to improve at 1/1 speak volumes in terms of the trajectory and what we would expect for reinsurance going forward. That will contribute. \n I think when we do, and the team has proven it does very good work on operational excellence, that when we separate Life and Retirement AIG RemainCo, we will find ways to improve the expense ratio as we work through the actual separation, and we have a very disciplined expense behavior in the company. And then just the rate above loss cost and as we continue to reposition the portfolio, we think there will be improvement in the loss ratio as we look to the future. So when you add all of those components together, we are very confident that we will be below the 90% as we exit 2022. Yes. And Mark, you can weigh in. I mean certainly, the path with the IPO is very clear with the 19.9% IPO sale. When we look at -- I think the heart of your question on the private is that it has to be a better alternative for us. We have to be more strategic, more financially advantageous and making certain that when we look at the 19.9%, we don't look at that in isolation. We look at the 80.1% and how we position the Life and Retirement business for the future. So those are the things, among other factors, that we will consider in terms of do we go through the IPO or would we do a private sale as we work through the coming months."

            "name": "Mark Lyons",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Before I go into the fourth quarter results, I want to highlight that we resegmented our financials this quarter and now have 3 business segments: General Insurance, Life and Retirement and Other Operations. The historical recasted information and description of the changes were in the 8-K filed on February 1 and posted on our website and were principally the elimination of the legacy segment and the realignment of its book into Life and Retirement and Other Operations as well as some small shifts within General Insurance.  \n Turning to the quarter. AIG reported adjusted pretax income or APTI of $1.1 billion and adjusted after-tax income of $827 million or $0.94 per diluted share compared to $923 million or $1.03 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019. The key drivers of this quarter were: first, a General Insurance accident year 2020 combined ratio ex CAT of 92.9%, which is a 290 basis point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2019; second, strong Life and Retirement APTI of $1 billion, driven by Individual and Group Retirement as well as Institutional Markets activity and strong net investment income; thirdly, $3.2 billion of consolidated net investment income on an APTI basis, primarily reflecting higher private equity and hedge fund income.  \n Moving to General Insurance. Fourth quarter adjusted pretax income was $809 million, up $31 million year-over-year as increased net investment income from alternatives offset the impact of higher catastrophe losses, which totaled $545 million pretax or 9 loss ratio points this quarter compared to 6.5 loss ratio points in the prior year quarter. The CAT losses were comprised of $367 million of natural CATs primarily related to fourth quarter events Hurricane Zeta, the East Troublesome and Silverado fires and Hurricane Delta, along with revised estimates for Hurricane Sally, which occurred late in the quarter and Hurricane Laura, where Delta has a similar path. \n Additionally, there were $178 million of COVID-related losses primarily related to Travel, Contingency and Validus Re.  Prior year development or PYD was slightly unfavorable this quarter at $45 million compared to favorable development of $139 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter included $51 million of net unfavorable development in North America and $6 million of net favorable development internationally.  \n The North America unfavorable PYD was driven mostly by Financial Lines, EPLI, E&O and mergers and acquisition insurance primarily from accident years 2016 to 2018 and thus not covered by the ADC, with favorable indications primarily in GL, AIGRM, some workers' compensation units and short-tail lines. As an additional lens, the $45 million of unfavorable development was also split as $5 million unfavorable in global Commercial Lines and $40 million unfavorable in global Personal Lines, primarily driven by adverse development in prior year CATs as opposed to attritional losses. As usual, there is net favorable amortization from the ADC, which amounted to $52 million this quarter.  \n I'll point out that our 2020 net premium profile is now skewed towards our international operations, totaling 57% of global net premium. Furthermore, the international book is nearly evenly balanced between Commercial and Personal Lines, and this demonstrates the truly global platform of our General Insurance business, led by an international book that has had better results with less volatility than North America. We expect these proportions to stay approximately the same in 2021 but skewed a bit less towards international as North America Commercial growth strengthens.  \n A key indicator of the turnaround of our General Insurance business is the improvement in the accident year ex CAT combined ratio results for North America and International Commercial Lines. As Peter has noted, North American Commercial had an accident quarter (sic) [ year ] combined ratio ex CAT that was 400 basis points better than last year's quarter to 93.6%, and International Commercial Lines improved their accident year combined ratio ex CAT by 490 basis points to 89.2%. We continue to view the current accident year prudently, with an appropriate view towards the margin of safety as the book has undergone a massive transformation and also anticipate continued margin expansion into 2021, resulting from the favorable global market conditions.  \n As Peter discussed, our Personal Insurance premium and underwriting results continue to be impacted by the repositioning of our high net worth business and the global pandemic. North America Personal Lines was impacted the most with an accident year combined ratio ex CAT of 102.6% versus 92.2% in the prior year quarter and a 55% drop in net premiums written.  \n In 2021, our year-over-year comparisons will begin to improve, although the first quarter will still be unfavorable since COVID was just beginning to impact Travel and Syndicate 2019 was formed in the second quarter of 2020. On the other hand, our International Personal Insurance business continues to perform well with a 93.9% accident year ex CAT combined ratio, which is 130 basis point improvement from 95.2% in 2019, reflecting favorable Japanese auto trends and improving business mix, offset slightly by the Travel book. Expense management also contributed to the improvement with 160 basis point reduction in the General Insurance expense ratio driven by lower acquisition ratio compared to the prior year quarter.  \n Lastly, before we leave General Insurance, we'd like to reiterate our outlook for a sub-90 accident year combined ratio ex CAT by the end of 2022. The 94.1% that we achieved in 2020 is a significant accomplishment, but there is more to come with the significant reunderwriting of the book over the past few years as well as the current very firm commercial lines market. We're highly confident that we will achieve more progress in 2021 and 2022 as we reestablish AIG's leadership in General Insurance.  \n Now turning to Life and Retirement. Adjusted pretax income was $1 billion for the quarter, up 20% compared to the prior year quarter. Total Life and Retirement premium and deposits increased by 4% compared to the prior year quarter driven by 2 large  GIC issuances. In addition, pension risk transfer activity grew sequentially.  \n Life and Retirement continued to see a rebound in retail annuity sales as distribution partners became more accustomed to the new environment with higher sequential sales for both Variable and Index Annuities. Fixed Annuities sales were lower sequentially as Life and Retirement maintained pricing discipline in this challenging rate environment. Although still lower than the prior year, Index Annuities sales continued to grow sequentially, contributing strong positive net flows, helping offset declines in Variable and Fixed Annuity net flows. \n Group Retirement net flows improved from the prior year quarter due to strong group plan acquisition and retention results, reflecting the investments made to modernize that platform. On February 8, AIG announced the sale of its Retail Mutual Fund business. This sale has a nearly immaterial impact on APTI but will benefit our overall net flow metrics, given the platform has generally experienced significant outflows over the last few years.  \n Base investment spreads for Variable and Index Annuities, Fixed Annuities and Group Retirement were virtually flat sequentially. As noted in previous quarters, Life and Retirement's reported base investment spread compression was impacted by substantially lower returns on cash and short-term investments through 2020. Excluding this impact, based on the environment we see today, we continue to expect base spread compression across the portfolio in the range of 8 to 16 basis points annually.  \n Recognizing the limits of sensitivities, especially in times of macroeconomic uncertainty and this higher market volatility, our sensitivity estimates for U.S. equity markets and rates are as follows. We would expect a plus or minus 1% change in equity market returns to respectively increase or decrease adjusted pretax income by approximately $40 million to $50 million annually. A plus or minus 10 basis points movement on the 10-year reinvestment rates would increase or decrease earnings by approximately $10 million to $20 million annually. As always, it is important to note that these market sensitivity ranges are not exact nor linear since our earnings are also impacted by the timing and degree of movements as well as other factors.  \n Moving to Other Operations, which now includes portions of the legacy segment from prior General Insurance exposures, had an adjusted pretax loss of $720 million, inclusive of $292 million of losses for consolidation and eliminations, which this quarter principally reflects realized capital gains on private equities, which are recorded as NII in the subsidiaries but eliminated in Other Operations' APTI and recorded as realized capital gains in net income, not AATI. \n For the quarter, corporate interest expenses were slightly higher than the prior year, reflecting the interest on the $4.1 billion of senior notes issued in May 2020 and Other Operations' GOE was down $38 million from the comparable quarter last year. For 2021, we expect both corporate interest expense and GOE to decrease due to debt repayments and lower corporate expenses. However, we expect continued volatility in asset management and in the consolidation and elimination lines due to returns, interest rates and credit spread volatility.  \n Shifting to investments. Net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.2 billion or $236 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2019, principally due to the June 2020 sale of Fortitude whose investment income was included in the prior year's quarter. Adjusting the fourth quarter 2019 accordingly, this quarter's net investment income on an APTI basis was $262 million or 9% higher than the prior year and reflected the strongest quarterly returns in 2020 for hedge funds and private equity as well as having strong bond tender and call premiums. It's also worth noting that on a full year basis, net investment income on an APTI basis excluding Fortitude was $11.8 billion.  \n Turning to the balance sheet. At December 31, 2020, book value per common share was $76.46, up 3.5% from September 20, 2020, and adjusted book value per share was $57.01, up slightly from September 30.  \n As Peter mentioned, at year-end, AIG parent had cash and short-term liquidity assets of $10.5 billion. And during the quarter, we repaid our December debt maturity of $708 million, bringing our debt leverage for year-end 2020 to 28.4%, which is 220 basis points lower than second quarter of 2020 when we raised $4.1 billion of senior notes to prefinance 2020 and 2021 maturing debt. \n Our primary operating subsidiaries remain profitable and well capitalized. For General Insurance, we estimate the U.S. pool fleet risk-based capital ratio for year-end 2020 to be approximately 455% and Life and Retirement is estimated to be approximately 430%, both above our target ranges and both providing a good absorbency buffer. The impacts from investment downgrades and credit losses to our RBC ratios were less than anticipated, reflecting a high-quality investment portfolio that is positioned well to navigate the uncertain environment. \n And with respect to the capital management in 2021, as intended, we repaid $1.5 billion of maturing senior notes on February 1, which reduces our leverage ratio by about 1.6 points on a pro forma basis, approaching towards our 25% leverage target. In addition, we repurchased approximately 92 million of shares to offset dilution associated with AIG warrants that were exercised prior to expiration on January 19, 2021. As Peter mentioned, we intend to repurchase additional common shares in the first half of 2021 to manage dilution. And in addition, we expect to execute some liability management actions in the first half of 2021 to facilitate the Life and Retirement separation. \n And with that, I'll now turn it back over to Brian. No, I think you covered it, Peter. Yes, if I could. Elyse, also, as Peter's kind of noted, we -- the momentum has been strong. We have really seen no evidence of deceleration of it. It's pretty broad-based across all lines and geographies. And I would just remind you that the timing was different internationally versus in North America. So it started a little bit later. So its trajectory is going to be different by definition, and thus far, no slowdowns. Yes, happy to. So a few things I could just point out is that in North America, we had -- we recognized in Financial Lines, I'd say on the EPLI side, a little bit on the E&O side and the mergers and acquisitions insurance, some little changes in M&A insurance. Originally, it was a product that was really to sellers and now sellers and buyers. That kind of changes your forecasted utilization and things like that. So there's some recognition there which I think makes some sense. \n In the past, when we've talked about this, we've always focused on like primary D&O and SCAs and so forth. And every assumption that we had on the public side is still coming to bear. No matter how we look at it, our commercial book, our national book, the SCAs continue to drop as the underwriting continues to improve, and that's been a steady pattern. \n What we would say this time is really on the private not-for-profit side, mostly centered in the EPLI, we saw some trends that we recognized. But we think we're in pretty good shape. We think we pretty much nailed it at this point. \n And I would say, the second part of your question, on a go-forward, this book has had such massive transformation that the predictive value, given the turnover of the past to the future, is almost nonexistent. So we use it. We try to carve all those things out, index forward. But the impact of that on such a transformed book is negligible. So the net is we're very comfortable with where '19 and '20 are. Yes, sure. Two things. One, I'll follow up on your direct question, which is on the rate changes and rate adequacy. \n And secondly, I think on the fin sup, we could have done a little better job. We said Excess Casualty was really the Lexington casualty, which really has primary in it. The traditional admitted casualty book that's either written out of American home or like London or Bermuda has performed very, very well during the year. And so I'm just letting you know that this is not an issue whatsoever. So it's really a combination of Lexington primary and excess. \n But my comments will now address all of that. So as you know, rate changes have not only been large, they've been compound over a period. The terms and conditions which drive this line of business are tighter and tighter. And whether you have a calm or an aggressive view of loss cost trends that could affect casualty businesses, getting further away from risk is the preferred way to go, and that's the strategy that Peter and Dave have put in place, moving that portfolio higher so you're further away from risk in case anything unforeseen happens. \n So we're very comfortable with that. We're very comfortable on -- our indications are that the rate adequacy as opposed to rate change is stronger on new business than it is on renewal business, which you'd expect to be the case in a hard cycle of acceleration like we have. And we continue to see inferior rate adequacy on the business we're not renewing. So that's what I call the implicit lift as opposed to the explicit lift. So we feel good about that. Yes. Yaron, if I could, I'm going to purposely give you an arithmetic view. And it's this -- Peter touched on it a bit with the XOL when he was talking about some of the reinsurance. So loss-occurring contracts, you basically have ceded written all bulleted, right, in the quarter, and then it's earned smoothly. Risk-attaching quota shares, you see the recognition quarter-by-quarter. So from a net earned basis, which is what's going to really matter, you're going to see much more uplift on a net earned basis over the course of the year. The benefit of a smaller cession on the casualty quota share will overwhelm the additional XOL cession. So you'll see that increase, right, but it won't be at 1Q. You're going to see that over the course of the year. So I think -- Peter and I go back and forth on this. On the 90% which we are, Josh, reiterating, Peter will get into some of the expense ratio aspects of it. \n With regard to loss ratio, that was the second part of it, well, we would expect improving margins as well as we go through '21 and '22. We're viewing that as exit though, Josh. So that's much closer and equivalent to 4Q. But the -- but nevertheless, you have to watch the compound growth or change because as the book continues to improve, and it's improved fabulously, the degree of improvement narrows and narrows and narrows that you can do. So the big, huge changes have already occurred, but we're comfortable on our cadence and approach to get there. Peter?"

And the 10-Q will be filed later today after the call.\n Today's remarks may contain forward-looking statements, including comments relating to company performance, strategic priorities, including the announced planned separation of our Life and Retirement business, business mix and market conditions, including the effects of COVID-19 on AIG. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. Actual performance and events may materially differ. Factors that could cause results to differ include the factors described in our second quarter 2020 report on Form 10-Q and our 2019 annual report on Form 10-K and our other recent filings made with the SEC, inclusive of the effects of COVID-19 on AIG, which cannot be fully determined at this time. AIG is not under any obligation and expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n Additionally, some remarks may refer to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website.\n I'll now turn the call over to Brian. \nBrian Duperreault: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Given the announcements we made last week, we will handle today's call differently with the objective to leave as much time as possible for your questions. I will focus most of my remarks on our leadership changes and the separation of Life and Retirement. Peter will expand on what the separation process will entail. He will provide an overview of our third quarter results for General Insurance and Life and Retirement and give an update on AIG 200. Lastly, Mark will provide additional color on our financial results for the quarter. Kevin Hogan, Dave McElroy and Doug Dachille will be available for the Q&A portion of the call.\n As you saw in our earnings release, AIG continues to manage through the ongoing global economic uncertainty. We are financially strong and well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities for growth. In the third quarter, we reported adjusted after-tax income of $0.81 per common share, and we saw improvement in both the accident year combined ratio in General Insurance and Life and Retirement's adjusted return on attributed common equity.\n As we announced last week, the AIG Board unanimously elected Peter to become the next Chief Executive Officer of AIG effective March 1. At that time, I will assume -- I will become Executive Chairman of the AIG Board. This leadership transition demonstrates our continuing momentum and focus on AIG's future. It's an honor to serve as a CEO of AIG, and I want to thank our directors for their ongoing support.\n I also want to congratulate Peter. I've worked with Peter in several capacities for many years, and I'm extremely proud of him and the legacy he is building in our industry. Since joining me at AIG in 2017, he designed and executed on the turnaround in our General Insurance business, which, by any measure, has been historic. I greatly admire Peter's strength of character, leadership abilities and willingness to take decisive action. He has a proven track record of building great teams and successfully leading them in times of significant change and growth. Peter exemplifies the rare executive who is both a hard-working operational leader and a strategic visionary. I know that he will be an excellent CEO for AIG, and the company will be in great hands.\n Turning to our second big announcement last week. As I stated before, we have continually examined the composite structure of AIG. And over the last several months with the assistance from independent financial and legal advisers, we conducted a very comprehensive review to determine if the change would be in the best interest of our shareholders and other stakeholders. This review included examining strategic, operational, capital and tax implications. And the output of this review was very clear, that is a simpler structure will benefit both GI and L&R. This is largely due to the significant foundational work our team has done across AIG to strengthen our businesses and position them as market leaders.\n In addition, impediments to a separation that existed back in 2017 have greatly diminished. For example, the tax benefits of AIG's current composite structure have decreased over time. And with the stronger capitalization of our core business, the capital diversification benefit has become less significant. We believe our businesses will be more resilient as separate companies with more appropriate and sustainable valuations, and each will continue to be market leaders in their respective sectors with strong balance sheets, appropriate capital structures, attractive earnings and cash flows. We also believe both will have sufficient financial flexibility to compete effectively. We do not anticipate that either will require additional capital -- equity capital in connection with the separation, and neither will be overleveraged, especially when compared to their respective peers.\n We have evaluated various structural alternatives for the separation, and Peter will provide details on our initial conclusions. While the separation process will be complex and will, of course, require regulatory approvals, we are confident that we will execute in a way that provides the best long-term value for shareholders and other stakeholders. We are committed to transparency and providing you with updates as the process moves forward.\n Now I'll turn it over to Peter. \nPeter Zaffino: Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Brian. I appreciate your kind words and want to thank the AIG Board for the opportunity to lead this company. As Brian noted, we are living through a sustained period of global economic challenges. At AIG, we are well prepared as our purpose is to partner with our clients, especially during challenging times, to help them solve complex risk issues, capture opportunities in all market cycles and provide a consistent approach to providing insurance solutions in this period of uncertainty. We continually ask ourselves whether the things that worked well yesterday will continue to work tomorrow and into the future.\n This morning, I will expand on Brian's comments regarding key areas we're focused on. I'll start with additional insight into our plan to separate Life and Retirement from AIG. Then I'll provide an overview of the third quarter results for General Insurance and Life and Retirement. And lastly, I'll briefly outline our progress on AIG 200.\n With respect to Life and Retirement, as Brian said, we undertook a comprehensive review of our composite structure over the last several months. We concluded that over time, the value of full separation can create for our shareholders will be significantly greater than maintaining our current structure. Our analysis took into account many factors, including potential impediments and benefits.\n Among the more significant factors are: One, the progress we've made since late 2017 to strengthen the foundation of General Insurance materially reduce risk and volatility in our portfolio and position General Insurance as a market leader poised for sustainable, profitable growth. A separation of Life and Retirement from AIG would not be possible without a strong General Insurance business that can support itself and thrive on a stand-alone basis.\n Two, we believe that we can effectively manage any loss of diversification benefits in our capital model as a result of separation. Our current expectation is that no additional equity capital will be required given the improvements in our subsidiary capital positions over the last 3 years. This is especially true in General Insurance, where the capital base is stronger than it's been in many years.\n Three, the separation process will require us to implement a stand-alone capital structure for Life and Retirement. This will involve raising new debt at Life and Retirement and restructuring debt at AIG parent. In the end, both companies will have independent capital structures in line with peers and appropriate financial leverage for their respective ratings. Both companies will also have strong financial flexibility to execute on their strategic priorities.\n Four, AIG's deferred tax asset is no longer an obstacle as it was in the past. The DTA is made up of net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits. With respect to the net operating losses, we expect AIG to have taxable income post-separation that is sufficient to utilize the remaining $6.6 billion before they expire. The foreign tax credit carryforwards have been significantly utilized in recent years, and we expect to utilize the vast majority of the remaining $1.5 billion before we deconsolidate Life and Retirement, leaving only a small portion potentially at risk.\n And five, there is a limited number of legal entity restructurings required to achieve a separation as well as limited expense dis-synergies. In fact, we will leverage the important work we're doing as part of AIG 200 to facilitate operational separation.\n While the precise form of separation will be subject to AIG Board and regulatory approvals, rating agency considerations and market conditions, we currently contemplate either an IPO or private sale of up to 19.9% of Life and Retirement, followed by one or more dispositions of our remaining ownership interest over time. We're proceeding with a sense of urgency to determine the initial step of the separation and will continue to engage with regulators and rating agencies throughout the process.\n Finally, we do not intend to break up Life and Retirement and sell it in pieces, as the significant strength of the business is the breadth of its platform and diversified product portfolio and distribution network. Throughout the separation process, we will remain laser-focused on continuing to position our businesses to deliver superior value to our clients, distribution partners, shareholders and other stakeholders.\n Turning to our third quarter. In General Insurance, we achieved another quarter of positive results in our core business with continued improvement in our underwriting margins. The accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophe, improved by 260 basis points to 93.3% compared to 95.9% a year ago and by 610 basis points compared to 99.4% in the third quarter of 2018. The improvement was driven by our Commercial business, which improved by approximately 560 basis points year-over-year as a result of lower accident year loss ratio, excluding CAT, and a lower expense ratio. The lower Commercial accident year loss ratio ex CAT reflects a higher-quality book of business, driven by a better mix and portfolio management actions. \n In Personal Insurance, not surprisingly, our portfolio mix continues to be impacted by COVID-19, which has reduced premium volumes by more than 80% in our Travel business alone. The mix of business was further impacted in North America Personal Insurance due to the reinsurance cessions related to Syndicate 2019.\n With respect to CAT, the third quarter was very active with low to moderate severity per event in both North America and Japan with an upper industry range of $45 billion globally. As we disclosed last week, our third quarter CAT loss estimates, net of reinsurance, totaled $790 million for the quarter. Included in this CAT number is $185 million of COVID-19 loss estimates. With respect to COVID-19, the loss estimates primarily related to Travel, Contingency and Validus Re. Our year-to-date COVID-related net loss estimates are slightly over $900 million.\n Our reinsurance program continues to perform as expected with recoveries in our International per occurrence, Private Client Group per occurrence and other discrete reinsurance programs limiting volatility. Regardless of frequency and severity of natural CATs and additional COVID-19-related losses, we expect overall CAT losses for the remainder of the year to be limited due to various protections we have in place under our aggregate CAT covers.\n Turning to rate. In the third quarter, our underwriting discipline continued as our team has pivoted to pursue premium growth while not losing our focus on account-level decisions, risk-adjusted rates and margin expansion. In Commercial, there is continued momentum in our portfolio optimization strategy, and we're seeing sustained rate-on-rate improvement across most lines of business. For the third quarter, our Commercial business had rate increases of approximately 17%. North America Commercial rate increases were 20% in the third quarter compared to 12% in the prior year. Rate increases in Admitted Property were over 30%. In Financial Lines, they were over 25% led by D&O. In Excess & Surplus Lines, they were over 20%. And in Excess Casualty, they were over 30%.\n International Commercial rate increases were 14% in the third quarter compared to 8% in the prior year, driven by Financial Lines and Specialty. Rate increases in Commercial Property were 12%. In Financial Lines, they were over 20% led by D&O. And in U.K. Specialty, they were over 25% led by energy, aviation and trade credit. It's important to note that the rates we're achieving are on a policy year basis and will take time to earn into our accident year results. Additionally, we're confident that the rate increases we are achieving are outpacing loss cost increases in our portfolio.\n Turning to Validus Re and upcoming 1/1 renewals, our team continues to be disciplined in deploying capacity and focus on acceptable terms and conditions as well as appropriate risk-adjusted rate changes. Double-digit rate increases are being quoted in most lines with tighter terms and conditions. Retro business is very active with meaningful double-digit rate increases being quoted with terms altering to modelled perils only with the occurrence covers being preferred over aggregate covers.\n Before turning to Life and Retirement, I want to provide context for how we view the rate environment in the P&C market. Insurance carriers have faced challenging business conditions for more than a decade. Soft market conditions have gripped the industry since 2007 and have been coupled with historically low interest rates and an increase in frequency and severity of natural catastrophes. As an example, when looking at Property, the expected aggregate industry natural CAT losses for 2017 through the third quarter of 2020 are estimated to exceed $400 billion. Median annual losses over the last 15 years have been approximately $65 billion. These amounts are nearly double the amount of expected loss. For natural catastrophes, pricing has adjusted in light of these new norms. And keep in mind, none of these numbers include catastrophe losses from COVID-19.\n With these challenges and the increasingly complex environment our clients are looking to us to help them manage, the work we do is becoming more complex. We believe our retention rates demonstrate the strength of our relationships with clients and distribution partners and confirm that a flight of quality has been backed from the fruition, particularly due to COVID. The momentum we have generated in General Insurance is significant and we believe that we will achieve top line growth in 2021. And by the end of 2022, we'll achieve an accident year combined ratio, excluding CATs, below 90%. This will represent a 1,000 basis point improvement since 2018.\n Turning to Life and Retirement. I've spent the last couple of months working with Kevin and his team to analyze this business. It is a franchise that is extremely well positioned in the market and has a track record of delivering consistent performance.\n Third quarter adjusted pretax income was $975 million, and adjusted return on attributed common equity was 14.5%. Third quarter results reflected strong performance in all lines of business, driven by recovering sales and strong equity market levels, resulting in favorable impacts to deferred acquisition costs and variable annuity reserves as well as higher private equity returns. Additionally, lower interest rates and tighter credit spreads drove higher call and tender income, which is a short-term benefit that will be offset in the long term in the form of additional base spread compression.\n The sensitivities Kevin previously discussed generally held up, recognizing the limits of sensitivities, especially in times of macroeconomic stress and high levels of volatility. As we noted in the second quarter, reported base investment spread compression has been impacted by substantially lower returns on our tactical cash and short-term investment position. Excluding this impact, base investment spreads would continue to be in the 8 to 16 basis points range of annual spread compression.\n Excluding estimated COVID-19-related deaths, mortality experience was favorable and consistent with pre-pandemic trends. Risk management efforts and discipline in Life and Retirement have continued to serve this business well. The hedge program has performed as expected, and our balance sheet remains strong. Additionally, we view our lack of large legacy blocks, such as long-term care, as a risk differentiator. As expected, retail annuity sales rebounded significantly from the historically low second quarter levels as our distribution partners became more accustomed to a new working environment. We also grew sales in Group Retirement and Institutional Markets where we successfully issued 3 large guaranteed investment contracts during the third quarter. Our total premiums and deposits decreased from second quarter levels, and we remain well positioned and confident to deploy capital as attractive opportunities arise across our business.\n Now let me provide a brief update on AIG 200. Since we announced AIG 200 in 2019, we have been focused on investing in our core processes and infrastructure in order to be more competitive in the marketplace and make real transformational change at AIG. A few key points I'd like to highlight. We are on track to deliver and will likely exceed our original guidance of $300 million exit run rate savings this year. We also expect to come in below the $350 million cost to achieve that we initially communicated for 2020. An important milestone we recently achieved was entering into a partnership with Accenture, whereby Accenture will acquire our existing shared services footprint.\n Working with the AIG global operations team, Accenture will help us to create a modern digital shared services platform with true end-to-end processes that will improve the user experience. This agreement is subject to regulatory approvals and marks the first phase of our overall relationship with Accenture, which we expect will expand over time. Our overall targets for AIG 200 remain unchanged. We still expect to deliver $1 billion of run rate savings by the end of 2022 against a $1.3 billion total investment. Lastly, we do not anticipate any delays or significant changes due to the planned separation of Life and Retirement.\n Before I turn it over to Mark, I'd like to end my remarks where I started, and thank Brian for his leadership over the last 3 years. Since I joined Brian in mid-2017, we have navigated truly unprecedented conditions. Throughout, Brian has remained steadfast in his commitment to build a world-leading insurance franchise with no shortcuts or quick fixes. I'm incredibly proud of what we achieved so far in our journey. Our colleagues have demonstrated unmatched resilience and a commitment to excellence in all that they do despite the significant disruption we've all experienced both personally and professionally due to COVID-19. I know I speak on behalf of all AIG colleagues when I say that we look forward to continuing to work with Brian as we close out 2020 and look ahead to a very bright future for our company.\n Now I'll turn it over to Mark. \nMark Lyons: Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. As Brian and Peter have already commented on the announced separation of the Life and Retirement business from AIG, I will briefly discuss the third quarter results in order to allow sufficient time for Q&A.\n AIG reported adjusted pretax income, or APTI, of $918 million and adjusted after-tax income of $709 million or $0.81 per diluted share compared to $505 million or $0.56 per share in the third quarter of 2019. The key drivers of this increased earnings were: one, a General Insurance underwriting gain, exclusive of the impact of catastrophes and prior year development, which improved $135 million compared to the third quarter of '19; second, a very strong Life and Retirement results, inclusive of the impact of the annual actuarial assumption update; third, solid net investment income results, up $271 million after adjusting the third quarter of 2019 for Fortitude, reflecting higher private equity and hedge fund income in addition to fixed maturity securities; fourth, reduced total AIG general operating expenses by approximately $200 million.\n Turning to General Insurance. Third quarter adjusted pretax income was $416 million, down $91 million from the third quarter of 2019, due primarily to the previously announced catastrophe losses of $790 million pretax, partially offset by higher net investment income stemming from alternatives. As with respect to prior year development, $16.1 billion of reserves were carried -- excuse me, were reviewed this quarter, bringing the year-to-date total reviews to more than 60% of carried reserves. The net result was unfavorable development of $13 million, which reflects $53 million of favorable development from amortization of the ADC deferred gain. So the unfavorable development was $66 million gross of this amortization impact.\n The areas reviewed were primary workers' compensation, environmental, program businesses, Western World, cyber, Personal Lines Property Casualty, Canada, U.K., Europe and Asia Pacific Casualty and Financial Lines as well as European short-tail lines. Next quarter's focus will be on U.S. Financial Lines and some Casualty areas. This quarter's PYD showed favorable development in North America, driven mostly by primary workers' compensation, California 2017 wildfire, subro (sic)  [ subrogation ] and short-tail lines and unfavorable developments internationally driven mostly by Financial Lines, large losses and U.K. and Europe Casualty, mostly in prior accident years.\n As Peter mentioned, the General Insurance business has continued to improve with an accident year combined ratio as adjusted of 93.3% in the quarter, a 260 basis point improvement from last year. North America was 96%, 250 basis points better than last year, while North American Commercial Lines was 630 basis points better than the prior year, 560 basis points of which emanated from an improved loss ratio.\n International improved, the accident year combined ratio as adjusted by 240 basis points, to 91% with International Commercial Lines better by 410 basis points, with 170 basis points of this emanating from an improved loss ratio. The global expense ratio was 180 basis points lower quarter-over-quarter, driven by an improved acquisition ratio. General Insurance also reduced their GOE by $76 million. The margin momentum in Commercial Lines reflects the hard work of the past several years with the added tailwinds of achieved rate in 2020 above our initial expectations. Both will drive margin improvement through 2021.\n I would also note that on a global basis, Personal Insurance results are not really comparable to last year due to the significant drop in Travel business, the formation of Syndicate 2019 for North American PCG business discussed last quarter and higher North American catastrophes, including the COVID impact on the Travel book. International Personal Insurance accident year combined ratio as adjusted improved by 80 basis points with favorable frequency in Japanese auto and a lower expense ratio. North American Personal Lines accident year combined ratio as adjusted was significantly higher to 118.6% due to the approximate 60% drop in net earned premium for the segment, led by Travel's nearly 80% reduction as well as the noise associated with the changes to PCG that was discussed on our prior call. Warranty, Personal A&H and Canadian Personal Lines all continued to perform well.\n With the Commercial Lines reunderwriting largely behind us, we are now pivoting to growth, which will become evident in early 2021, as near-term top line results are still impacted by Personal Insurance. Global gross premiums written were $8.3 billion in the quarter, down approximately 4% before the impact of currency. And net premiums written and earned were both down approximately 11%, principally due to Personal Insurance as well as the impact of reinsurance and portfolio management on the North American Commercial Lines book.\n In North America Commercial, net premiums written decreased by approximately 5%, reflecting the impact of reinsurance as stated, portfolio management actions and COVID, but retention and new business levels have improved the specific areas. For instance, our Lexington Property business grew by 20% year-over-year as a result of increased flow, continued rate increases and new business momentum. International Commercial's net premiums written increased by approximately 5%, reflecting significant rate momentum and growth in Financial Lines, Specialty and Talbot.\n North America Personal Insurance net premiums written was impacted by business mix shifts due to the lower Travel premium and the changes to PCG. As we enter 2021, we will retain approximately 25% of the PCG business, and the Syndicate structure will reduce the volatility of the overall Personal Lines book as was the case this quarter.\n International Personal Insurance net premiums written were down 10% on a constant dollar basis, principally because of the reduction in Travel premiums. Aside from Travel, most of the International Personal Insurance is in Japan, which had a slight decrease in premiums due to lower new business, also was the result of COVID.\n Now turning to Life and Retirement. Adjusted pretax income was $975 million for the quarter, up over 50% compared to the prior year with strong performance in most businesses. Third quarter adjusted return on attributed common equity was 14.5%, as Peter noted, and 12% on a year-to-date basis. Also, as Peter mentioned, Life and Retirement's retail annuity sales rebounded significantly from historically low second quarter levels. Sequentially, fixed annuities were up 144% to $942 million from the second quarter low of $387 million. Variable annuities were up 24% to $670 million, and index annuities were up 38% to $942 million. Life and Retirement also grew sales modestly in Group Retirement. And in Institutional Markets, several large guaranteed investment contracts were issued during the quarter, totaling approximately $1.2 billion.\n Total premiums and deposits increased from second quarter levels and net flows, although still negative, had a material rebound sequentially of over $612 million for fixed annuities and fixed index annuities alone.\n The balance sheet remains strong with a solid investment portfolio with limited exposure to large legacy blocks on the liability side, such as long-term care, prefinancial crisis variable annuities or long-duration payout annuities. While low interest rates in the last year will drive additional spread compression, the diversity of our product portfolio is a strength in this environment. Our annual actuarial assumption update, which lowered our 10-year -- forward 10-year treasury assumption to approximately 2.8% from 3.5% previously, was generally benign as we also updated our lapse, mortality and policyholder behavior assumptions, resulting in an unfavorable impact of $120 million to adjusted pretax income and a net unfavorable impact of $22 million to pretax net income, mostly from revised lapse and policyholder assumptions.\n Shifting to investments. Net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.2 billion or $277 million lower than the third quarter of 2019. As a reminder, due to the sale of Fortitude, the prior year included the full quarter income on the Fortitude portfolio, whereas it is excluded on an APTI basis this quarter. Adjusting the third quarter of last year's net investment income accordingly, this quarter's net investment income on an APTI basis actually grew $271 million compared to the prior year, reflecting stronger income on both hedge funds and private equity.\n Turning to other operations. The adjusted pretax loss after consolidation and eliminations was $562 million, $62 million higher than the third quarter of 2019, principally due to additional interest expense from our May 2020 issuance of $4.1 billion of senior notes to prefund upcoming maturities.\n Parent and service company GOE declined $50 million pretax, reflecting AIG's continued focus on expense reduction. Our Legacy segment or adjusted pretax income no longer reflects Fortitude at $89 million of APTI in the quarter, slightly down compared to the third quarter of 2019 due to lower income as a result of Fortitude sale, offset by higher gains on fair value option portfolios within the Legacy investments. Legacy's results also reflected a favorable impact of $13 million related to the annual actuarial assumption update.\n Now turning to the balance sheet. At September 30, 2020, book value per common share was $73.86, down 1% from the prior year-end but up 3% from June 2020. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes AOCI and DTA and net cumulative unrealized gains on the Fortitude funds withheld assets, was $56.78 per share, up 2% sequentially from June 30.\n At September 30, AIG parent had cash and short-term liquidity assets of $10.7 billion after third quarter dividends of holding company expenses as well as the August debt maturity of $638 million. Looking into next quarter, we expect to pay the balance of the IRS tax settlement on cross-border transactions that date back to the 1990s. During the second quarter, we had prepaid approximately $548 million related to principal and penalties. We recently settled the litigation associated with that case and are awaiting potentially by year-end, the final interest calculation from the IRS. We have requested interest netting, which may lower the total amount below our remaining settlement estimate, which we have accrued at $1.2 billion.\n As for debt leverage, we reduced that ratio by approximately 100 basis points in the third quarter, driven by maturing debt, which had been prefunded and growth in retained earnings.\n Finally, our primary operating subsidiaries remain profitable and well capitalized despite the continuing impact of low rates, credit experience and COVID. For General Insurance, we estimate the U.S. pool fleet risk-based capital ratio for the third quarter to be between 430% and 440%; in Life and Retirement, it's estimated to be between 410% and 420%, both above our target ranges and both providing a good buffer for the uncertainty of the current environment.\n With that, I will now turn it back over to Brian. \nBrian Duperreault: Thank you, Mark. I guess it's time for the Q&A portion of this. So operator, why don't we start? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We can now take our first question from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. \nElyse Greenspan: My first question, Peter, is going back to your comments on Life and Retirement. You mentioned the option for the separation was either an IPO or a private sale. But then in reference to both, it sounds like you mentioned 19.9%. So I guess I'm confused on what a private sale -- could you go down the route of a private sale of 19.9% of L&R with subsequent sales after that? If I can just get some clarity on that comment, please. \nBrian Duperreault: Peter, go ahead and take that, please? \nPeter Zaffino: Yes. Thanks, Elyse. Yes, the 19.9% was referencing to the IPO. And we said that there could be -- we can't predict the future but that there could be an approach for a private sale, but it would be for the same percentage, the 19.9% or less, that we would not consider anything that would be above that. So I would think about whether it's the IPO or in the event of something came from a private party that it would be the 19.9% or less as an initial first step. \nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then so if it was a 19.9% to a private party, I guess, then you'd just be looking for subsequent sales down the road. Is there a time frame if it was a private sale or, I guess, the IPO for the -- as you think of these 2, 19.9% option for the full disposition of L&R? \nPeter Zaffino: Got you. Okay. Yes. So really, the time line, Elyse, I would think like whether we pursue a minority IPO or sale, we're going to make that decision in the near term, and we'd like to communicate that promptly. I mean the ultimate closing of an IPO or sale will depend on regulatory or other required approvals. And we'd like to think we can close on the first step of separation in 2021. But of course, we'll have to see how the process unfolds. \nOperator: We can now take our next question from Josh Shanker of Bank of America. \nJoshua Shanker: So the first question was the general guidance around growing premium volumes next year. Is that exclusive of what happens with travel and accident premiums? \nBrian Duperreault: Well, I think that's a Peter question. Peter? \nPeter Zaffino: Thanks, Josh. It was not exclusive. I mean we believe that we can grow the top line for General Insurance, even in those conditions where we would have a prolonged headwind in Travel, but we think that we can grow the top line without caveats. \nJoshua Shanker: And for those who look at the third quarter liability, premium numbers down in the low double-digit range, given where pricing is. So it sounds like there's some concerns about your appetite for liability business at this price. You've obviously run a lot of liability business in the last couple of years. How does that reflect on your confidence on the last couple of years of books and the attractiveness of writing liability business on -- in November 2020? \nBrian Duperreault: Go ahead, Peter. \nPeter Zaffino: Well, we've been doing the reunderwriting of the liability lines for a couple of years now. And so we've seen the shift in the portfolio in a very positive way. I think what you'll see on the net premium written is just a lot of reinsurance cessions just because we put in excess of loss and quota share. In this particular year, we had even more cessions on the quota share. But we feel very good about the way in which we are positioning that portfolio. We do think that we can grow that portfolio on the top line. And the rate-on-rate increases that we're getting in the Casualty and liability lines are meaningful and, we believe, are above loss cost. So I wouldn't read into it. I would say that it's part of the remediation, it's part of reinsurance, and we think that we are in a position to grow it. \nJoshua Shanker: Would you care to share the gross premium written growth? \nPeter Zaffino: I'm sorry? \nBrian Duperreault: Say that again, Josh. \nJoshua Shanker: Would you care to share an idea about the gross written premium growth in liability, whether it was much less than down low double digits? \nPeter Zaffino: No, I would -- it's the same comment. I think we can grow the top line on a gross basis as well. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS. \nBrian Meredith: Peter, when you -- the guidance with respect to the below 90% underlying combined ratio, and I assume that's kind of run rate as you go out end of '22. How do we kind of think about that expense ratio, kind of loss ratio? As you kind of think about it, how much is going to be AIG 200 related? \nBrian Duperreault: Go ahead, Brian -- or go ahead, Peter. \nPeter Zaffino: Yes, it's end of 2022 run rate, and we just thought about as we start to exit 2022. But I think all of the variables will contribute to the improved combined ratio. So I gave you some guidance on -- in my prepared remarks on AIG 200. So we remain committed to the billion dollars, and so we'll recognize $300 million of that as an exit run rate this year.\n So you could think about a couple of hundred basis points contributing to expense improvement during that period of time. We feel very good about the opportunity to grow the top line. And so we will start to see top line growth, which will help the ratios. We think we will have a revised reinsurance program that will reflect the portfolio that we have today. And so the vast reunderwriting to pivot to where we are today, we will have a different reinsurance structure going forward, and we will likely not need quite as much.\n And then the last piece is just the rate increases above loss cost will start to earn into the portfolio. And so I think all of those 4 variables will contribute to an improved combined ratio below the 90%. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Newsome of Piper Sandler. \nJon Paul Newsome: Perhaps you could just talk about the prioritization for use of proceeds, if you do, could be IPO or sale of Life business and if that would be different from what you expected in the past. \nBrian Duperreault: So I think, Paul, the question was use of proceeds from the IPO. I think I got that right. And if that's the case, Mark, would you take that question? \nMark Lyons: Sure. Thanks, Paul, thanks for the question. Well, our primary focus for the proceeds from any initial disposition will be to reduce AIG's debt leverage. But we'll continuously to review the best use of our capital, which certainly includes share repurchases, and act accordingly based upon those priorities. \nBrian Duperreault: Paul, was there another part to the question because you were a little unclear in my audio? \nJon Paul Newsome: No. I mean that was the focus of it, but maybe if you could just further that in terms of the debt leverage procedures. I mean my sense was you've sort of already prefunded all of those debt leverage. So I guess I'm a little bit surprised that there's more to do. \nBrian Duperreault: Okay. Mark, can you take that? \nMark Lyons: Sure, sure. So since you talked about that, Paul, so AIG clearly has strong liquidity. That was bolstered by the $4.1 billion debt raise we did in May of this year. That attractively prefunded those forthcoming maturities, right, and provided liquidity from a risk management perspective. But the near-term capital management strategy remains focused, though, on reducing our debt level to leverage ratios and executing on this separation with Life and Retirement from AIG.\n So -- but as previously noted, though, we have upcoming obligations associated with that liquidity of roughly $3.5 billion. So we've got the tax settlement that I'd mentioned in my prepared remarks, that could be up to $1.2 billion. And we have maturing debt that we did prefund, which pushed up the leverage ratio knowingly. But we know that's coming due at a $700 million range in fourth quarter and $1.5 billion by March of 2021. So we really have -- those priorities are right in front of us. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Tom Gallagher of Evercore. \nThomas Gallagher: Peter, you mentioned that you don't intend to break up the Life Insurance business and sell it off in pieces. I guess my question is, we've seen some recent indications in the market that private values are potentially double that of current public market values of life insurers. Have you taken that into consideration and still concluded your path is the best one for shareholders? \nBrian Duperreault: Tom, let me take that one, and Peter can add to it. I think you just have to understand that when we look at our Life business, we believe the ongoing strength of it is the breadth of the platforms. They've unequal product and distribution. We've got leading market positions. And there's a lot of cross-unit synergies. So the integrated platform, we believe, provides the kind of knowledge and expertise and stability and that's more valuable together than in pieces. And so we've cleaned it up. We've done a lot of derisking, but L&R really is a beautiful machine where these things all interact. So we believe that some of the products is definitely greater. I mean the whole is greater than each of the parts, I'll say, the right way. I hope that helps, Tom.\n Peter, do you want to add anything to that? \nPeter Zaffino: So I think between my prepared remarks and your comments, Brian, we did look at many alternatives and just believe that the consistent performance that Life and Retirement has produced as it's structured is going to create the most shareholder value, keeping it together. \nThomas Gallagher: I appreciate that, guys. Just my follow-up is the -- back in 2016, there was an estimate of capital diversification breakage of over $5 billion. It sounds like that's a lot less now. Is there still some dissynergy in capital diversification? And if so, could you quantify it? \nBrian Duperreault: Well, I guess, I'm going to throw that one, Tom, to Mark. Mark, can you just take us through that? \nMark Lyons: Sure, sure. So Tom, 2015 is quite a while ago. And as you know, there's been massive changes to the portfolio pretty much across the board. So I mean when you think about it, not only from 2015, but when Brian arrived in 2017, you've got a targeted risk reduction program that really went across the board with a revamped risk appetite, no matter how you looked at it. So that's been successfully implemented on both sides of the balance sheet, and it's involved the parent and GI and Life and Retirement and investments. And the operating subsidiary RBC, and risk-based capital, is strong for both GI and for L&R and the volatility in total and within each of those operations has clearly been markedly reduced.\n So -- and just as a little bit of a remembrance, so you see exactly the kind of risk reduction, which involves all the things you asked about. So the investment derisking, the Fortitude transaction, which we went into great detail, moving not only $35 billion of reserves, $31 billion of it was on Life and Retirement and $4-plus billion on GI, but it's also what constitutes those reserves. So when you look under the covers and you see a lot of structured settlement reserves and a lot of single premium immediate annuity reserves, those are clearly loaded with interest rate risk.\n So now that type of volatility and that kind of issue has now been pushed off as well. We have the ADC that we put into place with General Insurance that still has $6.4 billion unused, representing an 80% cession. The underwriting change to the book that has been massive, both on the front end and a proper reinsurance structure to protect it, as Peter always talked about.\n Consequence, the P&Ls have gone down enormously. The marketplace taking advantage of that with improved earnings by driving compound rate and improved terms and conditions but trimming the portfolio the right way, not just renewing books of business but getting into classes and things doing it properly.\n And not only on that, we've got the -- what we kind of referenced earlier, which was the debt rates that we had that allowed us to having risk management -- liquidity risk management capability in front of the prefunding of those maturing debt securities. So I think all in, we've got a lot of strength in earnings, a lot of strength in -- of lesser volatility around those earnings, and there is certainly a reduction in all those things combined. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar of Goldman Sachs. \nYaron Kinar: My first question goes to the financial leverage commentary around separation. It sounds like you're comfortable and confident in the leverage that will be achieved by both entities after separation. Today, I think the leverage is still a bit higher than where the Life and P&C Groups are at. So I guess, if I try to connect the dots there, is that why you're talking about a 19.9% sale at first to potentially fund some of that decreased leverage and then you'd consider selling the rest? \nBrian Duperreault: Well, look, since you brought up the 19, and I would have given this to Mark, but Peter, you might want to comment on 19.9% first, and then maybe Mark can go into the leverage question. \nPeter Zaffino: Yes, I think, Yaron, it is largely in my script, which is the 19.9% does preserve the foreign tax credits and that's a meaningful number today, but we will earn out of that. But I think -- Mark, I don't know if you want to go in a little bit deeper as to the deconsolidation issues. \nMark Lyons: Yes. Well, as Peter said, the 19.9% certainly -- because you still consolidate. So you still continue to reap the benefits as he's noted, which is why it's important, number one. And number two is the shrinkage of that, the consumption of that has really been pretty evident over the older years to where we are now. And with L&R and GI -- because think about it, Yaron, L&R has really been the big consumer of -- for the DTA, especially on the FTC, that's the foreign tax credit side. But now you have 2 strong platforms with a lot of great prospects on a go-forward basis where both can use and both can consume that. So I think that's important.\n Now getting back to the structure, both -- all the AIG subsidiaries really are strongly capitalized today. And we do anticipate, though, that each of the General Insurance and Life and Retirement businesses will maintain strong RBC levels and will have a leverage ratio that's consistent with the respective peers and ratings. And we'll be working closely with our regulators and rating agencies, as Peter referenced, throughout this process to validate our analysis. And our intention is to remain at or above our target ratings of these operating subsidiaries. So we believe as separate organizations, both will have sufficient financial flexibility to compete effectively and to generate returns above their individual cost of capital. So again, to reiterate, at this time, with all in, we do not anticipate the need for additional equity capital in either business as part of the separation. \nYaron Kinar: Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question, with regards to the guidance for 2022, combined ratio has been below 90%. And I think, Peter, you may have touched on this with your answer to Josh earlier. Did you need for the rate momentum to achieve that? \nBrian Duperreault: Well, Peter, what do you think? \nPeter Zaffino: In the current rate environment? \nYaron Kinar: Yes. Yes. Does that need to continue? \nPeter Zaffino: No, we don't. I mean, again, I would have to -- when I'm looking through the future, I would have to talk myself out of it, not into it in terms of the underlying fundamentals as to will this continue or not. But we did not predicate getting below 90% combined at the end of 2022 with the rate environment that we're in today. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis of Autonomous Research. \nRyan Tunis: Just a follow-up on Tom's question about, I guess, why the outright separation is the right path forward rather than more of a piecemeal approach. And it sounded like Brian gave sort of the strategic rationale for it. But you guys also mentioned that you looked at capital and tax considerations when you decide on what you're going to do. So what, if any, of the capital and tax considerations that made this a better path than more of a piecemeal process of selling the Life business in parts? \nBrian Duperreault: Okay. Ryan, let me start with this. So when you -- when we looked at this question, the question is does Life and Retirement and GI belong together? Or are they better apart? And the kind of conclusion was they were better apart. So let me look at the Life and Retirement, and you say, okay, is the Life and Retirement better together or apart? And it's the same kind of process. As I outlined it, we believe that the Life and Retirement business itself, as I said earlier, really is well integrated. There's a synergy around them that produces greater value than separating them. So that was -- we didn't see that value between Life and Retirement and General Insurance, but we see the value in the Life and Retirement business, where there is a creation of value because they are together. And that was the strategic decision.\n The question, is it practical to separate and all that? We went through all that. And we have the capital. We believe we can get the -- we have the ability to appropriately stand up L&R, I should say. So -- but it really fell on that very simple process. I hope that helps, Ryan. \nRyan Tunis: Yes, it does. And then, I guess, just for Peter, it's early, but thinking about the dissynergies associated with stranded cost, that type of thing. I mean when you think about the cost base of the company, I just -- I'd like to hear your early thoughts on any complexities there. \nBrian Duperreault: Go ahead, Peter. \nPeter Zaffino: Yes. Thank you. So I would think about -- if I was -- if we're going to do an IPO with Life and Retirement, there will be additional investment in order to have that company stand up on its own. But how I would think about it is that the benefits of AIG 200 to Life and Retirement will be at or more than what the investment costs were. So there'll be no additional costs in terms of the run rate today.\n And then I do think that there will be more expense synergies at AIG post separation, and we're working through that. And that would be in addition to AIG 200, and we'll just give you some more insight in one of our future quarter calls as we do a little bit more ground-up work on it. \nOperator: And our final question comes from Meyer Shields of KBW. \nMeyer Shields: Great. On the fourth quarter '19 call, I think we got the sense that the underlying accident year loss ratio improvement would be more pronounced in 2021 than in 2020. Is that still the expectation? \nBrian Duperreault: Peter? \nPeter Zaffino: Well, I mean, Meyer, I just want to make sure I understand the question. Is it really in terms of rate above loss cost? Or like, I just want to make sure I understand what you're asking. \nMeyer Shields: I guess, I mean you talked about how rate above loss cost is helping 2020, but I'm wondering whether that would -- any of that improvement was originally expected more in 2021 and has been pulled forward. Or is it just the absolute better pricing environment? \nPeter Zaffino: Mark, do you want to just take that on the -- like what we're getting on the policy year and rate cost increase? \nMark Lyons: Sure. Sure, happy to. Thank you, Meyer. So I think one thing that's been clear from the informations Peter has provided not only this call but at prior calls is we don't see any reduction of the rate of increase. It's -- one, it's global not just centered in the U.S.; and secondly, we don't see it falling off in virtually all the major areas that we've discussed. I think some others may, but we have not. And I think that's tantamount to the continued professionalism of the underwriting group.\n So think of it this way. So if you have that kind of strength by policy quarter, effective quarter, and if that continues to build, it's going to flow off increasing rate adequacy into future calendar quarters. So '20, it's going to have a very strong year, and I see nothing in the way stopping 2021 from being marginally better than that. \nBrian Duperreault: Meyer, do you have a follow-up? \nMeyer Shields: Okay. Just a quick one. Is it possible that the proceeds from the sale or IPO of Life and Retirement can be used -- who can use the DTA? \nBrian Duperreault: It could be used to -- I didn't hear that last -- that last piece of the question. \nMeyer Shields: Yes. Is it possible that you can use some of the tax credits you come up against the proceeds from the partial sale or IPO of Life and Retirement? \nBrian Duperreault: Well, Mark, I think that's you. \nMark Lyons: It's actually much more complicated, and there's legal structures involved. That's -- there's no short answer to that, but other than to say, not really. \nBrian Duperreault: I think that's the best way to leave it, Meyer.\n So look, I want to once again thank you all for joining us today. I'm very pleased with the progress we've made at AIG, and I think third quarter certainly is another indication of the fact that we are on the right track. And I got to tell, our colleagues really continue to impress me with their dedication and loyalty to our company and all our stakeholders. It's an exciting time at AIG. We continue to manage through unprecedented circumstances across the globe while elevating our market-leading businesses. And we look forward to 2021. I remain confident that our team will continue to execute on our strategies for growth, and we'll separate the Life and Retirement business from AIG. So we look forward to updating you on future calls. Have a great day. Thank you very much. \nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Peter Zaffino",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Brian. I appreciate your kind words and want to thank the AIG Board for the opportunity to lead this company. As Brian noted, we are living through a sustained period of global economic challenges. At AIG, we are well prepared as our purpose is to partner with our clients, especially during challenging times, to help them solve complex risk issues, capture opportunities in all market cycles and provide a consistent approach to providing insurance solutions in this period of uncertainty. We continually ask ourselves whether the things that worked well yesterday will continue to work tomorrow and into the future.\n This morning, I will expand on Brian's comments regarding key areas we're focused on. I'll start with additional insight into our plan to separate Life and Retirement from AIG. Then I'll provide an overview of the third quarter results for General Insurance and Life and Retirement. And lastly, I'll briefly outline our progress on AIG 200.\n With respect to Life and Retirement, as Brian said, we undertook a comprehensive review of our composite structure over the last several months. We concluded that over time, the value of full separation can create for our shareholders will be significantly greater than maintaining our current structure. Our analysis took into account many factors, including potential impediments and benefits.\n Among the more significant factors are: One, the progress we've made since late 2017 to strengthen the foundation of General Insurance materially reduce risk and volatility in our portfolio and position General Insurance as a market leader poised for sustainable, profitable growth. A separation of Life and Retirement from AIG would not be possible without a strong General Insurance business that can support itself and thrive on a stand-alone basis.\n Two, we believe that we can effectively manage any loss of diversification benefits in our capital model as a result of separation. Our current expectation is that no additional equity capital will be required given the improvements in our subsidiary capital positions over the last 3 years. This is especially true in General Insurance, where the capital base is stronger than it's been in many years.\n Three, the separation process will require us to implement a stand-alone capital structure for Life and Retirement. This will involve raising new debt at Life and Retirement and restructuring debt at AIG parent. In the end, both companies will have independent capital structures in line with peers and appropriate financial leverage for their respective ratings. Both companies will also have strong financial flexibility to execute on their strategic priorities.\n Four, AIG's deferred tax asset is no longer an obstacle as it was in the past. The DTA is made up of net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits. With respect to the net operating losses, we expect AIG to have taxable income post-separation that is sufficient to utilize the remaining $6.6 billion before they expire. The foreign tax credit carryforwards have been significantly utilized in recent years, and we expect to utilize the vast majority of the remaining $1.5 billion before we deconsolidate Life and Retirement, leaving only a small portion potentially at risk.\n And five, there is a limited number of legal entity restructurings required to achieve a separation as well as limited expense dis-synergies. In fact, we will leverage the important work we're doing as part of AIG 200 to facilitate operational separation.\n While the precise form of separation will be subject to AIG Board and regulatory approvals, rating agency considerations and market conditions, we currently contemplate either an IPO or private sale of up to 19.9% of Life and Retirement, followed by one or more dispositions of our remaining ownership interest over time. We're proceeding with a sense of urgency to determine the initial step of the separation and will continue to engage with regulators and rating agencies throughout the process.\n Finally, we do not intend to break up Life and Retirement and sell it in pieces, as the significant strength of the business is the breadth of its platform and diversified product portfolio and distribution network. Throughout the separation process, we will remain laser-focused on continuing to position our businesses to deliver superior value to our clients, distribution partners, shareholders and other stakeholders.\n Turning to our third quarter. In General Insurance, we achieved another quarter of positive results in our core business with continued improvement in our underwriting margins. The accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophe, improved by 260 basis points to 93.3% compared to 95.9% a year ago and by 610 basis points compared to 99.4% in the third quarter of 2018. The improvement was driven by our Commercial business, which improved by approximately 560 basis points year-over-year as a result of lower accident year loss ratio, excluding CAT, and a lower expense ratio. The lower Commercial accident year loss ratio ex CAT reflects a higher-quality book of business, driven by a better mix and portfolio management actions. \n In Personal Insurance, not surprisingly, our portfolio mix continues to be impacted by COVID-19, which has reduced premium volumes by more than 80% in our Travel business alone. The mix of business was further impacted in North America Personal Insurance due to the reinsurance cessions related to Syndicate 2019.\n With respect to CAT, the third quarter was very active with low to moderate severity per event in both North America and Japan with an upper industry range of $45 billion globally. As we disclosed last week, our third quarter CAT loss estimates, net of reinsurance, totaled $790 million for the quarter. Included in this CAT number is $185 million of COVID-19 loss estimates. With respect to COVID-19, the loss estimates primarily related to Travel, Contingency and Validus Re. Our year-to-date COVID-related net loss estimates are slightly over $900 million.\n Our reinsurance program continues to perform as expected with recoveries in our International per occurrence, Private Client Group per occurrence and other discrete reinsurance programs limiting volatility. Regardless of frequency and severity of natural CATs and additional COVID-19-related losses, we expect overall CAT losses for the remainder of the year to be limited due to various protections we have in place under our aggregate CAT covers.\n Turning to rate. In the third quarter, our underwriting discipline continued as our team has pivoted to pursue premium growth while not losing our focus on account-level decisions, risk-adjusted rates and margin expansion. In Commercial, there is continued momentum in our portfolio optimization strategy, and we're seeing sustained rate-on-rate improvement across most lines of business. For the third quarter, our Commercial business had rate increases of approximately 17%. North America Commercial rate increases were 20% in the third quarter compared to 12% in the prior year. Rate increases in Admitted Property were over 30%. In Financial Lines, they were over 25% led by D&O. In Excess & Surplus Lines, they were over 20%. And in Excess Casualty, they were over 30%.\n International Commercial rate increases were 14% in the third quarter compared to 8% in the prior year, driven by Financial Lines and Specialty. Rate increases in Commercial Property were 12%. In Financial Lines, they were over 20% led by D&O. And in U.K. Specialty, they were over 25% led by energy, aviation and trade credit. It's important to note that the rates we're achieving are on a policy year basis and will take time to earn into our accident year results. Additionally, we're confident that the rate increases we are achieving are outpacing loss cost increases in our portfolio.\n Turning to Validus Re and upcoming 1/1 renewals, our team continues to be disciplined in deploying capacity and focus on acceptable terms and conditions as well as appropriate risk-adjusted rate changes. Double-digit rate increases are being quoted in most lines with tighter terms and conditions. Retro business is very active with meaningful double-digit rate increases being quoted with terms altering to modelled perils only with the occurrence covers being preferred over aggregate covers.\n Before turning to Life and Retirement, I want to provide context for how we view the rate environment in the P&C market. Insurance carriers have faced challenging business conditions for more than a decade. Soft market conditions have gripped the industry since 2007 and have been coupled with historically low interest rates and an increase in frequency and severity of natural catastrophes. As an example, when looking at Property, the expected aggregate industry natural CAT losses for 2017 through the third quarter of 2020 are estimated to exceed $400 billion. Median annual losses over the last 15 years have been approximately $65 billion. These amounts are nearly double the amount of expected loss. For natural catastrophes, pricing has adjusted in light of these new norms. And keep in mind, none of these numbers include catastrophe losses from COVID-19.\n With these challenges and the increasingly complex environment our clients are looking to us to help them manage, the work we do is becoming more complex. We believe our retention rates demonstrate the strength of our relationships with clients and distribution partners and confirm that a flight of quality has been backed from the fruition, particularly due to COVID. The momentum we have generated in General Insurance is significant and we believe that we will achieve top line growth in 2021. And by the end of 2022, we'll achieve an accident year combined ratio, excluding CATs, below 90%. This will represent a 1,000 basis point improvement since 2018.\n Turning to Life and Retirement. I've spent the last couple of months working with Kevin and his team to analyze this business. It is a franchise that is extremely well positioned in the market and has a track record of delivering consistent performance.\n Third quarter adjusted pretax income was $975 million, and adjusted return on attributed common equity was 14.5%. Third quarter results reflected strong performance in all lines of business, driven by recovering sales and strong equity market levels, resulting in favorable impacts to deferred acquisition costs and variable annuity reserves as well as higher private equity returns. Additionally, lower interest rates and tighter credit spreads drove higher call and tender income, which is a short-term benefit that will be offset in the long term in the form of additional base spread compression.\n The sensitivities Kevin previously discussed generally held up, recognizing the limits of sensitivities, especially in times of macroeconomic stress and high levels of volatility. As we noted in the second quarter, reported base investment spread compression has been impacted by substantially lower returns on our tactical cash and short-term investment position. Excluding this impact, base investment spreads would continue to be in the 8 to 16 basis points range of annual spread compression.\n Excluding estimated COVID-19-related deaths, mortality experience was favorable and consistent with pre-pandemic trends. Risk management efforts and discipline in Life and Retirement have continued to serve this business well. The hedge program has performed as expected, and our balance sheet remains strong. Additionally, we view our lack of large legacy blocks, such as long-term care, as a risk differentiator. As expected, retail annuity sales rebounded significantly from the historically low second quarter levels as our distribution partners became more accustomed to a new working environment. We also grew sales in Group Retirement and Institutional Markets where we successfully issued 3 large guaranteed investment contracts during the third quarter. Our total premiums and deposits decreased from second quarter levels, and we remain well positioned and confident to deploy capital as attractive opportunities arise across our business.\n Now let me provide a brief update on AIG 200. Since we announced AIG 200 in 2019, we have been focused on investing in our core processes and infrastructure in order to be more competitive in the marketplace and make real transformational change at AIG. A few key points I'd like to highlight. We are on track to deliver and will likely exceed our original guidance of $300 million exit run rate savings this year. We also expect to come in below the $350 million cost to achieve that we initially communicated for 2020. An important milestone we recently achieved was entering into a partnership with Accenture, whereby Accenture will acquire our existing shared services footprint.\n Working with the AIG global operations team, Accenture will help us to create a modern digital shared services platform with true end-to-end processes that will improve the user experience. This agreement is subject to regulatory approvals and marks the first phase of our overall relationship with Accenture, which we expect will expand over time. Our overall targets for AIG 200 remain unchanged. We still expect to deliver $1 billion of run rate savings by the end of 2022 against a $1.3 billion total investment. Lastly, we do not anticipate any delays or significant changes due to the planned separation of Life and Retirement.\n Before I turn it over to Mark, I'd like to end my remarks where I started, and thank Brian for his leadership over the last 3 years. Since I joined Brian in mid-2017, we have navigated truly unprecedented conditions. Throughout, Brian has remained steadfast in his commitment to build a world-leading insurance franchise with no shortcuts or quick fixes. I'm incredibly proud of what we achieved so far in our journey. Our colleagues have demonstrated unmatched resilience and a commitment to excellence in all that they do despite the significant disruption we've all experienced both personally and professionally due to COVID-19. I know I speak on behalf of all AIG colleagues when I say that we look forward to continuing to work with Brian as we close out 2020 and look ahead to a very bright future for our company.\n Now I'll turn it over to Mark. Yes. Thanks, Elyse. Yes, the 19.9% was referencing to the IPO. And we said that there could be -- we can't predict the future but that there could be an approach for a private sale, but it would be for the same percentage, the 19.9% or less, that we would not consider anything that would be above that. So I would think about whether it's the IPO or in the event of something came from a private party that it would be the 19.9% or less as an initial first step. Got you. Okay. Yes. So really, the time line, Elyse, I would think like whether we pursue a minority IPO or sale, we're going to make that decision in the near term, and we'd like to communicate that promptly. I mean the ultimate closing of an IPO or sale will depend on regulatory or other required approvals. And we'd like to think we can close on the first step of separation in 2021. But of course, we'll have to see how the process unfolds. Thanks, Josh. It was not exclusive. I mean we believe that we can grow the top line for General Insurance, even in those conditions where we would have a prolonged headwind in Travel, but we think that we can grow the top line without caveats. Well, we've been doing the reunderwriting of the liability lines for a couple of years now. And so we've seen the shift in the portfolio in a very positive way. I think what you'll see on the net premium written is just a lot of reinsurance cessions just because we put in excess of loss and quota share. In this particular year, we had even more cessions on the quota share. But we feel very good about the way in which we are positioning that portfolio. We do think that we can grow that portfolio on the top line. And the rate-on-rate increases that we're getting in the Casualty and liability lines are meaningful and, we believe, are above loss cost. So I wouldn't read into it. I would say that it's part of the remediation, it's part of reinsurance, and we think that we are in a position to grow it. I'm sorry? No, I would -- it's the same comment. I think we can grow the top line on a gross basis as well. Yes, it's end of 2022 run rate, and we just thought about as we start to exit 2022. But I think all of the variables will contribute to the improved combined ratio. So I gave you some guidance on -- in my prepared remarks on AIG 200. So we remain committed to the billion dollars, and so we'll recognize $300 million of that as an exit run rate this year.\n So you could think about a couple of hundred basis points contributing to expense improvement during that period of time. We feel very good about the opportunity to grow the top line. And so we will start to see top line growth, which will help the ratios. We think we will have a revised reinsurance program that will reflect the portfolio that we have today. And so the vast reunderwriting to pivot to where we are today, we will have a different reinsurance structure going forward, and we will likely not need quite as much.\n And then the last piece is just the rate increases above loss cost will start to earn into the portfolio. And so I think all of those 4 variables will contribute to an improved combined ratio below the 90%. So I think between my prepared remarks and your comments, Brian, we did look at many alternatives and just believe that the consistent performance that Life and Retirement has produced as it's structured is going to create the most shareholder value, keeping it together. Yes, I think, Yaron, it is largely in my script, which is the 19.9% does preserve the foreign tax credits and that's a meaningful number today, but we will earn out of that. But I think -- Mark, I don't know if you want to go in a little bit deeper as to the deconsolidation issues. In the current rate environment? No, we don't. I mean, again, I would have to -- when I'm looking through the future, I would have to talk myself out of it, not into it in terms of the underlying fundamentals as to will this continue or not. But we did not predicate getting below 90% combined at the end of 2022 with the rate environment that we're in today. Yes. Thank you. So I would think about -- if I was -- if we're going to do an IPO with Life and Retirement, there will be additional investment in order to have that company stand up on its own. But how I would think about it is that the benefits of AIG 200 to Life and Retirement will be at or more than what the investment costs were. So there'll be no additional costs in terms of the run rate today.\n And then I do think that there will be more expense synergies at AIG post separation, and we're working through that. And that would be in addition to AIG 200, and we'll just give you some more insight in one of our future quarter calls as we do a little bit more ground-up work on it. Well, I mean, Meyer, I just want to make sure I understand the question. Is it really in terms of rate above loss cost? Or like, I just want to make sure I understand what you're asking. Mark, do you want to just take that on the -- like what we're getting on the policy year and rate cost increase?"

            "content": "Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Given the announcements we made last week, we will handle today's call differently with the objective to leave as much time as possible for your questions. I will focus most of my remarks on our leadership changes and the separation of Life and Retirement. Peter will expand on what the separation process will entail. He will provide an overview of our third quarter results for General Insurance and Life and Retirement and give an update on AIG 200. Lastly, Mark will provide additional color on our financial results for the quarter. Kevin Hogan, Dave McElroy and Doug Dachille will be available for the Q&A portion of the call.\n As you saw in our earnings release, AIG continues to manage through the ongoing global economic uncertainty. We are financially strong and well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities for growth. In the third quarter, we reported adjusted after-tax income of $0.81 per common share, and we saw improvement in both the accident year combined ratio in General Insurance and Life and Retirement's adjusted return on attributed common equity.\n As we announced last week, the AIG Board unanimously elected Peter to become the next Chief Executive Officer of AIG effective March 1. At that time, I will assume -- I will become Executive Chairman of the AIG Board. This leadership transition demonstrates our continuing momentum and focus on AIG's future. It's an honor to serve as a CEO of AIG, and I want to thank our directors for their ongoing support.\n I also want to congratulate Peter. I've worked with Peter in several capacities for many years, and I'm extremely proud of him and the legacy he is building in our industry. Since joining me at AIG in 2017, he designed and executed on the turnaround in our General Insurance business, which, by any measure, has been historic. I greatly admire Peter's strength of character, leadership abilities and willingness to take decisive action. He has a proven track record of building great teams and successfully leading them in times of significant change and growth. Peter exemplifies the rare executive who is both a hard-working operational leader and a strategic visionary. I know that he will be an excellent CEO for AIG, and the company will be in great hands.\n Turning to our second big announcement last week. As I stated before, we have continually examined the composite structure of AIG. And over the last several months with the assistance from independent financial and legal advisers, we conducted a very comprehensive review to determine if the change would be in the best interest of our shareholders and other stakeholders. This review included examining strategic, operational, capital and tax implications. And the output of this review was very clear, that is a simpler structure will benefit both GI and L&R. This is largely due to the significant foundational work our team has done across AIG to strengthen our businesses and position them as market leaders.\n In addition, impediments to a separation that existed back in 2017 have greatly diminished. For example, the tax benefits of AIG's current composite structure have decreased over time. And with the stronger capitalization of our core business, the capital diversification benefit has become less significant. We believe our businesses will be more resilient as separate companies with more appropriate and sustainable valuations, and each will continue to be market leaders in their respective sectors with strong balance sheets, appropriate capital structures, attractive earnings and cash flows. We also believe both will have sufficient financial flexibility to compete effectively. We do not anticipate that either will require additional capital -- equity capital in connection with the separation, and neither will be overleveraged, especially when compared to their respective peers.\n We have evaluated various structural alternatives for the separation, and Peter will provide details on our initial conclusions. While the separation process will be complex and will, of course, require regulatory approvals, we are confident that we will execute in a way that provides the best long-term value for shareholders and other stakeholders. We are committed to transparency and providing you with updates as the process moves forward.\n Now I'll turn it over to Peter. Thank you, Mark. I guess it's time for the Q&A portion of this. So operator, why don't we start? Peter, go ahead and take that, please? Well, I think that's a Peter question. Peter? Go ahead, Peter. Say that again, Josh. Go ahead, Brian -- or go ahead, Peter. So I think, Paul, the question was use of proceeds from the IPO. I think I got that right. And if that's the case, Mark, would you take that question? Paul, was there another part to the question because you were a little unclear in my audio? Okay. Mark, can you take that? Tom, let me take that one, and Peter can add to it. I think you just have to understand that when we look at our Life business, we believe the ongoing strength of it is the breadth of the platforms. They've unequal product and distribution. We've got leading market positions. And there's a lot of cross-unit synergies. So the integrated platform, we believe, provides the kind of knowledge and expertise and stability and that's more valuable together than in pieces. And so we've cleaned it up. We've done a lot of derisking, but L&R really is a beautiful machine where these things all interact. So we believe that some of the products is definitely greater. I mean the whole is greater than each of the parts, I'll say, the right way. I hope that helps, Tom.\n Peter, do you want to add anything to that? Well, I guess, I'm going to throw that one, Tom, to Mark. Mark, can you just take us through that? Well, look, since you brought up the 19, and I would have given this to Mark, but Peter, you might want to comment on 19.9% first, and then maybe Mark can go into the leverage question. Well, Peter, what do you think? Okay. Ryan, let me start with this. So when you -- when we looked at this question, the question is does Life and Retirement and GI belong together? Or are they better apart? And the kind of conclusion was they were better apart. So let me look at the Life and Retirement, and you say, okay, is the Life and Retirement better together or apart? And it's the same kind of process. As I outlined it, we believe that the Life and Retirement business itself, as I said earlier, really is well integrated. There's a synergy around them that produces greater value than separating them. So that was -- we didn't see that value between Life and Retirement and General Insurance, but we see the value in the Life and Retirement business, where there is a creation of value because they are together. And that was the strategic decision.\n The question, is it practical to separate and all that? We went through all that. And we have the capital. We believe we can get the -- we have the ability to appropriately stand up L&R, I should say. So -- but it really fell on that very simple process. I hope that helps, Ryan. Go ahead, Peter. Peter? Meyer, do you have a follow-up? It could be used to -- I didn't hear that last -- that last piece of the question. Well, Mark, I think that's you. I think that's the best way to leave it, Meyer.\n So look, I want to once again thank you all for joining us today. I'm very pleased with the progress we've made at AIG, and I think third quarter certainly is another indication of the fact that we are on the right track. And I got to tell, our colleagues really continue to impress me with their dedication and loyalty to our company and all our stakeholders. It's an exciting time at AIG. We continue to manage through unprecedented circumstances across the globe while elevating our market-leading businesses. And we look forward to 2021. I remain confident that our team will continue to execute on our strategies for growth, and we'll separate the Life and Retirement business from AIG. So we look forward to updating you on future calls. Have a great day. Thank you very much."

            "name": "Mark Lyons",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. As Brian and Peter have already commented on the announced separation of the Life and Retirement business from AIG, I will briefly discuss the third quarter results in order to allow sufficient time for Q&A.\n AIG reported adjusted pretax income, or APTI, of $918 million and adjusted after-tax income of $709 million or $0.81 per diluted share compared to $505 million or $0.56 per share in the third quarter of 2019. The key drivers of this increased earnings were: one, a General Insurance underwriting gain, exclusive of the impact of catastrophes and prior year development, which improved $135 million compared to the third quarter of '19; second, a very strong Life and Retirement results, inclusive of the impact of the annual actuarial assumption update; third, solid net investment income results, up $271 million after adjusting the third quarter of 2019 for Fortitude, reflecting higher private equity and hedge fund income in addition to fixed maturity securities; fourth, reduced total AIG general operating expenses by approximately $200 million.\n Turning to General Insurance. Third quarter adjusted pretax income was $416 million, down $91 million from the third quarter of 2019, due primarily to the previously announced catastrophe losses of $790 million pretax, partially offset by higher net investment income stemming from alternatives. As with respect to prior year development, $16.1 billion of reserves were carried -- excuse me, were reviewed this quarter, bringing the year-to-date total reviews to more than 60% of carried reserves. The net result was unfavorable development of $13 million, which reflects $53 million of favorable development from amortization of the ADC deferred gain. So the unfavorable development was $66 million gross of this amortization impact.\n The areas reviewed were primary workers' compensation, environmental, program businesses, Western World, cyber, Personal Lines Property Casualty, Canada, U.K., Europe and Asia Pacific Casualty and Financial Lines as well as European short-tail lines. Next quarter's focus will be on U.S. Financial Lines and some Casualty areas. This quarter's PYD showed favorable development in North America, driven mostly by primary workers' compensation, California 2017 wildfire, subro (sic)  [ subrogation ] and short-tail lines and unfavorable developments internationally driven mostly by Financial Lines, large losses and U.K. and Europe Casualty, mostly in prior accident years.\n As Peter mentioned, the General Insurance business has continued to improve with an accident year combined ratio as adjusted of 93.3% in the quarter, a 260 basis point improvement from last year. North America was 96%, 250 basis points better than last year, while North American Commercial Lines was 630 basis points better than the prior year, 560 basis points of which emanated from an improved loss ratio.\n International improved, the accident year combined ratio as adjusted by 240 basis points, to 91% with International Commercial Lines better by 410 basis points, with 170 basis points of this emanating from an improved loss ratio. The global expense ratio was 180 basis points lower quarter-over-quarter, driven by an improved acquisition ratio. General Insurance also reduced their GOE by $76 million. The margin momentum in Commercial Lines reflects the hard work of the past several years with the added tailwinds of achieved rate in 2020 above our initial expectations. Both will drive margin improvement through 2021.\n I would also note that on a global basis, Personal Insurance results are not really comparable to last year due to the significant drop in Travel business, the formation of Syndicate 2019 for North American PCG business discussed last quarter and higher North American catastrophes, including the COVID impact on the Travel book. International Personal Insurance accident year combined ratio as adjusted improved by 80 basis points with favorable frequency in Japanese auto and a lower expense ratio. North American Personal Lines accident year combined ratio as adjusted was significantly higher to 118.6% due to the approximate 60% drop in net earned premium for the segment, led by Travel's nearly 80% reduction as well as the noise associated with the changes to PCG that was discussed on our prior call. Warranty, Personal A&H and Canadian Personal Lines all continued to perform well.\n With the Commercial Lines reunderwriting largely behind us, we are now pivoting to growth, which will become evident in early 2021, as near-term top line results are still impacted by Personal Insurance. Global gross premiums written were $8.3 billion in the quarter, down approximately 4% before the impact of currency. And net premiums written and earned were both down approximately 11%, principally due to Personal Insurance as well as the impact of reinsurance and portfolio management on the North American Commercial Lines book.\n In North America Commercial, net premiums written decreased by approximately 5%, reflecting the impact of reinsurance as stated, portfolio management actions and COVID, but retention and new business levels have improved the specific areas. For instance, our Lexington Property business grew by 20% year-over-year as a result of increased flow, continued rate increases and new business momentum. International Commercial's net premiums written increased by approximately 5%, reflecting significant rate momentum and growth in Financial Lines, Specialty and Talbot.\n North America Personal Insurance net premiums written was impacted by business mix shifts due to the lower Travel premium and the changes to PCG. As we enter 2021, we will retain approximately 25% of the PCG business, and the Syndicate structure will reduce the volatility of the overall Personal Lines book as was the case this quarter.\n International Personal Insurance net premiums written were down 10% on a constant dollar basis, principally because of the reduction in Travel premiums. Aside from Travel, most of the International Personal Insurance is in Japan, which had a slight decrease in premiums due to lower new business, also was the result of COVID.\n Now turning to Life and Retirement. Adjusted pretax income was $975 million for the quarter, up over 50% compared to the prior year with strong performance in most businesses. Third quarter adjusted return on attributed common equity was 14.5%, as Peter noted, and 12% on a year-to-date basis. Also, as Peter mentioned, Life and Retirement's retail annuity sales rebounded significantly from historically low second quarter levels. Sequentially, fixed annuities were up 144% to $942 million from the second quarter low of $387 million. Variable annuities were up 24% to $670 million, and index annuities were up 38% to $942 million. Life and Retirement also grew sales modestly in Group Retirement. And in Institutional Markets, several large guaranteed investment contracts were issued during the quarter, totaling approximately $1.2 billion.\n Total premiums and deposits increased from second quarter levels and net flows, although still negative, had a material rebound sequentially of over $612 million for fixed annuities and fixed index annuities alone.\n The balance sheet remains strong with a solid investment portfolio with limited exposure to large legacy blocks on the liability side, such as long-term care, prefinancial crisis variable annuities or long-duration payout annuities. While low interest rates in the last year will drive additional spread compression, the diversity of our product portfolio is a strength in this environment. Our annual actuarial assumption update, which lowered our 10-year -- forward 10-year treasury assumption to approximately 2.8% from 3.5% previously, was generally benign as we also updated our lapse, mortality and policyholder behavior assumptions, resulting in an unfavorable impact of $120 million to adjusted pretax income and a net unfavorable impact of $22 million to pretax net income, mostly from revised lapse and policyholder assumptions.\n Shifting to investments. Net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.2 billion or $277 million lower than the third quarter of 2019. As a reminder, due to the sale of Fortitude, the prior year included the full quarter income on the Fortitude portfolio, whereas it is excluded on an APTI basis this quarter. Adjusting the third quarter of last year's net investment income accordingly, this quarter's net investment income on an APTI basis actually grew $271 million compared to the prior year, reflecting stronger income on both hedge funds and private equity.\n Turning to other operations. The adjusted pretax loss after consolidation and eliminations was $562 million, $62 million higher than the third quarter of 2019, principally due to additional interest expense from our May 2020 issuance of $4.1 billion of senior notes to prefund upcoming maturities.\n Parent and service company GOE declined $50 million pretax, reflecting AIG's continued focus on expense reduction. Our Legacy segment or adjusted pretax income no longer reflects Fortitude at $89 million of APTI in the quarter, slightly down compared to the third quarter of 2019 due to lower income as a result of Fortitude sale, offset by higher gains on fair value option portfolios within the Legacy investments. Legacy's results also reflected a favorable impact of $13 million related to the annual actuarial assumption update.\n Now turning to the balance sheet. At September 30, 2020, book value per common share was $73.86, down 1% from the prior year-end but up 3% from June 2020. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes AOCI and DTA and net cumulative unrealized gains on the Fortitude funds withheld assets, was $56.78 per share, up 2% sequentially from June 30.\n At September 30, AIG parent had cash and short-term liquidity assets of $10.7 billion after third quarter dividends of holding company expenses as well as the August debt maturity of $638 million. Looking into next quarter, we expect to pay the balance of the IRS tax settlement on cross-border transactions that date back to the 1990s. During the second quarter, we had prepaid approximately $548 million related to principal and penalties. We recently settled the litigation associated with that case and are awaiting potentially by year-end, the final interest calculation from the IRS. We have requested interest netting, which may lower the total amount below our remaining settlement estimate, which we have accrued at $1.2 billion.\n As for debt leverage, we reduced that ratio by approximately 100 basis points in the third quarter, driven by maturing debt, which had been prefunded and growth in retained earnings.\n Finally, our primary operating subsidiaries remain profitable and well capitalized despite the continuing impact of low rates, credit experience and COVID. For General Insurance, we estimate the U.S. pool fleet risk-based capital ratio for the third quarter to be between 430% and 440%; in Life and Retirement, it's estimated to be between 410% and 420%, both above our target ranges and both providing a good buffer for the uncertainty of the current environment.\n With that, I will now turn it back over to Brian. Sure. Thanks, Paul, thanks for the question. Well, our primary focus for the proceeds from any initial disposition will be to reduce AIG's debt leverage. But we'll continuously to review the best use of our capital, which certainly includes share repurchases, and act accordingly based upon those priorities. Sure, sure. So since you talked about that, Paul, so AIG clearly has strong liquidity. That was bolstered by the $4.1 billion debt raise we did in May of this year. That attractively prefunded those forthcoming maturities, right, and provided liquidity from a risk management perspective. But the near-term capital management strategy remains focused, though, on reducing our debt level to leverage ratios and executing on this separation with Life and Retirement from AIG.\n So -- but as previously noted, though, we have upcoming obligations associated with that liquidity of roughly $3.5 billion. So we've got the tax settlement that I'd mentioned in my prepared remarks, that could be up to $1.2 billion. And we have maturing debt that we did prefund, which pushed up the leverage ratio knowingly. But we know that's coming due at a $700 million range in fourth quarter and $1.5 billion by March of 2021. So we really have -- those priorities are right in front of us. Sure, sure. So Tom, 2015 is quite a while ago. And as you know, there's been massive changes to the portfolio pretty much across the board. So I mean when you think about it, not only from 2015, but when Brian arrived in 2017, you've got a targeted risk reduction program that really went across the board with a revamped risk appetite, no matter how you looked at it. So that's been successfully implemented on both sides of the balance sheet, and it's involved the parent and GI and Life and Retirement and investments. And the operating subsidiary RBC, and risk-based capital, is strong for both GI and for L&R and the volatility in total and within each of those operations has clearly been markedly reduced.\n So -- and just as a little bit of a remembrance, so you see exactly the kind of risk reduction, which involves all the things you asked about. So the investment derisking, the Fortitude transaction, which we went into great detail, moving not only $35 billion of reserves, $31 billion of it was on Life and Retirement and $4-plus billion on GI, but it's also what constitutes those reserves. So when you look under the covers and you see a lot of structured settlement reserves and a lot of single premium immediate annuity reserves, those are clearly loaded with interest rate risk.\n So now that type of volatility and that kind of issue has now been pushed off as well. We have the ADC that we put into place with General Insurance that still has $6.4 billion unused, representing an 80% cession. The underwriting change to the book that has been massive, both on the front end and a proper reinsurance structure to protect it, as Peter always talked about.\n Consequence, the P&Ls have gone down enormously. The marketplace taking advantage of that with improved earnings by driving compound rate and improved terms and conditions but trimming the portfolio the right way, not just renewing books of business but getting into classes and things doing it properly.\n And not only on that, we've got the -- what we kind of referenced earlier, which was the debt rates that we had that allowed us to having risk management -- liquidity risk management capability in front of the prefunding of those maturing debt securities. So I think all in, we've got a lot of strength in earnings, a lot of strength in -- of lesser volatility around those earnings, and there is certainly a reduction in all those things combined. Yes. Well, as Peter said, the 19.9% certainly -- because you still consolidate. So you still continue to reap the benefits as he's noted, which is why it's important, number one. And number two is the shrinkage of that, the consumption of that has really been pretty evident over the older years to where we are now. And with L&R and GI -- because think about it, Yaron, L&R has really been the big consumer of -- for the DTA, especially on the FTC, that's the foreign tax credit side. But now you have 2 strong platforms with a lot of great prospects on a go-forward basis where both can use and both can consume that. So I think that's important.\n Now getting back to the structure, both -- all the AIG subsidiaries really are strongly capitalized today. And we do anticipate, though, that each of the General Insurance and Life and Retirement businesses will maintain strong RBC levels and will have a leverage ratio that's consistent with the respective peers and ratings. And we'll be working closely with our regulators and rating agencies, as Peter referenced, throughout this process to validate our analysis. And our intention is to remain at or above our target ratings of these operating subsidiaries. So we believe as separate organizations, both will have sufficient financial flexibility to compete effectively and to generate returns above their individual cost of capital. So again, to reiterate, at this time, with all in, we do not anticipate the need for additional equity capital in either business as part of the separation. Sure. Sure, happy to. Thank you, Meyer. So I think one thing that's been clear from the informations Peter has provided not only this call but at prior calls is we don't see any reduction of the rate of increase. It's -- one, it's global not just centered in the U.S.; and secondly, we don't see it falling off in virtually all the major areas that we've discussed. I think some others may, but we have not. And I think that's tantamount to the continued professionalism of the underwriting group.\n So think of it this way. So if you have that kind of strength by policy quarter, effective quarter, and if that continues to build, it's going to flow off increasing rate adequacy into future calendar quarters. So '20, it's going to have a very strong year, and I see nothing in the way stopping 2021 from being marginally better than that. It's actually much more complicated, and there's legal structures involved. That's -- there's no short answer to that, but other than to say, not really."

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Sabra Purtill, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nSabra Purtill: Good morning and thank you all for joining us. Today\u2019s will cover AIG's second quarter 2020 financial results announced yesterday afternoon. The news release, financial results presentation and financial supplement were posted on our website at www.aig.com, and the 10-Q for the quarter will be filed later today after the call.\nBrian Duperreault: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I hope everyone is staying healthy and safe. Like last quarter our team is participating on the call from different locations. I'm joined by Peter, Kevin and Mike and Doug Dachille, our Chief Investment Officer will also be available for Q&A. AIG continues to show remarkable strength and resiliency as COVID-19 remains a formidable and ongoing catastrophe. Our global workforce has adjusted to working remotely and I am incredibly proud of how the team has become more unified and focused on supporting each other, our clients and other stakeholders during this unprecedented time. Throughout the second quarter, we continue to build on the strong foundation created since late 2017 to instil a culture of underwriting excellence, adjusted risk tolerances and implement a best-in-class reinsurance program. These actions strengthened and protected our balance sheet and are allowing us to effectively manage through COVID-19 and its collateral effects on the global economy in addition to natural catastrophes. We also made progress on strategic initiatives across AIG, including the early June closing of the sale of a majority stake in Fortitude, which significantly de-risked our balance sheet and represented the vast majority of our legacy portfolio. Our focus on de-risking is also reflected in how the overall investment portfolio was held up during this extended period of market uncertainty.\nPeter Zaffino: Thanks, Brian. And good morning, everyone. Today I plan to provide more detail on Brian's comments regarding the General Insurance second quarter results, COVID-19, the current market environment and I will finish with an update on AIG 200. This month marks my third anniversary of joining Brian at AIG and when I look back at where we started our journey, the progress our team has made is extraordinary. As we've discussed on prior calls, during our first year at AIG we determined the GI portfolio required a complete overhaul in terms of underwriting culture, establishing global standards and dramatically altering limits deployed. In addition, we knew that our businesses needed to be repositioned in the marketplace to become more competitive and relevant to clients. We also moved quickly to design a comprehensive global reinsurance program, which has been evolving as our portfolio improves. This program vastly reduced volatility and unpredictability in outcomes and was a critical component of our overall strategy, allowing us to move faster in re-underwriting the GI portfolio. We built a world-class team and a strengthened bench across the world and our completely revamped risk appetite was successfully communicated to and accepted by the marketplace. We also achieved our goal of entering 2020 with an underwriting profit and since the second quarter of 2018 our adjusted accident year combined ratio has gone from 101% to 94.9%, a 610 basis point improvement. This is a result of the outstanding work done by the team and we've built considerable momentum that will allow us to continue to improve our financial results. With respect to our global commercial portfolio, it has been significantly remediated and while there will always be opportunities for improvement this portfolio is now positioned for further strengthening, more diversification and profitable growth. In Personal Insurance, as I outlined in our last call, we significantly de-risked private client group, known as PCG with the creation of Syndicate 2019 through our partnership with Lloyd's. In addition in late June, we announced an agreement to transition the PCG upper middle market clients to Liberty Mutual and Heritage Insurance this fall. PCG is a market leader and the innovative capital structure we carefully designed with Lloyd's, coupled with the disposition of our upper middle market business allows us to now focus on the areas in the high net worth segment where we bring the most value clients, as well as our brokers and agents.\nKevin Hogan: Thank you, Peter. And good morning, everyone. Today I will discuss overall Life & Retirement results for the second quarter, our current outlook and the results for each of our businesses. Life & Retirement recorded adjusted pre-tax income of $881 million for the quarter and delivered adjusted return on attributed common equity of 13.2%. With a significant rebound in equity markets during the quarter, we saw favorable benefits to both reserves and deferred acquisition costs, which had been impacted by negative equity market returns in the first quarter. This market recovery is not reflected in our private equity returns for the quarter, since they are generally reported on a one quarter lag. Adjusted pre-tax income decreased by $168 million from the very strong second quarter of last year, driven by unfavorable mortality resulting from COVID-19, lower returns from fair value option bonds to the volatile credit spreads, and the expected spread compression. Our current quarter also benefited from significant yield enhancements related to low interest rates, whereas results for the second quarter last year reflected a large IPO gain from a single private equity holding. Recognizing the limits of sensitivities, especially in times of macroeconomic stress and historic volatility, the sensitivities we previously provided have generally continued to hold up. However, our reported base investments spread compression is higher than we would otherwise expect, as we have continued to maintain liquidity and have held higher levels of cash on our balance sheet. Excluding the impact from this larger liquidity position, our base investment spreads would continue to be in the 8 to 16 basis point range of annual spread compression. Relative to equity markets and total yields, we have also updated our sensitivity estimates as of the end of the second quarter. We would expect a plus or minus 1% change in equity market returns to respectively increase or decrease adjusted pre-tax income by approximately $40 million to $50 million annually, a modest increase based on higher market levels than the first quarter. As to rates, a plus or minus 10 basis point movement on 10-year reinvestment rates would increase or decrease earnings by approximately $5 million to $15 million annually consistent with prior quarter. As always, it is important to note that these market sensitivity ranges are not exact nor linear, since our earnings are also impacted by the timing and degree of movements, as well as other factors. Our risk management and discipline are serving us well in these challenging times, noting our hedging program has continued to perform as expected and our balance sheet remained strong. We currently estimate our fleet risk-based capital ratio for the second quarter to be between 420% and 430%, well above our target range of 375% to 400%, providing a good buffer for the uncertainty of the current environment. Further, as we have repriced and restructured many of our products, our new business margins generally remain within our targets at currently minimal returns  Sales were significantly lower in the quarter, especially in the retail annuity market, as our distribution partners responded to their own challenges. Towards the end of the quarter, we began to see improvement in retail annuity activity, as our distribution partners responded to the new environment. As of today, based on early indications, we have seen a strong rebound in sales compared to June and our retail new business pipeline continues to build, suggesting improving volumes from historically low second quarter levels. Our broad position across products and channels has been especially advantageous during these times. For example, as retail annuity sales languished in the second quarter, we expanded our pension risk transfer business, concluding several significant reinsurance transactions. We remain well-positioned and confident to deploy capital as attractive opportunities arise across our businesses. Now, I will turn to our second quarter results for each of our businesses. The challenging sales environment for individual retirement that I noted resulted in negative net flows for annuities. For group retirement, premiums and deposits decreased due to lower new group acquisitions, as well as reduced individual product sales. Despite lower sales, net flows were essentially flat due to lower group and individual surrenders  For our Life Insurance business, total premiums and deposits increased due to higher international life premiums. Our estimate for the impact from excess mortality of all causes, including COVID-19 is also in a  level of mortality net of reinsurance and longevity offsets that is modestly higher than pricing assumptions. Based on a small and evolving dataset, we currently estimate that around 40% of our COVID-19 related death claims reflect an acceleration of claims we would have otherwise experienced in the next five years. Our recent mortality experience will be factored into our longer term experience studies in our annual review of actuarial assumptions which will occur in the third quarter. In isolation, we do not currently expect COVID-19 losses to have a large impact on our long term mortality assumptions. For institutional markets, adjusted pre-tax income was favorably impacted by the yield enhancement activity I noted earlier. We significantly grew premiums and deposits and continue to develop attractive new opportunities across the portfolio. In particular, the pipeline for pension risk transfer opportunities, both direct and through reinsurance is very strong. To close, we remain well-positioned to meet the ever growing needs for protection, retirement savings and lifetime income solutions. Now, I will turn it over to Mark.\nMark Lyons: Thank you, Kevin and good morning all. AIG produced strong underlying performance this quarter, particularly in the thematic areas of risk reduction, liquidity and capital preservation. Overall, AIG reported adjusted pre-tax income of $803 million and adjusted after tax income of $571 million or $0.66 per diluted share, compared to a $1.3 billion or a $1.43 per share in the second quarter of 2019. The key drivers of the year-over-year reduction were higher catastrophe losses from COVID and civil unrest, along with lower net investment income. Positive contributions stem from continued improvement in general insurances, adjusted accident year results, stronger likely retirement returns and our ongoing disciplined focus on costs. As Peter noted, the continued focus on general insurance underwriting profitability and expense management drove 120 basis point improvement in the accident year combined ratio ex-CAT. However, commercial lines was even stronger with a 400 basis point improvement on a global basis, made up of a 320 basis point improvement in North America and 500 basis points of improvement in international. General Insurance's second quarter APGI  was a $175 million, down $805 from the second quarter of 2019, due to a $350 million reduction in net investment income, driven by the combined impact of alternative investment losses and the continued impact of lower reinvestment rates on available for sale income and a $500 million increase in catastrophe losses. Peter discussed second quarter catastrophe losses, but I'd point out that in the aggregate they represent 11.9 loss ratio points and that the non-COVID non-civil unrest CAT reserves represent just 1.6 loss ratio points versus 2.6 loss ratio points in the second quarter of 2019. Prior period development was net favorable by $74 million, $53 million of which was associated with the amortization of the ADC deferred gain. For North America personal lines, the combined impact of lower travel premiums and the Syndicate 2019 structure sessions caused a sharp change in business mix within the segment for the quarter, which impacted both the loss ratio and expense ratio compared to the prior year. These impacts, which include some catch-up premiums caused the net written premiums to be negative for the quarter. The structure however should significantly reduce the future only combined ratio volatility of the Personal lines book, while allowing us to continue to profitably grow this business. Looking forward to 2021, we anticipate retaining approximately 25% of the PCG premium. However for the balance of 2020 for the totality of the North America personal insurance segment, as reported in our financial supplement, we estimate roughly $425 million and $325 million of net written premium and net earned premium respectively for each of the next two quarters. Turning to Life & Retirement. As Kevin mentioned, Life & Retirement achieved a 13.2% annualized return on attributed equity for the quarter, that $881 million of APTI was aided by lower DAC amortization due to the recovery of the financial markets, after the large increase in amortization in the first quarter of 2020 related to that quarter's market decline. So a better measure is the year-to-date nearly 11% return on attributed equity. Kevin described the market through his various product sets, but it should also be noted that surrender/LAP rates were noticeably lower for both individual and group retirement, as well as the life unit of both the quarter over quarter and sequential basis. Shifting to Investments. Net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.2 billion or $537 million lower than the second quarter of 2019 and impacted both General Insurance and Life & Retirement APTI. The reduction was primarily driven by a $514  million year-over-year negative swing in private equity results, with $276 million of losses recorded in this second quarter compared with a particularly high amount in second quarter of 2019 reserve \u2013 returns, which it has included a one-time large IPO gain. Like others in the industry, we generally report private equity on a one quarter lag due to the timing evaluation information received from the managers. So the second quarter's loss reflects March 31 2020 valuations. On a sequential basis, however, APTI net investment income improved by almost $500 million from the first quarter, even though the second quarter only had two months of Fortitude related NII. This reflects the impact of the strong capital market recovery in the second quarter on hedge funds and fair value option income. But please note that in future quarters APTI and after tax income will not include Fortitude, although the investments themselves will continue to be included on our GAAP balance sheet. We'll get into more of that too. Turning to other operations, the adjusted pre-tax loss after consolidations and eliminations was $510 million, an improvement of $25 million sequentially and $76 million of improvement from the fourth quarter of 2019. Reflecting AIGs continuous focus on expense reductions, corporate interest expense was slightly higher due to our May bond issuance and will increase corporate interest expense for the second half of 2020 and into the first half of 2021. Our legacy segment had $257 million of APTI in the quarter, $96 million of which was from Fortitude before the impact of not-consolidating interests. The remaining $161 million is related to other one-off General Insurance, Life & Retirement and Investment portfolios. As Brian noted, on June 2nd we completed the sale of Fortitude and because it closed during the quarter the second quarter included earnings for April and May only in APTI. The net earnings on the funds withheld assets are excluded from APTI for the month of June, as the economics of those assets were shifted to Fortitude upon closing. Now shifting from adjusted after tax income to GAAP below the line impacts on net income attributable to common shareholders equity. The second quarter included two largely non-economic items I'd like to unpack. The first item which I focused on during our last call involves the GAAP recognition of our variable annuity hedging program, which requires a non-performance adjustment or NPA. In the second quarter, we recorded an approximate $1 billion GAAP pre-tax loss, which is shown and discussed on pages 158 through 160 of the 10-Q, which will be filed later today. And this represents a partial reversal of the large gains we recorded in the first quarter of 2020, as our hedge program is designed to offset interest rate and equity market changes on annuity reserves. The second item involves the sale of Fortitude. As Brian noted, the completion of this majority stake sale represents a significant milestone in de-risking our balance sheet and improving our asset liability management profile. However, it also created a lot of noise on a GAAWP basis, so I will highlight five key impacts that cut through the associated complex accounting. But I will also direct you to the robust disclosures we've included in our slides, financial supplement and 10-Q to help navigate the accounting involved. Additionally, our investor relations staff now stands ready to help with your understanding. The five core highlights I'd like to make sure we communicate are as follows. First, nearly $35 billion of GAAP reserves are now recoverable from a fully collateralized third party re-insurer in which AIG now retains a 3.5% interest. Second and perhaps most importantly is the recognition that the GAAP accounting impact is largely non-economic, as this transaction had no adverse impact on the statutory capital of our insurance company. The assets are marked to fair value, but GAAP reserving practices don't reflect analogous fair value adjustments on the liabilities. Accordingly had the policyholder benefit reserves been fair valued to reflect current low interest rates their fair value would have been higher and have more closely aligned the GAAP accounting with the true underlying economics. Third, from a GAAP accounting perspective the impact on common shareholders equity is a $4.3 billion reduction. However, the impact on adjusted common shareholders equity is a lesser $2.5 Billion reduction with the major difference being an adjustment for $4.2 billion of unrealized appreciation on the supporting funds withheld assets included in our AOCI. As you recall, AOCI is one of the items historically removed in AIGs definition of adjusted common shareholders equity. Fourth, the components of the $6.7 billion dollar GAAP net income loss are comprised of two broad items. First is a loss on de-consolidation of the previously disclosed $2.7 billion for prepaid reinsurance assets and deferred acquisition expenses. The second item is the loss on sale which totaled $4 billion, which is primarily due to the increase in Fortitude GAAP equity from mark-to-market on the investment portfolio, primarily the funds withheld assets. Fifth, AIG has updated several non-GAAP financial measures this quarter to remove asymmetrical accounting treatments. There will be ongoing below the line volatility in our GAAP result. So to help navigate this, our continuing disclosures, plus our Investor Relations team will drive understanding of this asymmetry and the need for these definitional adjustments. And lastly on this, we will be-re segmenting before year end to better align with management's view of assessing operating performance, given the legacy segments now expected de minimis contribution to APTI. Turning to the balance sheet. At June 30th 2020 book value per share was $71.64, down 2.7% from one year ago and adjusted book value per share, which excludes AOCI, the DTA and unrealized gains on the Fortitude funds withheld assets was down 1.7% from one year ago. During the quarter, tighter credit spreads compared to March 31 reversed the negative mark-to-market impact on AFS securities that we had at March 31, with a net increase in AOCI of $10.2 billion in the second quarter. We continue to place a high emphasis on maintaining ample liquidity and a strong capital position in this economic environment. At June 30, AIG had parent liquidity of $10.7 billion. This is in addition to our fully undrawn $4.5 billion revolving credit facility. During the second quarter, we issued $4.1 billion of senior debt and receive $2.2 billion of proceeds related to the sale of Fortitude, of which $1.3 billion were retained at parent. We also repaid our precautionary $1.3 billion March 2020 credit facility borrowing in full and made a $548 million pre payments to the IRS related to principal and penalties on our previously disclosed tax settlement on cross border transactions that date back to the 1990s. We will pay the balance of this settlement up to $1.2 billion pending receipt of the final interest calculation potentially by the end of this year, with the ultimate amount depending on the potential application of interest netting for the crude interest calculation which AIG has requested. We do not plan to repurchase shares in the near term and have $1.3 billion in maturity senior notes in the second half of 2020, as well as $1.5 billion of maturing notes in the first quarter of 2021. All of which will be funded with cash on hand. Turning to subsidiary capital. AIG's insurance fleet capitalization and liquidity levels remained very strong. At June 30th, RBC fleet ratios for General Insurances US pool as for Life & Retirement are above the prior year levels and above the higher end of our target operating ranges, providing solid buffers for absorbing potential COVID-19 losses, capital market volatility or credit impacts. Also, our ratings and stable outlook were affirmed by S&P following its regular annual review. We continue to prioritize liquidity, strong operating capitalization and financial flexibility as we navigate this ongoing uncertain environment. Our balance sheet and liquidity are strong and our investment portfolio is diversified and significantly derisked compared to years past. We remain focused on the continuing improvement of General Insurance profitability, managing Life & Retirement prudently in a low interest rate environment and executing AIG 200 on schedule and on budget. We are convinced that AIG will exit this unusual crisis as a stronger, more resilient company. And with that, I will now turn the call back over to Brian.\nBrian Duperreault: Thank you, Mark. I think it's time for Q&A. So operator, can we start the Q&A process?\nOperator: Thank you.  We\u2019ll now take our first question from Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nMichael Phillips: Thank you. And good morning, Brian and everybody. First question, focus on North America Commercial lines where your core loss ratio improvement  looks pretty decent on the surface. I guess, I'm going to dive into that a little bit. You know, we've seen some competitors talk about some frequency benefits, because of COVID. I suspect that's not much the case here. But I want to make sure, given your, you know, your book of business, high layers, high limits and larger corporate accounts, that may not see - you may not be seeing as much frequency benefit from COVID in that core loss ratio for North America Commercial. So can you maybe talk about that a little bit and go through what\u2019s really behind that 1.7  improvement?\nBrian Duperreault: Well, I think that's - Michael, that's a good question for Peter and the frequency benefits or lack thereof. Peter, can you answer that?\nPeter Zaffino: Yeah, sure. Brian, thank you and good morning, Michael. You\u2019re correct, we did not take the frequency benefits in the quarter. If there was any sign of a better frequency relative to expectations, it was in some of our international business in auto in Japan. But we've seen that over the last several quarters. You know, when you think about - I'm going to go to workers compensation, because I think that's the one that stands out the most, which is you know, we've had frequency in COVID, it's typically I would say 70% in industries related to healthcare. But it's very unique because again, we have high retentions, most of that over 90% is related to businesses where we have a deductible of $1 million or greater. So that frequency really hasn't impacted us. And then we have seen a commensurate reduction in frequency in non-COVID related claims. Again, their observation this quarter, again, a lot of is on retention business, but we haven't recognized it yet because we want to see how it emerges. You know, one thing back on COVID workers comp, which is very interesting is that, over 50% of the claims that we've seen over the last four months, about 50% of them are already closed. So it's a very different type of loss relative to workers compensation. Other the lines that we've seen in the liability and auto, again, it'll be slow to recognize that, we've seen reduced frequency and we\u2019ll give you an update next quarter once we have a little bit more experience.\nMichael Phillips: Okay, great. Thank you. Second question would be throughout all last year, you guys were one of the few companies that did actually have a margin improvement, and that's because of all your renovating  opportunities done for the past couple years. I guess, can you talk about where are you in that process? And what inning are you in with the efforts  You mentioned rate, now we're all getting rates or rates from all trend you said. But how much of that re-underwriting effort has been done and how much more still can be done?\nBrian Duperreault: Okay, Michael, I think again, that's Peter.\nPeter Zaffino: Yeah, Michael. So I think we're in a really good place. I mean, you know, we - when I said in my opening comments, what are the areas where we had headwinds in new business, which I think the industry has seen when everybody was going to work remotely, what drove the growth, it was driven by better retention, we had, you know, 400 basis points of improvement, in international 500 basis points improvement on retention of our clients within North America. So I think that reflects that we like the portfolio, and we're trying to be very helpful to our clients and distribution partners by deploying capital, of course, you know, in a different dynamic and need to make sure that we're getting the appropriate returns. And I think you saw that in the rate. So I think the combination of retention of a portfolio we like and we can grow, combined with a positive rate environment, I think contributed to the overall growth on the NPW commercial.\nBrian Duperreault: Okay, Michael.\nMichael Phillips: Thanks.\nBrian Duperreault: Next question, please.\nOperator: We\u2019ll now take our next question from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is also related to the Commercial business. You guys mentioned some of the prices that you're getting on into the double digits on and said that that's in excess of trend. Could you just give us a sense on you know, where loss trends fit in your commercial business and how that's, you know, changed so far this year, just as we think about kind of the spread between price and loss trend on that, you know, can start running through your margin?\nBrian Duperreault: Okay. Elyse, thanks. I think in terms of trends, et cetera, certainly Mark is the better responder. Mark, can you answer the question?\nMark Lyons: Yeah. Thank you, Brian. Appreciate that. Hello, Elyse. So you know, in the areas, I think that mostly asking about, take like excess businesses, that trend, pure loss cost trend is approaching double digits. When you get into auto, it's a little bit less, probably in the 7%, 8% area. And then other primary lines are a little less than that. But you've got - when you weigh it all together with things like you know, with property and other loss sensitive-related exposure bases, it kind of drops it off. So there's - I'm not going to get into the weighted average in total, but I\u2019ll tell you that we look at every single line and reflect that in our thinking. I wanted to give you the range where it could be a couple percentage points and some short tail lines up to almost double digits and some more volatile excess line.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay, that's helpful. And then my second question is on the earned premium, I guess on Commercial lines and you know, Personal lines is impacted by that quota share. But within Commercial we've seen some pretty good growth in both North America and internationally on the written  side, but earned on, no, it's still decelerating just given, you know, a lot of your business mix actions that you took. So is it right way to think about it that, you know, just given the earn-ins, we could see some pressure on that earned within Commercial over the balance of the year and that could start to see some growth in 2021?\nBrian Duperreault: Mark, why don\u2019t you take that one too, please?\nMark Lyons: Yeah, I think you actually answered your own question, you get the increasing, you know, impact of the Casualty quota share, and that's really what you're seeing.\nBrian Duperreault: Okay. Elyse, thank you. Next question please?\nOperator: Next question is from Brian Meredith from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBrian Meredith: Thank you. One quick numbered questions and another broader question. First one, Mark, I wonder if you could give us a quick guidance on what dividend and interest income is going to look like in General Insurance? Big drop off, obviously, in the second quarter, was there anything unusual there? Is that kind of a run rate given where we are right now, as far as investment yields?\nBrian Duperreault: Hey, Mar. Go ahead, please.\nMark Lyons: Yeah, thank you, Brian. You've cut out a little bit on me Brian, were you asking about investment yields in GI?\nBrian Meredith: Yeah. I am looking overall but also in GI, in particular, you had a big drop off in investment yield sequentially. And I am just wondering if there's anything in there or rate securities or something else that was causing the drop so much or that's kind of a true run rate?\nMark Lyons: Yes, yes, actually. You guys are getting good. You\u2019re answering you own question. So there's two things going on, the last quarter, I think was the first quarter we allowed the disclosure to even see that. So the drop off you see is somewhat caused by what you just said, and I'll get it that more a little bit later and one of it is just a bit of a correction. So, last quarter's GI yield was over \u2013 so think of it as overstated. There was a $20 million Canadian security correction. But I think the heart of your question, so that would have come down another 12 basis points, something like that. To the extent of - on the current quarter with the structured securities, you're right, a lot of that stuff is floating, but you're really required to retrospectively look at it and look at what has happened and what your view of the future is, and what that implied yield is and if that yield is lower than what you've booked, you have to do a catch up on it. And that's what you're seeing in the quarter. So you can adjust for some of those Brian, and it looks to me it be a 9 to 10 basis point drop off sequentially, not as steep as it appears.\nBrian Meredith: Great.\nBrian Duperreault: Brian, do you have a follow up?\nBrian Meredith: Yeah, absolutely Brian. And this is I guess, more for you and Peter. Given how low yields are right now. I'm wondering what type of underlying combined ratio or combined ratio do you need to achieve, do you believe in your General Insurance business now to earn an acceptable return on capital? And if you had to kind of alter your targets?\nBrian Duperreault: Well, that's a great question, Brian. I guess I'll take that. Yeah, I mean, double digit returns with a higher interest rate makes sense with these low interest rates, it probably comes down. You know, I would say that, it's an evolving - right now, it's an evolving process and, you know, its difficult with COVID to understand what steady state looks like. But, you know, my gut would say that something in the double digit range is possible. It's becoming more difficult because of the low interest rates. So it's more like, you know, what's the return over the risk free rates. So, I - it's hard to say, you know, we're just driving this thing down. When we get into a market like this where rates are rising, terms and conditions are improving, you're not - you don't have a fixed number that you're going to try to hit. We're going to take advantage of the market and have the results that we can achieve with this elevated level of risk received  in the marketplace, I guess, that\u2019s the best way to put it Brian. Can me move on to the next question, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nErik Bass: Hi, thank you. As we've talked about some of the benefits from Syndicate \u201819 in terms of volatility and reduction in the fee income you'll generate and those makes sense and should be clear positive over time. Stepping back from a near term perspective, do you see this as enhancing or detracting from the normalized earnings of the personal line segment?\nBrian Duperreault: Eric, let me start with this and then I'll let Peter pick it up. So look when you make a change like this is certainly a disruption you know, with ceded premiums and the unearned going out, and so, there will be some dislocation. Obviously, we saw in the second quarter to bleed into the third. Overall though, you know, when things normalize, as we approach the end of the year, this will be a net benefit to the company, it is a - as Mark said, a capital-light structure and it basically allows us to grow the business and we could not grow it given the concentration of CAT exposure, with the approach we've taken now the structure of Lloyds and its capital efficiency and the ability to spread it, we can now take the benefits net and actually grow it and have the net grow. Peter, do you want to add anything to that?\nPeter Zaffino: Yeah, just a couple of points. Brian, as you said, I mean I think de-risking, reposition the portfolio for growth is important. That reduced volatility increase in capital flexibility. I think the second quarter is going to be the noisiest just because of the catch up on the, you know, unearned premium, and seasonally the second quarter was the largest on the net premium written side. So again, you\u2019ll still see some noise in the third and fourth, but not to the degree you saw in the second and we just been very focused on accelerating the transition. So we can get to 2021 with the unearned, you know, largely gone away and then reposition Syndicate 2019 to be very competitive in the market, in terms of value. So we're really excited about what this is going to mean for the business and for our clients, and distribution partners.\nBrian Duperreault: Do you have a follow up Erik, do you have a follow up?\nErik Bass: Yes, thank you. And then second, just with the lower level of sales in Life & Retirement, how does this affect your outlook for capital generation? And are you planning to keep any sort of excess capital you generate in the Life subs? Or do you see opportunities to shift capital to P&C to take advantage of some of the more favorable pricing backdrop?\nBrian Duperreault: Well, let me have Kevin just talk about the sales, because we are seeing a pickup of it. So it may be premature to talk about our capital, but I'll get back to that. Kevin, you want to start with the sales piece?\nKevin Hogan: Yeah, sure. Thanks, Erik. The quarter was the lowest in memory. But you know, towards the latter part of June, we saw some real signs of life. During the quarter, the channel that really was disrupted the most was the bank channel, which was down around 60%. And if we look at just the month of July, over June, the bank channel was back to almost double. So you know, that the disruption that impacted that channel the most we've seen starting to turn around. For financial advisors, broker dealers, and IMOs, you know, they were down about 40%. But I think that the virtual sales practices that they adopted, and we tended to reprice earlier than many companies. And so I think as other companies caught up with repricing that leveled the playing field a bit. Again, what we saw following the month of June, looking at July over June, we saw substantial increase in sales and the pipeline is growing and our sales of annuities per day  continued to increase. So we're pretty optimistic that if conditions continue the way they are, we'll see recovery in July over June and in the third quarter over the second. Life Insurance continued to grow despite the disruption, we saw about 4% growth in the second quarter. And that trend continues, particularly our direct channel is performing very well. And in retirement services, it's important to note that periodic premiums, which are really the backbone of that business, we\u2019re only down 4% in the second quarter. And again, you know, our advisor channel is back up and focused on their customers and its individual sales generally follow the retail individual retirement sales. So when you back that up with the fact that the pension risk transfer business and pipeline is as strong as we've ever seen it and we've opened up the reinsurance channel, we feel cautiously optimistic that second quarter will be the low watermark and our strategy will prevail in the third quarter and beyond, recognizing all the uncertainties in the market.\nPeter Zaffino: Yeah. Thanks, Kevin. And I\u2019ll just add, if you look at the \u2013 the opportunities seem to be much more in GI though, yes. It's not as extreme as maybe the sales in the second quarter might have indicated. But, you know, we will move our attention where we think the greatest growth and returns are occurring. And right now GI looks pretty good. So we move on to the next question then please?\nOperator: Thank you. And next question comes from Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nYaron Kinar: Thank you very much. A couple of questions on GI. So first, can you maybe talk about how you're thinking of loss fix here with rates well in excess of loss trend? On the one hand, you also have the COVID driven favorable frequency, more short term, I guess, on the other. And I asked what's in the context of North America commercial loss ratio, which I guess, improved year-over-year, but actually weakened a bit sequentially?\nBrian Duperreault: Yeah. Thanks, Yaron. I think that's a Mark question. Mark, loss fix?\nMark Lyons: I can certainly start that. Thank you, Brian. Well, you do have a lot of forces. We\u2019re happy to be, I think one of the catalysts on this market. And level of increases, Peter talked about it continued to increase at an increasing rate, I think it\u2019s a fair statement. But you do have other things, we don't know the longer term impacts on many third party and first party lines of COVID, for example. Social inflation is more of a general upward movement, as opposed to a lot of specifics that you can nail down. And so I think there's still the thought amongst us in the industry that there's potential for freight  moving up. I think there should be some back to normality between interest rates and inflation and we're probably heading more into an inflationary environment. So a little cautious on the fact that we're seeing this great rate increase, and there's more variability, and I flipped it from a year ago, where there was more variability around, what kind of price increase can we get? Now we see that the magnitude of the price increases we can get, and there's more variability about the future look loss cost trends.\nYaron Kinar: Okay.\nBrian Duperreault: Yaron, do you have a follow up?\nYaron Kinar: I do. So in the \u2013 in commercial premiums that has been growing, and it sounds like you're pretty constructive on those lines and growth there. Can you talk about the potential offset impact of exposure there? I think we've heard from some of your peers that exposure is coming in and that\u2019s quite a headwind?\nBrian Duperreault: Yeah. Peter, can you talk about exposures?\nPeter Zaffino: Sure. Thank you, Yaron for the question. I think when you think about compared to our competitors, remember, we don't have as much you know, guaranteed cost business. And so therefore, it's not a direct correlation to effect on payroll sales, and that's going to result in a commensurate premium reduction. You know, as we have the in force book that we have, you know, minimum deposits on our excess business, in most cases. I think when, you know, we look to the future in terms of some of the changes on frequency and changes on payroll and sales, you know, it could have a modest headwind, which is what we had talked about in last quarters call. In terms of exposure base for renewals, and, you know, could have a slight impact on premium, but I would look to it on, you know, we're trying to solve issues on excess. We're deploying capital, I mean, those are - have led to better risk adjusted returns, because, we are still coming up with similar structures. And, you know, while there may be a little bit of light headwinds in terms of overall exposure, should not have a material impact on our premium, as we look to the third and fourth quarter based on what we know today.\nBrian Duperreault: Thank you. We've run a little late. Maybe we could take one last question, operator?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hi. On the travel insurance book, I think you wrote a little bit over a $1 billion of premiums last year. Can you discuss how much that shrunk and whether you're seeing any sort of signs of recovery in that book, either in the US or in international markets? And then also on P&C, with you having restructured your portfolio and reinsurance program? Are you thinking about any major changes in reinsurance, as you're looking at next year, given the hardening market there?\nBrian Duperreault: Jimmy the first book of business that you referred to was what? I didn't pick that up\u2026\nJimmy Bhullar: The travel book...\nBrian Duperreault: Yeah, got it. Yeah\u2026\nJimmy Bhullar: $1billion book and it's shrinking, I'm just trying to get an idea on whether you're seeing\u2026\nBrian Duperreault: Thanks, Jimmy. Yeah, Peter, I think those are both yours.\nPeter Zaffino: Yeah. So on the first one on the travel, again, the second quarter, you know, you had not only no new sales, you also had cancellation. And so I think that, that was one that was a headwind and contributed to the North American personal negative premium written. Now as we look at, it's hard to predict, again, we don't know what's going to happen with COVID. We don't know when travel is going to resume. It's less than a $1 billion in North America and it's fairly evenly spread in terms of quarter-to-quarter. I think we would have some modest sales in the third quarter, probably about a third as to what our run rate would be. But again, very hard to predict. We think that there is a dynamic in that business that's interesting, which is, you know, nobody really contemplated, I think, in terms of clients, and the CAT. And so I think there's going to be a rebase in terms of how we price this business, what the economics are going forward and don't want to overreact, you know, sort of Q2  a quarter in terms of travel and think that as it starts to rebound, we think the economics will be better. But again, we'll give an update as to what it looks like in the third quarter in terms of if there's a rebound or not. I'm sorry, I didn\u2019t get the second question, Jimmy?\nJimmy Bhullar: It was just on reinsurance prices going up, are you kind of thinking about sort of maybe retaining more risk or changing your reinsurance program in anyway?\nPeter Zaffino: Well, we're going to have to, you know, try out our virtual Monte Carlo in September, which is really with a kick off I think we probably would have had 100 meetings scheduled at AIG under normal conditions. I don't think that we're going to - you know, we look at the reinsurance structures than any repositioning, it will reflect the growth portfolio, not trying to say the market conditions are much stronger. Therefore, we're going to dump treaties because we always talked about the reduction of volatility, making sure we had more predictable outcomes. And we have great partnerships that we trade across every geography and multiple lines of business with our reinsurance partners. But we would expect to see changes in our reinsurance programs that reflect the excellent underwriting that we've been doing, and the gross improvement that we've seen quarter-to-quarter. So we begin to have those discussions, what we have in terms of structures? I don't think they'll be something that materially changes, but I would expect some refinements to reflect the portfolio as it is today.\nBrian Duperreault: Okay. Thank you, Jimmy. Thank you.\nBrian Duperreault: Well, let me just close and thank everybody for joining us this morning. And I particularly want to thank my AIG colleagues around the world. I mean, these last few months have really been challenging on many, many fronts and I'm so grateful for your hard work and dedication on this journey we're on and I hope everyone stays safe and healthy. Wear your masks. Okay. Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Peter Zaffino",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian. And good morning, everyone. Today I plan to provide more detail on Brian's comments regarding the General Insurance second quarter results, COVID-19, the current market environment and I will finish with an update on AIG 200. This month marks my third anniversary of joining Brian at AIG and when I look back at where we started our journey, the progress our team has made is extraordinary. As we've discussed on prior calls, during our first year at AIG we determined the GI portfolio required a complete overhaul in terms of underwriting culture, establishing global standards and dramatically altering limits deployed. In addition, we knew that our businesses needed to be repositioned in the marketplace to become more competitive and relevant to clients. We also moved quickly to design a comprehensive global reinsurance program, which has been evolving as our portfolio improves. This program vastly reduced volatility and unpredictability in outcomes and was a critical component of our overall strategy, allowing us to move faster in re-underwriting the GI portfolio. We built a world-class team and a strengthened bench across the world and our completely revamped risk appetite was successfully communicated to and accepted by the marketplace. We also achieved our goal of entering 2020 with an underwriting profit and since the second quarter of 2018 our adjusted accident year combined ratio has gone from 101% to 94.9%, a 610 basis point improvement. This is a result of the outstanding work done by the team and we've built considerable momentum that will allow us to continue to improve our financial results. With respect to our global commercial portfolio, it has been significantly remediated and while there will always be opportunities for improvement this portfolio is now positioned for further strengthening, more diversification and profitable growth. In Personal Insurance, as I outlined in our last call, we significantly de-risked private client group, known as PCG with the creation of Syndicate 2019 through our partnership with Lloyd's. In addition in late June, we announced an agreement to transition the PCG upper middle market clients to Liberty Mutual and Heritage Insurance this fall. PCG is a market leader and the innovative capital structure we carefully designed with Lloyd's, coupled with the disposition of our upper middle market business allows us to now focus on the areas in the high net worth segment where we bring the most value clients, as well as our brokers and agents. Yeah, sure. Brian, thank you and good morning, Michael. You\u2019re correct, we did not take the frequency benefits in the quarter. If there was any sign of a better frequency relative to expectations, it was in some of our international business in auto in Japan. But we've seen that over the last several quarters. You know, when you think about - I'm going to go to workers compensation, because I think that's the one that stands out the most, which is you know, we've had frequency in COVID, it's typically I would say 70% in industries related to healthcare. But it's very unique because again, we have high retentions, most of that over 90% is related to businesses where we have a deductible of $1 million or greater. So that frequency really hasn't impacted us. And then we have seen a commensurate reduction in frequency in non-COVID related claims. Again, their observation this quarter, again, a lot of is on retention business, but we haven't recognized it yet because we want to see how it emerges. You know, one thing back on COVID workers comp, which is very interesting is that, over 50% of the claims that we've seen over the last four months, about 50% of them are already closed. So it's a very different type of loss relative to workers compensation. Other the lines that we've seen in the liability and auto, again, it'll be slow to recognize that, we've seen reduced frequency and we\u2019ll give you an update next quarter once we have a little bit more experience. Yeah, Michael. So I think we're in a really good place. I mean, you know, we - when I said in my opening comments, what are the areas where we had headwinds in new business, which I think the industry has seen when everybody was going to work remotely, what drove the growth, it was driven by better retention, we had, you know, 400 basis points of improvement, in international 500 basis points improvement on retention of our clients within North America. So I think that reflects that we like the portfolio, and we're trying to be very helpful to our clients and distribution partners by deploying capital, of course, you know, in a different dynamic and need to make sure that we're getting the appropriate returns. And I think you saw that in the rate. So I think the combination of retention of a portfolio we like and we can grow, combined with a positive rate environment, I think contributed to the overall growth on the NPW commercial. Yeah, just a couple of points. Brian, as you said, I mean I think de-risking, reposition the portfolio for growth is important. That reduced volatility increase in capital flexibility. I think the second quarter is going to be the noisiest just because of the catch up on the, you know, unearned premium, and seasonally the second quarter was the largest on the net premium written side. So again, you\u2019ll still see some noise in the third and fourth, but not to the degree you saw in the second and we just been very focused on accelerating the transition. So we can get to 2021 with the unearned, you know, largely gone away and then reposition Syndicate 2019 to be very competitive in the market, in terms of value. So we're really excited about what this is going to mean for the business and for our clients, and distribution partners. Yeah. Thanks, Kevin. And I\u2019ll just add, if you look at the \u2013 the opportunities seem to be much more in GI though, yes. It's not as extreme as maybe the sales in the second quarter might have indicated. But, you know, we will move our attention where we think the greatest growth and returns are occurring. And right now GI looks pretty good. So we move on to the next question then please? Sure. Thank you, Yaron for the question. I think when you think about compared to our competitors, remember, we don't have as much you know, guaranteed cost business. And so therefore, it's not a direct correlation to effect on payroll sales, and that's going to result in a commensurate premium reduction. You know, as we have the in force book that we have, you know, minimum deposits on our excess business, in most cases. I think when, you know, we look to the future in terms of some of the changes on frequency and changes on payroll and sales, you know, it could have a modest headwind, which is what we had talked about in last quarters call. In terms of exposure base for renewals, and, you know, could have a slight impact on premium, but I would look to it on, you know, we're trying to solve issues on excess. We're deploying capital, I mean, those are - have led to better risk adjusted returns, because, we are still coming up with similar structures. And, you know, while there may be a little bit of light headwinds in terms of overall exposure, should not have a material impact on our premium, as we look to the third and fourth quarter based on what we know today. Yeah. So on the first one on the travel, again, the second quarter, you know, you had not only no new sales, you also had cancellation. And so I think that, that was one that was a headwind and contributed to the North American personal negative premium written. Now as we look at, it's hard to predict, again, we don't know what's going to happen with COVID. We don't know when travel is going to resume. It's less than a $1 billion in North America and it's fairly evenly spread in terms of quarter-to-quarter. I think we would have some modest sales in the third quarter, probably about a third as to what our run rate would be. But again, very hard to predict. We think that there is a dynamic in that business that's interesting, which is, you know, nobody really contemplated, I think, in terms of clients, and the CAT. And so I think there's going to be a rebase in terms of how we price this business, what the economics are going forward and don't want to overreact, you know, sort of Q2  a quarter in terms of travel and think that as it starts to rebound, we think the economics will be better. But again, we'll give an update as to what it looks like in the third quarter in terms of if there's a rebound or not. I'm sorry, I didn\u2019t get the second question, Jimmy?

            "name": "Kevin Hogan",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter. And good morning, everyone. Today I will discuss overall Life & Retirement results for the second quarter, our current outlook and the results for each of our businesses. Life & Retirement recorded adjusted pre-tax income of $881 million for the quarter and delivered adjusted return on attributed common equity of 13.2%. With a significant rebound in equity markets during the quarter, we saw favorable benefits to both reserves and deferred acquisition costs, which had been impacted by negative equity market returns in the first quarter. This market recovery is not reflected in our private equity returns for the quarter, since they are generally reported on a one quarter lag. Adjusted pre-tax income decreased by $168 million from the very strong second quarter of last year, driven by unfavorable mortality resulting from COVID-19, lower returns from fair value option bonds to the volatile credit spreads, and the expected spread compression. Our current quarter also benefited from significant yield enhancements related to low interest rates, whereas results for the second quarter last year reflected a large IPO gain from a single private equity holding. Recognizing the limits of sensitivities, especially in times of macroeconomic stress and historic volatility, the sensitivities we previously provided have generally continued to hold up. However, our reported base investments spread compression is higher than we would otherwise expect, as we have continued to maintain liquidity and have held higher levels of cash on our balance sheet. Excluding the impact from this larger liquidity position, our base investment spreads would continue to be in the 8 to 16 basis point range of annual spread compression. Relative to equity markets and total yields, we have also updated our sensitivity estimates as of the end of the second quarter. We would expect a plus or minus 1% change in equity market returns to respectively increase or decrease adjusted pre-tax income by approximately $40 million to $50 million annually, a modest increase based on higher market levels than the first quarter. As to rates, a plus or minus 10 basis point movement on 10-year reinvestment rates would increase or decrease earnings by approximately $5 million to $15 million annually consistent with prior quarter. As always, it is important to note that these market sensitivity ranges are not exact nor linear, since our earnings are also impacted by the timing and degree of movements, as well as other factors. Our risk management and discipline are serving us well in these challenging times, noting our hedging program has continued to perform as expected and our balance sheet remained strong. We currently estimate our fleet risk-based capital ratio for the second quarter to be between 420% and 430%, well above our target range of 375% to 400%, providing a good buffer for the uncertainty of the current environment. Further, as we have repriced and restructured many of our products, our new business margins generally remain within our targets at currently minimal returns  Sales were significantly lower in the quarter, especially in the retail annuity market, as our distribution partners responded to their own challenges. Towards the end of the quarter, we began to see improvement in retail annuity activity, as our distribution partners responded to the new environment. As of today, based on early indications, we have seen a strong rebound in sales compared to June and our retail new business pipeline continues to build, suggesting improving volumes from historically low second quarter levels. Our broad position across products and channels has been especially advantageous during these times. For example, as retail annuity sales languished in the second quarter, we expanded our pension risk transfer business, concluding several significant reinsurance transactions. We remain well-positioned and confident to deploy capital as attractive opportunities arise across our businesses. Now, I will turn to our second quarter results for each of our businesses. The challenging sales environment for individual retirement that I noted resulted in negative net flows for annuities. For group retirement, premiums and deposits decreased due to lower new group acquisitions, as well as reduced individual product sales. Despite lower sales, net flows were essentially flat due to lower group and individual surrenders  For our Life Insurance business, total premiums and deposits increased due to higher international life premiums. Our estimate for the impact from excess mortality of all causes, including COVID-19 is also in a  level of mortality net of reinsurance and longevity offsets that is modestly higher than pricing assumptions. Based on a small and evolving dataset, we currently estimate that around 40% of our COVID-19 related death claims reflect an acceleration of claims we would have otherwise experienced in the next five years. Our recent mortality experience will be factored into our longer term experience studies in our annual review of actuarial assumptions which will occur in the third quarter. In isolation, we do not currently expect COVID-19 losses to have a large impact on our long term mortality assumptions. For institutional markets, adjusted pre-tax income was favorably impacted by the yield enhancement activity I noted earlier. We significantly grew premiums and deposits and continue to develop attractive new opportunities across the portfolio. In particular, the pipeline for pension risk transfer opportunities, both direct and through reinsurance is very strong. To close, we remain well-positioned to meet the ever growing needs for protection, retirement savings and lifetime income solutions. Now, I will turn it over to Mark. Yeah, sure. Thanks, Erik. The quarter was the lowest in memory. But you know, towards the latter part of June, we saw some real signs of life. During the quarter, the channel that really was disrupted the most was the bank channel, which was down around 60%. And if we look at just the month of July, over June, the bank channel was back to almost double. So you know, that the disruption that impacted that channel the most we've seen starting to turn around. For financial advisors, broker dealers, and IMOs, you know, they were down about 40%. But I think that the virtual sales practices that they adopted, and we tended to reprice earlier than many companies. And so I think as other companies caught up with repricing that leveled the playing field a bit. Again, what we saw following the month of June, looking at July over June, we saw substantial increase in sales and the pipeline is growing and our sales of annuities per day  continued to increase. So we're pretty optimistic that if conditions continue the way they are, we'll see recovery in July over June and in the third quarter over the second. Life Insurance continued to grow despite the disruption, we saw about 4% growth in the second quarter. And that trend continues, particularly our direct channel is performing very well. And in retirement services, it's important to note that periodic premiums, which are really the backbone of that business, we\u2019re only down 4% in the second quarter. And again, you know, our advisor channel is back up and focused on their customers and its individual sales generally follow the retail individual retirement sales. So when you back that up with the fact that the pension risk transfer business and pipeline is as strong as we've ever seen it and we've opened up the reinsurance channel, we feel cautiously optimistic that second quarter will be the low watermark and our strategy will prevail in the third quarter and beyond, recognizing all the uncertainties in the market."

            "name": "Brian Duperreault",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I hope everyone is staying healthy and safe. Like last quarter our team is participating on the call from different locations. I'm joined by Peter, Kevin and Mike and Doug Dachille, our Chief Investment Officer will also be available for Q&A. AIG continues to show remarkable strength and resiliency as COVID-19 remains a formidable and ongoing catastrophe. Our global workforce has adjusted to working remotely and I am incredibly proud of how the team has become more unified and focused on supporting each other, our clients and other stakeholders during this unprecedented time. Throughout the second quarter, we continue to build on the strong foundation created since late 2017 to instil a culture of underwriting excellence, adjusted risk tolerances and implement a best-in-class reinsurance program. These actions strengthened and protected our balance sheet and are allowing us to effectively manage through COVID-19 and its collateral effects on the global economy in addition to natural catastrophes. We also made progress on strategic initiatives across AIG, including the early June closing of the sale of a majority stake in Fortitude, which significantly de-risked our balance sheet and represented the vast majority of our legacy portfolio. Our focus on de-risking is also reflected in how the overall investment portfolio was held up during this extended period of market uncertainty. Thank you, Mark. I think it's time for Q&A. So operator, can we start the Q&A process? Well, I think that's - Michael, that's a good question for Peter and the frequency benefits or lack thereof. Peter, can you answer that? Okay, Michael, I think again, that's Peter. Okay, Michael. Next question, please. Okay. Elyse, thanks. I think in terms of trends, et cetera, certainly Mark is the better responder. Mark, can you answer the question? Mark, why don\u2019t you take that one too, please? Okay. Elyse, thank you. Next question please? Hey, Mar. Go ahead, please. Brian, do you have a follow up? Well, that's a great question, Brian. I guess I'll take that. Yeah, I mean, double digit returns with a higher interest rate makes sense with these low interest rates, it probably comes down. You know, I would say that, it's an evolving - right now, it's an evolving process and, you know, its difficult with COVID to understand what steady state looks like. But, you know, my gut would say that something in the double digit range is possible. It's becoming more difficult because of the low interest rates. So it's more like, you know, what's the return over the risk free rates. So, I - it's hard to say, you know, we're just driving this thing down. When we get into a market like this where rates are rising, terms and conditions are improving, you're not - you don't have a fixed number that you're going to try to hit. We're going to take advantage of the market and have the results that we can achieve with this elevated level of risk received  in the marketplace, I guess, that\u2019s the best way to put it Brian. Can me move on to the next question, thanks. Eric, let me start with this and then I'll let Peter pick it up. So look when you make a change like this is certainly a disruption you know, with ceded premiums and the unearned going out, and so, there will be some dislocation. Obviously, we saw in the second quarter to bleed into the third. Overall though, you know, when things normalize, as we approach the end of the year, this will be a net benefit to the company, it is a - as Mark said, a capital-light structure and it basically allows us to grow the business and we could not grow it given the concentration of CAT exposure, with the approach we've taken now the structure of Lloyds and its capital efficiency and the ability to spread it, we can now take the benefits net and actually grow it and have the net grow. Peter, do you want to add anything to that? Do you have a follow up Erik, do you have a follow up? Well, let me have Kevin just talk about the sales, because we are seeing a pickup of it. So it may be premature to talk about our capital, but I'll get back to that. Kevin, you want to start with the sales piece? Yeah. Thanks, Yaron. I think that's a Mark question. Mark, loss fix? Yaron, do you have a follow up? Yeah. Peter, can you talk about exposures? Thank you. We've run a little late. Maybe we could take one last question, operator? Jimmy the first book of business that you referred to was what? I didn't pick that up\u2026 Yeah, got it. Yeah\u2026 Thanks, Jimmy. Yeah, Peter, I think those are both yours. Okay. Thank you, Jimmy. Thank you. Well, let me just close and thank everybody for joining us this morning. And I particularly want to thank my AIG colleagues around the world. I mean, these last few months have really been challenging on many, many fronts and I'm so grateful for your hard work and dedication on this journey we're on and I hope everyone stays safe and healthy.

I'll now turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Duperreault: Good morning, everyone. It's been an extraordinary few months since we last spoke. Before we start, I want to say that I hope you and your families are healthy, and that you've been able to adjust to the new normal that COVID-19 is creating for all of us. This crisis has been heartbreaking to witness as it unfolds across the globe. It's a tough time for everyone and the uncertainty about how long it will last and what life will be like afterwards makes this time even harder. I've witnessed a lot in my 40-plus year career in the insurance industry. But this health and humanitarian crisis, which quickly became a threat to the world economy, is like nothing any of us has experienced. We believe COVID-19 will be the single largest CAT loss the industry has ever seen and will continue to have significant global economic ramifications for the foreseeable future.\nPeter Zaffino: Thank you, Brian. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, I plan to review the following topics: a brief overview of the potential near and longer term impact of COVID-19 on the insurance and reinsurance markets generally, how we analyze the impact of COVID-19 on GI through March 31st, first quarter results for General Insurance, excluding COVID-19, including Validus Re, our recently announced launch of Syndicate 2019 and AIG 200 and the progress that we've made since our last earnings call. As Brian said, the near and long-term impact of COVID-19 on the global economy and insurance and reinsurance industries remains unclear. In contrast to other catastrophes like wildfires, hurricanes and earthquakes, this event is not confined to any specific geographic region, and it has already impacted over 200 countries and territories. In addition, this duration is not limited as is typically the case with traditional CATs. While the insurance industry manages risk of all kinds, it's fair to say that the profound impact and global nature of COVID-19 is something we have never encountered. There's no playbook. And as a result, we are called upon to make thoughtful and prudent decisions in a climate of unprecedented uncertainty. Before COVID, the largest catastrophes on record were Hurricane Katrina with $65 billion losses, then the Tohoku earthquake with $35 billion in loss, Hurricane Irma with $30 billion losses, and Superstorm Sandy also with approximately $30 billion in losses. With respect to COVID-19, we're starting to see early industry estimates, but they have significant ranges. While it's too early to gauge the ultimate size of the loss, we believe COVID-19 will result in the largest individual CAT loss, the insurance industry has ever seen. Going forward, COVID-related losses will impact all aspects of underwriting insurance from absolute limits available, limits deployed to certain lines of business, terms and conditions, co-insurance and structure of coverage just to name a few. With respect to the reinsurance main, unlike traditional name parallel catastrophes, COVID was not modeled. And, therefore, it will be a headwind for future capacity. We believe the retro market will contract. And in the ILS market, there will be trapped capital, which will lock up collateral, therefore, restricting capacity on a go-forward basis, and we're already seeing this.\nKevin Hogan: Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss overall Life and Retirement results for the first quarter and our current outlook, changes in our operating environment due to COVID-19 and then briefly comments on the results for each of our businesses. Life and Retirement recorded adjusted pre-tax income of $574 million for the quarter and delivered adjusted return on attributed common equity at 8.4%. Adjusted pre-tax income decreased by $350 million year-over-year, primarily due to significant market stress in March compared with the strong market recovery we saw in the first quarter of 2019. The main driver of the decrease was lower equity market returns, which primarily resulted in higher variable annuity reserves of $161 million and higher deferred acquisition cost amortization back of $138 million. Also, widening credit spreads generated lower returns from fair value option bonds of $116 million and the low interest rate environment resulted in continued spread compression across our individual and group retirement product lines. Lastly, I am pleased to report that our hedge program performed as expected in response to the market stress experienced in March, generating gains exceeding the movements in our economic view of the liability and related cash collateral. Recognizing the limits of sensitivity, especially in the context of first quarter's market volatility, our sensitivities provided on our last earnings call generally held up. Based on the environment we see today, we continue to expect base spread compression across the whole portfolio of approximately eight to 16 basis points annually. However, wider risk-adjusted credit spreads should generate opportunities to attract new business as profitable margins and the reinvestment of assets slowing off the portfolio should benefit from higher credit spreads. We have updated our estimates of market sensitivities to reflect our balance sheet as of the end of the first quarter. We would expect a plus or minus 1% change in equity market returns to respectively increase or decrease adjusted pretax income by approximately $25 million to $35 million annually and a plus or minus 10 basis point movement in 10-year treasury rates to respectively increase or decrease earnings by approximately $5 million to $15 million annually. These sensitivities assume the immediate impact of market movements on reserves, fact and fair value option securities as well as investment income and other items. It is important to note that these market sensitivity ranges are not exact nor linear since our earnings are also impacted by the timing and degree of movements as well as other factors. Market conditions began to improve in April, but one can expect that should conditions continue to improve, there may be immediate benefits in reserves back for investments in the second quarter although these benefits are likely to be offset slightly by lower private equity returns that are reported on a one quarter lag. Despite the challenging environment COVID-19 created, our balance sheet is strong and we currently estimate our fleet risk-based capital ratio for the first quarter to be between 405% and 415%, including both the impacts of variable annuity reserve and capital reform as well as our hedging program. Our risk-based capital ratio will be sensitive to the impacts from COVID-19 as they flow through our balance sheet throughout the year. Market stress in the first quarter due to COVID-19, while severe in nature did not reach our modeled stress testing scenarios. Although we expect lower levels of overall industry sales for the foreseeable future due to impacts from COVID-19, our leadership position continues to provide us with a unique competitive advantage. We have a broad position across variable index and fixed annuities, term and permanent life insurance, not-for-profit retirement plan markets and institutional markets. We are not dependent on any one product type or distribution channel, which allows us to maintain our long standing disciplined approach with respect to product pricing and future development regardless of the economic environment. Over many years, we have proven our ability to redirect our marketing efforts from one product type to another as market needs and pricing conditions change. We also have a large and diverse in-force portfolio that does not have the significant risks associated with pre-2010 living benefits for long-term care. Our very small block of remaining long-term care business has been reinsured to quarter two. Our strong capital levels and broad market presence position us well to deploy capital as potential attractive opportunities arise in this widening spread environment. Now, I'd like to touch on our operations over the last few months. As Peter noted, we transitioned quickly to a remote working model, with the support of our regulators we're meeting, we successfully adapted our e-signature policies, procedures and controls to support the needs of our plant sponsors, distribution partner firms and individual customers. Also, investments we have made to enhance our digital capabilities have served us well as many more customers are taking advantage of our enhanced self service tools. We've also been very responsive in adopting changes to address the financial hardship faced by some of our customers, such as extending the grace period for premium payments and meeting the requirement of the Cares Act. Our sales and relationship management professionals quickly shifted from face-to-face to virtual meetings and have conducted thousands of such meetings and educational webinars with our producers and customers. Turning to our first quarter financial results. As mentioned, the primary drivers of the decline in Life and Retirement portal adjusted pre-tax income with short-term impacts to our individual and group retirement businesses from significant market movements. As to the top line results are individual retirement, premiums and deposits decreased primarily due to significantly lower fixed annuities fail, as we maintained our pricing discipline as Treasury rates dropped throughout the quarter with credit spreads only beginning to widen late in the period. Our index annuity sales remain strong, but we again grew variable annuity sales. Lower sales of fixed annuities resulted in negative net flows for total individual annuities. For group retirement, premiums and deposits decreased due to lower new group acquisitions, as well as reduced individual product sales driven by the uncertain environment. Net flows improved year-over-year, primarily due to lower group surrenders. In this period of uncertainty, we expect fewer plan sponsors to change providers, which may reduce new group acquisitions, but would support plan retention. For our Life Insurance business, total premiums and deposits increased due to higher international premiums. Our mortality trends continued to be favorable to overall pricing assumptions and the first quarter included a modest IBNR reserve strengthening to reflect the fluidity of COVID-19. Although we may experience some acceleration, we are not expecting large incremental impacts to mortality rates and expect any incremental impacts to be manageable in the context of our overall balance sheet. For institutional markets, we have continued to grow our asset base and earnings, and this business continues to be well-positioned. We remain focused on new opportunities and have the capacity to participate as activity arises in the pension risk transfer and other institutional businesses. To close, despite these challenging times, we remain available to serve our customers, plan sponsors and distribution partners. We are committed to further mobilizing our broad product expertise and distribution footprint to serve our stakeholders in new ways as their needs evolve. We will continue to deploy capital to the most attractive opportunities and focus on meeting ever-growing needs for protection, retirement savings and lifetime income solutions. Now, I will turn it over to Mark.\nMark Lyons: Thank you, Kevin. Before providing summary comments about the first quarter, I'd like to give COVID-19 perspective from where I sit. First, this health crisis, which quickly evolves into an associated financial crisis, is unprecedented in scope, uncertainty and length and depth of economic impact. Additionally, this ongoing event has simultaneously impacted both sides of the balance sheet, thereby nullifying most underlying disruptions that investment assets and insurance liabilities are marginally correlated. As a result, it's extremely difficult to forecast one quarter in advance let alone a full year longer. However, as Brian also noted, I want to reiterate that AIG was strongly financially positioned entering the crisis, both from a parent and subsidiary liquidity and capital perspective and is well positioned today, including our investment portfolio. The evolving situation causes us to view liquidity and capital strength as an imperative. When the crisis suddenly took hold on capital markets in mid-March and not knowing what could come next, we thought it was prudent to augment our already strong current liquidity with a $1.3 billion partial drawdown of our revolving credit facility. We did this solely as a precautionary measure given the significant uncertainty at the time, about the near-term impacts of COVID-19. I will provide an update on our capital management plans and liquidity position later in these remarks after I review our first quarter results. So turning to the first quarter. AIG reported adjusted after-tax operating earnings of $0.11 per diluted share compared to $1.58 per share in the first quarter of 2019. Contained within this result is the continued improvement of General Insurance with a 95.5% accident year 2020 ex-CAT combined ratio as Peter noted. First quarter results reflect direct and indirect impacts related to COVID-19, including the market impact on net investment income and book value, with a lesser impact on core operations APTI. Peter discussed, the General Insurance COVID reserve reflects our best estimate, the losses occurring through March 31. The first quarter, adjusted book value per share increased 2.8% and adjusted tangible book value per share increased 3.2%, both since year-end. It's also notable that AIG's adjusted tangible book value per share increased nearly 11% since March 31, one year ago, which we believe is a better measurement of the improvement in AIG's core operating performance over the last year. Book value and tangible book value per share, both of which include changes in AOCI and the DTA, were virtually flat year-over-year, even with the significant AOCI change we saw in the first quarter of this year. In the first quarter, on an adjusted pre-tax income basis, net investment income, or NII, was $2.7 billion, down approximately $1 billion from the down approximately first quarter of 2019. Recall that the first quarter of 2019 included significant gains following the downturn that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2018 as this year's first quarter experienced significant losses due to the COVID-19 volatility in March, resulting in a distorted quarter-over-quarter comparison. I want to spend some time on our global investment portfolio. Because in the current environment, I think it's important to understand its composition. Several reports have been published that use incorrect assumptions and information about our portfolio. In many cases, our consolidated global portfolio has been compared to U.S. Life or P&C peers or the industry generally, without taking into account our unique position as a global composite or multi-line insurer. In addition, some believe our portfolio has above-average inherent risk, which is simply not the case. Instead, we believe our portfolio is below average in terms of risk and we'll get into some of that. In addition, certain accounting elections AIG took in prior years relating to specific securities have created above the line accounting volatility, which has led to some confusion, but this volatility does not impact AIG on a total return basis. To address these complexities and the many questions and comments we have received, we've provided much more disclosure regarding our portfolio, including the General Insurance, Life and Retirement and Legacy portfolio composition. On pages 46 through 65 in our financial supplement, there you will find a significant expansion of our disclosure beyond segment and into credit quality distribution and asset or industry characteristics. As Brian mentioned, Doug Dachille, our Chief Investment Officer, can help address follow-up questions during Q&A, but I'll give some high-level comments now. At March 31st, AIG had a $332 billion investable asset portfolio. This portfolio is about 73% fixed income available for sale securities, which represents 75% of General Insurance's portfolio and 74% of Life and Retirement. In addition, roughly 14% of the portfolio is invested in mortgage and other loans, 6% in short-term investments, 2.5% in real estate investment, less than 2% in private equity, approximately 1.5% is in fair value option fixed income security or FVO securities and about 0.7% is in hedge funds. It's important to recognize though that roughly 80% of the FVO fixed income portfolio, which historically has had higher volatility than are available to sales fixed maturity securities is held in legacy. Notably, the FVO portfolio makes up only 1.4% of General Insurance's portfolio and 0.3% of Life and Retirement. Our historical FVO accounting election mostly on legacy non-agency RMBS that were previously credit impaired cannot be changed or be changed or modified and move mark-to-market volatility above the line into our income statement within net investment income. For available for sale securities, such volatility would be below the line in AOCI. As a result, this FVO accounting treatment puts more volatility into our income statement by NII with less relative volatility in AOCI, which is where one would ordinarily expect to see the volatility. Financial statement geography is important to note when examining AIG's NII, but it is irrelevant when you look at total return, which is how our investment function manages our portfolio. Over the last four-plus years, and Doug can address this in more detail, AIG has seen significant de-risking of its investment portfolio with material reductions in hedge funds, life settlement, CDOs, and FVO securities, totaling approximately $32 billion, which is a 60% drop in these asset classes since year end 2015. Additionally, AIG's portfolio has only a very small direct equity exposure, representing just 0.2% of the portfolio. The volatility in the equity markets has a minimal impact on our investment income and even that is below the line. On page 63 of the financial supplement, you will also see a significant $9 billion plus credit quality difference and below investment-grade securities between the rating agency view and the NAIC designation view. Most of this is non-agency RMBS on an FVO basis, which we have had evaluated and rated NAIC 1 by the securities valuation office of the NAIC. This is the highest rating category, which is important because these assets strengthen subsidiary RBC levels and can sustain RBC levels even if they fall one notch, because they still will be investment grade. However, rating agencies have not re-rated these securities with current information, so from their perspective, the securities still retains legacy below investment-grade status. When examining our $144 billion of corporate debt, which is summarized on page 56 of the financial supplement and expanded beginning on page 59, note that nearly $130 million is investment grade. And of this total, 15% is rated AA or AAA, 34% is A-rated and 51% is BBB-rated. Compared to the overall investment-grade market, we have a superior distribution of such asset by rating. Similarly, when viewing the entire corporate debt portfolio, 10% is below investment grade, which is much lower than the market average of 48%. I wanted to point this out because given the magnitude of AIG's investment portfolio; some may assume that our portfolio mirrors the industry average, which is not the case. With respect to CECL credit impacts in the first quarter, which are included in realized gains and losses and not NII, we recognized approximately $236 million of credit losses. This stems from about $198 million in fixed income securities and $38 million in loans. Now turning to the operating segment. As Peter and Kevin discuss their financial results in detail, I will just add a few remarks that augment their comments. General Insurance, I'd point out that the $419 million of total CAT reserves for the quarter represents 6.9 loss ratio points with $272 million or 4.5 loss ratio points being attributed to COVID-19 and $147 million or 2.4 loss ratio related to other CAT events, the largest of which was the tornado storm system that hit Nashville in early March. Excluding COVID-19, General Insurance generated $185 million of underwriting income, which includes the non-COVID catalog. Prior year development was minimal in the first quarter with $60 million of net favorable development, $53 million of which emanated from the amortization of the ADC deferred gain. On a pre-ADC basis, there was a net $1 million of favorable development, representing $30 million of unfavorable in North America, mostly from shorter deadlines, largely offset by favorable $31 million from international across many product lines. Lastly, as Peter discussed, Syndicate 2019 will favorably alter AIG's risk profile as concentration risk is distributed across an innovative structure and set of capital providers. We anticipate that in the second quarter and for the balance of the 2020 year, TDS premiums will increase over original expectations, and therefore, net premiums will correspondingly reduce. We project that second quarter net written premium in high net worth will be down approximately $650 million from original expectations and that net earned premiums for the 2020 year were reduced by approximately $675 million as a result. Beginning in 2021, however, the catastrophe cover costs will decrease for AIG since the high net worth exposure subject to the CAT program will be a fraction of what it is today. So for 2020, underwriting income for the high net worth unit, we anticipate approximately the same underwriting result pre and post 2019 and then to become accretive thereafter. Turning to Life and Retirement, I would just add that institutional markets benefited from approximately $700 million pension risk transfer premium in the quarter, albeit down a bit from -- corresponding quarter of last year. Legacy, a $368 million adjusted pretax loss in the first quarter was due to a reduction in NII driven by capital markets volatility we saw in March, which abated, as mentioned, in April. As a reminder, we signed a definitive agreement to sell Fortitude last year with the economic set as of December 31, 2018, which means that all net income subsequent to year-end 2018, up through closing will be included in the gain or sale or loss on sale to be recognized upon the closing of the transaction. We continue on course towards a midyear closing subject to regulatory approval and it is noteworthy that Fortitude also has benefited from strategic hedging transactions that performed as expected, and in fact, health capital ratios remain virtually unchanged since early 2019. Next, moving to other operations, and as I discussed on last quarter's earnings call, you will see on pages 37 to 39 of the financial supplement, a revised and simplified presentation that helps identify key drivers of APTI. Our previous disclosures on this segment could be difficult to understand and volatile, in part due to the gross-up of income and expense for internal items, mostly investment services, which increased other income and GOE. We simplified that and also provided APTI by activity, which should help. As for magnitude, this quarter's $280 million of other operations GOE included the COVID-19 employee grants totaling $30 million that Brian referenced, and remote access IT costs of $3 million. Excluding that, other operations GOE would have only been $247 million. Turning to tax, we had a core 23% tax rate on adjusted pretax income for the first quarter, higher than recent prior quarters due to additional items dominated by a $37 million impact, reflecting share-based compensation differences, plus by grant date versus delivery date of value resulting from spot price declines during the first quarter. Turning to liquidity and capital resources, we believe that liquidity and operating subsidiary capital strength are paramount priority in this uncertain economic environment. At year-end 2019, AIG had $7.5 billion of liquidity at the parent and the RBC fleet ratios for General Insurance's US pool finished 2019 at 419% and for Life and Retirement at 402%. During the first quarter, we repurchased $500 million of our stock and closed $350 million of most advanced. Share repurchases helped to offset share count dilution stemming from equity compensation and the promotion bond call aided our debt leverage ratio. As of March 31, AIG had a similar $7.5 billion of current liquidity, including the $1.3 billion draw from our revolver that I referenced earlier in my remarks as well as strong liquidity in both General Insurance and Life and Retirement. Before turning to AIG 200, there were two below the line items in the first quarter that I would like to highlight: First, the success of our hedging program; and the second would be Blackboard. Turning first to our hedging program, roughly $3.6 billion of variable annuity fair value benefits were reflected during the first quarter within the realized games line as a direct result of successful interest rate and equity risk hedging within the Life and Retirement and legacy segment that clearly preserve book value. It should be noted though that on a GAAP basis, this gain was aided by the NPA, or non-performance adjustment, impact, which is highly volatile and reversible depending upon rates for ebbs and equity markets. Secondly, at the end of March, AIG made a strategic decision to discontinue Blackboard, our internal insured tech startup in light of current market condition. Blackboard's GOE which was $16 million in the quarter, has been historically recorded in other operations, but that we'll cease starting with the second quarter of this year. Associated with this business decision, we recorded an approximate $165 million after-tax charge, not included in APTI. Pivoting to AIG 200, as Peter noted, we continue to refine our operational plans in response to COVID-19. We still expect that this strategic three-year transformation will result in $1.3 billion in costs to achieve an annualized $1 billion of run rate GOE savings by year-end 2022. Let me first just provide a quick review and then I'll give you the AIG 200 three-year walk as well as its impact on the first quarter of 2020. From a reporting perspective, all costs to achieve, aside from $400 million of pre-tax spending that will be capitalized will be recorded below the line, not in APTI, as restructuring and other costs, which will make it straightforward to track. These below the line charges mostly involve employee-related costs, dedicated internal resources and associated professional services. Capitalized costs of $400 million before tax, represent mostly investments in systems, development, interfaces, data conversions and associated integrated workflow processes, which have an impact on cash, but are not expensed immediately in the income statement. Instead, each investment will be capitalized and then amortized through GOE based on its useful life according to accounting principles. Hence, by year-end 2022, we would expect that the amortization portion of the $400 million will be included in our annual expense run rate, where our goal is a total annual run rate savings of $1 billion, including the amortization of these capitalized investments. So let's turn towards what this means for the next three years, acknowledging that in this uncertain world, timing of plans can somewhat change. Under Peter's leadership, we are governing AIG 200 via structured checkpoints and tollgate that control cost, confirm scope and reconfirm scope and drive key milestone achievements. Overall, we expect a total 'cash cost' at the holding company of $1.3 billion. As shown on page eight of the financial results slide, $350 million of this is expected in 2020, although still being reviewed due to COVID-19 impact; $500 million in 2021 and $450 million in 2022. Of these amounts, approximately $100 million in 2020 will be capitalized with later amortization into GOE. The combination of these two result in a below the line projected charge of $250 million before tax. Then in 2021, about $200 million will be capitalized, with a below the line charge of roughly $300 million. And finally, about $100 million will be capitalized to 2022, with a below the line charge of $350 million. Based on our current useful life schedule for depreciation and assumptions about when we expect the $400 million in capitalized assets to be placed into service, calendar year depreciation included in GOE should be zero in 2020, as the project will still be in development; rising in 2021 to be between $10 million to $15 million before tax; and $25 million to $30 million in 2022. Based on projected completion by year-end 2022, the unamortized balance of about $350 million will be amortized at about a seven-year average life, with $50 million per year in 2023 through 2027 and then trailing off a bit from there. Finally, in the first quarter of 2020, we had a $90 million restructuring charge below the line, of which about $23 million related to AIG 200 and the balance from other actions. Going forward, restructuring charges will primarily reflect AIG 200 costs. Relative to expense savings, this quarter had $10 million of GOE savings, which will translate to $60 million on an annualized run rate basis, which is part of the $300 million plan run rate benefit by year-end 2020. Now shifting to capital management and looking ahead, in light of the significant uncertainty on many fronts due to COVID-19, we do not plan to do additional share repurchases or debt reduction actions for the foreseeable future, but we will reassess this as COVID-19 impact stabilize. However, given improved stability in and access to the capital markets since March, we are reevaluating our debt and capital plan. While reducing debt leverage to 25% or below is a minimum term goal, in the near term, our priority is maintaining strong operating capitalization, financial flexibility and liquidity. As a result, we are considering options to generate additional near-term liquidity in light of ongoing economic volatility as well as upcoming debt maturities in 2020 and in the medium term. Although spreads have widened since year-end, all-in coupons are attractive. Given the significant uncertainty around the duration and depth of global recession created by COVID-19, as well as taking into account our global operating footprint and different regulatory capital regimes, we think it is prudent to evaluate debt capital market opportunities in the near term rather than waiting until later in the year, which was our original plan prior to COVID-19. Lastly, and reflecting back, the first quarter benefited in the first two months from strong momentum in GI pricing, investment return and operating initiatives. In March, COVID-19 spread incredibly fast and dramatically changed everyone's everyday world. AIG entered this crisis from a position of strength while it has certainly impacted us and caused us to recalibrate some of our plans. AIG is more resilient than it has ever been with strong leadership and greater portfolio and risk management across the organization. We are confident in our ability to weather this storm and look forward to being able to engage with you again in person, hopefully, in the near term. With that, I will turn it back to Brian.\nBrian Duperreault: Thanks, Mark. Abby, I think we're ready for the Q&A portion. So please get us started and let us move first.\nOperator: Thank you.  And we will take our first question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks. Good morning. My first question, in your prepared remarks, you guys mentioned that a small fraction of your commercial property policies contain coverage for infectious diseases and that those policies do have small sub-units. I'm just trying to get a sense of those policies where you think you could see losses have you set up reserves within your COVID losses in the first quarter?\nBrian Duperreault: Okay. Elyse, I think that's a question for Peter. Peter, would you take that, please?\nPeter Zaffino: Yeah. Sure, Brian. Hi, Elyse, let me just give you a little bit more detail. Yes, we did go through it very thoroughly in the first quarter, as I outlined our process that we did bottom-up and top-down but when you look at the size and scope of our global portfolio, the nature of our clients in terms of the segmentation, we do have commercial property policy that have some manuscript warnings. As I said in my opening remarks, the overwhelming majority of the standard commercial property policies do contain clear exclusions for viruses, and it's fairly standard in the industry. These policies also require that there's direct physical loss or damage that impact the insurance business operations. As to these policies, COVID is not covered. So that's point one. There are limited instances where we do write affirmative coverage for communicable diseases. But even in those cases, it's only on a supplemented basis, and in pursuant, we have very strict underwriting guidelines that often result in coverage for only specified diseases. And in an event that there's a requirement that there would also be a government closure caused by physical presence of the disease itself. So again, it's fairly clear. And just to give you some context in terms of what I'm talking about is that 100% of our sub-limits aggregate to well less than 1% of our total limits in our commercial property policy. So it's a very small portion of the overall property exposure. And I would just note that I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have really comprehensive reinsurance, whether it's on a property per risk basis, we have low attachment points on a per occurrence basis that's regional, and we also have global aggregates that attach to reduced volatility on a frequency severity basis. So sorry for the long answer, but I think it's important to get into the detail.\nBrian Duperreault: Thank you, Peter. Next question \nOperator: We will take our next question from Tom Gallagher with Evercore.\nTom Gallagher: Good morning. Mark, you mentioned your plan on running with higher debt for the time being, which I think that makes sense given the current environment. Have you gotten any sense from the rating agencies on their reaction to the higher leverage for now? And then just a follow-up question on the investment portfolio. Appreciate all the disclosure there. The $18 billion of other invested assets, it looks like $6.7 billion of that is in legacy. Would you expect most of that to be transferred with the Fortitude resale? And then sorry for the string here. But then just one related question, the $8.5 billion of real estate alternative investments, should we expect there to be any kind of impairment on that in 2Q, or is there some buffer with historical cost accounting there?\nBrian Duperreault: Okay, Tom. Listen, why don't we have Mark, you wanted to talk about the debt. And then I'm going to ask Doug to take over on the investment portfolio question. So Mark, why don't you go first?\nMark Lyons: Thank you, Brian, and I will do that as well. With regards to debt, yes, we've spoken to the rating agencies. In fact, we were in conversation with them on the revolver drawdown, as a matter of fact, and had very good strong and supportive conversations with them. And in the future, we may contemplate, of course, we be involve in discussions with them as well. With that, I will turn it over to Doug to talk about this to investment questions.\nDoug Dachille: Thank you, Mark and good morning. Well, I would refer you to page 49 of the financial supplement, which basically goes through the legacy segment and the assets that are held in that segment in pretty robust detail. And as you know, in addition, there's approximately $40 billion of assets, which we also disclosed in our financials, which are going to be part of the sale related to Fortitude. The portions that we\u2019ll be retaining, there will be some real estate investments that we'll be retaining that are part of legacy. There will also be some fair value option bonds that will be retained in legacy that were part of the old financial products direct investment book. So those will not be part of the sale transaction. But the material amount of the assets will be, as you know \u2013 over $40 billion will be separating as part of the sale of Fortitude. With respect of the real estate, you -- as you know, we only experienced a rapid acceleration in the month of March with respect to the development and emergence of the COVID situation. So we're still in the midst of analyzing the impact. And I think it's very early to determine what the impact will be on our real estate portfolio. But it should be noted that our real estate portfolio is diverse. It includes both domestic and international exposures. So the impact we'll learn more as things go on. I think where we're learning the most about our real estate is obviously on the commercial mortgage loan side. So that's where we're getting some real insight into what's going on in the real estate market. And those teams, the commercial mortgage loan team work very, very closely with the real estate equity team at AIG. And all of those investments are managed directly. So we have great level sight \u2013 of line of sight to what's going on in that market, but it's still really early to determine what's going to happen.\nBrian Duperreault: Okay, thanks Doug. So, why don\u2019t we get the next question then.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs.\nYaron Kinar: Hi, good morning everybody and thanks for the very helpful opening comments. I just want to start with one question on the removal of the 2021 exit rate return guidance. Just want to make sure I understand what it does and what it does not mean? Does it mean from your perspective that you could see the COVID impact linger or continue well into 2021?\nDoug Dachille: Well, let me take that. Who knows? I mean, you don't know whether COVID will reemerge, if it does go down an impact in 2020. It's really a question of how much predictability is there to quarterly earnings. And it's difficult to predict quarters. So if you can't predict the quarter, I don't want to try to predict a year or several years.  I think it's important to note, though, that the underlying power of the company remains. We're very, very strong in the GI. GI has continued to show improvement. Good work that has been done over the last 3 years, what Peter and his team have continued on. So the returns that we were talking about, I believe, if you \u2013 certainly, if you pick the COVID out for a second, are going to continue to improve. And so that trajectory we're on is, we're still on. Now you have a COVID event, and I think the COVID event certainly would impact L&R on a short-term basis. But again, we think the long-term power of the company is there. So COVID itself, it will be large. I told you that I believe it will be the largest event in the insurance industry, but it is -- it's an inflection point. And that effect that we'll see -- we've already been in a market on the GI side, General Insurance, P&C side that was turning. It was improving. And the rates in terms and conditions were improving for the risk taker. This COVID is going to prove to be an inflection point. So, companies with strong balance sheet, we have one; companies with strong management, we have one; companies that has been well risk managed, and we've done that now, they're going to be on the right side of that. And so we believe we can handle anything that comes with COVID and we feel very strong. But predicting quarter-to-quarter is just impossible. So, I hope that helps.\nYaron Kinar: Yes, it does.\nBrian Duperreault: Next question.\nYaron Kinar: So, my follow-up question on that is when you talk about COVID being the largest catastrophe event in the industry's history. Can you maybe talk about what P&C lines in particular you would foresee having very large losses here? And maybe also the proportion of losses that you'd expect coming from L&R, maybe not directly COVID-related, but from capital markets activity?\nBrian Duperreault: Well, I'm going to have Peter talk about what we see in the P&C side, and then I'll let Kevin talk about L&R. So, Peter, do you want to talk about that first?\nPeter Zaffino: Sure. Thank you, Brian. We mentioned quite a few lines when we were referring to the first quarter, whether it's travel, M&A, A&H, some other lines to think about that could have activity, workers' compensation. We don't know about D&O liability. We have been watching it very carefully and making certain that we're looking at any line that we think could have an impact. But what I can tell you to add to Brian's comments before, is that we have a very thorough process and we'll be consistent all the way through. We know the CAT is still ongoing, which is a very rare. So, as things emerge and develop, we will adapt to that. And we're looking at this across every global geography where we think there's impact and multiple lines of business. But because the CAT is still going, we even have two months left in the quarter. It's hard to see what transpire in the future. But as I said, we have a great process, and we will keep everybody have a great process, and we will keep everybody updated on lines of business as they emerge.\nBrian Duperreault: Kevin, on L&R?\nKevin Hogan: Yes. Thanks. So, I'll address it really in 3 pieces, mortalities of the markets and then maybe just a reminder around pricing. So, our reported mortality in the first quarter was below pricing, which continues the trend that we've had for the last two-plus years. But later in the period, what we did notice is that there were some delays in reporting, generally related the issuance of certain documentations. So, we put up the modest IBNR really for just running reporting. As we look ahead, we do expect that there will be additional mortality in the second and the third quarter, depending upon how circumstances and behaviors evolve. So, where does that leave us? We expect some expect some adverse mortality overall for 2020, but we don't expect to see significant impacts to the balance sheet based on what we know, and there could be some offsetting factors. In terms of the market effects, look, there's two things. I mean, when equity markets move, particularly when they go down, that ultimately reduces our future expected fee income, particularly in the annuities portfolio, which we have to reflect immediately and back. The reality is, is that the reduced reserve overall actually emerges as additional profits in the future. It also serves to increase our SOP all 3 1 reserves, and when changes in credit spreads, we see the immediate impact on fair value options. So those two short-term market effects are reversible. And that leads to the third thing, which is pricing and how do we feel about current pricing. And certainly, treasury rates are at all-time lows, but our ability to price product is to pace -- is based not only on where base rates are. But also where credit spreads, what is the shape of the yield curve and where investor expectations and appetites are. And so based on the power environment, we're still able to price the long-term expectations that we have. Certainly, there's disruptions in the sales environment, but it's difficult to anticipate what the future on that is going to be and how it resolves. So those are the three perspectives I have on the long-term earnings potential of the Life and Retirement environment.\nBrian Duperreault: And one thing I'd just like to add there, Yaron, Peter's comments about certain lines of business, he mentioned workers' comp. I think it's important to remember that AIG has de-risked that workers' compensation business significantly, probably over the last 7, 8 years. And where AIG finds itself now is mostly in loss sensitive related programs, which have average deductibles north of $1 million. So when you think about debt in the work comp area, that's statutorily determined by state, that's going to be underneath a deductible, standard medical and temporary, all that falls away. It has to be a major permanent parcel to really penetrate it. So I think the book is well positioned given what we're talking about here.\nKevin Hogan: Yes. And just one other piece on the comp, and Peter mentioned this earlier, but, yes, there are COVID claims coming in, but I think you have to recognize that there's been a decline in a number of claims coming in otherwise. So it remains to be seen what the net effect of COVID has on the worker concept. So that's something to keep an eye on. With that, Abby, let\u2019s go to the next question.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Phillips: Thank you. Good morning. I want to touch on comments on expected, continued underwriting core profitability in General Insurance and maybe how you think about the near-term impact of exposure drops given your economy and how that might affect the profitability improvement plan for the remainder of this year?\nKevin Hogan: Okay. Michael, well, that's Peter. So Peter, why don't you do that?\nPeter Zaffino: Okay. Thank you for the question. We certainly are paying very close attention to lines of business that would be affected by the economic headwinds that are generated from COVID-19. I mentioned some of them in the prior question in areas where we're watching for loss, but I would think that there's going to be a meaningful falloff of travel in the second quarter. M&A could be some fall off in aerospace, marine and energy, and we mentioned workers' compensation. Having said all that is that you got to remember the segmentation and demographic of our portfolio, I mean, over 75% of our businesses on some form of either deductible SIR or funded captive. And so we don't have a direct correlation, even though it is rated off of a payroll, sales, auto is done on an excess basis. And therefore, we do not think we will have as much headwind in terms of premium reduction. There will be some, but it will be more modest because it's not a direct ratable exposure that generates the premium. We have different factors in terms of how we adjust excess premium. So we just don't think it's going to be as pronounced. Brian mentioned on workers' compensation, the decrease in frequency. It's not a trend yet, but it's an observation that, while COVID losses are increasing, we're seeing a commensurate drop in where our clients are retaining losses that those are dropping. So as we look at repositioning our portfolio, where we attach on an excess basis and the commensurate premium as I said, there's going to be some lines of business that will affect. We there's opportunities for other areas of growth. As we have repositioned the portfolio, we like where we are, and think that the leadership position that AIG can demonstrate in the marketplace will give us also some select opportunities for growth.\nPeter Zaffino: Thanks. Michael, anything else?\nMichael Phillips: No. That\u2019s it. Thank you, Peter. Appreciate it.\nPeter Zaffino: Okay. Thanks, Michael, Abby, next question.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler.\nPaul Newsome: Good morning. Thanks for the call everyone. I'm a little concerned that the loss with the \u2013 the big CAT loss that you have from Totalbank seems more of a liability loss than a property loss. Could you talk about how the reinsurance could protect you in liability-type catastrophe versus property. I think we all feel is excess loss properties, but I can't recall liability to cash is simple size. So I don't know with regard to in terms of coverage ?\nBrian Duperreault: Okay. So Paul, you want us to talk about in a COVID versus our reinsurance program?\nPaul Newsome: Yes. If COVID was a liability loss instead of a property loss?\nBrian Duperreault: Yes. Okay. Well, Peter, I guess, that's you again.\nPeter Zaffino: Thanks, Brian and Paul. So I outlined our property program and said that we had reduced volatility significantly. On the liability side, I think we've done actually even more. We used to retain significant limits within AIG and so we've been building a program over time that significantly reduce the net limits that we put out as well as the gross limits. And also we did that on an excess of loss basis and also on a quota share. So on a general liability policy, as an example, we would have less than probably, depending on the limit, we have a 50% plus quota share on our first limit retention that we have 100% reinsurance above $25 million. So we have \u2013 if you issue a policy, a significant sized policy, the multi have net is between $10 million and $12 million. So we actually have significant protection on the quota share as well as the excess of loss.\nBrian Duperreault: So Paul, let me just jump in. Look, our reinsurance is good and solid, and Peter has done a tremendous job along with his team to put that together. Our first-line of defense is the way we manage our portfolio to start with. And so you can't rely on reinsurance to make a portfolio better than it is.  o we've done a tremendous amount of work, risk selection, limits management, attachment points and pricing along all the lines of business property and casualty and that's where we feel very confident about our situation vis-\u00e0-vis the impact that COVID will \u2013 as those impacts unfold. So I just want to add that. So Paul, did you have another \u2013 anything else?\nPaul Newsome: No. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks for the answer and thank you very much.\nBrian Duperreault: Okay. You\u2019re welcome, Paul. Thank you. Next question, Abby?\nOperator: Our next question is from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.\nRyan Tunis: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to confirm some of that, I guess, Peter said earlier in the Q&A. Yes. There's affirmative BI coverage for 1% of total property limit. But sounds like that could be somewhat of a big notional number that you might get, roughly?\nBrian Duperreault: Well, I said one. Peter, go ahead.\nKevin Hogan: Peter, go ahead.\nPeter Zaffino: Sorry, Ryan. What I said was, not that that was a permanent coverage and those sublimits would trigger coverage. What I said is that the limits that we provided on the affirmative, which have, again, a bunch of triggers that I outlined in my previous answer that we have well less than 1% of our total limits when you compare that to our property gross limits. So, again, it's well less than 1%. And I'm not suggesting that we confirm that there is coverage or that we are adjudicating claims on that amount. It's just that, that's what we have for limits, and then it goes case-by-case, insured-by-insured in terms of what the losses.\nBrian Duperreault: Yes. Ryan, let me just add something here. And that is, Peter talked about that process of evaluating the losses occurring in the first quarter. I've been in this business a long time, 40-plus years. And I've seen a lot of things come and go. I've seen difficulties in trying to assess loss. I have to tell you the process that they \u2013 that we went through, that they went through, we went through, it's as good as anything I've ever seen. They have gone through every bit of the portfolio. They looked at everything where there was a potential and evaluated whether there would be reason to post the reserve, if it was, it was done. So we have posted the reserve that we believe are appropriate, albeit conservative for that, everything that happened in the first quarter. I just want to make sure that everybody understands that, everything that happened there.\nRyan Tunis: Yes, yes. So could you just talk a little bit about how you're seeing business interruption, losses might respond within the Validus book? And also, just the $272 million net loss number, what does that look like on a growth basis of reinsurance? Thanks.\nBrian Duperreault: Okay. Well, Peter, that's you again.\nPeter Zaffino: Okay. With Validus Re, we've gone seat-by-seat and have taken a look at our gross net exposures and put up what we thought was the best estimate based on, again, the same process that we outlined for the core of AIG in the first quarter. In terms of the net growth, I mean, look, there's some reinsurance. I'm not going to go into great detail in terms of what the net is versus the growth is, still an evolving loss as we outlined with meaningful IBNR. But again, I've outlined what I thought were the reinsurance structures that could apply in the event that the loss were to grow over time.\nBrian Duperreault: Okay. Thanks, Ryan. Abby, let\u2019s go to the next question.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Meyer Shields with KBW.\nMeyer Shields: Thanks. This is soft of a related question, but it seems to be top of mind for a lot of investors. How should we think about commercial property where there is no little bit of coverage, but no virus exclusion, given some apparent court decision saying that non circle damage would qualify?\nBrian Duperreault: Well, it's a technical question, Peter, can you do this?\nPeter Zaffino: Hey Meyer. It's a really hard question to answer because it's, hypothetical. The only thing I can really do is comment on the policies that we have and where we think, again, I outlined demographics of it and think that the exclusions that we have and where we granted affirmative coverage, it's very specific. And so, it's hard to answer that because I don't think it really applies to our portfolio.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. That's fair, unrelated question. I guess, I would have expected maybe better results in international personal lines, assuming, an international shelter in place order. Am I missing something there?\nBrian Duperreault: International personal lines, Peter?\nPeter Zaffino: Yeah. What, what happened in international personal lines? It's not an anomaly, but we basically had a runoff program, that impacted we still had earned premium, so it was put into runoff in 2018 that earned premium in 2019 and as you've been doing the re underwriting of the portfolio, again not as much as we did on the commercial. We've just lost a little bit of premium. And so, the ratios, look like they perhaps are not going in the right direction, but the absolute performance is very strong. We like the personal book very much and think that there's some real discrete opportunities for growth, particularly in A&H and an areas across, all of international an accident held them new digital platform we're putting in. So I wouldn't read into that in terms of a trend is just, the impact of a runoff of business. Meyer.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Thanks.\nBrian Duperreault: Thanks Peter. Thanks Meyer. Let's go to the next question. I think \nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Meredith with UBS.\nBrian Meredith: Yeah, thanks. So, Brian, I'll have this one for you. We're going to Peter on it. Given the impact you've seen of COVID-19 on the general church business as well as the life insurance businesses, I'm wondering if you're at all rethinking the strategic rationale of actually having both the lights in the TMT operation in the same company?\nPeter Zaffino: Well, Brian, I guess, you know, my job is to continually always think about, the structure that we have. Does it make sense? Would we be better in a different structure? And so that's, that thinking continues, I think at this point. We're comfortable with where we are, but I -- that's my job is to continue to do that. So we'll continue to keep looking at that. There were reasons why these two belong together and those two are still there. But we, I'll always think about that, but there is nothing that I would talk about. Right now I think we're comfortable with it.\nBrian Duperreault: Any other question, Brian? \nBrian Meredith: Yeah, this is just one of the quick one here. I'm just thinking about it. So given us the largest cash loss coverage, each inch industry probably ever, if I kind of think back, AIG with -- had well over $2 billion of losses, are we talking about it potential last year? There's going to be well north of a $1 billion for you guys. Ultimately, at the end of the day, if this is truly the largest cash we lost ever?\nPeter Zaffino: Well, I look at it, we're not the company we were Brian. We're not the company then, there's been a complete, change and we look at the risk, the de-risking that we've done, the limits management, the improved reinsurance profiles all lead us -- put us in a position where we are much stronger and able to withstand an event. And so I point out that this is the largest event because I want people to understand that it's creating an inflection point in the industry. But there are going to be some who do well in this process and some that won't. We're in -- we believe we will do well through this event and that we're going to emerge stronger and more in demand than we were before.\nQ \u2013 Brian Meredith: Makes sense. Thank you.\nBrian Duperreault: You are welcome. Abby, next question.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse.\nAndrew Kligerman: Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. On the life insurance side, I'm wondering if you could give a bit more of sensitivity in terms of the COVID-19 exposure, what you might expect during the course of the year. And then with regard to variable annuity hedging that was very strong. What was your hedging expensive numbers for the variable annuity? And lastly, just in terms of the press release and what you said on the call, you talked about maintaining the return on equity profile for the life business, what might that profile be? I mean could you kind of drill in where you think a good range for all the Life and Retirement could be?\nBrian Duperreault: Okay, Andrew, thanks. So I'm going to have Kevin, obviously, talk about the sensitivity around COVID-19 and the hedging program. And the hedging program, I think, Kevin, why don't you do the piece about the variable annuity, but I would like Doug to jump in on the -- what happened with Fortitude as well. So Kevin, why don't you start?\nKevin Hogan: Yes. Thanks, Brian. Thanks, Andrew. So look, I guess I'll address that from a couple of perspectives. I covered the market impacts, the short-term market impacts. So I'm not sure I need to go back to that. But I mean, clearly, when equity markets move, it impacts the SOP in the DAC and when the fair values move, that impacts the fair value options. Those will never -- I'm sorry, Andrew?\nAndrew Kligerman: Yes. I apologize. I needed to be clear, I mean quickly the mortality. What would series\u2026\nKevin Hogan: Mortality. So it\u2019s very straightforward that in the first quarter, we saw mortality better than pricing. We believe there are delays in the reporting of those claims. As we look at second quarter and third quarter based on where the current estimates are, this is well within our first level modeled stress scenario. We don't expect any significant impact on the balance sheet. And there's also -- it's difficult to project how people are going to behave, how people are going to respond. So that's about the best that we can do. It's just based on where we believe our market presence and geographical presence are versus the current expected losses. In terms of hedging, what I would say is, first of all, you can only hedge what you have. And so the liability profile that we have is a big part of the success of our hedging program because we have primarily de-risked benefits, sold well after the VA arms race of the mid-2000s. And so that includes our feature of requiring fixed income allocation, volatility control funds, et cetera. We've hedged all hedgeable market risks. We've left an open position relative to credit spread, because we believe that that is a natural hedge against our general account portfolio. Over time, our hedge effectiveness is around 90%, and it's continued to perform almost exactly as we expected in the various market dynamics, resulting in I think the results, the good results were reported for the quarter. But I'm going to pass on to Doug because another feature of our hedging success in the first quarter was also in the Fortitude portfolio.\nDoug Dachille: All right. Thank you, Kevin. So I just wanted to comment on the fact that what you don't really see in the financials is with respect to the legacy segment, you're seeing all the mark-to-market impact particularly of the fair value option securities that are in legacy and to some extent, in Fortitude. What you don't see is the fact that we had established interest rate and credit hedges, which all that P&L and effect goes through realized capital gains and losses. So you don't really see the net effect. But the best way to look at how that \u2013 how the entity performed and how those hedges are formed and how effective they were is as Mark made in his prepared remarks, he said that the regulatory capital ratios for the entity were preserved from over a year ago. So that gives you a sense of how effective our hedging strategy was for things that you're not necessarily seeing when you look at the mark-to-market volatility that is reported in our financial statement in the APTI. So, thank you.\nBrian Duperreault: Okay. Thanks, Doug. And Abby, I think we're running a little long, but why don't we take one last question?\nOperator: Yes. Our next question will be from Scott Frost with State Street Global Advisors.\nScott Frost: Thank you for taking my question. You said you expect COVID to be the largest single P&C event industry's ever seen. Could you give us some background on what the basis is with this assessment, specifically the length of shutdown you're assuming here? And what are your thoughts on the Willis piece released Friday, and over how many years do you expect claims to develop and be paid? I'm assuming multiyear payment profile, but if I'm wrong, please correct me.\nBrian Duperreault: Okay. Well, let me start with that and then Peter can add from it. But in terms -- just in terms of the payments, these particularly business interruption claims are very long in process and payments. So I think we're just I think we just cleaned up the last business interruption from Superstorm Sandy to give you some idea. So anyway, but in terms of the estimate, I mean, we've seen a lot of different estimates, and I think they run the range, but the first thing you have to understand is this is global in nature. This pandemic is affected every corner of the world. It isn't that hard to come up with a reasonable assumption around the effects because we're seeing effects in Europe, we're seeing effects in Japan. We're seeing effects in Latin America, and of course, here in North America. So whether it's the effects of comp that we talked about or it's the business interruption, we've seen travel and event cancellations and on and on and on, it doesn't take much to figure out how this is spread across the globe. The question for us is, what's our position on all those things and we feel very, very comfortable with how we've managed this risk in general and how we're well-positioned for COVID. Peter, do you want to add anything to that?\nPeter Zaffino: Not much. The only thing I would just add is what you said. We've seen a lot of very good written documents that have come out. But just because of the ongoing nature of the event and the complexity of the different lines of business, it's the wide range of scale in terms of the low end of the high end is about as wide as you'll see in terms of predicting cash. So, it's very hard to pinpoint anything or the level of accuracy until this evolves over time.\nScott Frost: Well then how can we say that it's going to be the largest event we've ever seen when there's a wide range, I mean, again, you're saying that's going to exceed Katrina? So, on the basis of that, what -- I mean, again, what are we saying? I mean, the world supports a length of shutdown is really the determining factor. They're saying a year its $80 billion. When you say it's greater than Katrina, is that the basis of your statement or can it be less than -- I mean, what I'm trying to get at is, how are you getting to that statement?\nBrian Duperreault: Peter?\nPeter Zaffino: Yes. I mean -- so looking at -- I mean, let's get off the Willis is that we've done a ground-up analysis based on what we think can be an industry loss with a lot of assumptions, again, let's get off the Willis is that we've done a ground-up analysis based on what we think can be an industry loss with a lot of assumptions, again, length of time, severity, geographic spread and have done it across multiple lines of business. And length of time, severity, geographic spread and have done it across multiple lines of business. And again, we're not in the business of putting out ranges as to what is going to happen to the industry because we look at our own portfolio. But when we look at market share of different lines of business, we came up with an estimate that exceeded Katrina. And I think that was the basis of Brian's statement.\nScott Frost: Okay. It would be helpful if you told us some of the assumptions behind that, so I'm driving that. Thank you. I appreciate the comments.\nBrian Duperreault: Well, thank you very much. Like I said, we've gone past our time. So, I want to wrap this up. And so first of all, I want to thank everyone again for joining us today. And I also want to thank our clients and distribution partners, our shareholders, other stakeholders. We're all in this together and we will get through this challenging time together. Most importantly, finally, I want to thank our colleagues around the world. Guys you've exceeded my expectations and I could not be prouder of what we've accomplished together over the last few months. So, everyone, please be safe and be healthy and thank you again. Goodbye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Hogan",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss overall Life and Retirement results for the first quarter and our current outlook, changes in our operating environment due to COVID-19 and then briefly comments on the results for each of our businesses. Life and Retirement recorded adjusted pre-tax income of $574 million for the quarter and delivered adjusted return on attributed common equity at 8.4%. Adjusted pre-tax income decreased by $350 million year-over-year, primarily due to significant market stress in March compared with the strong market recovery we saw in the first quarter of 2019. The main driver of the decrease was lower equity market returns, which primarily resulted in higher variable annuity reserves of $161 million and higher deferred acquisition cost amortization back of $138 million. Also, widening credit spreads generated lower returns from fair value option bonds of $116 million and the low interest rate environment resulted in continued spread compression across our individual and group retirement product lines. Lastly, I am pleased to report that our hedge program performed as expected in response to the market stress experienced in March, generating gains exceeding the movements in our economic view of the liability and related cash collateral. Recognizing the limits of sensitivity, especially in the context of first quarter's market volatility, our sensitivities provided on our last earnings call generally held up. Based on the environment we see today, we continue to expect base spread compression across the whole portfolio of approximately eight to 16 basis points annually. However, wider risk-adjusted credit spreads should generate opportunities to attract new business as profitable margins and the reinvestment of assets slowing off the portfolio should benefit from higher credit spreads. We have updated our estimates of market sensitivities to reflect our balance sheet as of the end of the first quarter. We would expect a plus or minus 1% change in equity market returns to respectively increase or decrease adjusted pretax income by approximately $25 million to $35 million annually and a plus or minus 10 basis point movement in 10-year treasury rates to respectively increase or decrease earnings by approximately $5 million to $15 million annually. These sensitivities assume the immediate impact of market movements on reserves, fact and fair value option securities as well as investment income and other items. It is important to note that these market sensitivity ranges are not exact nor linear since our earnings are also impacted by the timing and degree of movements as well as other factors. Market conditions began to improve in April, but one can expect that should conditions continue to improve, there may be immediate benefits in reserves back for investments in the second quarter although these benefits are likely to be offset slightly by lower private equity returns that are reported on a one quarter lag. Despite the challenging environment COVID-19 created, our balance sheet is strong and we currently estimate our fleet risk-based capital ratio for the first quarter to be between 405% and 415%, including both the impacts of variable annuity reserve and capital reform as well as our hedging program. Our risk-based capital ratio will be sensitive to the impacts from COVID-19 as they flow through our balance sheet throughout the year. Market stress in the first quarter due to COVID-19, while severe in nature did not reach our modeled stress testing scenarios. Although we expect lower levels of overall industry sales for the foreseeable future due to impacts from COVID-19, our leadership position continues to provide us with a unique competitive advantage. We have a broad position across variable index and fixed annuities, term and permanent life insurance, not-for-profit retirement plan markets and institutional markets. We are not dependent on any one product type or distribution channel, which allows us to maintain our long standing disciplined approach with respect to product pricing and future development regardless of the economic environment. Over many years, we have proven our ability to redirect our marketing efforts from one product type to another as market needs and pricing conditions change. We also have a large and diverse in-force portfolio that does not have the significant risks associated with pre-2010 living benefits for long-term care. Our very small block of remaining long-term care business has been reinsured to quarter two. Our strong capital levels and broad market presence position us well to deploy capital as potential attractive opportunities arise in this widening spread environment. Now, I'd like to touch on our operations over the last few months. As Peter noted, we transitioned quickly to a remote working model, with the support of our regulators we're meeting, we successfully adapted our e-signature policies, procedures and controls to support the needs of our plant sponsors, distribution partner firms and individual customers. Also, investments we have made to enhance our digital capabilities have served us well as many more customers are taking advantage of our enhanced self service tools. We've also been very responsive in adopting changes to address the financial hardship faced by some of our customers, such as extending the grace period for premium payments and meeting the requirement of the Cares Act. Our sales and relationship management professionals quickly shifted from face-to-face to virtual meetings and have conducted thousands of such meetings and educational webinars with our producers and customers. Turning to our first quarter financial results. As mentioned, the primary drivers of the decline in Life and Retirement portal adjusted pre-tax income with short-term impacts to our individual and group retirement businesses from significant market movements. As to the top line results are individual retirement, premiums and deposits decreased primarily due to significantly lower fixed annuities fail, as we maintained our pricing discipline as Treasury rates dropped throughout the quarter with credit spreads only beginning to widen late in the period. Our index annuity sales remain strong, but we again grew variable annuity sales. Lower sales of fixed annuities resulted in negative net flows for total individual annuities. For group retirement, premiums and deposits decreased due to lower new group acquisitions, as well as reduced individual product sales driven by the uncertain environment. Net flows improved year-over-year, primarily due to lower group surrenders. In this period of uncertainty, we expect fewer plan sponsors to change providers, which may reduce new group acquisitions, but would support plan retention. For our Life Insurance business, total premiums and deposits increased due to higher international premiums. Our mortality trends continued to be favorable to overall pricing assumptions and the first quarter included a modest IBNR reserve strengthening to reflect the fluidity of COVID-19. Although we may experience some acceleration, we are not expecting large incremental impacts to mortality rates and expect any incremental impacts to be manageable in the context of our overall balance sheet. For institutional markets, we have continued to grow our asset base and earnings, and this business continues to be well-positioned. We remain focused on new opportunities and have the capacity to participate as activity arises in the pension risk transfer and other institutional businesses. To close, despite these challenging times, we remain available to serve our customers, plan sponsors and distribution partners. We are committed to further mobilizing our broad product expertise and distribution footprint to serve our stakeholders in new ways as their needs evolve. We will continue to deploy capital to the most attractive opportunities and focus on meeting ever-growing needs for protection, retirement savings and lifetime income solutions. Now, I will turn it over to Mark. Yes. Thanks. So, I'll address it really in 3 pieces, mortalities of the markets and then maybe just a reminder around pricing. So, our reported mortality in the first quarter was below pricing, which continues the trend that we've had for the last two-plus years. But later in the period, what we did notice is that there were some delays in reporting, generally related the issuance of certain documentations. So, we put up the modest IBNR really for just running reporting. As we look ahead, we do expect that there will be additional mortality in the second and the third quarter, depending upon how circumstances and behaviors evolve. So, where does that leave us? We expect some expect some adverse mortality overall for 2020, but we don't expect to see significant impacts to the balance sheet based on what we know, and there could be some offsetting factors. In terms of the market effects, look, there's two things. I mean, when equity markets move, particularly when they go down, that ultimately reduces our future expected fee income, particularly in the annuities portfolio, which we have to reflect immediately and back. The reality is, is that the reduced reserve overall actually emerges as additional profits in the future. It also serves to increase our SOP all 3 1 reserves, and when changes in credit spreads, we see the immediate impact on fair value options. So those two short-term market effects are reversible. And that leads to the third thing, which is pricing and how do we feel about current pricing. And certainly, treasury rates are at all-time lows, but our ability to price product is to pace -- is based not only on where base rates are. But also where credit spreads, what is the shape of the yield curve and where investor expectations and appetites are. And so based on the power environment, we're still able to price the long-term expectations that we have. Certainly, there's disruptions in the sales environment, but it's difficult to anticipate what the future on that is going to be and how it resolves. So those are the three perspectives I have on the long-term earnings potential of the Life and Retirement environment. Yes. And just one other piece on the comp, and Peter mentioned this earlier, but, yes, there are COVID claims coming in, but I think you have to recognize that there's been a decline in a number of claims coming in otherwise. So it remains to be seen what the net effect of COVID has on the worker concept. So that's something to keep an eye on. With that, Abby, let\u2019s go to the next question. Okay. Michael, well, that's Peter. So Peter, why don't you do that? Peter, go ahead. Yes. Thanks, Brian. Thanks, Andrew. So look, I guess I'll address that from a couple of perspectives. I covered the market impacts, the short-term market impacts. So I'm not sure I need to go back to that. But I mean, clearly, when equity markets move, it impacts the SOP in the DAC and when the fair values move, that impacts the fair value options. Those will never -- I'm sorry, Andrew? Mortality. So it\u2019s very straightforward that in the first quarter, we saw mortality better than pricing. We believe there are delays in the reporting of those claims. As we look at second quarter and third quarter based on where the current estimates are, this is well within our first level modeled stress scenario. We don't expect any significant impact on the balance sheet. And there's also -- it's difficult to project how people are going to behave, how people are going to respond. So that's about the best that we can do. It's just based on where we believe our market presence and geographical presence are versus the current expected losses. In terms of hedging, what I would say is, first of all, you can only hedge what you have. And so the liability profile that we have is a big part of the success of our hedging program because we have primarily de-risked benefits, sold well after the VA arms race of the mid-2000s. And so that includes our feature of requiring fixed income allocation, volatility control funds, et cetera. We've hedged all hedgeable market risks. We've left an open position relative to credit spread, because we believe that that is a natural hedge against our general account portfolio. Over time, our hedge effectiveness is around 90%, and it's continued to perform almost exactly as we expected in the various market dynamics, resulting in I think the results, the good results were reported for the quarter. But I'm going to pass on to Doug because another feature of our hedging success in the first quarter was also in the Fortitude portfolio."

            "content": "Good morning, everyone. It's been an extraordinary few months since we last spoke. Before we start, I want to say that I hope you and your families are healthy, and that you've been able to adjust to the new normal that COVID-19 is creating for all of us. This crisis has been heartbreaking to witness as it unfolds across the globe. It's a tough time for everyone and the uncertainty about how long it will last and what life will be like afterwards makes this time even harder. I've witnessed a lot in my 40-plus year career in the insurance industry. But this health and humanitarian crisis, which quickly became a threat to the world economy, is like nothing any of us has experienced. We believe COVID-19 will be the single largest CAT loss the industry has ever seen and will continue to have significant global economic ramifications for the foreseeable future. Thanks, Mark. Abby, I think we're ready for the Q&A portion. So please get us started and let us move first. Okay. Elyse, I think that's a question for Peter. Peter, would you take that, please? Thank you, Peter. Next question Okay, Tom. Listen, why don't we have Mark, you wanted to talk about the debt. And then I'm going to ask Doug to take over on the investment portfolio question. So Mark, why don't you go first? Okay, thanks Doug. So, why don\u2019t we get the next question then. Next question. Well, I'm going to have Peter talk about what we see in the P&C side, and then I'll let Kevin talk about L&R. So, Peter, do you want to talk about that first? Kevin, on L&R? And one thing I'd just like to add there, Yaron, Peter's comments about certain lines of business, he mentioned workers' comp. I think it's important to remember that AIG has de-risked that workers' compensation business significantly, probably over the last 7, 8 years. And where AIG finds itself now is mostly in loss sensitive related programs, which have average deductibles north of $1 million. So when you think about debt in the work comp area, that's statutorily determined by state, that's going to be underneath a deductible, standard medical and temporary, all that falls away. It has to be a major permanent parcel to really penetrate it. So I think the book is well positioned given what we're talking about here. Okay. So Paul, you want us to talk about in a COVID versus our reinsurance program? Yes. Okay. Well, Peter, I guess, that's you again. So Paul, let me just jump in. Look, our reinsurance is good and solid, and Peter has done a tremendous job along with his team to put that together. Our first-line of defense is the way we manage our portfolio to start with. And so you can't rely on reinsurance to make a portfolio better than it is.  o we've done a tremendous amount of work, risk selection, limits management, attachment points and pricing along all the lines of business property and casualty and that's where we feel very confident about our situation vis-\u00e0-vis the impact that COVID will \u2013 as those impacts unfold. So I just want to add that. So Paul, did you have another \u2013 anything else? Okay. You\u2019re welcome, Paul. Thank you. Next question, Abby? Well, I said one. Peter, go ahead. Yes. Ryan, let me just add something here. And that is, Peter talked about that process of evaluating the losses occurring in the first quarter. I've been in this business a long time, 40-plus years. And I've seen a lot of things come and go. I've seen difficulties in trying to assess loss. I have to tell you the process that they \u2013 that we went through, that they went through, we went through, it's as good as anything I've ever seen. They have gone through every bit of the portfolio. They looked at everything where there was a potential and evaluated whether there would be reason to post the reserve, if it was, it was done. So we have posted the reserve that we believe are appropriate, albeit conservative for that, everything that happened in the first quarter. I just want to make sure that everybody understands that, everything that happened there. Okay. Well, Peter, that's you again. Okay. Thanks, Ryan. Abby, let\u2019s go to the next question. Well, it's a technical question, Peter, can you do this? International personal lines, Peter? Thanks Peter. Thanks Meyer. Let's go to the next question. I think Any other question, Brian? You are welcome. Abby, next question. Okay, Andrew, thanks. So I'm going to have Kevin, obviously, talk about the sensitivity around COVID-19 and the hedging program. And the hedging program, I think, Kevin, why don't you do the piece about the variable annuity, but I would like Doug to jump in on the -- what happened with Fortitude as well. So Kevin, why don't you start? Okay. Thanks, Doug. And Abby, I think we're running a little long, but why don't we take one last question? Okay. Well, let me start with that and then Peter can add from it. But in terms -- just in terms of the payments, these particularly business interruption claims are very long in process and payments. So I think we're just I think we just cleaned up the last business interruption from Superstorm Sandy to give you some idea. So anyway, but in terms of the estimate, I mean, we've seen a lot of different estimates, and I think they run the range, but the first thing you have to understand is this is global in nature. This pandemic is affected every corner of the world. It isn't that hard to come up with a reasonable assumption around the effects because we're seeing effects in Europe, we're seeing effects in Japan. We're seeing effects in Latin America, and of course, here in North America. So whether it's the effects of comp that we talked about or it's the business interruption, we've seen travel and event cancellations and on and on and on, it doesn't take much to figure out how this is spread across the globe. The question for us is, what's our position on all those things and we feel very, very comfortable with how we've managed this risk in general and how we're well-positioned for COVID. Peter, do you want to add anything to that? Peter? Well, thank you very much. Like I said, we've gone past our time. So, I want to wrap this up. And so first of all, I want to thank everyone again for joining us today. And I also want to thank our clients and distribution partners, our shareholders, other stakeholders. We're all in this together and we will get through this challenging time together. Most importantly, finally, I want to thank our colleagues around the world. Guys you've exceeded my expectations and I could not be prouder of what we've accomplished together over the last few months. So, everyone, please be safe and be healthy and thank you again. Goodbye."

            "name": "Doug Dachille",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark and good morning. Well, I would refer you to page 49 of the financial supplement, which basically goes through the legacy segment and the assets that are held in that segment in pretty robust detail. And as you know, in addition, there's approximately $40 billion of assets, which we also disclosed in our financials, which are going to be part of the sale related to Fortitude. The portions that we\u2019ll be retaining, there will be some real estate investments that we'll be retaining that are part of legacy. There will also be some fair value option bonds that will be retained in legacy that were part of the old financial products direct investment book. So those will not be part of the sale transaction. But the material amount of the assets will be, as you know \u2013 over $40 billion will be separating as part of the sale of Fortitude. With respect of the real estate, you -- as you know, we only experienced a rapid acceleration in the month of March with respect to the development and emergence of the COVID situation. So we're still in the midst of analyzing the impact. And I think it's very early to determine what the impact will be on our real estate portfolio. But it should be noted that our real estate portfolio is diverse. It includes both domestic and international exposures. So the impact we'll learn more as things go on. I think where we're learning the most about our real estate is obviously on the commercial mortgage loan side. So that's where we're getting some real insight into what's going on in the real estate market. And those teams, the commercial mortgage loan team work very, very closely with the real estate equity team at AIG. And all of those investments are managed directly. So we have great level sight \u2013 of line of sight to what's going on in that market, but it's still really early to determine what's going to happen. Well, let me take that. Who knows? I mean, you don't know whether COVID will reemerge, if it does go down an impact in 2020. It's really a question of how much predictability is there to quarterly earnings. And it's difficult to predict quarters. So if you can't predict the quarter, I don't want to try to predict a year or several years.  I think it's important to note, though, that the underlying power of the company remains. We're very, very strong in the GI. GI has continued to show improvement. Good work that has been done over the last 3 years, what Peter and his team have continued on. So the returns that we were talking about, I believe, if you \u2013 certainly, if you pick the COVID out for a second, are going to continue to improve. And so that trajectory we're on is, we're still on. Now you have a COVID event, and I think the COVID event certainly would impact L&R on a short-term basis. But again, we think the long-term power of the company is there. So COVID itself, it will be large. I told you that I believe it will be the largest event in the insurance industry, but it is -- it's an inflection point. And that effect that we'll see -- we've already been in a market on the GI side, General Insurance, P&C side that was turning. It was improving. And the rates in terms and conditions were improving for the risk taker. This COVID is going to prove to be an inflection point. So, companies with strong balance sheet, we have one; companies with strong management, we have one; companies that has been well risk managed, and we've done that now, they're going to be on the right side of that. And so we believe we can handle anything that comes with COVID and we feel very strong. But predicting quarter-to-quarter is just impossible. So, I hope that helps. All right. Thank you, Kevin. So I just wanted to comment on the fact that what you don't really see in the financials is with respect to the legacy segment, you're seeing all the mark-to-market impact particularly of the fair value option securities that are in legacy and to some extent, in Fortitude. What you don't see is the fact that we had established interest rate and credit hedges, which all that P&L and effect goes through realized capital gains and losses. So you don't really see the net effect. But the best way to look at how that \u2013 how the entity performed and how those hedges are formed and how effective they were is as Mark made in his prepared remarks, he said that the regulatory capital ratios for the entity were preserved from over a year ago. So that gives you a sense of how effective our hedging strategy was for things that you're not necessarily seeing when you look at the mark-to-market volatility that is reported in our financial statement in the APTI. So, thank you."

            "name": "Peter Zaffino",
            "content": "Thank you, Brian. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, I plan to review the following topics: a brief overview of the potential near and longer term impact of COVID-19 on the insurance and reinsurance markets generally, how we analyze the impact of COVID-19 on GI through March 31st, first quarter results for General Insurance, excluding COVID-19, including Validus Re, our recently announced launch of Syndicate 2019 and AIG 200 and the progress that we've made since our last earnings call. As Brian said, the near and long-term impact of COVID-19 on the global economy and insurance and reinsurance industries remains unclear. In contrast to other catastrophes like wildfires, hurricanes and earthquakes, this event is not confined to any specific geographic region, and it has already impacted over 200 countries and territories. In addition, this duration is not limited as is typically the case with traditional CATs. While the insurance industry manages risk of all kinds, it's fair to say that the profound impact and global nature of COVID-19 is something we have never encountered. There's no playbook. And as a result, we are called upon to make thoughtful and prudent decisions in a climate of unprecedented uncertainty. Before COVID, the largest catastrophes on record were Hurricane Katrina with $65 billion losses, then the Tohoku earthquake with $35 billion in loss, Hurricane Irma with $30 billion losses, and Superstorm Sandy also with approximately $30 billion in losses. With respect to COVID-19, we're starting to see early industry estimates, but they have significant ranges. While it's too early to gauge the ultimate size of the loss, we believe COVID-19 will result in the largest individual CAT loss, the insurance industry has ever seen. Going forward, COVID-related losses will impact all aspects of underwriting insurance from absolute limits available, limits deployed to certain lines of business, terms and conditions, co-insurance and structure of coverage just to name a few. With respect to the reinsurance main, unlike traditional name parallel catastrophes, COVID was not modeled. And, therefore, it will be a headwind for future capacity. We believe the retro market will contract. And in the ILS market, there will be trapped capital, which will lock up collateral, therefore, restricting capacity on a go-forward basis, and we're already seeing this. Yeah. Sure, Brian. Hi, Elyse, let me just give you a little bit more detail. Yes, we did go through it very thoroughly in the first quarter, as I outlined our process that we did bottom-up and top-down but when you look at the size and scope of our global portfolio, the nature of our clients in terms of the segmentation, we do have commercial property policy that have some manuscript warnings. As I said in my opening remarks, the overwhelming majority of the standard commercial property policies do contain clear exclusions for viruses, and it's fairly standard in the industry. These policies also require that there's direct physical loss or damage that impact the insurance business operations. As to these policies, COVID is not covered. So that's point one. There are limited instances where we do write affirmative coverage for communicable diseases. But even in those cases, it's only on a supplemented basis, and in pursuant, we have very strict underwriting guidelines that often result in coverage for only specified diseases. And in an event that there's a requirement that there would also be a government closure caused by physical presence of the disease itself. So again, it's fairly clear. And just to give you some context in terms of what I'm talking about is that 100% of our sub-limits aggregate to well less than 1% of our total limits in our commercial property policy. So it's a very small portion of the overall property exposure. And I would just note that I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have really comprehensive reinsurance, whether it's on a property per risk basis, we have low attachment points on a per occurrence basis that's regional, and we also have global aggregates that attach to reduced volatility on a frequency severity basis. So sorry for the long answer, but I think it's important to get into the detail. Sure. Thank you, Brian. We mentioned quite a few lines when we were referring to the first quarter, whether it's travel, M&A, A&H, some other lines to think about that could have activity, workers' compensation. We don't know about D&O liability. We have been watching it very carefully and making certain that we're looking at any line that we think could have an impact. But what I can tell you to add to Brian's comments before, is that we have a very thorough process and we'll be consistent all the way through. We know the CAT is still ongoing, which is a very rare. So, as things emerge and develop, we will adapt to that. And we're looking at this across every global geography where we think there's impact and multiple lines of business. But because the CAT is still going, we even have two months left in the quarter. It's hard to see what transpire in the future. But as I said, we have a great process, and we will keep everybody have a great process, and we will keep everybody updated on lines of business as they emerge. Okay. Thank you for the question. We certainly are paying very close attention to lines of business that would be affected by the economic headwinds that are generated from COVID-19. I mentioned some of them in the prior question in areas where we're watching for loss, but I would think that there's going to be a meaningful falloff of travel in the second quarter. M&A could be some fall off in aerospace, marine and energy, and we mentioned workers' compensation. Having said all that is that you got to remember the segmentation and demographic of our portfolio, I mean, over 75% of our businesses on some form of either deductible SIR or funded captive. And so we don't have a direct correlation, even though it is rated off of a payroll, sales, auto is done on an excess basis. And therefore, we do not think we will have as much headwind in terms of premium reduction. There will be some, but it will be more modest because it's not a direct ratable exposure that generates the premium. We have different factors in terms of how we adjust excess premium. So we just don't think it's going to be as pronounced. Brian mentioned on workers' compensation, the decrease in frequency. It's not a trend yet, but it's an observation that, while COVID losses are increasing, we're seeing a commensurate drop in where our clients are retaining losses that those are dropping. So as we look at repositioning our portfolio, where we attach on an excess basis and the commensurate premium as I said, there's going to be some lines of business that will affect. We there's opportunities for other areas of growth. As we have repositioned the portfolio, we like where we are, and think that the leadership position that AIG can demonstrate in the marketplace will give us also some select opportunities for growth. Thanks. Michael, anything else? Okay. Thanks, Michael, Abby, next question. Thanks, Brian and Paul. So I outlined our property program and said that we had reduced volatility significantly. On the liability side, I think we've done actually even more. We used to retain significant limits within AIG and so we've been building a program over time that significantly reduce the net limits that we put out as well as the gross limits. And also we did that on an excess of loss basis and also on a quota share. So on a general liability policy, as an example, we would have less than probably, depending on the limit, we have a 50% plus quota share on our first limit retention that we have 100% reinsurance above $25 million. So we have \u2013 if you issue a policy, a significant sized policy, the multi have net is between $10 million and $12 million. So we actually have significant protection on the quota share as well as the excess of loss. Sorry, Ryan. What I said was, not that that was a permanent coverage and those sublimits would trigger coverage. What I said is that the limits that we provided on the affirmative, which have, again, a bunch of triggers that I outlined in my previous answer that we have well less than 1% of our total limits when you compare that to our property gross limits. So, again, it's well less than 1%. And I'm not suggesting that we confirm that there is coverage or that we are adjudicating claims on that amount. It's just that, that's what we have for limits, and then it goes case-by-case, insured-by-insured in terms of what the losses. Okay. With Validus Re, we've gone seat-by-seat and have taken a look at our gross net exposures and put up what we thought was the best estimate based on, again, the same process that we outlined for the core of AIG in the first quarter. In terms of the net growth, I mean, look, there's some reinsurance. I'm not going to go into great detail in terms of what the net is versus the growth is, still an evolving loss as we outlined with meaningful IBNR. But again, I've outlined what I thought were the reinsurance structures that could apply in the event that the loss were to grow over time. Hey Meyer. It's a really hard question to answer because it's, hypothetical. The only thing I can really do is comment on the policies that we have and where we think, again, I outlined demographics of it and think that the exclusions that we have and where we granted affirmative coverage, it's very specific. And so, it's hard to answer that because I don't think it really applies to our portfolio. Yeah. What, what happened in international personal lines? It's not an anomaly, but we basically had a runoff program, that impacted we still had earned premium, so it was put into runoff in 2018 that earned premium in 2019 and as you've been doing the re underwriting of the portfolio, again not as much as we did on the commercial. We've just lost a little bit of premium. And so, the ratios, look like they perhaps are not going in the right direction, but the absolute performance is very strong. We like the personal book very much and think that there's some real discrete opportunities for growth, particularly in A&H and an areas across, all of international an accident held them new digital platform we're putting in. So I wouldn't read into that in terms of a trend is just, the impact of a runoff of business. Meyer. Well, Brian, I guess, you know, my job is to continually always think about, the structure that we have. Does it make sense? Would we be better in a different structure? And so that's, that thinking continues, I think at this point. We're comfortable with where we are, but I -- that's my job is to continue to do that. So we'll continue to keep looking at that. There were reasons why these two belong together and those two are still there. But we, I'll always think about that, but there is nothing that I would talk about. Right now I think we're comfortable with it. Well, I look at it, we're not the company we were Brian. We're not the company then, there's been a complete, change and we look at the risk, the de-risking that we've done, the limits management, the improved reinsurance profiles all lead us -- put us in a position where we are much stronger and able to withstand an event. And so I point out that this is the largest event because I want people to understand that it's creating an inflection point in the industry. But there are going to be some who do well in this process and some that won't. We're in -- we believe we will do well through this event and that we're going to emerge stronger and more in demand than we were before.\nQ \u2013 Brian Meredith: Makes sense. Thank you. Not much. The only thing I would just add is what you said. We've seen a lot of very good written documents that have come out. But just because of the ongoing nature of the event and the complexity of the different lines of business, it's the wide range of scale in terms of the low end of the high end is about as wide as you'll see in terms of predicting cash. So, it's very hard to pinpoint anything or the level of accuracy until this evolves over time. Yes. I mean -- so looking at -- I mean, let's get off the Willis is that we've done a ground-up analysis based on what we think can be an industry loss with a lot of assumptions, again, let's get off the Willis is that we've done a ground-up analysis based on what we think can be an industry loss with a lot of assumptions, again, length of time, severity, geographic spread and have done it across multiple lines of business. And length of time, severity, geographic spread and have done it across multiple lines of business. And again, we're not in the business of putting out ranges as to what is going to happen to the industry because we look at our own portfolio. But when we look at market share of different lines of business, we came up with an estimate that exceeded Katrina. And I think that was the basis of Brian's statement."

            "name": "Mark Lyons",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. Before providing summary comments about the first quarter, I'd like to give COVID-19 perspective from where I sit. First, this health crisis, which quickly evolves into an associated financial crisis, is unprecedented in scope, uncertainty and length and depth of economic impact. Additionally, this ongoing event has simultaneously impacted both sides of the balance sheet, thereby nullifying most underlying disruptions that investment assets and insurance liabilities are marginally correlated. As a result, it's extremely difficult to forecast one quarter in advance let alone a full year longer. However, as Brian also noted, I want to reiterate that AIG was strongly financially positioned entering the crisis, both from a parent and subsidiary liquidity and capital perspective and is well positioned today, including our investment portfolio. The evolving situation causes us to view liquidity and capital strength as an imperative. When the crisis suddenly took hold on capital markets in mid-March and not knowing what could come next, we thought it was prudent to augment our already strong current liquidity with a $1.3 billion partial drawdown of our revolving credit facility. We did this solely as a precautionary measure given the significant uncertainty at the time, about the near-term impacts of COVID-19. I will provide an update on our capital management plans and liquidity position later in these remarks after I review our first quarter results. So turning to the first quarter. AIG reported adjusted after-tax operating earnings of $0.11 per diluted share compared to $1.58 per share in the first quarter of 2019. Contained within this result is the continued improvement of General Insurance with a 95.5% accident year 2020 ex-CAT combined ratio as Peter noted. First quarter results reflect direct and indirect impacts related to COVID-19, including the market impact on net investment income and book value, with a lesser impact on core operations APTI. Peter discussed, the General Insurance COVID reserve reflects our best estimate, the losses occurring through March 31. The first quarter, adjusted book value per share increased 2.8% and adjusted tangible book value per share increased 3.2%, both since year-end. It's also notable that AIG's adjusted tangible book value per share increased nearly 11% since March 31, one year ago, which we believe is a better measurement of the improvement in AIG's core operating performance over the last year. Book value and tangible book value per share, both of which include changes in AOCI and the DTA, were virtually flat year-over-year, even with the significant AOCI change we saw in the first quarter of this year. In the first quarter, on an adjusted pre-tax income basis, net investment income, or NII, was $2.7 billion, down approximately $1 billion from the down approximately first quarter of 2019. Recall that the first quarter of 2019 included significant gains following the downturn that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2018 as this year's first quarter experienced significant losses due to the COVID-19 volatility in March, resulting in a distorted quarter-over-quarter comparison. I want to spend some time on our global investment portfolio. Because in the current environment, I think it's important to understand its composition. Several reports have been published that use incorrect assumptions and information about our portfolio. In many cases, our consolidated global portfolio has been compared to U.S. Life or P&C peers or the industry generally, without taking into account our unique position as a global composite or multi-line insurer. In addition, some believe our portfolio has above-average inherent risk, which is simply not the case. Instead, we believe our portfolio is below average in terms of risk and we'll get into some of that. In addition, certain accounting elections AIG took in prior years relating to specific securities have created above the line accounting volatility, which has led to some confusion, but this volatility does not impact AIG on a total return basis. To address these complexities and the many questions and comments we have received, we've provided much more disclosure regarding our portfolio, including the General Insurance, Life and Retirement and Legacy portfolio composition. On pages 46 through 65 in our financial supplement, there you will find a significant expansion of our disclosure beyond segment and into credit quality distribution and asset or industry characteristics. As Brian mentioned, Doug Dachille, our Chief Investment Officer, can help address follow-up questions during Q&A, but I'll give some high-level comments now. At March 31st, AIG had a $332 billion investable asset portfolio. This portfolio is about 73% fixed income available for sale securities, which represents 75% of General Insurance's portfolio and 74% of Life and Retirement. In addition, roughly 14% of the portfolio is invested in mortgage and other loans, 6% in short-term investments, 2.5% in real estate investment, less than 2% in private equity, approximately 1.5% is in fair value option fixed income security or FVO securities and about 0.7% is in hedge funds. It's important to recognize though that roughly 80% of the FVO fixed income portfolio, which historically has had higher volatility than are available to sales fixed maturity securities is held in legacy. Notably, the FVO portfolio makes up only 1.4% of General Insurance's portfolio and 0.3% of Life and Retirement. Our historical FVO accounting election mostly on legacy non-agency RMBS that were previously credit impaired cannot be changed or be changed or modified and move mark-to-market volatility above the line into our income statement within net investment income. For available for sale securities, such volatility would be below the line in AOCI. As a result, this FVO accounting treatment puts more volatility into our income statement by NII with less relative volatility in AOCI, which is where one would ordinarily expect to see the volatility. Financial statement geography is important to note when examining AIG's NII, but it is irrelevant when you look at total return, which is how our investment function manages our portfolio. Over the last four-plus years, and Doug can address this in more detail, AIG has seen significant de-risking of its investment portfolio with material reductions in hedge funds, life settlement, CDOs, and FVO securities, totaling approximately $32 billion, which is a 60% drop in these asset classes since year end 2015. Additionally, AIG's portfolio has only a very small direct equity exposure, representing just 0.2% of the portfolio. The volatility in the equity markets has a minimal impact on our investment income and even that is below the line. On page 63 of the financial supplement, you will also see a significant $9 billion plus credit quality difference and below investment-grade securities between the rating agency view and the NAIC designation view. Most of this is non-agency RMBS on an FVO basis, which we have had evaluated and rated NAIC 1 by the securities valuation office of the NAIC. This is the highest rating category, which is important because these assets strengthen subsidiary RBC levels and can sustain RBC levels even if they fall one notch, because they still will be investment grade. However, rating agencies have not re-rated these securities with current information, so from their perspective, the securities still retains legacy below investment-grade status. When examining our $144 billion of corporate debt, which is summarized on page 56 of the financial supplement and expanded beginning on page 59, note that nearly $130 million is investment grade. And of this total, 15% is rated AA or AAA, 34% is A-rated and 51% is BBB-rated. Compared to the overall investment-grade market, we have a superior distribution of such asset by rating. Similarly, when viewing the entire corporate debt portfolio, 10% is below investment grade, which is much lower than the market average of 48%. I wanted to point this out because given the magnitude of AIG's investment portfolio; some may assume that our portfolio mirrors the industry average, which is not the case. With respect to CECL credit impacts in the first quarter, which are included in realized gains and losses and not NII, we recognized approximately $236 million of credit losses. This stems from about $198 million in fixed income securities and $38 million in loans. Now turning to the operating segment. As Peter and Kevin discuss their financial results in detail, I will just add a few remarks that augment their comments. General Insurance, I'd point out that the $419 million of total CAT reserves for the quarter represents 6.9 loss ratio points with $272 million or 4.5 loss ratio points being attributed to COVID-19 and $147 million or 2.4 loss ratio related to other CAT events, the largest of which was the tornado storm system that hit Nashville in early March. Excluding COVID-19, General Insurance generated $185 million of underwriting income, which includes the non-COVID catalog. Prior year development was minimal in the first quarter with $60 million of net favorable development, $53 million of which emanated from the amortization of the ADC deferred gain. On a pre-ADC basis, there was a net $1 million of favorable development, representing $30 million of unfavorable in North America, mostly from shorter deadlines, largely offset by favorable $31 million from international across many product lines. Lastly, as Peter discussed, Syndicate 2019 will favorably alter AIG's risk profile as concentration risk is distributed across an innovative structure and set of capital providers. We anticipate that in the second quarter and for the balance of the 2020 year, TDS premiums will increase over original expectations, and therefore, net premiums will correspondingly reduce. We project that second quarter net written premium in high net worth will be down approximately $650 million from original expectations and that net earned premiums for the 2020 year were reduced by approximately $675 million as a result. Beginning in 2021, however, the catastrophe cover costs will decrease for AIG since the high net worth exposure subject to the CAT program will be a fraction of what it is today. So for 2020, underwriting income for the high net worth unit, we anticipate approximately the same underwriting result pre and post 2019 and then to become accretive thereafter. Turning to Life and Retirement, I would just add that institutional markets benefited from approximately $700 million pension risk transfer premium in the quarter, albeit down a bit from -- corresponding quarter of last year. Legacy, a $368 million adjusted pretax loss in the first quarter was due to a reduction in NII driven by capital markets volatility we saw in March, which abated, as mentioned, in April. As a reminder, we signed a definitive agreement to sell Fortitude last year with the economic set as of December 31, 2018, which means that all net income subsequent to year-end 2018, up through closing will be included in the gain or sale or loss on sale to be recognized upon the closing of the transaction. We continue on course towards a midyear closing subject to regulatory approval and it is noteworthy that Fortitude also has benefited from strategic hedging transactions that performed as expected, and in fact, health capital ratios remain virtually unchanged since early 2019. Next, moving to other operations, and as I discussed on last quarter's earnings call, you will see on pages 37 to 39 of the financial supplement, a revised and simplified presentation that helps identify key drivers of APTI. Our previous disclosures on this segment could be difficult to understand and volatile, in part due to the gross-up of income and expense for internal items, mostly investment services, which increased other income and GOE. We simplified that and also provided APTI by activity, which should help. As for magnitude, this quarter's $280 million of other operations GOE included the COVID-19 employee grants totaling $30 million that Brian referenced, and remote access IT costs of $3 million. Excluding that, other operations GOE would have only been $247 million. Turning to tax, we had a core 23% tax rate on adjusted pretax income for the first quarter, higher than recent prior quarters due to additional items dominated by a $37 million impact, reflecting share-based compensation differences, plus by grant date versus delivery date of value resulting from spot price declines during the first quarter. Turning to liquidity and capital resources, we believe that liquidity and operating subsidiary capital strength are paramount priority in this uncertain economic environment. At year-end 2019, AIG had $7.5 billion of liquidity at the parent and the RBC fleet ratios for General Insurance's US pool finished 2019 at 419% and for Life and Retirement at 402%. During the first quarter, we repurchased $500 million of our stock and closed $350 million of most advanced. Share repurchases helped to offset share count dilution stemming from equity compensation and the promotion bond call aided our debt leverage ratio. As of March 31, AIG had a similar $7.5 billion of current liquidity, including the $1.3 billion draw from our revolver that I referenced earlier in my remarks as well as strong liquidity in both General Insurance and Life and Retirement. Before turning to AIG 200, there were two below the line items in the first quarter that I would like to highlight: First, the success of our hedging program; and the second would be Blackboard. Turning first to our hedging program, roughly $3.6 billion of variable annuity fair value benefits were reflected during the first quarter within the realized games line as a direct result of successful interest rate and equity risk hedging within the Life and Retirement and legacy segment that clearly preserve book value. It should be noted though that on a GAAP basis, this gain was aided by the NPA, or non-performance adjustment, impact, which is highly volatile and reversible depending upon rates for ebbs and equity markets. Secondly, at the end of March, AIG made a strategic decision to discontinue Blackboard, our internal insured tech startup in light of current market condition. Blackboard's GOE which was $16 million in the quarter, has been historically recorded in other operations, but that we'll cease starting with the second quarter of this year. Associated with this business decision, we recorded an approximate $165 million after-tax charge, not included in APTI. Pivoting to AIG 200, as Peter noted, we continue to refine our operational plans in response to COVID-19. We still expect that this strategic three-year transformation will result in $1.3 billion in costs to achieve an annualized $1 billion of run rate GOE savings by year-end 2022. Let me first just provide a quick review and then I'll give you the AIG 200 three-year walk as well as its impact on the first quarter of 2020. From a reporting perspective, all costs to achieve, aside from $400 million of pre-tax spending that will be capitalized will be recorded below the line, not in APTI, as restructuring and other costs, which will make it straightforward to track. These below the line charges mostly involve employee-related costs, dedicated internal resources and associated professional services. Capitalized costs of $400 million before tax, represent mostly investments in systems, development, interfaces, data conversions and associated integrated workflow processes, which have an impact on cash, but are not expensed immediately in the income statement. Instead, each investment will be capitalized and then amortized through GOE based on its useful life according to accounting principles. Hence, by year-end 2022, we would expect that the amortization portion of the $400 million will be included in our annual expense run rate, where our goal is a total annual run rate savings of $1 billion, including the amortization of these capitalized investments. So let's turn towards what this means for the next three years, acknowledging that in this uncertain world, timing of plans can somewhat change. Under Peter's leadership, we are governing AIG 200 via structured checkpoints and tollgate that control cost, confirm scope and reconfirm scope and drive key milestone achievements. Overall, we expect a total 'cash cost' at the holding company of $1.3 billion. As shown on page eight of the financial results slide, $350 million of this is expected in 2020, although still being reviewed due to COVID-19 impact; $500 million in 2021 and $450 million in 2022. Of these amounts, approximately $100 million in 2020 will be capitalized with later amortization into GOE. The combination of these two result in a below the line projected charge of $250 million before tax. Then in 2021, about $200 million will be capitalized, with a below the line charge of roughly $300 million. And finally, about $100 million will be capitalized to 2022, with a below the line charge of $350 million. Based on our current useful life schedule for depreciation and assumptions about when we expect the $400 million in capitalized assets to be placed into service, calendar year depreciation included in GOE should be zero in 2020, as the project will still be in development; rising in 2021 to be between $10 million to $15 million before tax; and $25 million to $30 million in 2022. Based on projected completion by year-end 2022, the unamortized balance of about $350 million will be amortized at about a seven-year average life, with $50 million per year in 2023 through 2027 and then trailing off a bit from there. Finally, in the first quarter of 2020, we had a $90 million restructuring charge below the line, of which about $23 million related to AIG 200 and the balance from other actions. Going forward, restructuring charges will primarily reflect AIG 200 costs. Relative to expense savings, this quarter had $10 million of GOE savings, which will translate to $60 million on an annualized run rate basis, which is part of the $300 million plan run rate benefit by year-end 2020. Now shifting to capital management and looking ahead, in light of the significant uncertainty on many fronts due to COVID-19, we do not plan to do additional share repurchases or debt reduction actions for the foreseeable future, but we will reassess this as COVID-19 impact stabilize. However, given improved stability in and access to the capital markets since March, we are reevaluating our debt and capital plan. While reducing debt leverage to 25% or below is a minimum term goal, in the near term, our priority is maintaining strong operating capitalization, financial flexibility and liquidity. As a result, we are considering options to generate additional near-term liquidity in light of ongoing economic volatility as well as upcoming debt maturities in 2020 and in the medium term. Although spreads have widened since year-end, all-in coupons are attractive. Given the significant uncertainty around the duration and depth of global recession created by COVID-19, as well as taking into account our global operating footprint and different regulatory capital regimes, we think it is prudent to evaluate debt capital market opportunities in the near term rather than waiting until later in the year, which was our original plan prior to COVID-19. Lastly, and reflecting back, the first quarter benefited in the first two months from strong momentum in GI pricing, investment return and operating initiatives. In March, COVID-19 spread incredibly fast and dramatically changed everyone's everyday world. AIG entered this crisis from a position of strength while it has certainly impacted us and caused us to recalibrate some of our plans. AIG is more resilient than it has ever been with strong leadership and greater portfolio and risk management across the organization. We are confident in our ability to weather this storm and look forward to being able to engage with you again in person, hopefully, in the near term. With that, I will turn it back to Brian. Thank you, Brian, and I will do that as well. With regards to debt, yes, we've spoken to the rating agencies. In fact, we were in conversation with them on the revolver drawdown, as a matter of fact, and had very good strong and supportive conversations with them. And in the future, we may contemplate, of course, we be involve in discussions with them as well. With that, I will turn it over to Doug to talk about this to investment questions."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to AIG's Fourth Quarter 2021 Financial Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.\n At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead. \nQuentin McMillan: Thank you very much, Katie. Today's remarks may contain forward-looking statements, including comments relating to company performance, strategic priorities, including AIG's pursuit of a separation of its Life and Retirement business, business mix and market conditions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. Actual performance and events may differ materially. Factors that could cause results to differ include the factors described in our third quarter 2021 report on Form 10-Q and our 2020 annual report on Form 10-K and other recent filings made with the SEC. AIG is under -- is not under any obligation and expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n Additionally, some remarks may refer to non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at www.aig.com.\n With that, I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO of AIG, Peter Zaffino. \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Following my prepared remarks, Mark will provide more detail on our financial results and other relevant updates to close out 2021. Shane Fitzsimons, who became AIG's CFO on January 1, will be available for Q&A, along with David McElroy and Kevin Hogan.\n Today, I will cover 4 topics: First, an overview of General Insurance's fourth quarter and full year performance, where we continue to drive meaningful underwriting profitability improvement. I will also briefly touch on the 1/1 reinsurance renewal season. Second, I will review results from our Life and Retirement business, which continues to be a meaningful contributor to our overall results. Third, I will provide an update on our progress towards an IPO of Life and Retirement and operational separation of the business from AIG. And fourth, I will review our current plans regarding capital management.\n Before turning to those topics, I want to take a few minutes to highlight some noteworthy achievements in 2021, which were significant for AIG. 2021 was a pivotal year and one in which our team executed on several strategic priorities. As you saw in our earnings release, adjusted after-tax income in 2021 was $5.12 per diluted share, representing a substantial increase of more than 100% year-over-year. We produced strong liquidity throughout 2021, which provided flexibility and allowed us to return $3.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We also repurchased $4 billion of debt, which reduced our debt leverage by 380 basis points to 24.6%. Notwithstanding these actions, we ended 2021 with $10.7 billion in parent liquidity.\n As I said on prior calls, the path we've taken to improve AIG and our portfolio in General Insurance, in particular, with a significant undertaking. In General Insurance, given the portfolio we started with in 2018, we needed to make fundamental changes. We quickly overhauled our underwriting standards and developed a culture of underwriting excellence, including significantly reducing gross limits.\n To give you a sense for the magnitude of what we needed to do, we reduced gross limits by over $1 trillion in our Property, Specialty and Casualty businesses. In addition, we took a conservative approach to volatility by reducing net limits and exposure through strategic implementation of reinsurance. As a result of this strategy, since 2018 and through 2021, we've been able to grow net premiums written in Commercial by over $3 billion, while ceding an additional $2 billion of reinsurance premium to further reduce volatility and protect the balance sheet. At the same time, we improved the combined ratio, excluding CATs, by 1,000 basis points. Simply put, today, we have a different portfolio with a markedly different risk profile, which we believe is significantly stronger by all measures.\n Turning to Life Retirement. We again had solid and consistent results throughout 2021, benefiting from product diversity within the business. Return on adjusted segment common equity was 14.2% for the full year. Throughout 2021, we also made tremendous progress on the separation of Life Retirement from AIG. We're executing on multiple work streams to operationally separate the business, and we closed on the sale of 9.9% equity stake and transferred $50 billion of assets under management to Blackstone.\n Additionally, we achieved significant milestones at AIG 200 and remain on track to deliver $1 billion in run rate savings by the end of 2022 against the spend of $1.3 billion. I could not be prouder of what the team has accomplished. While we still have plenty of work ahead of us, it would be remiss of me not to recognize these accomplishments and the significant momentum we have heading into 2022.\n Now let me turn to our business results in General Insurance for the fourth quarter of 2021. Mark is going to go into more detail, but we had a terrific quarter to close out the year. In the fourth quarter, General Insurance net premiums written increased 8% overall on an FX-adjusted basis with another strong quarter of 13% growth in Commercial, which was tempered somewhat by a slight contraction in Personal with a 1% reduction in net premiums written. The growth in Commercial lines was balanced with 11% in North America and 16% in International.\n Personal Lines' net premium growth contracted by 1% in the quarter due to a 5% reduction in International, driven by our repositioning of the Personal Property portfolio in Japan, offset by 17% growth in North America, which largely reflects less year-over-year ceded reinsurance.\n Looking at fourth quarter profitability. I'm very pleased with the accident year combined ratio ex CATs, which improved 310 basis points year-over-year to 89.8%, the first sub-90% quarterly result since the financial crisis. This improvement was driven by Commercial, which achieved an accident year combined ratio ex CATs of 87.9%, a 380 basis point improvement year-over-year and the third consecutive quarter below 90%. Personal reported 130 basis points of improvement in the accident year combined ratio ex CATs to 94.3%.\n Pivoting to the full year 2021. We made enormous progress in improving the quality of the underwriting portfolio and driving growth throughout the year. Net premiums written grew 11% on an FX-adjusted basis, driven by Global Commercial growth of 16%. Growth in Commercial was particularly strong in both North America at 18% and International at 13%. We had very strong retention in our in-force portfolio with North America improving by 300 basis points and International improving by 500 basis points for the full year. Gross new business in Global Commercial grew 27% year-over-year to over $4 billion with 24% growth in International and 30% in North America.\n Turning to rate. Overall, Global Commercial saw increases of 13%, and strong momentum continued in many lines. In Global Personal, we had some growth challenges in this segment, but Accident & Health performed very well, and overall, we had a solid year with net premiums written up 1% on an FX-adjusted basis. These results also reflect less reinsurance cessions in our high net worth business and some growth in Warranty.\n Turning to underwriting profitability for full year 2021. General Insurance's accident year combined ratio ex CATs was 91%, an improvement of 310 basis points year-over-year. The full year saw 140 basis point improvement in the accident year loss ratio ex CATs and 170 basis point improvement in the expense ratio, split evenly between the GOE ratio and the acquisition ratio. These positive results were driven by our improved portfolio mix, net earned premium growth, achieving rate in excess of loss cost trends, continued expense discipline and the benefits we are receiving from AIG 200.\n Global Commercial achieved an impressive accident year combined ratio ex CATs of 89.1%, an improvement of 410 basis points year-over-year. The accident year combined ratio ex CATs for North America Commercial and International Commercial were 91% and 86.7%, which reflected improvements of 450 basis points and 340 basis points, respectively.\n In Global Personal, the accident year combined ratio ex CATs was 94.9%, an improvement of 120 basis points year-over-year, driven by improvement in the expense ratio. These notable combined ratio improvements across General Insurance reflected improved higher-quality Global portfolio, driven by the strategic underwriting actions and strong execution, which have enabled us to shift our focus towards accelerating profitable growth in areas of the market where we see attractive opportunities. We are very pleased with these materially improved results, which provide tangible evidence of our successful underwriting strategy and the significant progress we have made.\n Turning to January 1 renewals with respect to our ceded reinsurance. We were very pleased with the outcome of our reinsurance placements. While the markets presented significant challenges across the industry with retrocessional limited along with other capacity issues, our reinsurance partners recognize the strength of our improved underwriting portfolio and reduced aggregation exposure, which translated to many improvements in our reinsurance structures along with better terms and conditions. It's important to keep in mind that we placed over 35 treaties at 1/1 with over 65 discrete layers and over $12 billion of limit placed and we cede over $3 billion of premium in the market.\n As you can imagine, we're not an index of market pricing because of the significant improvement in the portfolio along with the size and complexity of our placements. We continue to maintain very strong relationships with our reinsurance partners, and the support we receive in the marketplace is evident in the quality of the overall reinsurance program. We continue to make meaningful improvements to our core placements in every major treaty on January 1, and as a result, continue to reduce volatility in our portfolio.\n While there's too much detail to cover on this call, I want to provide a few key highlights on our placements. For our Property CAT treaty, we improved the per occurrence structure and improved our aggregate structure for our Global Commercial businesses. For the North America per occurrence Property CAT treaty, we lowered our attachment point to $250 million for all perils, which is a reduction from our core 2021 program that had staggered attachment points depending on peril, that range from $200 million to $500 million. And we maintained our per occurrence attachment points in International, which are $200 million for Japan and $100 million for the rest of the world.\n For our Global shared limit aggregate cover, we were able to reduce our attachment point in every region across the world, most notably, $100 million reduction in the attachment point in North America. Our Global shared limit, each and every deductible remain the same or reduced in every global region, most notably $25 million reduction in North America-named storms.\n Our attachment point return periods are the same or lower in every region across the world when compared to our 2021 core reinsurance program, and our exhaustion period returns are higher in every instance across the world on an OEP and AEP basis. And we achieved these significant improvements while modestly reducing the total aggregate reinsurance CAT spend.\n On our core Casualty treaty, we reduced our net limits on our excess to loss treaty in both North America and International. On our proportional core North America placement, we maintained the same session amount while improving our ceding commission by 400 basis points, which represents an 800 basis point improvement over the last 24 months, reflecting our significantly improved underwriting and recognition from the reinsurance market. Lastly, we renewed our cyber structure at 1/1 with additional quota share cede increasing from 60% to 70% and the aggregate placement attaching at 85% versus a 90% loss ratio.\n Given the tight terms and conditions and discipline in our portfolio along with significant rate increase we achieved during the year, we were able to secure more quota share authorization, which is a great example of the reinsurance market's flight to quality.\n As we discussed on last earnings call, we've spent considerable time through AIG research and our Chief Underwriting Office analyzing the impact of climate change and the increased frequency and severity of natural catastrophes. A few observations about 2021.\n It was the sixth warmest year on record since NOAA began tracking global temperatures in 1880. Hurricane Ida estimated at $36 billion of insured loss was the third largest hurricane on record. In North America, $17 billion of winter weather losses was the largest on record for this peril. And $13 billion of insured loss for European flooding was the costliest disaster on record for the continent.\n While we've been working over the past few years to reposition our portfolio to limit exposure and dampen volatility, changing weather patterns and increased density of risk in peak zones have caused stress on aggregation and have hampered the ability of property underwriters to make appropriate risk-adjusted returns on capital deployed. These changes have caused us to look deeper into the exposures we are underwriting in several lines of business.\n An example of a business that needs further attention and strategic repositioning is our high net worth property portfolio within our Personal Insurance segment. By the nature of the business, it's exposed to peak zones and is susceptible to increased frequency and severity. This reality together with secondary perils that have become primary perils in the underwriting and modeling process as well as secondary perils and modeling have all driven up loss costs, creating a significant issue that needs to be addressed.\n When analyzing the portfolio over the last 5 years, we've seen catastrophe levels that are 10x the level the portfolio dealt with in the prior 10 years for losses in excess of $50 million. The inability to reflect emerging risk factors, the effects of changes to modeling, increased loss costs from CATs has put the profitability of the business under pressure. In addition, when you consider the increased exposure in most peak zones in the United States over the last few years, with significantly increased total insured values, in some cases, greater than 100%, more density, supply chain issues, reinsurance availability and increased reinsurance costs and all this with heightened complexity the pandemic has caused along with the impact of demand surge post-CATs, not being tested, the business model simply needs to change.\n Recognizing these realities after careful review, we decided to take meaningful steps to address this risk issue in our high net worth business, which will allow us to continue to offer comprehensive solutions to our clients that are more consistent and sustainable. Aggregation and profitability challenges led us to the conclusion that we have to offer the property homeowners product as an example through excess and surplus lines on a nonadmitted basis in multiple states.\n For example, in December, we announced that we would no longer be offering admitted personal property homeowners policies in the state of California. We cannot maintain our current level of aggregation in the state nor have we been able to achieve any profitability from this line of business. Being a prudent steward of capital, these actions will enable us to segment the portfolio, achieve an acceptable return, reduce volatility and offer clients more comprehensive policy wordings and service.\n Now turning to Life Retirement. Full year results were driven by improved equity markets, strong alternative investment income, higher interest rates, higher call and tender income and higher fee income, partially offset by elevated mortality and base spread compression across products. Adjusted pretax income in the fourth quarter and full year was $969 million and $3.9 billion, respectively. The full year growth of 11% was driven by strong alternative investment and fee income. Full year sales were strong with premiums and deposits increasing 15% year-over-year to $31.3 billion.\n Sales within our Individual Retirement segment grew 34% across our 3 product lines for the year. Assets under management were $323 billion, and assets under administration increased to $86 billion, benefiting both from strong sales activities and favorable economic conditions.\n We also made excellent progress with Blackstone in the fourth quarter, completing the initial $50 billion asset transfer, incorporating them into our asset liability management process, finalizing the investment guidelines and developing initial product offerings based on Blackstone's origination platform.\n Lastly, having analyzed our exposure to long duration target improvements or LDTI accounting, based on the current interest rate and macro environment, we expect the transition impact of LDTI is well within Life Retirement's current balance of AOCI. Mark will provide more detail on this topic in his remarks.\n Turning to the separation and IPO of Life Retirement. In addition to closing Blackstone transactions, we also continue to make significant progress on operationally separating Life Retirement from AIG, both with respect to what can be done by the IPO and longer term to transition service agreements. We are applying the same rigor and discipline to our separation work streams as we have with our AIG 200 Transformation Program, but with a clear focus on speed to execution. We continue to work towards an IPO in the second quarter of this year, subject to regulatory approvals and market conditions.\n As I mentioned on our last call, due to the sale of our affordable housing portfolio in the fourth quarter and the execution of certain tax strategies, we are not constrained in terms of how much of Life Retirement we can sell in an IPO. Having said that, the size of the IPO will be dependent on market conditions. We continue to expect to retain a greater than 50% interest immediately following the IPO and to continue to consolidate Life Retirement's financial statements at least until such time as we fall below the 50% ownership threshold.\n Finally, turning to capital management. We've been giving significant thought to both Life Retirement as a stand-alone business and AIG as we continue the path to separation. With respect to Life and Retirement, our goal remains to achieve a successful IPO of a business with a capital structure that is consistent with its industry peers. Life and Retirement has a strong balance sheet and limited exposure to legacy liabilities, and its insurance operations have a history of strong cash flow generation. We expect that over time, this business will sustain a payout ratio to shareholders of 60% to 65% between dividends and share repurchases on a full calendar year basis.\n We also expect that post IPO, Life and Retirement will pay an annual dividend in the range of $400 million to $600 million, which equates to roughly a 2% to 3% yield on book value. Additionally, as part of the separation process, in the fourth quarter of 2021, Life and Retirement declared a dividend payable to AIG in the amount of $8.3 billion, which will be funded by Life and Retirement debt issuances and paid prior to the IPO. Our expectation is that a vast majority of this dividend payment will be used to reduce debt at AIG, and therefore, the overall amount of debt across our consolidated company will remain relatively constant at the time of the Life Retirement IPO. Post deconsolidation, we expect Life Retirement to maintain a leverage ratio in the high 20s with AIG maintaining a leverage ratio in the low 20s.\n Regarding our current capital management plan for AIG, ending 2021 with $10.7 billion in parent liquidity provides us with a significant amount of flexibility. Our capital management philosophy will continue to be balanced to maintain appropriate levels of debt and to return capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, while also allowing for investment in growth opportunities across our Global portfolio. This will also be true post IPO and over time as we continue to sell down our stake in Life Retirement.\n With respect to share buybacks, we have $3.9 billion remaining under our current authorization and expect to complete this amount in 2022, weighted more towards the first half of this year. We do not expect the Life Retirement IPO to impact AIG's dividend and expect to maintain our current annual dividend level at $1.28 per share.\n With respect to growth opportunities, our priorities will be to allocate capital in General Insurance, where we see opportunities to grow and further improve our risk-adjusted returns. We believe there are excellent opportunities for continued growth in Global Commercial Lines, which Mark will cover in more detail in his remarks.\n As we move through 2022 and are further along with the IPO and separation of Life Retirement, we will continue to provide updates regarding capital management. As you can see, we made significant progress in 2021 and had a terrific year. 2022 will be another busy and transformational year for AIG. We started 2022 with a significant amount of momentum, and our colleagues continue to demonstrate an ability to execute on multiple fronts as we continue our journey to be a top-performing company.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark. \nMark Lyons,Executive VP & CFO: Thank you, Peter, and good morning to all. Given Peter's comments, I will head directly into the fourth quarter results. Diluted adjusted earnings per share were $1.58, representing 68% growth over the prior year. This material improvement in adjusted EPS was driven by an over 1,000 basis point reduction in the General Insurance calendar quarter combined ratio; 9% growth in net earned premiums, led by Global Commercial with 13% net earned premium growth; and an improvement in the underlying accident year combined ratio ex CATs to 89.8%. As Peter mentioned, our first sub-90% quarterly results since before the financial crisis, which also represented a 310 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter. \n Life and Retirement delivered another quarter of solid returns and remained well-positioned with a 13.7% return on adjusted segment common equity for the fourth quarter and 14.2% for the full year 2021. The strength of our operating earnings and capital actions in the quarter helped drive a near 10% adjusted annualized ROE and growth in adjusted tangible book value per share of nearly $7, which represents a sequential increase of 12% and a full year increase of 23%. We fulfilled our capital management commitments and finished the year with a GAAP leverage ratio of 24.6%, a reduction of 150 basis points in the quarter and 380 basis points over the course of the year, which is another milestone, as we stated our goal was to be at or under 25% on this important metric. This improvement was driven by approximately $4 billion of debt and hybrid retirement along with $2.6 billion of share repurchases, nearly $2.1 billion of which occurred in the second half of 2021, which was slightly above our guidance.\n Moving to General Insurance. I will provide some color in areas which Peter did not touch upon in his opening remarks. Catastrophe losses of $189 million were significantly lower this quarter compared to $545 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter's main drivers were the Midwest tornadoes and the Colorado wildfire. Prior year development was $44 million favorable in the fourth quarter compared to unfavorable development of $45 million in the prior year quarter. As usual, there was net favorable amortization from the ADC, which was $45 million this quarter. So PYD was essentially flat without this amortization. On a full year basis, net favorable development amounted to $201 million relative to [ $43 billion ] in net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. In 2020, we released $76 million of net favorable development.\n Shifting to premium growth. Overall Global Commercial Insurance net premiums grew 13% on a reported and constant dollar basis for the quarter, and growth in North America commercial was 11%, driven by Casualty, which increased 50%; Lexington, which increased 14%; and Financial Lines, which increased over 10%. In International Commercial, growth was 16% on an FX-adjusted basis. And by line of business, Global Specialty, which is booked in International, grew over 25%. Talbot had 20% growth, and Property grew by 13%. Overall growth in the fourth quarter was driven by strong incremental rate improvement, higher renewal retentions and strong new business volumes.\n Commercial retention improved by 300 basis points year-over-year in North America to 80% and by 400 basis points in International to 86% in the period. This increase in wholesale business in North America Commercial brings with it lower channel retention ratios in addition to purposefully lower retentions in cyber and private D&O. Excluding these items, the retention ratios between North America and International Commercial are comparable. Commercial new business grew by 33% in the fourth quarter with 41% growth in North America and 25% growth in International.\n Turning to rate. Where overall Global Commercial Lines saw increases of 10% in the quarter, we achieved the third straight year of double-digit increases. Strong momentum continued across most lines, and we continue to achieve rate above loss cost trends. North America Commercial's overall 11% rate increases were balanced across the portfolio and led by Financial Lines, which increased by 15%; Excess Casualty, which increased by 14%; Retail Property, which was up 13%; and Lexington, which increased by 11%. International Commercial rate increases in the aggregate were 9%, driven by EMEA, which increased by 18%; the U.K., which increased by 12%; Financial Lines, which increased 18%; and Energy, which was up 11%, which is also its 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit rate increases.\n Shifting now to a calendar year combined ratio comparison. General Insurance produced a 95.8% combined ratio for 2021, an improvement of 850 basis points over 2020 and nearly 1,600 basis points better from 2018's 111.4% calendar year combined ratio. Peeling back a bit more, the combined CAT and prior period development improvement has been 720 basis points since 2018, indicating both a material CAT exposure reduction, in line with the movement we have shown in our PMLs and a much stronger loss reserve position than 3 years ago.\n Turning to additional pricing. Rate increases continue to be favorable and outpaced loss cost trends in most areas of the portfolio. With the level of rate that we have achieved in just the last 12 months, we expect that margin expansion will continue at least through 2022 and likely into accident year 2023. Getting more specific for illustrative purposes, we have communicated written rate changes during prior earnings calls and will continue to do so. However, since earned rate changes more directly impact reported results and given recent discussions around the inflation component of loss cost trend, I thought I'd go over a few areas on an earned rate basis for full year 2021.\n In North America Commercial, for example, Excess Casualty business that focuses on our national and corporate accounts has achieved an approximate earned rate increase approaching 40% in 2021 over 2020's earned rate level, as has cyber. D&O and nonadmitted Casualty achieved earned rate increases in the mid-20s. And importantly, retail and wholesale property achieved earned rate increases during 2021 in the low 20s. This is noteworthy because Property is getting most of the inflation attention, and yet the level of earned rate that was achieved is, in my view, still materially ahead of property and loss cost trend. And the same could be said for both Excess Casualty and D&O.\n Recent Property written rate increases are still in the low teens, and looking into policy year 2022 should keep them above loss trend even with an inflationary spike. Property pricing needs to remain firm to cover these increased costs of labor, materials and transportation.\n Turning to International Commercial. Similar to North America, there are large areas of material earned rate increases for full year 2021. International Financial Lines achieved a 23% earned rate increase over 2020's earned rate level. The International property book achieved an 18% earned rate increase, and the Energy book achieved earned rate increases in the mid-20s.\n Let's now step back and look at the last 3 years of cumulative written rate increases achieved at a high level during 2019 through 2021. North America Commercial across all lines of business had a 47% cumulative written rate increase, and International Commercial's cumulative written rate increase during that same time period was 40%. These measures, although they don't take into account improved terms and conditions and other difficult-to-track impact, indicate, on their own, a significant ingredient of margin improvement as evidenced by the material reduction in our reported accident year results.\n As we think about moving forward into calendar year 2022 and 2023, we need to be cognizant about the absolute, significantly favorable impact on combined ratios over the last 3 years and realize that most lines of business are well into the green. Although there are several opposite forces at work, such as economic and social inflation, my sense is that the 2022 market will continue to produce tight terms and conditions and strong pricing to sustain additional margin expansion into calendar 2023.\n As we think about 2022, major areas of growth for North America would be Accident & Health as the economy is expected to begin rebounding and Lexington on a nonadmitted basis. And on the International side, we see growth in our Global Specialty operations, A&H as well and select Casualty and Financial Lines areas around the globe, whereas AIG Re sees growth mostly in casualty business. The AIG Re portfolio strategically took the opportunity to further derisk and rebalance the portfolio away from property CAT due to our view of a less-than-adequate returns in that space and expanded further into Casualty and Specialty Lines and expects to continue that trend. Furthermore, limits deployed in U.S. property were down about 10%, and the retrocessional program provided $1 billion of protection with peak U.S. zone PML down meaningfully across most points in the return period curve.\n Moving to Life and Retirement. Premiums and deposits grew 19% in the fourth quarter, excluding Retail Mutual funds, relative to the comparable quarter last year. Growth was driven by Individual Retirement and $2.1 billion of pension risk transfer activity. APTI for the quarter was $969 million, down 6%, driven primarily by lower net investment income and unfavorable COVID-19 base mortality, although non-COVID-19 mortality returned to being better than pricing expectations.\n On a full year basis, APTI increased to $3.9 billion, reflecting higher net investment income and fee income, partially offset by adverse mortality. Our investment portfolio and hedging program continued to perform extremely well for both the quarter and the year. Composite base spreads across Individual and Group Retirement along with institutional markets compressed 12 basis points during 2021 within the sensitivity guidance we've previously provided.\n Within Individual Retirement, Index Annuities continued to be the net flows growth engine with $880 million of positive net flows for the quarter and $4.1 billion of the full year. APTI was essentially flat for full year 2021 over full year 2020, but premiums and deposits were up 34% and AUM was up 2% year-over-year to $159 billion. Group Retirement had APTI of $314 million for the fourth quarter, virtually flat with last year's comparable quarter, but was up 27% on a full year basis, with premium and deposits up roughly 4% and assets under administration up over 7.5% on a full year basis to $140 billion.\n Life Insurance APTI was a negative $8 million in the fourth quarter, but had a gain of $106 million for the full year. Premiums and deposits grew 4% from fourth quarter of 2020 and over 5% for the full year to $4.7 billion. Additionally, total insurance in-force grew to $1.2 trillion, representing over 3% growth.\n Our COVID-19-related mortality exposure sensitivity of $65 million to $75 million pretax per 100,000 U.S. population deaths was in line based on the externally reported fourth quarter COVID-related population deaths in the U.S. Institutional Markets grew premiums and deposits by 74% relative to last year's comparable quarter, primarily due to the significant pension risk transfer sales.\n Moving to other operations. The adjusted pretax loss before consolidation and eliminations was $178 million, a $250 million improvement versus the prior year quarter, with the primary drivers being higher net investment income of $237 million; a lower corporate interest expense on financial debt of $51 million, resulting from our debt redemption activities; partially offset by higher corporate GOE of $12 million, which include increases in performance-based compensation.\n Heading to Peter's comment about AIG 200. $810 million of run rate savings are already executed or contracted towards the $1 billion run rate in savings objective with approximately $540 million recognized to date in our income statement and $645 million of the $1.3 billion cost to achieve having been spent to date.\n Shifting to investments. Total cash and investments were $361 billion, and fourth quarter net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.3 billion, which was essentially the same both sequentially and year-over-year and was aided by higher alternative investment income, particularly within private equity. NII for the full year of $12.9 billion was up over $600 million from 2020. Private equity returns were nearly 32% for the full year, up from approximately 10% last year. Hedge funds returned approximately 14% each year, and mortgage loan returns were stable at 4.2%.\n We ended the year with our primary operating subsidiaries being profitable and well-capitalized with General Insurance's U.S. pool fleet risk-based capital ratio for the fourth quarter estimated to be between 460% and 470%, and the Life and Retirement [ yields ] is estimated to be between 440% and 450%, both well above the upper bound of our target operating ranges. With respect to share count, our average total diluted shares outstanding in the fourth quarter were 847 million, a reduction of 2% as we repurchased approximately 17 million shares in the quarter. The end-of-period outstanding shares for book value per share purposes was approximately 819 million at year-end 2021.\n Now I'd like to address the forthcoming LDTI accounting changes affecting our Life and Retirement business. First, this is a GAAP-only accounting standard, and there should not be impacts to cash flow or statutory results. As this continues to be a work in progress for us and the industry at large, I'd like to provide a range towards the transitional balance impact at January 1, 2021, as being between $1 billion and $3 billion decrease to shareholders' equity with our current point estimate being towards the lower end of this range. This decrease represents a netting between an increase to retained earnings and a decrease to AOCI. Once again, Life and Retirement's breadth of product offerings provides value as the LDTI impact of old traditional products covered by FAS 60 involving mortality are roughly offset by the elimination of historical AOCI adjustment associated with certain longevity products.\n Also, current GAAP accounting for living benefits is at fair value, and changes go through the income statement, whereas under LDTI, a portion of that charge will be recorded in AOCI, pertaining to the company's own credit spreads, which, for that piece, will help to dampen some volatility. But mortality benefits will now also be at fair value and will act as an offset to take volatility in the other direction within the GAAP income statement.\n Turning now to the recent S&P capital model changes. The deadline to respond has been extended to March of 2022, and S&P will presumably conclude shortly thereafter. Both the property, casualty and the life retirement insurance industries will likely see higher capital charges for innate insurance exposures as well as for asset credit and asset market risks. Additionally, reduced benefits of holding company cash liquidity and lower levels of accessible debt leverage is an indicated outcome, but all with material offsets due to increased diversification benefits. We have spent considerable time on the analysis of this proposal so far, but it is probably premature to make any predictions at this point before S&P and the industry have had more time to land upon the exact details of the final framework.\n Now in conclusion, by virtually all measures, growth, profitability, returns, margin expansion, adjusted book, adjusted tangible book value, debt leverage reduction, EPS, adjusted pre- and after-tax income and net income all point to an outstanding year for AIG. When you also factor in our global platform, our marketplace actions and impact, the strength of our loss reserves, a robust reinsurance program and massive portfolio reconstruction, AIG is exceedingly well-positioned as we look to the separation of L&R, completing AIG 200, maintaining our path towards increasing profitable growth and for whatever else the future holds.\n With that, I will turn the call back over to Peter. \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: Great. Thank you, Mark. Operator, we're ready for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. \nElyse Greenspan: My first question, given that you guys have just under $11 billion of capital at the parent, your debt to capital is also below 25%, and you have the Life and Retirement IPO coming, shouldn't you be able to buy back more than $3.9 billion this year? Or is the $3.9 billion, Peter, that you mentioned remaining under the authorization, is that a floor? And could you come back later after the IPO and update that figure? \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: Thanks, Elyse, for the question. Yes, that's really what we tried to outline in terms of the capital management, is the $10.7 billion, what's in front of us in terms of we see great growth opportunities in the business. And I think that the results and how much they're improving are evidence of that, maintaining the right leverage, committing to the dividend and then talking through the current share authorization and not speculating on the amount or timing of the IPO beyond the guidance that we've already provided. So as we do the IPO, we will continue to refresh that sort of capital management and sort of accelerate what we can do with capital above what we have for liquidity today. \nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then my second question is on that sub-90% underlying margin target in General Insurance. You guys came in at 91% for 2021 for the full year. Given your comments that earned rate should exceed loss trend this year and you still have some AIG 200 expense saves coming in, should we think about seeing improvement in both the loss and the expense ratio in '22? And then also, would you expect to be at that sub-90% during every quarter of 2022? \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: Thanks, Elyse. I'll have Mark add to my comments. But we gave you full year guidance. I think Mark gave tremendous detail in his prepared remarks in terms of the earned premium, the improvements that we've made. And again, when you look at the quality in terms of how we're growing with strong top line, strong retention, strong new business, strong rate, developing margin above loss cost, in addition, AIG 200, as you mentioned, earning in is going to give us an expense benefit.\n The one thing I do want to note that in the expense benefit, we've been investing against that in terms of bringing more underwriters in for growth, particularly in A&H, where we see great opportunities. We're building an operational muscle within AIG in terms of adding high-qualified people that have backgrounds in data, digital, digital workflow. So while we're recognizing the benefits from AIG 200, we're also investing to be able to continue to perpetuate this very strong performance.\n Mark, do you want to comment a little bit in terms of the -- I don't think we give quarterly guidance, but how you think about next year in a little bit more detail? \nMark Lyons,Executive VP & CFO: Yes, happy to, Peter. Thank you. So with respect to your quarterly question, I mean, the Insurance business, we take out a lot of different risks. We have the big portfolio, so you get some smoothing. But quarter-by-quarter, you never really know that. And as Dave McElroy and Peter have said in the past, every quarter has a different underlying mix to it. So we would certainly expect improvement, but I wouldn't be surprised if 1 quarter went off or something. But the year, we certainly expect continued improvement. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Meyer Shields with KBW. \nMeyer Shields: Let me start with a question for Mark, if I can. It's going to be a little sort of detailed. But in the supplement, you disclosed $676 million of alternative investments that are above expectations. And then there's, I want to say, $476 million of consolidation offset. And I'm wondering if you could talk about the relationship between those 2? And what sort of rule of thumb we should apply to the outperformance that goes out on the consolidation side? \nMark Lyons,Executive VP & CFO: Well -- sorry. \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: Go ahead, Mark. \nMark Lyons,Executive VP & CFO: So thank you for the question, Meyer. What you'll always see is the -- and basically, what you see in other operations, which always gets a little confusing, granted, is that the investment income in the subs would be double counted otherwise. So what you see as you go through that is that the elimination of that overlap, firstly.\n Secondly, on the alternatives, I kind of highlighted for you what some of the returns have been on that over the last couple of years, which we certainly wouldn't count on really on a go-forward basis, you don't plan on that level. We're happy to have it, but we wouldn't really contemplate that on a strict go-forward basis. \nMeyer Shields: Okay. And the second question, maybe a little bit less obscure. You mentioned the decrease in PMLs historically. How do things look, whether it's PML or AAL? How do you use 2022 based on both inward network reinsurance? \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: Well, let me start, and then Dave, maybe you can just add a little bit of commentary on how we're thinking about the property book. But as I said in my prepared remarks, we were very conservative in terms of how we've been shedding gross limit. This is on the sort of AIG, non-AIG Re side. And we've been very conservative on growth and also we've reduced our nets, I mean. So when I was trying to outline in the reinsurance that we're taking less volatility going forward, just because of all the different factors of what we've been doing on the underwriting side and also to continue to advance and evolve our comprehensive reinsurance program.\n Before turning it over to Dave, I will comment on AIG Re. We significantly reduced our aggregates in peak zones at 1/1, didn't think the risk-adjusted returns were there. As Mark alluded to, we lowered in the majority of our return periods in the frequency, severity and tail; significantly reduced our net PMLs and have a lot of ability depending on what happens in the market in the future to be able to be responsive. But we were not going to be an index in the market. And I think we were very conservative at the AIG Re level in terms of that deployment. Dave, do you want to add a couple of comments on property? David, you're on mute. \nDavid McElroy: Yes, it's very important to understand the reunderwriting that was done in the Property book. And not only the limits that were taken out, of the $1 trillion, about $600 billion of that was Property around the world. So -- and it really did rearchitect completely different businesses with Lexington becoming more of an E&S carrier. 80 -- 90% of our limits now are less than $10 million, okay? And we let Retail Property play, and they started to do shared and layered. They weren't competing anymore with $2 billion limit. So the whole PML and AAL has come down dramatically, okay? And that's obviously influenced how we buy our [ reinsurances ]. \n We are reflecting the fact that there is a higher, let's say, expected loss in inflation in the 2022 plan. So we've actually added a little bit above our AAL as a marker for our CAT load in 2022 to reflect that. I think that's just prudent business. It also reflects the fact that the -- we think we have these books from a limit management standpoint, from an exposure standpoint controlled, but we need to be conservative. We need to think of it that way. So -- and that actually extends to the Global franchise, too. There was a massive amount of limits that we've taken out of that portfolio, and that feeds into the respective CAT programs that we have overseas. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. \nErik Bass: I just wanted to walk through the mechanics of the capital transfers prior to the IPO, just to make sure that I have this correct. Is the expectation that Life and Retirement will issue debt and then use the proceeds to pay the $8.3 billion dividend to the AIG Holding Company, and that will then, in turn, use that cash to retire debt? And I guess, is the takeaway that this will put you in a leverage position such that all of the net IPO proceeds will be available to shareholders or for growth investments? \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: Yes, it's a really good question, Erik. Thanks for that. Shane, maybe you can just answer Erik's question, but also just give a high level in terms of how we're thinking about the sequencing with the IPO. \nShane Fitzsimons: Yes. So Erik, you're correct. So Life and Retirement declared a dividend of $8.3 billion, which is a note receivable at parent at the moment. So Life and Retirement will go into the market and actually raise some of that debt actually pre IPO, and we're working through that at the moment. And those proceeds will then come across as a repayment on the note. And then the proceeds from that note will be used to pay down debt at parent.\n So the goal is to keep debt levels between the 2 companies more or less at the same level moving forward. And I think as Peter outlined, the goal in separation is to have [indiscernible] for the new company in the high 20s and in the -- for the -- what you would know going forward is kind of parent plus General Insurance in the low 20s, is kind of the way that this will evolve. \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: Yes. Thanks, Shane. And Erik, you're right, like we're going to have more flexibility as the proceeds of the IPO become available, but we're trying to be very prudent in terms of the capital management leading up to that. \nErik Bass: Got it. And then I believe that you transferred the ownership of the asset management business to Life and Retirement at the end of the year? \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: Yes. \nErik Bass: Can you just help us think about the impact of this change on go-forward results for both L&R and other ops? \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: Well, this is a process that we've outlined as part of the separation. So there's a variety of steps in terms of sequencing that. One is that we transfer the investment management group to Life and Retirement as part of the separation. We've been operationally taken assets under management as we put in the prepared remarks and have been very open and transparent about Blackstone. So that was a transfer.\n We have a sort of target operating model that we're working through with Life and Retirement and with the remaining AIG in terms of the pace in which we will make those changes. But we're going to optimize that structure to make sure that it's in the range of what the sort of AUM basis point fee was in terms of our internal management with using an outsourcing model. So we'll continue to give you more and more guidance, but you should know that like in sequential steps, we want to get the transfer for -- into Life Retirement, then Blackstone and then how we optimize the target operating model to make sure there's not headwinds for Life Retirement in the future. \nOperator: We'll go next to Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. \nTaylor Scott: First thing I wanted to ask about is just the ROE at the remaining company. It seems like you provided some helpful guidance on Life and Retirement, what the cash flows could look like. It seems like maybe some of that's getting honed in a bit. And I know you probably can't give specifics so much, but could you give us a feel for what kind of ROE we'll be looking at sort of post separation as we have some stranded costs and things like that to deal with versus maybe where you would expect to run a company with these businesses at the remaining company more long term? \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: Sure, Alex. Thanks for the question. Again, we have so much going on that there is, I keep using the word sequencing because we want to make sure that we're doing the underwriting turnaround and all the things that we outlined through the scripts in the right sequence and making sure that we are getting things put behind us.\n We do have a path to a 10% ROE. I can't really give you a specific time frame because you can appreciate, we have so many moving pieces at the moment. Many of them we addressed in the scripts, but there's some that we can't address until we know further in terms of what are the IPO proceeds and looking further at the structure of the equity.\n I'm going to ask Shane to comment a little bit more. I mean -- but we know that we have to get expenses and rationalized in the company. But again, those priorities are going to be, we got to focus on making sure that we're driving the underwriting. We have great opportunities as a global leader in the industry, and we want to make sure that we're solving risk issues and capitalizing on all the opportunities present themselves.\n We want to finish AIG 200, which is going to give some of that expense benefit in terms of driving the ROE and get that done within the calendar year and then pivot to investment on digital. The operational separation of Life Retirement is incredibly important. We've been working with Kevin and the leadership team of getting that set up. So we want to continue to drive that forward, and then we have to execute on the IPO.\n So once that is largely complete, we know that the parent and what it is today called General Insurance, we have to combine the 2, and we will rationalize that operating model, not only driving profitability improvement but expense improvement, and that will drive the path in terms of achieving that ROE.\n Shane, I know I probably gobbled up a lot of the details, but is there anything else you'd like to add? \nShane Fitzsimons: Yes. I mean, Peter, I think the only other thing I would really add is that we also made significant progress here in 2021 with a combination of buyback and getting share. Our leverage down below 25% is a significant highlight. Peter talked about what we have to do in terms of finalizing the remaining equity as part of an efficient capital structure for Remain Co, including post-separation leverage in the low 20s and what capital is needed in the insurance subsidiaries to support accretive organic growth and return to share owners.\n And I think Peter mentioned as well, we have improved expense ratios, but one of the key drags on our ROE is parent expenses. And we have been rightsizing this through AIG 200 in separation, but we need to do more. And I think Peter has assembled a team that has spent good parts of their career in transformation, driving expense and operational efficiency programs. And we'll turn this headwind at parent into a tailwind, at least, that's -- and that will help us get to where we need to get to. And we will provide updates over time. \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: Thanks, Shane. \nTaylor Scott: That's all really helpful. And maybe a follow-up, in General Insurance, can you just comment maybe a high level around how you're balancing, driving further margin improvement from here versus prioritizing growth? And maybe if you could just comment between North America and international, if you could? \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: Yes. Let me just give a brief overview, and then ask Dave to comment on a little bit more specificity. One is we have a great balance across the globe in terms of International and North America. We've been driving top line growth, but the underwriting culture that we've developed is all about profitability. And so making sure that we continue to drive that profitability on a combined ratio, it's sustainable, but the areas in where we think we really drive significant value, there's multiple.\n Mark mentioned some of the product lines. It's not a couple, it's many, and it's across many geographies. And our underwriting leadership capacity and ability to structure programs is going to be something that we think is sustainable, but we won't be sacrificing margin and bottom line for top line.\n Dave, anything you want to add in terms of some of the specific areas where you're really looking to grow? Dave, you're on mute. \nDavid McElroy: Thank you. You can hear me? \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: Yes. \nDavid McElroy: Yes. I think we don't want to front-run 2022, but a lot of the work that we've done over the last 3 years really -- and it manifests itself in 2021. You could see we are growing. You can see the numbers that we put forth on the accident year as well as combined year. And those books form our future. So I've spoken to a momentum business, but we now look at those books of business that we've rearchitected, okay, and it gave us a lot of room to do that, and you saw the pivot to growth. But those are now a well-formed books that we think we can grow off of.\n If you think about renewal retention, when you think about rate on that book and when you think about new business on that book, we are optimistic around that forming a foundation for growth into 2022 and 2023. And renewal retention is a momentum business, okay? We've been adding a couple of hundred bps to each renewal retention each year. We think that there's opportunity there because we like the book. It's a better price book into 2022.\n Rates. You've heard some of the rhetoric. We believe that rates will continue to trend above expected loss costs with an inflation buffer in there. We saw in the fourth quarter where there was concern and fear around Property, and Property turned back. And I call out not only to ourselves but to everybody on this call, how we thought there would be deceleration in 2021, but there was a respect in the industry and a reflection in the industry on inflation costs, and the market is reacting rationally to that. And we think that will continue into 2022.\n And then new business, the machinery and what Peter is alluding to is we have so many franchises around the world that have, what I consider to be preferred positions, moat positions, okay? We are not trading against the comparative rater in auto. We are a specialty global company that judgment matters, underwriting matters, and we have primary positions and collateral and multinational service capabilities. These are assets that we can control and allow us to generate growth with that. So let me stop there for a change. \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: Thank you, David. That's excellent. Thank you, everyone, for being here today. Before we end the call, I do want to take a minute to thank Mark for all the terrific work he did as a CFO over the last few years. In addition to leading the finance team, Mark has been a critical member of the executive team that transformed our GI portfolio, helped us achieve a great result, and we were able to talk about it today. Grateful for his support, really look forward to him in his new role and the transition. So Mark, thank you for everything.\n We're really anxious to have Shane. And you saw it today. We introduced him, done a great job getting up to speed. And so that transition has been very seamless. And Shane, welcome to the CFO role. And lastly, I want to thank all of our global colleagues for their incredible dedication, great work and making AIG a market leader and a great place to work. So thank you, everyone, and have a great day. \nOperator: That will conclude today's call. We appreciate your participation.",

            "name": "Peter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Following my prepared remarks, Mark will provide more detail on our financial results and other relevant updates to close out 2021. Shane Fitzsimons, who became AIG's CFO on January 1, will be available for Q&A, along with David McElroy and Kevin Hogan.\n Today, I will cover 4 topics: First, an overview of General Insurance's fourth quarter and full year performance, where we continue to drive meaningful underwriting profitability improvement. I will also briefly touch on the 1/1 reinsurance renewal season. Second, I will review results from our Life and Retirement business, which continues to be a meaningful contributor to our overall results. Third, I will provide an update on our progress towards an IPO of Life and Retirement and operational separation of the business from AIG. And fourth, I will review our current plans regarding capital management.\n Before turning to those topics, I want to take a few minutes to highlight some noteworthy achievements in 2021, which were significant for AIG. 2021 was a pivotal year and one in which our team executed on several strategic priorities. As you saw in our earnings release, adjusted after-tax income in 2021 was $5.12 per diluted share, representing a substantial increase of more than 100% year-over-year. We produced strong liquidity throughout 2021, which provided flexibility and allowed us to return $3.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We also repurchased $4 billion of debt, which reduced our debt leverage by 380 basis points to 24.6%. Notwithstanding these actions, we ended 2021 with $10.7 billion in parent liquidity.\n As I said on prior calls, the path we've taken to improve AIG and our portfolio in General Insurance, in particular, with a significant undertaking. In General Insurance, given the portfolio we started with in 2018, we needed to make fundamental changes. We quickly overhauled our underwriting standards and developed a culture of underwriting excellence, including significantly reducing gross limits.\n To give you a sense for the magnitude of what we needed to do, we reduced gross limits by over $1 trillion in our Property, Specialty and Casualty businesses. In addition, we took a conservative approach to volatility by reducing net limits and exposure through strategic implementation of reinsurance. As a result of this strategy, since 2018 and through 2021, we've been able to grow net premiums written in Commercial by over $3 billion, while ceding an additional $2 billion of reinsurance premium to further reduce volatility and protect the balance sheet. At the same time, we improved the combined ratio, excluding CATs, by 1,000 basis points. Simply put, today, we have a different portfolio with a markedly different risk profile, which we believe is significantly stronger by all measures.\n Turning to Life Retirement. We again had solid and consistent results throughout 2021, benefiting from product diversity within the business. Return on adjusted segment common equity was 14.2% for the full year. Throughout 2021, we also made tremendous progress on the separation of Life Retirement from AIG. We're executing on multiple work streams to operationally separate the business, and we closed on the sale of 9.9% equity stake and transferred $50 billion of assets under management to Blackstone.\n Additionally, we achieved significant milestones at AIG 200 and remain on track to deliver $1 billion in run rate savings by the end of 2022 against the spend of $1.3 billion. I could not be prouder of what the team has accomplished. While we still have plenty of work ahead of us, it would be remiss of me not to recognize these accomplishments and the significant momentum we have heading into 2022.\n Now let me turn to our business results in General Insurance for the fourth quarter of 2021. Mark is going to go into more detail, but we had a terrific quarter to close out the year. In the fourth quarter, General Insurance net premiums written increased 8% overall on an FX-adjusted basis with another strong quarter of 13% growth in Commercial, which was tempered somewhat by a slight contraction in Personal with a 1% reduction in net premiums written. The growth in Commercial lines was balanced with 11% in North America and 16% in International.\n Personal Lines' net premium growth contracted by 1% in the quarter due to a 5% reduction in International, driven by our repositioning of the Personal Property portfolio in Japan, offset by 17% growth in North America, which largely reflects less year-over-year ceded reinsurance.\n Looking at fourth quarter profitability. I'm very pleased with the accident year combined ratio ex CATs, which improved 310 basis points year-over-year to 89.8%, the first sub-90% quarterly result since the financial crisis. This improvement was driven by Commercial, which achieved an accident year combined ratio ex CATs of 87.9%, a 380 basis point improvement year-over-year and the third consecutive quarter below 90%. Personal reported 130 basis points of improvement in the accident year combined ratio ex CATs to 94.3%.\n Pivoting to the full year 2021. We made enormous progress in improving the quality of the underwriting portfolio and driving growth throughout the year. Net premiums written grew 11% on an FX-adjusted basis, driven by Global Commercial growth of 16%. Growth in Commercial was particularly strong in both North America at 18% and International at 13%. We had very strong retention in our in-force portfolio with North America improving by 300 basis points and International improving by 500 basis points for the full year. Gross new business in Global Commercial grew 27% year-over-year to over $4 billion with 24% growth in International and 30% in North America.\n Turning to rate. Overall, Global Commercial saw increases of 13%, and strong momentum continued in many lines. In Global Personal, we had some growth challenges in this segment, but Accident & Health performed very well, and overall, we had a solid year with net premiums written up 1% on an FX-adjusted basis. These results also reflect less reinsurance cessions in our high net worth business and some growth in Warranty.\n Turning to underwriting profitability for full year 2021. General Insurance's accident year combined ratio ex CATs was 91%, an improvement of 310 basis points year-over-year. The full year saw 140 basis point improvement in the accident year loss ratio ex CATs and 170 basis point improvement in the expense ratio, split evenly between the GOE ratio and the acquisition ratio. These positive results were driven by our improved portfolio mix, net earned premium growth, achieving rate in excess of loss cost trends, continued expense discipline and the benefits we are receiving from AIG 200.\n Global Commercial achieved an impressive accident year combined ratio ex CATs of 89.1%, an improvement of 410 basis points year-over-year. The accident year combined ratio ex CATs for North America Commercial and International Commercial were 91% and 86.7%, which reflected improvements of 450 basis points and 340 basis points, respectively.\n In Global Personal, the accident year combined ratio ex CATs was 94.9%, an improvement of 120 basis points year-over-year, driven by improvement in the expense ratio. These notable combined ratio improvements across General Insurance reflected improved higher-quality Global portfolio, driven by the strategic underwriting actions and strong execution, which have enabled us to shift our focus towards accelerating profitable growth in areas of the market where we see attractive opportunities. We are very pleased with these materially improved results, which provide tangible evidence of our successful underwriting strategy and the significant progress we have made.\n Turning to January 1 renewals with respect to our ceded reinsurance. We were very pleased with the outcome of our reinsurance placements. While the markets presented significant challenges across the industry with retrocessional limited along with other capacity issues, our reinsurance partners recognize the strength of our improved underwriting portfolio and reduced aggregation exposure, which translated to many improvements in our reinsurance structures along with better terms and conditions. It's important to keep in mind that we placed over 35 treaties at 1/1 with over 65 discrete layers and over $12 billion of limit placed and we cede over $3 billion of premium in the market.\n As you can imagine, we're not an index of market pricing because of the significant improvement in the portfolio along with the size and complexity of our placements. We continue to maintain very strong relationships with our reinsurance partners, and the support we receive in the marketplace is evident in the quality of the overall reinsurance program. We continue to make meaningful improvements to our core placements in every major treaty on January 1, and as a result, continue to reduce volatility in our portfolio.\n While there's too much detail to cover on this call, I want to provide a few key highlights on our placements. For our Property CAT treaty, we improved the per occurrence structure and improved our aggregate structure for our Global Commercial businesses. For the North America per occurrence Property CAT treaty, we lowered our attachment point to $250 million for all perils, which is a reduction from our core 2021 program that had staggered attachment points depending on peril, that range from $200 million to $500 million. And we maintained our per occurrence attachment points in International, which are $200 million for Japan and $100 million for the rest of the world.\n For our Global shared limit aggregate cover, we were able to reduce our attachment point in every region across the world, most notably, $100 million reduction in the attachment point in North America. Our Global shared limit, each and every deductible remain the same or reduced in every global region, most notably $25 million reduction in North America-named storms.\n Our attachment point return periods are the same or lower in every region across the world when compared to our 2021 core reinsurance program, and our exhaustion period returns are higher in every instance across the world on an OEP and AEP basis. And we achieved these significant improvements while modestly reducing the total aggregate reinsurance CAT spend.\n On our core Casualty treaty, we reduced our net limits on our excess to loss treaty in both North America and International. On our proportional core North America placement, we maintained the same session amount while improving our ceding commission by 400 basis points, which represents an 800 basis point improvement over the last 24 months, reflecting our significantly improved underwriting and recognition from the reinsurance market. Lastly, we renewed our cyber structure at 1/1 with additional quota share cede increasing from 60% to 70% and the aggregate placement attaching at 85% versus a 90% loss ratio.\n Given the tight terms and conditions and discipline in our portfolio along with significant rate increase we achieved during the year, we were able to secure more quota share authorization, which is a great example of the reinsurance market's flight to quality.\n As we discussed on last earnings call, we've spent considerable time through AIG research and our Chief Underwriting Office analyzing the impact of climate change and the increased frequency and severity of natural catastrophes. A few observations about 2021.\n It was the sixth warmest year on record since NOAA began tracking global temperatures in 1880. Hurricane Ida estimated at $36 billion of insured loss was the third largest hurricane on record. In North America, $17 billion of winter weather losses was the largest on record for this peril. And $13 billion of insured loss for European flooding was the costliest disaster on record for the continent.\n While we've been working over the past few years to reposition our portfolio to limit exposure and dampen volatility, changing weather patterns and increased density of risk in peak zones have caused stress on aggregation and have hampered the ability of property underwriters to make appropriate risk-adjusted returns on capital deployed. These changes have caused us to look deeper into the exposures we are underwriting in several lines of business.\n An example of a business that needs further attention and strategic repositioning is our high net worth property portfolio within our Personal Insurance segment. By the nature of the business, it's exposed to peak zones and is susceptible to increased frequency and severity. This reality together with secondary perils that have become primary perils in the underwriting and modeling process as well as secondary perils and modeling have all driven up loss costs, creating a significant issue that needs to be addressed.\n When analyzing the portfolio over the last 5 years, we've seen catastrophe levels that are 10x the level the portfolio dealt with in the prior 10 years for losses in excess of $50 million. The inability to reflect emerging risk factors, the effects of changes to modeling, increased loss costs from CATs has put the profitability of the business under pressure. In addition, when you consider the increased exposure in most peak zones in the United States over the last few years, with significantly increased total insured values, in some cases, greater than 100%, more density, supply chain issues, reinsurance availability and increased reinsurance costs and all this with heightened complexity the pandemic has caused along with the impact of demand surge post-CATs, not being tested, the business model simply needs to change.\n Recognizing these realities after careful review, we decided to take meaningful steps to address this risk issue in our high net worth business, which will allow us to continue to offer comprehensive solutions to our clients that are more consistent and sustainable. Aggregation and profitability challenges led us to the conclusion that we have to offer the property homeowners product as an example through excess and surplus lines on a nonadmitted basis in multiple states.\n For example, in December, we announced that we would no longer be offering admitted personal property homeowners policies in the state of California. We cannot maintain our current level of aggregation in the state nor have we been able to achieve any profitability from this line of business. Being a prudent steward of capital, these actions will enable us to segment the portfolio, achieve an acceptable return, reduce volatility and offer clients more comprehensive policy wordings and service.\n Now turning to Life Retirement. Full year results were driven by improved equity markets, strong alternative investment income, higher interest rates, higher call and tender income and higher fee income, partially offset by elevated mortality and base spread compression across products. Adjusted pretax income in the fourth quarter and full year was $969 million and $3.9 billion, respectively. The full year growth of 11% was driven by strong alternative investment and fee income. Full year sales were strong with premiums and deposits increasing 15% year-over-year to $31.3 billion.\n Sales within our Individual Retirement segment grew 34% across our 3 product lines for the year. Assets under management were $323 billion, and assets under administration increased to $86 billion, benefiting both from strong sales activities and favorable economic conditions.\n We also made excellent progress with Blackstone in the fourth quarter, completing the initial $50 billion asset transfer, incorporating them into our asset liability management process, finalizing the investment guidelines and developing initial product offerings based on Blackstone's origination platform.\n Lastly, having analyzed our exposure to long duration target improvements or LDTI accounting, based on the current interest rate and macro environment, we expect the transition impact of LDTI is well within Life Retirement's current balance of AOCI. Mark will provide more detail on this topic in his remarks.\n Turning to the separation and IPO of Life Retirement. In addition to closing Blackstone transactions, we also continue to make significant progress on operationally separating Life Retirement from AIG, both with respect to what can be done by the IPO and longer term to transition service agreements. We are applying the same rigor and discipline to our separation work streams as we have with our AIG 200 Transformation Program, but with a clear focus on speed to execution. We continue to work towards an IPO in the second quarter of this year, subject to regulatory approvals and market conditions.\n As I mentioned on our last call, due to the sale of our affordable housing portfolio in the fourth quarter and the execution of certain tax strategies, we are not constrained in terms of how much of Life Retirement we can sell in an IPO. Having said that, the size of the IPO will be dependent on market conditions. We continue to expect to retain a greater than 50% interest immediately following the IPO and to continue to consolidate Life Retirement's financial statements at least until such time as we fall below the 50% ownership threshold.\n Finally, turning to capital management. We've been giving significant thought to both Life Retirement as a stand-alone business and AIG as we continue the path to separation. With respect to Life and Retirement, our goal remains to achieve a successful IPO of a business with a capital structure that is consistent with its industry peers. Life and Retirement has a strong balance sheet and limited exposure to legacy liabilities, and its insurance operations have a history of strong cash flow generation. We expect that over time, this business will sustain a payout ratio to shareholders of 60% to 65% between dividends and share repurchases on a full calendar year basis.\n We also expect that post IPO, Life and Retirement will pay an annual dividend in the range of $400 million to $600 million, which equates to roughly a 2% to 3% yield on book value. Additionally, as part of the separation process, in the fourth quarter of 2021, Life and Retirement declared a dividend payable to AIG in the amount of $8.3 billion, which will be funded by Life and Retirement debt issuances and paid prior to the IPO. Our expectation is that a vast majority of this dividend payment will be used to reduce debt at AIG, and therefore, the overall amount of debt across our consolidated company will remain relatively constant at the time of the Life Retirement IPO. Post deconsolidation, we expect Life Retirement to maintain a leverage ratio in the high 20s with AIG maintaining a leverage ratio in the low 20s.\n Regarding our current capital management plan for AIG, ending 2021 with $10.7 billion in parent liquidity provides us with a significant amount of flexibility. Our capital management philosophy will continue to be balanced to maintain appropriate levels of debt and to return capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, while also allowing for investment in growth opportunities across our Global portfolio. This will also be true post IPO and over time as we continue to sell down our stake in Life Retirement.\n With respect to share buybacks, we have $3.9 billion remaining under our current authorization and expect to complete this amount in 2022, weighted more towards the first half of this year. We do not expect the Life Retirement IPO to impact AIG's dividend and expect to maintain our current annual dividend level at $1.28 per share.\n With respect to growth opportunities, our priorities will be to allocate capital in General Insurance, where we see opportunities to grow and further improve our risk-adjusted returns. We believe there are excellent opportunities for continued growth in Global Commercial Lines, which Mark will cover in more detail in his remarks.\n As we move through 2022 and are further along with the IPO and separation of Life Retirement, we will continue to provide updates regarding capital management. As you can see, we made significant progress in 2021 and had a terrific year. 2022 will be another busy and transformational year for AIG. We started 2022 with a significant amount of momentum, and our colleagues continue to demonstrate an ability to execute on multiple fronts as we continue our journey to be a top-performing company.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark. Great. Thank you, Mark. Operator, we're ready for questions. Thanks, Elyse, for the question. Yes, that's really what we tried to outline in terms of the capital management, is the $10.7 billion, what's in front of us in terms of we see great growth opportunities in the business. And I think that the results and how much they're improving are evidence of that, maintaining the right leverage, committing to the dividend and then talking through the current share authorization and not speculating on the amount or timing of the IPO beyond the guidance that we've already provided. So as we do the IPO, we will continue to refresh that sort of capital management and sort of accelerate what we can do with capital above what we have for liquidity today. Thanks, Elyse. I'll have Mark add to my comments. But we gave you full year guidance. I think Mark gave tremendous detail in his prepared remarks in terms of the earned premium, the improvements that we've made. And again, when you look at the quality in terms of how we're growing with strong top line, strong retention, strong new business, strong rate, developing margin above loss cost, in addition, AIG 200, as you mentioned, earning in is going to give us an expense benefit.\n The one thing I do want to note that in the expense benefit, we've been investing against that in terms of bringing more underwriters in for growth, particularly in A&H, where we see great opportunities. We're building an operational muscle within AIG in terms of adding high-qualified people that have backgrounds in data, digital, digital workflow. So while we're recognizing the benefits from AIG 200, we're also investing to be able to continue to perpetuate this very strong performance.\n Mark, do you want to comment a little bit in terms of the -- I don't think we give quarterly guidance, but how you think about next year in a little bit more detail? Go ahead, Mark. Well, let me start, and then Dave, maybe you can just add a little bit of commentary on how we're thinking about the property book. But as I said in my prepared remarks, we were very conservative in terms of how we've been shedding gross limit. This is on the sort of AIG, non-AIG Re side. And we've been very conservative on growth and also we've reduced our nets, I mean. So when I was trying to outline in the reinsurance that we're taking less volatility going forward, just because of all the different factors of what we've been doing on the underwriting side and also to continue to advance and evolve our comprehensive reinsurance program.\n Before turning it over to Dave, I will comment on AIG Re. We significantly reduced our aggregates in peak zones at 1/1, didn't think the risk-adjusted returns were there. As Mark alluded to, we lowered in the majority of our return periods in the frequency, severity and tail; significantly reduced our net PMLs and have a lot of ability depending on what happens in the market in the future to be able to be responsive. But we were not going to be an index in the market. And I think we were very conservative at the AIG Re level in terms of that deployment. Dave, do you want to add a couple of comments on property? David, you're on mute. Yes, it's a really good question, Erik. Thanks for that. Shane, maybe you can just answer Erik's question, but also just give a high level in terms of how we're thinking about the sequencing with the IPO. Yes. Thanks, Shane. And Erik, you're right, like we're going to have more flexibility as the proceeds of the IPO become available, but we're trying to be very prudent in terms of the capital management leading up to that. Yes. Well, this is a process that we've outlined as part of the separation. So there's a variety of steps in terms of sequencing that. One is that we transfer the investment management group to Life and Retirement as part of the separation. We've been operationally taken assets under management as we put in the prepared remarks and have been very open and transparent about Blackstone. So that was a transfer.\n We have a sort of target operating model that we're working through with Life and Retirement and with the remaining AIG in terms of the pace in which we will make those changes. But we're going to optimize that structure to make sure that it's in the range of what the sort of AUM basis point fee was in terms of our internal management with using an outsourcing model. So we'll continue to give you more and more guidance, but you should know that like in sequential steps, we want to get the transfer for -- into Life Retirement, then Blackstone and then how we optimize the target operating model to make sure there's not headwinds for Life Retirement in the future. Sure, Alex. Thanks for the question. Again, we have so much going on that there is, I keep using the word sequencing because we want to make sure that we're doing the underwriting turnaround and all the things that we outlined through the scripts in the right sequence and making sure that we are getting things put behind us.\n We do have a path to a 10% ROE. I can't really give you a specific time frame because you can appreciate, we have so many moving pieces at the moment. Many of them we addressed in the scripts, but there's some that we can't address until we know further in terms of what are the IPO proceeds and looking further at the structure of the equity.\n I'm going to ask Shane to comment a little bit more. I mean -- but we know that we have to get expenses and rationalized in the company. But again, those priorities are going to be, we got to focus on making sure that we're driving the underwriting. We have great opportunities as a global leader in the industry, and we want to make sure that we're solving risk issues and capitalizing on all the opportunities present themselves.\n We want to finish AIG 200, which is going to give some of that expense benefit in terms of driving the ROE and get that done within the calendar year and then pivot to investment on digital. The operational separation of Life Retirement is incredibly important. We've been working with Kevin and the leadership team of getting that set up. So we want to continue to drive that forward, and then we have to execute on the IPO.\n So once that is largely complete, we know that the parent and what it is today called General Insurance, we have to combine the 2, and we will rationalize that operating model, not only driving profitability improvement but expense improvement, and that will drive the path in terms of achieving that ROE.\n Shane, I know I probably gobbled up a lot of the details, but is there anything else you'd like to add? Thanks, Shane. Yes. Let me just give a brief overview, and then ask Dave to comment on a little bit more specificity. One is we have a great balance across the globe in terms of International and North America. We've been driving top line growth, but the underwriting culture that we've developed is all about profitability. And so making sure that we continue to drive that profitability on a combined ratio, it's sustainable, but the areas in where we think we really drive significant value, there's multiple.\n Mark mentioned some of the product lines. It's not a couple, it's many, and it's across many geographies. And our underwriting leadership capacity and ability to structure programs is going to be something that we think is sustainable, but we won't be sacrificing margin and bottom line for top line.\n Dave, anything you want to add in terms of some of the specific areas where you're really looking to grow? Dave, you're on mute. Yes. Thank you, David. That's excellent. Thank you, everyone, for being here today. Before we end the call, I do want to take a minute to thank Mark for all the terrific work he did as a CFO over the last few years. In addition to leading the finance team, Mark has been a critical member of the executive team that transformed our GI portfolio, helped us achieve a great result, and we were able to talk about it today. Grateful for his support, really look forward to him in his new role and the transition. So Mark, thank you for everything.\n We're really anxious to have Shane. And you saw it today. We introduced him, done a great job getting up to speed. And so that transition has been very seamless. And Shane, welcome to the CFO role. And lastly, I want to thank all of our global colleagues for their incredible dedication, great work and making AIG a market leader and a great place to work. So thank you, everyone, and have a great day."

            "name": "Mark Lyons,Executive VP & CFO",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter, and good morning to all. Given Peter's comments, I will head directly into the fourth quarter results. Diluted adjusted earnings per share were $1.58, representing 68% growth over the prior year. This material improvement in adjusted EPS was driven by an over 1,000 basis point reduction in the General Insurance calendar quarter combined ratio; 9% growth in net earned premiums, led by Global Commercial with 13% net earned premium growth; and an improvement in the underlying accident year combined ratio ex CATs to 89.8%. As Peter mentioned, our first sub-90% quarterly results since before the financial crisis, which also represented a 310 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter. \n Life and Retirement delivered another quarter of solid returns and remained well-positioned with a 13.7% return on adjusted segment common equity for the fourth quarter and 14.2% for the full year 2021. The strength of our operating earnings and capital actions in the quarter helped drive a near 10% adjusted annualized ROE and growth in adjusted tangible book value per share of nearly $7, which represents a sequential increase of 12% and a full year increase of 23%. We fulfilled our capital management commitments and finished the year with a GAAP leverage ratio of 24.6%, a reduction of 150 basis points in the quarter and 380 basis points over the course of the year, which is another milestone, as we stated our goal was to be at or under 25% on this important metric. This improvement was driven by approximately $4 billion of debt and hybrid retirement along with $2.6 billion of share repurchases, nearly $2.1 billion of which occurred in the second half of 2021, which was slightly above our guidance.\n Moving to General Insurance. I will provide some color in areas which Peter did not touch upon in his opening remarks. Catastrophe losses of $189 million were significantly lower this quarter compared to $545 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter's main drivers were the Midwest tornadoes and the Colorado wildfire. Prior year development was $44 million favorable in the fourth quarter compared to unfavorable development of $45 million in the prior year quarter. As usual, there was net favorable amortization from the ADC, which was $45 million this quarter. So PYD was essentially flat without this amortization. On a full year basis, net favorable development amounted to $201 million relative to [ $43 billion ] in net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. In 2020, we released $76 million of net favorable development.\n Shifting to premium growth. Overall Global Commercial Insurance net premiums grew 13% on a reported and constant dollar basis for the quarter, and growth in North America commercial was 11%, driven by Casualty, which increased 50%; Lexington, which increased 14%; and Financial Lines, which increased over 10%. In International Commercial, growth was 16% on an FX-adjusted basis. And by line of business, Global Specialty, which is booked in International, grew over 25%. Talbot had 20% growth, and Property grew by 13%. Overall growth in the fourth quarter was driven by strong incremental rate improvement, higher renewal retentions and strong new business volumes.\n Commercial retention improved by 300 basis points year-over-year in North America to 80% and by 400 basis points in International to 86% in the period. This increase in wholesale business in North America Commercial brings with it lower channel retention ratios in addition to purposefully lower retentions in cyber and private D&O. Excluding these items, the retention ratios between North America and International Commercial are comparable. Commercial new business grew by 33% in the fourth quarter with 41% growth in North America and 25% growth in International.\n Turning to rate. Where overall Global Commercial Lines saw increases of 10% in the quarter, we achieved the third straight year of double-digit increases. Strong momentum continued across most lines, and we continue to achieve rate above loss cost trends. North America Commercial's overall 11% rate increases were balanced across the portfolio and led by Financial Lines, which increased by 15%; Excess Casualty, which increased by 14%; Retail Property, which was up 13%; and Lexington, which increased by 11%. International Commercial rate increases in the aggregate were 9%, driven by EMEA, which increased by 18%; the U.K., which increased by 12%; Financial Lines, which increased 18%; and Energy, which was up 11%, which is also its 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit rate increases.\n Shifting now to a calendar year combined ratio comparison. General Insurance produced a 95.8% combined ratio for 2021, an improvement of 850 basis points over 2020 and nearly 1,600 basis points better from 2018's 111.4% calendar year combined ratio. Peeling back a bit more, the combined CAT and prior period development improvement has been 720 basis points since 2018, indicating both a material CAT exposure reduction, in line with the movement we have shown in our PMLs and a much stronger loss reserve position than 3 years ago.\n Turning to additional pricing. Rate increases continue to be favorable and outpaced loss cost trends in most areas of the portfolio. With the level of rate that we have achieved in just the last 12 months, we expect that margin expansion will continue at least through 2022 and likely into accident year 2023. Getting more specific for illustrative purposes, we have communicated written rate changes during prior earnings calls and will continue to do so. However, since earned rate changes more directly impact reported results and given recent discussions around the inflation component of loss cost trend, I thought I'd go over a few areas on an earned rate basis for full year 2021.\n In North America Commercial, for example, Excess Casualty business that focuses on our national and corporate accounts has achieved an approximate earned rate increase approaching 40% in 2021 over 2020's earned rate level, as has cyber. D&O and nonadmitted Casualty achieved earned rate increases in the mid-20s. And importantly, retail and wholesale property achieved earned rate increases during 2021 in the low 20s. This is noteworthy because Property is getting most of the inflation attention, and yet the level of earned rate that was achieved is, in my view, still materially ahead of property and loss cost trend. And the same could be said for both Excess Casualty and D&O.\n Recent Property written rate increases are still in the low teens, and looking into policy year 2022 should keep them above loss trend even with an inflationary spike. Property pricing needs to remain firm to cover these increased costs of labor, materials and transportation.\n Turning to International Commercial. Similar to North America, there are large areas of material earned rate increases for full year 2021. International Financial Lines achieved a 23% earned rate increase over 2020's earned rate level. The International property book achieved an 18% earned rate increase, and the Energy book achieved earned rate increases in the mid-20s.\n Let's now step back and look at the last 3 years of cumulative written rate increases achieved at a high level during 2019 through 2021. North America Commercial across all lines of business had a 47% cumulative written rate increase, and International Commercial's cumulative written rate increase during that same time period was 40%. These measures, although they don't take into account improved terms and conditions and other difficult-to-track impact, indicate, on their own, a significant ingredient of margin improvement as evidenced by the material reduction in our reported accident year results.\n As we think about moving forward into calendar year 2022 and 2023, we need to be cognizant about the absolute, significantly favorable impact on combined ratios over the last 3 years and realize that most lines of business are well into the green. Although there are several opposite forces at work, such as economic and social inflation, my sense is that the 2022 market will continue to produce tight terms and conditions and strong pricing to sustain additional margin expansion into calendar 2023.\n As we think about 2022, major areas of growth for North America would be Accident & Health as the economy is expected to begin rebounding and Lexington on a nonadmitted basis. And on the International side, we see growth in our Global Specialty operations, A&H as well and select Casualty and Financial Lines areas around the globe, whereas AIG Re sees growth mostly in casualty business. The AIG Re portfolio strategically took the opportunity to further derisk and rebalance the portfolio away from property CAT due to our view of a less-than-adequate returns in that space and expanded further into Casualty and Specialty Lines and expects to continue that trend. Furthermore, limits deployed in U.S. property were down about 10%, and the retrocessional program provided $1 billion of protection with peak U.S. zone PML down meaningfully across most points in the return period curve.\n Moving to Life and Retirement. Premiums and deposits grew 19% in the fourth quarter, excluding Retail Mutual funds, relative to the comparable quarter last year. Growth was driven by Individual Retirement and $2.1 billion of pension risk transfer activity. APTI for the quarter was $969 million, down 6%, driven primarily by lower net investment income and unfavorable COVID-19 base mortality, although non-COVID-19 mortality returned to being better than pricing expectations.\n On a full year basis, APTI increased to $3.9 billion, reflecting higher net investment income and fee income, partially offset by adverse mortality. Our investment portfolio and hedging program continued to perform extremely well for both the quarter and the year. Composite base spreads across Individual and Group Retirement along with institutional markets compressed 12 basis points during 2021 within the sensitivity guidance we've previously provided.\n Within Individual Retirement, Index Annuities continued to be the net flows growth engine with $880 million of positive net flows for the quarter and $4.1 billion of the full year. APTI was essentially flat for full year 2021 over full year 2020, but premiums and deposits were up 34% and AUM was up 2% year-over-year to $159 billion. Group Retirement had APTI of $314 million for the fourth quarter, virtually flat with last year's comparable quarter, but was up 27% on a full year basis, with premium and deposits up roughly 4% and assets under administration up over 7.5% on a full year basis to $140 billion.\n Life Insurance APTI was a negative $8 million in the fourth quarter, but had a gain of $106 million for the full year. Premiums and deposits grew 4% from fourth quarter of 2020 and over 5% for the full year to $4.7 billion. Additionally, total insurance in-force grew to $1.2 trillion, representing over 3% growth.\n Our COVID-19-related mortality exposure sensitivity of $65 million to $75 million pretax per 100,000 U.S. population deaths was in line based on the externally reported fourth quarter COVID-related population deaths in the U.S. Institutional Markets grew premiums and deposits by 74% relative to last year's comparable quarter, primarily due to the significant pension risk transfer sales.\n Moving to other operations. The adjusted pretax loss before consolidation and eliminations was $178 million, a $250 million improvement versus the prior year quarter, with the primary drivers being higher net investment income of $237 million; a lower corporate interest expense on financial debt of $51 million, resulting from our debt redemption activities; partially offset by higher corporate GOE of $12 million, which include increases in performance-based compensation.\n Heading to Peter's comment about AIG 200. $810 million of run rate savings are already executed or contracted towards the $1 billion run rate in savings objective with approximately $540 million recognized to date in our income statement and $645 million of the $1.3 billion cost to achieve having been spent to date.\n Shifting to investments. Total cash and investments were $361 billion, and fourth quarter net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.3 billion, which was essentially the same both sequentially and year-over-year and was aided by higher alternative investment income, particularly within private equity. NII for the full year of $12.9 billion was up over $600 million from 2020. Private equity returns were nearly 32% for the full year, up from approximately 10% last year. Hedge funds returned approximately 14% each year, and mortgage loan returns were stable at 4.2%.\n We ended the year with our primary operating subsidiaries being profitable and well-capitalized with General Insurance's U.S. pool fleet risk-based capital ratio for the fourth quarter estimated to be between 460% and 470%, and the Life and Retirement [ yields ] is estimated to be between 440% and 450%, both well above the upper bound of our target operating ranges. With respect to share count, our average total diluted shares outstanding in the fourth quarter were 847 million, a reduction of 2% as we repurchased approximately 17 million shares in the quarter. The end-of-period outstanding shares for book value per share purposes was approximately 819 million at year-end 2021.\n Now I'd like to address the forthcoming LDTI accounting changes affecting our Life and Retirement business. First, this is a GAAP-only accounting standard, and there should not be impacts to cash flow or statutory results. As this continues to be a work in progress for us and the industry at large, I'd like to provide a range towards the transitional balance impact at January 1, 2021, as being between $1 billion and $3 billion decrease to shareholders' equity with our current point estimate being towards the lower end of this range. This decrease represents a netting between an increase to retained earnings and a decrease to AOCI. Once again, Life and Retirement's breadth of product offerings provides value as the LDTI impact of old traditional products covered by FAS 60 involving mortality are roughly offset by the elimination of historical AOCI adjustment associated with certain longevity products.\n Also, current GAAP accounting for living benefits is at fair value, and changes go through the income statement, whereas under LDTI, a portion of that charge will be recorded in AOCI, pertaining to the company's own credit spreads, which, for that piece, will help to dampen some volatility. But mortality benefits will now also be at fair value and will act as an offset to take volatility in the other direction within the GAAP income statement.\n Turning now to the recent S&P capital model changes. The deadline to respond has been extended to March of 2022, and S&P will presumably conclude shortly thereafter. Both the property, casualty and the life retirement insurance industries will likely see higher capital charges for innate insurance exposures as well as for asset credit and asset market risks. Additionally, reduced benefits of holding company cash liquidity and lower levels of accessible debt leverage is an indicated outcome, but all with material offsets due to increased diversification benefits. We have spent considerable time on the analysis of this proposal so far, but it is probably premature to make any predictions at this point before S&P and the industry have had more time to land upon the exact details of the final framework.\n Now in conclusion, by virtually all measures, growth, profitability, returns, margin expansion, adjusted book, adjusted tangible book value, debt leverage reduction, EPS, adjusted pre- and after-tax income and net income all point to an outstanding year for AIG. When you also factor in our global platform, our marketplace actions and impact, the strength of our loss reserves, a robust reinsurance program and massive portfolio reconstruction, AIG is exceedingly well-positioned as we look to the separation of L&R, completing AIG 200, maintaining our path towards increasing profitable growth and for whatever else the future holds.\n With that, I will turn the call back over to Peter. Yes, happy to, Peter. Thank you. So with respect to your quarterly question, I mean, the Insurance business, we take out a lot of different risks. We have the big portfolio, so you get some smoothing. But quarter-by-quarter, you never really know that. And as Dave McElroy and Peter have said in the past, every quarter has a different underlying mix to it. So we would certainly expect improvement, but I wouldn't be surprised if 1 quarter went off or something. But the year, we certainly expect continued improvement. Well -- sorry. So thank you for the question, Meyer. What you'll always see is the -- and basically, what you see in other operations, which always gets a little confusing, granted, is that the investment income in the subs would be double counted otherwise. So what you see as you go through that is that the elimination of that overlap, firstly.\n Secondly, on the alternatives, I kind of highlighted for you what some of the returns have been on that over the last couple of years, which we certainly wouldn't count on really on a go-forward basis, you don't plan on that level. We're happy to have it, but we wouldn't really contemplate that on a strict go-forward basis."

            "content": "Yes, it's very important to understand the reunderwriting that was done in the Property book. And not only the limits that were taken out, of the $1 trillion, about $600 billion of that was Property around the world. So -- and it really did rearchitect completely different businesses with Lexington becoming more of an E&S carrier. 80 -- 90% of our limits now are less than $10 million, okay? And we let Retail Property play, and they started to do shared and layered. They weren't competing anymore with $2 billion limit. So the whole PML and AAL has come down dramatically, okay? And that's obviously influenced how we buy our [ reinsurances ]. \n We are reflecting the fact that there is a higher, let's say, expected loss in inflation in the 2022 plan. So we've actually added a little bit above our AAL as a marker for our CAT load in 2022 to reflect that. I think that's just prudent business. It also reflects the fact that the -- we think we have these books from a limit management standpoint, from an exposure standpoint controlled, but we need to be conservative. We need to think of it that way. So -- and that actually extends to the Global franchise, too. There was a massive amount of limits that we've taken out of that portfolio, and that feeds into the respective CAT programs that we have overseas. Thank you. You can hear me? Yes. I think we don't want to front-run 2022, but a lot of the work that we've done over the last 3 years really -- and it manifests itself in 2021. You could see we are growing. You can see the numbers that we put forth on the accident year as well as combined year. And those books form our future. So I've spoken to a momentum business, but we now look at those books of business that we've rearchitected, okay, and it gave us a lot of room to do that, and you saw the pivot to growth. But those are now a well-formed books that we think we can grow off of.\n If you think about renewal retention, when you think about rate on that book and when you think about new business on that book, we are optimistic around that forming a foundation for growth into 2022 and 2023. And renewal retention is a momentum business, okay? We've been adding a couple of hundred bps to each renewal retention each year. We think that there's opportunity there because we like the book. It's a better price book into 2022.\n Rates. You've heard some of the rhetoric. We believe that rates will continue to trend above expected loss costs with an inflation buffer in there. We saw in the fourth quarter where there was concern and fear around Property, and Property turned back. And I call out not only to ourselves but to everybody on this call, how we thought there would be deceleration in 2021, but there was a respect in the industry and a reflection in the industry on inflation costs, and the market is reacting rationally to that. And we think that will continue into 2022.\n And then new business, the machinery and what Peter is alluding to is we have so many franchises around the world that have, what I consider to be preferred positions, moat positions, okay? We are not trading against the comparative rater in auto. We are a specialty global company that judgment matters, underwriting matters, and we have primary positions and collateral and multinational service capabilities. These are assets that we can control and allow us to generate growth with that. So let me stop there for a change."

And now at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead, sir. \nQuentin McMillan: Thank you, Jake. Today's remarks may contain forward-looking statements, including comments related to company performance, strategic priorities, including AIG's pursuit of separation of its Life and Retirement business, business mix and market conditions and the effects of COVID-19 on AIG. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. Actual performance and events may differ materially.\n Factors that could cause results to differ include factors described in our third quarter 2021 report on Form 10-Q, our 2020 annual report on Form 10-K and other recent filings made with the SEC. AIG is under no obligation and expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n Additionally, some remarks may refer to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website, www.aig.com.\n With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter Zaffino, President and CEO of AIG. \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review our third quarter results. I'm pleased to report that AIG had another outstanding quarter as we continue to build momentum and execute on our strategic priorities. We continue to drive underwriting excellence across our portfolio. We're executing on AIG 200 to instill operational excellence in everything we do. We are continuing to work on the separation of Life and Retirement from AIG. And we're demonstrating an ongoing commitment to thoughtful capital management.\n I will start my remarks with an overview of our consolidated financial results for the third quarter. I will then review our results for General Insurance, where we continue to demonstrate market leadership in solving risk issues for clients while delivering improved underwriting profitability and more consistent results. I'll also comment on certain market dynamics, particularly in the property market, as well as recent CAT activity and related reinsurance considerations as we approach year-end.\n Next, I'll review results from our Life and Retirement business, which we continue to prepare to be a stand-alone company. I will also provide an update on the considerable progress we're making on the operational separation of Life and Retirement from AIG and our strong execution of AIG 200.\n I will then review capital management, where our near-term priorities remain unchanged from those I have outlined in the past: debt reduction, return of capital to shareholders, investment in our business through organic growth and operational improvements.\n Finally, I will conclude with our recently announced senior executive changes that further position AIG for the long term. These appointments were possible due to the strong bench of internal talent and significantly augment the leadership team across our company. I will then turn the call over to Mark, who will provide more detail on our financial results, and then we'll take your questions.\n Starting with our consolidated results. As I said, AIG had another outstanding quarter, continuing the terrific trends we've experienced throughout 2021. Against the backdrop of a very active CAT season and the persistent and ongoing global pandemic, our global team of colleagues continue to perform at an incredibly high level, delivering value to our clients, policyholders and distribution partners.\n Adjusted after-tax income in the third quarter was $0.97 per diluted share compared to $0.81 in the prior year quarter. This result was driven by significant improvement in profitability in General Insurance, very good results in Life and Retirement, continued expense discipline and savings from AIG 200 and executing on our capital management strategy.\n In General Insurance, Global Commercial drove strong top line growth. And we were especially pleased with our adjusted accident year combined ratio, which improved 280 basis points year-over-year to 90.5%. These excellent results in General Insurance validate the strategy we've been executing on to vastly improve the quality of our portfolio and build a top-performing culture of disciplined underwriting.\n One data point that I believe demonstrates the incredible progress we have made is our accident year combined ratio for the first 9 months of 2021, which was 97.7%. That's including CATs. This represents a 770 basis point improvement year-over-year, with 600 of that improvement coming from the loss ratio and 170 from the expense ratio.\n In Life and Retirement, we again had solid results primarily driven by improved investment performance and increased call and tender income. This business delivered a return on adjusted segment common equity of 12.2% for the third quarter and 14.3% for the first 9 months of the year. And we recently achieved an important milestone in the separation process by closing the sale of a 9.9% equity stake in Life and Retirement to Blackstone for $2.2 billion in cash. We continue to prepare the business for an IPO in 2022, and we'll begin moving certain assets under management to Blackstone.\n We ended the third quarter with $5.3 billion in parent liquidity after redeeming $1.5 billion in debt outstanding and completing $1.1 billion in share repurchases. Year-to-date, we have reduced financial debt outstanding by $3.4 billion and have returned $2.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.\n We expect to redeem or repurchase an additional $1 billion of debt in the fourth quarter and to repurchase a minimum of $900 million of common stock through year-end to complete the $2 billion of stock repurchase we announced on our last call. Through these actions, we've made clear our continuing commitment to remain active and thoughtful about capital management.\n Now let me provide more detail on our business results in the third quarter. I will start with General Insurance, where, as I mentioned earlier, growth in net premiums written continued to be very strong, and we achieved our 13th consecutive quarter of improvement in the adjusted accident year combined ratio.\n Adjusting for foreign exchange, net premiums written increased 10% year-over-year to $6.6 billion. This growth was driven by Global Commercial, which increased 15%, with Personal Insurance flat for the quarter.\n Growth in Commercial was balanced between North America and International, with North America increasing 18% and International increasing 12%. Growth in North America Commercial was driven by Excess Casualty, which increased over 50%; Lexington Wholesale, which continued to show leadership in the E&S market and grew Property and Casualty by over 30%; Financial Lines, which increased over 20%; and Crop Risk Services, which grew more than 50% driven by increased commodity prices.\n In International Commercial, Financial Lines grew 25%, Talbot had over 15% growth, and Liability had over 10% growth. In addition, gross new business in Global Commercial grew 40% year-over-year to over $1 billion. In North America, new business growth was more than 50%, and in International, it was more than 25%. North America new business was strongest in Lexington, Financial Lines and Retail Property. International new business came mostly from Financial Lines and our Specialty businesses.\n We also had very strong retention in our in-force portfolio, with North America improving retention by 200 basis points and International improving retention by 700 basis points.\n Turning to rate. Strong momentum continued with overall Global Commercial rate increases of 12%. In many cases, this is the third year where we have achieved double-digit rate increases in our portfolio.\n North America Commercial's overall 11% rate increases were balanced across the portfolio and led by Excess Casualty, which increased over 15%; Financial Lines, which also increased over 15%; and Canada, where rates increased by 17%, representing the 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit rate increases.\n International Commercial rate increases were 13% driven by EMEA, excluding Specialty, which increased by 22%; U.K., excluding Specialty, which increased 21%; Financial Lines, which increased 24%; and Energy, which was up 14%, its 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit rate increases.\n Turning to Global Personal Insurance. We had a solid quarter that reflected a modest rebound in net premiums written in Travel and Warranty, offset by results in the Private Client Group due to reinsurance cessions related to Syndicate 2019 and nonrenewals in peak zones.\n Shifting to underwriting profitability. As I noted earlier, General Insurance's accident year combined ratio ex CAT was 90.5%. The third quarter saw a 150 basis point improvement in the accident year loss ratio ex CAT and a 130 basis point improvement in the expense ratio, all of which came from the GOE ratio. These results were driven by our improved portfolio mix, achieving rate in excess of loss cost trends, continued expense discipline and benefits from AIG 200.\n Global Commercial achieved an impressive accident year combined ratio ex CATs of 88.9%, an improvement of 290 basis points year-over-year and the second consecutive quarter with a sub-90% combined ratio result. The accident year combined ratio ex CAT for North America Commercial and International Commercial were 90.5% and 86.8%, respectively, an improvement of 370 basis points and 210 basis points. In Global Personal Insurance, the accident year combined ratio ex CATs was 94.2%, an improvement of 220 basis points year-over-year driven by improvement in the expense ratio.\n Given the significant progress we have made to improve our combined ratios and our view that the momentum we have will continue for the foreseeable future, we now expect to achieve a sub-90% accident year combined ratio ex CAT for full year 2022. After 3 years of significant underwriting margin improvement, we believe that the sub-90% accident year combined ratio ex CAT is something that not only will be achieved for full year 2022, but that there will continue to be runway for further improvement in future years.\n Turning to CATs. As I said earlier, the third quarter was very active, with current industry estimates ranging between $45 billion and $55 billion globally. We reported approximately $625 million of net global CAT losses with approximately $530 million in Commercial. The largest impacts were from Hurricane Ida and flooding in Europe, where we saw net CAT losses of approximately $400 million and $190 million, respectively.\n We have put significant management focus into our reinsurance program, which continues to perform exceptionally well to reduce volatility, including strategic purchases for wind that we made in the second quarter. Reinsurance recoveries in our International per occurrence, Private Client Group per occurrence and other discrete reinsurance programs also reduced volatility in the third quarter.\n We expect any fourth quarter CAT losses to be limited given that we are close to attaching on our North America aggregate cover and our aggregate cover for rest of the world, excluding Japan. We have each and every loss deductibles of $75 million for North America wind, $50 million for North America earthquake and $25 million for all other North America perils and $20 million for international. Our worldwide retention has approximately $175 million remaining before attaching in the aggregate, which would essentially be for Japan CAT.\n Taking a step back for a moment, I want to acknowledge the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes in recent years. Since 2012 and excluding COVID, there have been 10 CATs with losses exceeding $10 billion. And 9 of those 10 occurred in 2017 through the third quarter of this year.\n Average CAT losses over the last 5 years have been $114 billion, up 30% from the 10-year average and up 40% from the 15-year average. And through 2021, catastrophe losses exceed $100 billion, and we're already at $90 billion through the third quarter. This will be the fourth year in the last 5 years in which natural catastrophes have exceeded this threshold. We've never seen consistent CAT losses at this level and as an industry, need to acknowledge that frequency and severity has changed dramatically as a result of climate change and other factors.\n I'll make 3 observations. First, while CAT models tended to trend acceptable over the last 20 years, that has not been the case over the last 5 years. Second, over the last 5 years, on average, models have been 20% to 30% below the expected value at the lower return periods. If you add in wildfire, those numbers dramatically increase. Third, industry losses compared to model losses at the low end of the curve have been deficient and need rate adjustments to reflect the significant increase in frequency in CATs.\n To address these issues, at AIG, we've invested heavily in our CAT research team to develop our own view of risk in this new environment. As a result of this work, we made frequency and severity adjustments for wildfire, U.S. wind, storm surge, flood as well as numerous other perils in international. We will continue to leverage new scientific studies, improvements in vendor model work and our own claims data to calibrate our views on risk over time to ensure we're appropriately pricing CAT risks.\n Across our portfolio, our strategy and primary focus has been and will continue to be to deliver risk solutions that meet our clients' needs while aligning within our risk appetite, which takes into consideration terms and conditions, strategic deployment of limits and a recognition of increased frequency and severity. The significant focus that we've been applying to the critical work we've been doing is showing through in our financial results as you've seen over the course of 2021 with improving combined ratios, both including and excluding CATs.\n Now turning to Life and Retirement. Earnings continue to be strong, and in the third quarter were supported by stable equity markets, modestly improving interest rates relative to the second quarter and significant call and tender income. Adjusted pretax income in the third quarter was approximately $875 million.\n Individual Retirement, excluding Retail Mutual Funds, which we sold in the third quarter, maintained its upward trajectory with 27% growth in sales year-over-year. Our largest retail product, Index Annuity, was up 50% compared to the prior year quarter.\n Group Retirement collectively grew deposits 3% with new group acquisitions ahead of prior year, but below a robust second quarter. Kevin and his team continued to actively manage the impacts from a low interest rate and tighter credit spreads environment. And their earlier provided range for expected annual spread compression has not changed as base investment spreads for the third quarter were within the annual 8 to 6 points (sic) [ 8 to 16 basis points ] guidance.\n With respect to the operational separation of Life and Retirement, we continue to make considerable progress on a number of fronts. Our goal is to deliver a clean separation with minimal business disruption and emphasis on speed execution, operational efficiency and thoughtful talent allocation.\n We have many work streams in execution mode, including designing a target operating model that will position Life and Retirement to be a successful stand-alone public company, separating IT systems, data centers, software applications, real estate and material vendor contracts and determining where transition services will be required and minimizing their duration with clear exit plans.\n We continue to expect an IPO to occur in the first quarter of 2022 or potentially in the second quarter, subject to regulatory approvals and market conditions. As I mentioned on our last call, due to the sale of our affordable housing portfolio and the execution of certain tax strategies, we are no longer constrained in terms of how much of Life and Retirement we can sell on an IPO.\n Having said that, we currently expect to retain a greater than 50% interest immediately following the IPO and to continue to consolidate Life and Retirement's financial statements until such time as we fall below the 50% ownership threshold. As we plan for the full separation of Life and Retirement, the timing of further secondary offerings will be based on market conditions and other relevant factors over time.\n With respect to AIG 200, we continue to advance this program and remain on track to deliver $1 billion in run rate savings across the company by the end of 2022 against a cost to achieve of $1.3 billion. $660 million of run rate savings are already executed or contracted, with approximately $400 million recognized to date in our income statement.\n As with the underwriting turnaround, which created a culture of underwriting excellence, AIG 200 is creating a culture of operational excellence that is becoming the way we work across AIG.\n Before turning the call over to Mark, I'd like to take a moment to discuss the senior leadership changes we announced last week. Having made significant progress during the first 9 months of 2021 across our strategic priorities and in light of the momentum we have heading towards the end of the year, this was an ideal time to make these appointments.\n I'll start with Mark, who will step into a newly created role, Global Chief Actuary and Head of Portfolio Management for AIG on January 1. As you all know, over the last 3 years, Mark has played a critical role in the repositioning of AIG. He originally joined AIG in 2018 as our Chief Actuary. And this new role will get him back into the core of our business, driving portfolio improvement, growth and prudent decision-making by providing guidance on important performance metrics within our risk appetite and evolving our reinsurance program.\n Shane Fitzsimons will take over for Mark as Chief Financial Officer on January 1. Shane joined AIG in 2019, and his strong leadership helped accelerate aspects of AIG 200 and instill discipline and rigor around our finance transformation, strategic planning, budgeting and forecasting processes. He has a strong financial and accounting background having worked at GE for over 20 years in many senior finance roles, including as Head of FP&A and Chief Financial Officer of GE's international operations. Shane has already begun working with Mark on a transition plan, and we've shifted his AIG 200 and shared services responsibility to other senior leaders.\n We also announced that Elias Habayeb has been named Chief Financial Officer of Life and Retirement. Elias has been with AIG for over 15 years and was most recently our Deputy CFO and Principal Accounting Officer for AIG as well as the CFO for General Insurance. Elias has deep expertise about AIG. And his transition to Life and Retirement will be seamless as he is well known to that management team, the investments team that is now part of Life and Retirement, our regulators, rating agencies and many other stakeholders.\n Overall, I am very pleased with our team, our third quarter results and the tremendous progress we're making on many fronts across AIG.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark. \nMark Lyons;Executive VP & CFO: Thank you, Peter, and good morning to all. I am extremely pleased with the strong adjusted earnings this quarter of $0.97 per share and our profitable General Insurance calendar quarter combined ratio, which includes CATs, of 99.7%. The year-over-year adjusted EPS improvement was driven by a 750 basis point reduction in the General Insurance calendar quarter combined ratio, strong growth in net premiums written and earned and a related 280 basis point decrease in the underlying accident year combined ratio ex CAT. Life and Retirement also produced strong APTI of $877 million, along with a healthy adjusted ROE of 12.2%.\n The quarter's strong operating earnings and consistent investment performance helped increase adjusted book value per share by 3% sequentially and nearly 9% compared to 1 year ago. The strength of our balance sheet and strong liquidity position were highlights in the period as we made continued progress on our leverage goals with a GAAP debt leverage reduction of 90 basis points sequentially and 350 basis points from 1 year ago today to 26.1%, generated through retained earnings and liability management actions.\n Shifting to General Insurance. Due to our achieved profitable growth to date, together with demonstrable volatility reduction and smart cycle management, makes us even more confident in achieving our stated goal of a sub-90% accident year combined ratio ex CAT for full year 2022 rather than just exiting 2022.\n Shifting now to current conditions. The markets in which we operate persist in strength and show resiliency. AIG's global platform continues to see rate strengthening internationally, which adds to our overall uplift unlike more U.S.-centric competitors. As you recall, International Commercial rate increases lagged those in North America initially. But beginning in 2021, as noted by Peter in his remarks, International is now producing rate increases that surpass those strong rates still being achieved in North America, and in some areas, meaningfully so.\n These rate increases continue to outstrip loss cost trends on a global basis across a broadband of assumptions and are additive towards additional margin expansion. In fact, for a more extensive view, within North America over the 3-year period, 2019 through 2021, product lines that achieved cumulative rate increases near or above 100% are found within Excess Casualty, both admitted and non-admitted; Property Lines, both admitted and non-admitted; and Financial Lines. We believe these levels of tailwind will continue driving earned margin expansion into the foreseeable future.\n In the current inflationary environment, it's important to remember that products with inflation-sensitive exposure bases, such as sales, receipts and payroll, act as an inflation mitigant and furthermore are subject to additional audit premiums as the economy recovers.\n Last quarter, we provided commentary about U.S. portfolio loss cost trends of 4% to 5% and in some aspects were viewed as being near term. We believe that this range still holds but now gravitates towards the upper end given another quarter of data. And in fact, our U.S. loss cost trends range from approximately 3.5% to 10%, depending on the line of business.\n From a pricing perspective, we feel that we are integrating these near-term inflationary impact into our rating and portfolio tools. And we are not lowering any line of business loss cost trends since lighter claims reporting may be misconstrued as a false positive due to COVID-19 societal impacts.\n It's also worth noting that all of our North America Commercial Lines loss cost trends, with the exception of workers' compensation, are materially lower than the corresponding rate increases we are seeing. This discussion around compound rate increases and loss cost trends collectively give rise to the related topic of current year loss ratio picks or indications and the result in bookings. The strong market that we now enjoy, in conjunction with the significant underwriting transformation at AIG, has driven other aspects of the portfolio that affect loss ratios.\n In many lines and classes of business, the degree that cumulative rate changes have outpaced cumulative loss cost trend is substantial. And these lead to meaningfully reduced loss ratio indications between 2018 and the 2021 years. Unfortunately, this is where most discussions usually cease with external stakeholders. However, in reality, that is not the end of the discussion but merely the beginning.\n Some other aspects that can have material favorable implications towards the profitability of underlying businesses are, one, terms and conditions, which can rival price in the impact; two, a much more balanced submission flow across the insured risk quality spectrum, thereby improving rate adequacy and mitigating adverse selection; three, strategic capacity deployment across various layers of an insurance tower, which can produce preferred positioning and ongoing retention with the customer; and fourth, reinsurance that tempers volatility and mitigates net losses.\n Accordingly, even if modest loss ratio beneficial impacts are assigned to each of these nuances, they will additionally contribute to further driving down the 2021 indicated loss ratio beyond that signaled by rate versus loss trend alone. And these are real, and these are happening.\n So why are product lines booked at this implied level of profitability by any insurer? Well, there is at least 4 reasons. First, insurers assume the heterogeneous risk of others, and each year is composed of different exposures, rendering so-called on-level projections to be imperfect. Second, most policies are written on an occurrence basis, which means the policy language can be challenged for years, if not decades, potentially including novel series of liability. Third, many lines are extremely volatile and even if every insured is underwritten perfectly -- even if every insured is underwritten perfectly. And fourth, booking an overly optimistic initial loss ratio merely increases the chance of future unfavorable development. Therefore, these types of issues require prudence in the establishment of initial loss ratio picks for most commercial lines of business.\n Shifting now to our third quarter reserve review. Approximately $42 billion of reserves were reviewed this quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to approximately 90% of carried pre-ADC reserves. I'd like to spend a little time taking you through the results of our quarterly reserve analysis, which resulted in minimal net movement, confirming the strength of our overall reserve position.\n On a pre-ADC basis, the prior year development was $153 million favorable. On a post-ADC basis, it was $3 million favorable. And when reflecting the $47 million ADC amortization on the deferred gain, it was $50 million favorable in total. This means that our overall reserves continue to be adequate, with favorable and unfavorable development balanced across lines of business, resulting in an improved yet neutral alignment of reserves.\n Now before looking at the quarter on a segment basis, I'd like to strip away some noise that's in the quarter so we don't get overly lost in the details. One should think of this quarter's reserve analysis as performing all of the scheduled product reviews and then having to overlay 2 seemingly unrelated impacts caused by the receipt of a large subrogation recovery associated with the 2017 and 2018 California wildfires.\n The first of these 2 impacts is the direct reduction from North America Personal Insurance reserves of $326 million, resulting from the subrogation recoveries. As a result, we also had to reverse a previously recorded 2018 accident year reinsurance recovery in North America Commercial Insurance of $206 million since the attachment point was no longer penetrated once the subrogation recoveries were received.\n These 2 impacts from the subrogation recovery resulted in a net $120 million of favorable development. So excluding their impact restates the total General Insurance PYD as being $70 million unfavorable in total rather than the $50 million of favorable development discussed earlier. This is a better framework to discuss the true underlying reserve movements this quarter.\n This $70 million of global unfavorable stems from $85 million unfavorable in global CAT losses together with $50 million favorable in global non-CAT or attritional losses. The $85 million unfavorable in CAT is driven by marginal adjustments involving multiple prior year events from 2019 and 2020. The $15 million non-CAT favorable stems from the net of $255 million unfavorable from Global Commercial and $270 million of favorable development, predominantly from short-tail personal lines businesses within accident year 2020, mostly in our International book. Consistent with our overall reserving philosophy, we were cautious towards reacting to this $270 million favorable indication until we allow the accident year to season.\n North America Commercial had unfavorable development of $112 million, which was driven by Financial Lines' strengthening of approximately $400 million with favorable development and other lines led by workers' compensation with approximately $200 million, emanating mostly from accident years 2015 and prior and approximately $100 million across various other units. North America Financial Lines were negatively impacted by primary public D&O, largely in the more complex national accounts arena and within private not-for-profit D&O unit, in addition to some excess coverage mostly in the public D&O space, with 90% emanating from accident years 2016 to 2018.\n International Commercial had unfavorable development of $143 million, which was comprised of Financial Lines' strengthening in D&O and professional indemnity of approximately $300 million led by the U.K. and Europe, but the accident year impacts are more spread out. Favorable development was led by our Specialty businesses at roughly $110 million with an additional favorable of approximately $50 million stemming from various lines and regions.\n Now as Peter noted, the changes we've made to our underwriting culture and risk appetite over the last few years, coupled with strong market conditions, are now showing through in our financial results. U.S. Financial Lines, in particular, through careful underwriting and risk selection has meaningfully reduced our exposure to securities class actions or SCA lawsuits over the last few years.\n Evidence of this underwriting change is best seen through the proportion of SCAs for which the U.S. operation has provided coverage. In 2017, AIG provided D&O coverage to 67 insurers involved in SCAs, which represents 42% of all U.S. federal security class actions in that year. Whereas in 2020, that shrunk to just 18%, and through 9 months of 2021 is only 15 insurers or 14%. This is significant because roughly 60% to 70% of public D&O loss dollars historically emanate from SCAs.\n The North America private not-for-profit D&O book has also been significantly transformed. The policy retention rate here between 2018 and 2021, which is a key strategic target, is just 15%. And yet it should also be noted that the corresponding cumulative rate increase over the same period is nearly 130%. This purposeful change in risk selection criteria away from billion-dollar revenue large private companies and nonprofit universities and hospitals to instead a more balanced middle market book will also drive profitability substantially.\n International Financial Lines has implemented similar underwriting actions with comparable 3-year cumulative rate increases, along with a singular underwriting authority around the world as respect U.S.-listed D&O exposure through close collaboration with the U.S. Chief Underwriting Office.\n In summary, our reserving philosophy remains consistent in that we will continue to be prudent and conservative. This is evidenced by our slower recognition of attritional improvements in short-tail lines from accident year 2020 and from the sound decision to strengthen Financial Line reserves, even though there are some interpretive challenges stemming from a difficult claims environment, changes within our internal claims operations over the last couple of years and potential COVID-19 impacts on claim reporting patterns. All of these underwriting actions we've taken over the last few years make us even more confident in our total reserve position across both prior and current accident years.\n Moving on to Life and Retirement. The year-to-date ROE has been a strong 14.3% compared to 12.8% in the first 9 months of last year. APTI during the third quarter saw higher net investment income and higher fee income, offset by the unfavorable impact from the annual actuarial assumption update, which is $166 million pretax, negatively affected the ROE by approximately 250 basis points on an annual basis and EPS by $0.15 per share. The main source of the impact was in the Individual Retirement division associated with fixed annuity spread compression.\n Life Insurance reflected a slightly elevated COVID-19-related mortality provision in the quarter. But our exposure sensitivity of $65 million to $75 million per 100,000 population deaths proved accurate based on the reported third quarter COVID-related deaths in the United States. Mortality exclusive of COVID-19 was also slightly elevated in the period.\n Within Individual Retirement, excluding the Retail Mutual Fund business, net flows were a positive $250 million this quarter compared to net outflows of $110 million in the prior year quarter largely due to the recovery from the broad industry-wide sales disruption resulting from COVID-19, which we view as a material rebound indicator.\n Prior sensitivities in respect to yield and equity market movements affecting APTI continue to hold true. And new business margins generally remain within our targets at current new money returns due to active product management and disciplined pricing approach.\n Moving to other operations. The adjusted pretax loss before consolidations and eliminations was $370 million, $2 million higher than the prior quarter of 2020, driven by higher corporate GOE primarily from increases in performance-based employee compensation, partially offset by higher investment income and lower corporate interest expense resulting from year-to-date debt redemption activity.\n Shifting to investments. Overall net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.3 billion, an increase of $78 million compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting mostly higher private equity gains.\n By business, Life and Retirement benefited most due to asset growth, higher call and tender income and another strong period of private equity returns. General Insurance's NII declined approximately 6% year-over-year due to continued yield compression and underperformance in the hedge fund position. Also, General Insurance has a much higher percentage allocation to private equity and hedge funds, which is likely to change moving forward.\n As respect share count, our average total diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 864 million, and we repurchased approximately 20 million shares. The end-of-period outstanding shares for book value per share purposes was approximately 836 million and anticipated to be approximately 820 million at year-end 2021 depending upon share price performance, given Peter's comments on additional share repurchases.\n Lastly, our primary operating subsidiaries remain profitable and well capitalized, with General Insurance's U.S. pool fleet risk-based capital ratio for the third quarter estimated to be between 450% and 460%. And the Life and Retirement U.S. fleet is estimated to be between 440% and 450%, both above our target ranges.\n With that, I'll now turn it back over to Peter. \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: Great, Mark, thank you. Operator, we'll take our first question. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we will begin with Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. \nElyse Greenspan: My first question, when you guys -- Peter, when you make the comment that you think you'll hit sub-90% for full year 2022, and then you said that there would be runway for further improvement in future years, I'm just trying -- when you kind of think 2022 and beyond, what are you guys assuming for both pricing and loss trend as we kind of think out the next year and even beyond that time frame? \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: Well, thanks, Elyse. Let me answer the first part why we're so confident that the momentum that we have and the sub-90% combined ratio is achievable. When you look at this quarter and last quarter, just the improvement from the core of the businesses continues to improve at an accelerated pace. And Dave McElroy and the leadership team on the underwriting side, Shane who's now going to move into the CFO role driving AIG 200, just the execution has been terrific.\n And why we're confident it's just, again, the momentum when we look at the fundamentals of the business, we're growing top line. We talk, Mark and I, about that we're getting pricing above loss cost, developing margin, expense ratio. All of that goes into our confidence. We have higher retentions on a policy count, very strong new business and think that applied to quality. We have more relevance each quarter in the marketplace.\n And so the assumptions are modest. It's not that it has to stay in the same pricing environment. But it is one that we are going to continue to be very disciplined of driving profitability and making sure that where we're deploying capital, that on a risk-adjusted basis, we're going to be getting margin. So I think that -- again, I don't want to give guidance beyond that but feel that next year, we have the momentum. We're executing on all of our strategic imperatives, and we're delivering the results. \nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then my follow-up on -- you guys said that the Life IPO should take place in the Q1, perhaps in the second quarter of next year. How do we think about capital return? I know you guys have laid out a plan for this year, but how should we think about capital return next year? And is that dependent on when and the ultimate size of what you bring to market with the Life and Retirement business and the IPO? \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: Well, we've been trying to give a lot of guidance in terms of what we intend to do in the short run because of a number of moving pieces. We have strong liquidity, which is what we had talked about in the prepared remarks. Some of the big moving pieces as we get to the back half of the year will be the affordable housing proceeds, the closing of Blackstone, the fact that we're going to continue to execute on debt reduction, share repurchases.\n And I think as we get to the fourth quarter call and we have a better line of sight in terms of what we think the actual timing will be on the IPO plus liquidity at year-end, we'll give further guidance as we move forward. But for now, I think we're just going to stick with what we've outlined, and we continue to execute on that each quarter. \nOperator: We'll now take the next question from Meyer Shields with KBW. \nMeyer Shields: I guess first question for Peter. You laid out a pretty conservative case for the frequency and severity of catastrophes. How should we think about what Validus Re is interested in writing in that context? \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: Thanks, Meyer. Well, I mean, Validus Re, since we've acquired them, we have not increased risk appetite. And as a matter of fact, they take a very conservative position in terms of their nets. And I think that was evidenced in the quarter in terms of our overall CAT number. That's number one.\n I think Chris Schaper and the team have done a terrific job of diversification on the portfolio. So we've reduced our aggregates in peak zones, such as Florida, significantly from the original portfolio that we acquired. We're getting better balance in the portfolio across the world, and that's with multiple perils and multiple geographies.\n So I think that, that continuation of that strategy of getting balanced diversification and making sure that we're not taking significant nets in the portfolio and making sure that we're driving risk-adjusted returns as we look to 1/1 is going to be very important for Validus Re. But we've been executing on that throughout the year. \nMeyer Shields: Okay. Understood. And then as a follow-up for Mark, is there any way of describing the -- I mean you made a very strong case for conservatism in the current accident year loss picks. And I'm wondering how you're thinking about that level of conservatism in recent accident years as of 9/30. \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: Go ahead, Mark. \nMark Lyons;Executive VP & CFO: Yes, thanks. Yes, thank you, Peter. Thanks, Meyer. Actually, we feel very good about accident year '20 and '21, I think the core of your question. And I think I've made a pretty strong case for the changes that have occurred, which I think have been, I think, pretty enormous on it.\n And interestingly, overall, I'm confident not just in the current accident years. I'm confident where we are now on the reserve position even and for Financial Lines and in total across the book. And you could kind of say, well, why are you confident? And there's a lot of reasons for it.\n I mean when Dave McElroy and his group got in here, they started making some pretty material underwriting changes step by step. And I think it's just endemic upon the analysis of it for not only the past years but the current year is to focus in on exactly what those changes were and then go back with a very tight eye to look at it. And that's exactly what we did. But the transformation of the book, as I itemized on private not-for-profit and public, has been enormous. So I feel very strongly about where we are on those recent years. \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: Mark, since you mentioned Financial Lines, I think maybe Dave can provide some context as to some of the changes and how he's looking at the portfolio. So Dave, maybe you can add to what Mark commented on. \nDavid McElroy: Yes. Thank you, Peter. Thank you, Mark. The -- I know it's probably top of mind, but the Financial Lines book has been one that has been stored at AIG. And most of you know I've been involved with P&L and Financial Lines for my entire 40-year career. So I've seen the bodies float by me. I've seen the strategies avowed and disavowed. And we knew exactly what we were doing when we came in here to look at this portfolio.\n So today, I would say that both North America and International are completely different and fundamentally different books than what we had in the '16 to '18 cohort years. That's personal to me. That's also Michael Price, who's running North America for us. But we did the things that are -- that matter, and we've been doing it across all of our lines of business in terms of risk selection, limit management, portfolio balance, the diligence on terms and conditions. Mark talked about a little bit on private, and then we're measuring it on claims.\n So the -- this is what this -- I view this as the story that we needed to complete. Mark hit our public company book. That is by and large the measure of a D&O underwriter. And if you're in the public company space, you're talking about your securities class action exposure, and the 67% of your annual loss costs are driven by those cases.\n So when you think about that, it's a math equation of 200 of these are normally filed out of 5,500 total public companies. So risk selection matters. What we found here was probably chasing premium versus chasing quality accounts. So we might -- we were overweighted in technology and life science and health care and new economy and unicorns trying to go public instead of trying to build a portfolio of what I'd consider to be stable, less volatile stocks.\n So from a company class industry standpoint, we gave some more definition to our underwriting teams about what they should be looking at and then trying to stay away from what I consider to be the target-rich environment of the plains thus far, which are stock volatility, market cap volatility and basically a ready-made securities class action case.\n So that's a lot of the re-underwriting that's been done. It's -- we knew it was going to take a little bit of time. The evidence of that is now showing up. We've taken out $65 billion of limits. We -- you've heard our story around $650 billion of limits taken out across the portfolio. $65 billion of it is in these products alone. And more importantly, and that's sort of often how I'm looking at the business is we took it out in primary D&O, okay?\n So the natural order of looking at large -- Fortune 500 companies used to be at $25 million. They're now at $10 million. 81% of our portfolio is at $10 million there versus what would have been $25 million 4 years ago. The same with a -- what I consider to be NASDAQ mid-cap, they were 15s and 10s. They're now $5 million. 66% of the book is now $5 million.\n So we've compressed limits. We've addressed the retention issue. We were trying to -- we recognize that M&A bump-up claims were actually affecting primary underwriters -- and I think that's been on other calls. They were affecting primary underwriters more disparately than excess underwriters. So we increased our retentions there.\n These are all the tools that were always available to us. We just actually pushed them forward. And I -- we're trying to get in front of it, but basically, we believe strongly that this portfolio today is a very different portfolio from a risk selection standpoint, from a balance perspective in terms of excess and side A versus primary versus the limits versus our controlling the aggregate.\n I would also sort of finalize that by saying this is a claims-made book. So in many ways, we'll actually know within that 3- to 5-year window all the work that's been done. And our frequency and severity has dropped dramatically in these '20, '21 years, not only in securities class actions, we're running at less than half. But because of limit management, we're running at 2/3 lower in terms of limits exposed to class action suits as well. So these the are tools... \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: Dave, your passion is coming through very much. We probably want to take another question. \nDavid McElroy: And then, by the way, we have gotten compounded rate increases of 100%. So I apologize, that's... \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: That's terrific. Thank you. \nOperator: Next, we'll hear from Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley. \nMichael Phillips: I'll be -- 2 quick ones, I think. Mark, your comments on, again, the loss pick thing. Number two was, I think, about well the current stuff and it's long-tailed, and that can lead to risk. And so we're going to be conservative, it looks like the industry. I think that was your number two. Can you tell us, has there been any kind of shift in your book given everything else you guys have done and -- from occurrence to claims-made in the Commercial Lines book? So anything noteworthy that would shift away from occurrence to claims-made? \nMark Lyons;Executive VP & CFO: Great question, Michael. So I would say there's only a handful that are really claims-made, right? It's management liability, it's professional indemnity that really drive it, and super tough product liability case is really claims-made.\n It's one thing to shift it gross, it's another thing to ship it net, right? So as we've used different reinsurances over time, that changes the proportions. So we're comfortable with the mix of occurrence and claims-made. There's growth in Financial Lines, as Peter pointed out. And there's some growth in Excess Casualty. The nets are somewhat different but we think appropriate for what we're doing. \nMichael Phillips: Okay. Perfect. And then maybe just a real quick point on one, too, on the last question to Dave's answers in the professional lines. There's clearly lots of concerns in the past 18 months or so because of securities class actions and IPOs and SPACs. Would you say given all Dave's comments there that you think your exposure to that type of risk is pretty limited? \nMark Lyons;Executive VP & CFO: Well, yes, I think how Dave explained it is the way the business actually flows, the business actually works. So the key thing is upfront identifying the right classes and the right risk, which they've really done, I think, exceptionally well. And then the second is what goes through the court systems. Given that you have SCAs, even though we are massively reduced in the SCAs, you got to go through all the motions to dismiss and other procedurals that take it there.\n So that's what Dave's comment about 3 plus -- 3 to 5 years has to work its way through the court system. But given our reduced exposure, back to a similar answer, that makes us feel so strongly about the recent accident years. \nOperator: Next question, Josh Shanker, Bank of America. \nJoshua Shanker: At the risk of being labeled a pariah, I'm going to go back to the D&O questions a little bit. Can we talk a little about the accident year picks, not necessarily for AIG, although it can be, what sort of combined ratios were '16, '17 and '18 producing in retrospect?\n We've seen tremendous pricing come through. Is D&O business broadly for the industry written in those years being written at a substantial underwriting loss? And the extent to which you took the reserve charges in this quarter, a lot of the business, I assume, was syndicated. Are the syndicates feeling the same kind of pain that you are? Or are you getting ahead of what you think are losses to come? \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: Mark, why don't you comment on Josh's question on loss ratios? And then I think Dave should talk about the pricing. \nMark Lyons;Executive VP & CFO: Josh, I know you're speaking of business. And if you go back -- because speaking to the industry is a little different. I don't want to get out ahead of the industry, but I know you're a schedule fee guy. You go back and look at that, of course, that's U.S. only. And you can look direct, not just net. And that's a combination of management liability and professional, right, in there. But we know it's dominated by the management liability side.\n So you can go back and look at the annual statements through 2020 and get an idea. But with regard to syndication, and Dave will pick this up better than I will, but generally, primaries are 100% written. And as you go up the tower, there could be some co-participations, but it's not syndicated like in a huge property transaction the way you're thinking of it. But Dave, do you want to pick that up? \nDavid McElroy: Yes. Thanks, Mark and Josh. Yes, the only thing I'd say there is that you've seen a lot of variability in the schedule piece in terms of portfolios over the years. There can be 40- to 50-point differences consistently. So that speaks to risk selection and the portfolios. But that said, there's definitely verticality that's been happening in those years. That is showing up in the 2019 and 2022 -- 2020 years because the courts did not close for this motion to dismiss and the securities class action. So in fact, if you look at Cornerstone, there were the equal number of settlements in 2020 during COVID that there were in 2019.\n So verticality still exists in this business, market cap loss, disclosed damages and what that happens. So I think there's a lot of immaturity in those years that will continue to show up because the cases are still sort of fermenting. There's a 3- to 5-year window on these claims made. It all ties to the motion to dismiss, but they continue to be argued. I think what we saw was a lot of them were argued, and then when they're decided on -- in the client's behalf, then you start negotiating settlements, okay? If the company wins, they normally go away, therapeutics or defense costs, but that's still an unknown in that '16 to '18 cohort year as the verticality of loss for those cases, okay? A number of them got settled in '20. There's a number that are still getting settled in '21, and there'll still be a number that will be settled in '22. \nJoshua Shanker: I'm going to hold it to one question for you guys, and just congratulations on everyone's new role. \nOperator: Brian Meredith with UBS. \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: And if it's a financial question on the Financial Lines, it will be the last one because I'm going to have to turn it over to Dave again. \nBrian Meredith: I'll give you a broader-based one. Peter, if I look at the return on attributed equity for the General Insurance business right now, you had some corporate costs there. It's still below a double-digit return on equity. I guess my question is, is that your goal to achieve a double-digit ROE in that business? And what does the underlying combined ratio need to be in order to achieve that given the kind of current catastrophe outlook and interest rate environment? \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: Thanks, Brian. As we've said in the past, and I really have the same answer, which is we're really focused on driving the profitability earnings, reducing volatility. We're making great progress on the combined ratio, looking at the investment portfolio over time to have less volatility on the Property and Casualty side. We're working through the separation.\n And it's hard to give you an answer in terms of the absolute combined ratio and returns until we know all the math in terms of the numerator and denominator. Meaning we just need a little bit more time over the next couple of quarters to separate Life and Retirement, have the path of the IPO and the capital structure that we'll outline in more detail for you. But we know that, that is an important guidance in terms of when we are in future state, and we'll work towards that.\n But I think now with the number of moving pieces between the 9.9% in terms of what we're doing to set up the IPO and what we're doing with General Insurance in terms of growth, we see a lot of opportunities to grow with margin and with improved combined ratios over time. And so that's really the primary focus now that giving the ROE guidance once we know the variable is a little bit more fixed, we can do that. \nBrian Meredith: That's fair. And then just one other just quick one. Have you done any work or maybe just some general perspective on what LDTI could mean for your Life Insurance business? \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: Well, we are in progress of implementing the new standards and working through it. And so we're analyzing the guidance that's been issued today, formulating approach. We know that we have the IPO coming up, so we have an enormous amount of resources on it. But it's really just too early for us to provide the estimates. But it's a key area of focus for the company and one that we'll give guidance as we get in subsequent quarters.\n Thanks, Brian. I think that's going to wrap it. Look, I really appreciate it. Appreciate the time. I want to thank all of our colleagues for all the great work, and I hope everybody has a great day. Thank you. \nOperator: And with that, ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude your conference for today. We do thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review our third quarter results. I'm pleased to report that AIG had another outstanding quarter as we continue to build momentum and execute on our strategic priorities. We continue to drive underwriting excellence across our portfolio. We're executing on AIG 200 to instill operational excellence in everything we do. We are continuing to work on the separation of Life and Retirement from AIG. And we're demonstrating an ongoing commitment to thoughtful capital management.\n I will start my remarks with an overview of our consolidated financial results for the third quarter. I will then review our results for General Insurance, where we continue to demonstrate market leadership in solving risk issues for clients while delivering improved underwriting profitability and more consistent results. I'll also comment on certain market dynamics, particularly in the property market, as well as recent CAT activity and related reinsurance considerations as we approach year-end.\n Next, I'll review results from our Life and Retirement business, which we continue to prepare to be a stand-alone company. I will also provide an update on the considerable progress we're making on the operational separation of Life and Retirement from AIG and our strong execution of AIG 200.\n I will then review capital management, where our near-term priorities remain unchanged from those I have outlined in the past: debt reduction, return of capital to shareholders, investment in our business through organic growth and operational improvements.\n Finally, I will conclude with our recently announced senior executive changes that further position AIG for the long term. These appointments were possible due to the strong bench of internal talent and significantly augment the leadership team across our company. I will then turn the call over to Mark, who will provide more detail on our financial results, and then we'll take your questions.\n Starting with our consolidated results. As I said, AIG had another outstanding quarter, continuing the terrific trends we've experienced throughout 2021. Against the backdrop of a very active CAT season and the persistent and ongoing global pandemic, our global team of colleagues continue to perform at an incredibly high level, delivering value to our clients, policyholders and distribution partners.\n Adjusted after-tax income in the third quarter was $0.97 per diluted share compared to $0.81 in the prior year quarter. This result was driven by significant improvement in profitability in General Insurance, very good results in Life and Retirement, continued expense discipline and savings from AIG 200 and executing on our capital management strategy.\n In General Insurance, Global Commercial drove strong top line growth. And we were especially pleased with our adjusted accident year combined ratio, which improved 280 basis points year-over-year to 90.5%. These excellent results in General Insurance validate the strategy we've been executing on to vastly improve the quality of our portfolio and build a top-performing culture of disciplined underwriting.\n One data point that I believe demonstrates the incredible progress we have made is our accident year combined ratio for the first 9 months of 2021, which was 97.7%. That's including CATs. This represents a 770 basis point improvement year-over-year, with 600 of that improvement coming from the loss ratio and 170 from the expense ratio.\n In Life and Retirement, we again had solid results primarily driven by improved investment performance and increased call and tender income. This business delivered a return on adjusted segment common equity of 12.2% for the third quarter and 14.3% for the first 9 months of the year. And we recently achieved an important milestone in the separation process by closing the sale of a 9.9% equity stake in Life and Retirement to Blackstone for $2.2 billion in cash. We continue to prepare the business for an IPO in 2022, and we'll begin moving certain assets under management to Blackstone.\n We ended the third quarter with $5.3 billion in parent liquidity after redeeming $1.5 billion in debt outstanding and completing $1.1 billion in share repurchases. Year-to-date, we have reduced financial debt outstanding by $3.4 billion and have returned $2.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.\n We expect to redeem or repurchase an additional $1 billion of debt in the fourth quarter and to repurchase a minimum of $900 million of common stock through year-end to complete the $2 billion of stock repurchase we announced on our last call. Through these actions, we've made clear our continuing commitment to remain active and thoughtful about capital management.\n Now let me provide more detail on our business results in the third quarter. I will start with General Insurance, where, as I mentioned earlier, growth in net premiums written continued to be very strong, and we achieved our 13th consecutive quarter of improvement in the adjusted accident year combined ratio.\n Adjusting for foreign exchange, net premiums written increased 10% year-over-year to $6.6 billion. This growth was driven by Global Commercial, which increased 15%, with Personal Insurance flat for the quarter.\n Growth in Commercial was balanced between North America and International, with North America increasing 18% and International increasing 12%. Growth in North America Commercial was driven by Excess Casualty, which increased over 50%; Lexington Wholesale, which continued to show leadership in the E&S market and grew Property and Casualty by over 30%; Financial Lines, which increased over 20%; and Crop Risk Services, which grew more than 50% driven by increased commodity prices.\n In International Commercial, Financial Lines grew 25%, Talbot had over 15% growth, and Liability had over 10% growth. In addition, gross new business in Global Commercial grew 40% year-over-year to over $1 billion. In North America, new business growth was more than 50%, and in International, it was more than 25%. North America new business was strongest in Lexington, Financial Lines and Retail Property. International new business came mostly from Financial Lines and our Specialty businesses.\n We also had very strong retention in our in-force portfolio, with North America improving retention by 200 basis points and International improving retention by 700 basis points.\n Turning to rate. Strong momentum continued with overall Global Commercial rate increases of 12%. In many cases, this is the third year where we have achieved double-digit rate increases in our portfolio.\n North America Commercial's overall 11% rate increases were balanced across the portfolio and led by Excess Casualty, which increased over 15%; Financial Lines, which also increased over 15%; and Canada, where rates increased by 17%, representing the 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit rate increases.\n International Commercial rate increases were 13% driven by EMEA, excluding Specialty, which increased by 22%; U.K., excluding Specialty, which increased 21%; Financial Lines, which increased 24%; and Energy, which was up 14%, its 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit rate increases.\n Turning to Global Personal Insurance. We had a solid quarter that reflected a modest rebound in net premiums written in Travel and Warranty, offset by results in the Private Client Group due to reinsurance cessions related to Syndicate 2019 and nonrenewals in peak zones.\n Shifting to underwriting profitability. As I noted earlier, General Insurance's accident year combined ratio ex CAT was 90.5%. The third quarter saw a 150 basis point improvement in the accident year loss ratio ex CAT and a 130 basis point improvement in the expense ratio, all of which came from the GOE ratio. These results were driven by our improved portfolio mix, achieving rate in excess of loss cost trends, continued expense discipline and benefits from AIG 200.\n Global Commercial achieved an impressive accident year combined ratio ex CATs of 88.9%, an improvement of 290 basis points year-over-year and the second consecutive quarter with a sub-90% combined ratio result. The accident year combined ratio ex CAT for North America Commercial and International Commercial were 90.5% and 86.8%, respectively, an improvement of 370 basis points and 210 basis points. In Global Personal Insurance, the accident year combined ratio ex CATs was 94.2%, an improvement of 220 basis points year-over-year driven by improvement in the expense ratio.\n Given the significant progress we have made to improve our combined ratios and our view that the momentum we have will continue for the foreseeable future, we now expect to achieve a sub-90% accident year combined ratio ex CAT for full year 2022. After 3 years of significant underwriting margin improvement, we believe that the sub-90% accident year combined ratio ex CAT is something that not only will be achieved for full year 2022, but that there will continue to be runway for further improvement in future years.\n Turning to CATs. As I said earlier, the third quarter was very active, with current industry estimates ranging between $45 billion and $55 billion globally. We reported approximately $625 million of net global CAT losses with approximately $530 million in Commercial. The largest impacts were from Hurricane Ida and flooding in Europe, where we saw net CAT losses of approximately $400 million and $190 million, respectively.\n We have put significant management focus into our reinsurance program, which continues to perform exceptionally well to reduce volatility, including strategic purchases for wind that we made in the second quarter. Reinsurance recoveries in our International per occurrence, Private Client Group per occurrence and other discrete reinsurance programs also reduced volatility in the third quarter.\n We expect any fourth quarter CAT losses to be limited given that we are close to attaching on our North America aggregate cover and our aggregate cover for rest of the world, excluding Japan. We have each and every loss deductibles of $75 million for North America wind, $50 million for North America earthquake and $25 million for all other North America perils and $20 million for international. Our worldwide retention has approximately $175 million remaining before attaching in the aggregate, which would essentially be for Japan CAT.\n Taking a step back for a moment, I want to acknowledge the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes in recent years. Since 2012 and excluding COVID, there have been 10 CATs with losses exceeding $10 billion. And 9 of those 10 occurred in 2017 through the third quarter of this year.\n Average CAT losses over the last 5 years have been $114 billion, up 30% from the 10-year average and up 40% from the 15-year average. And through 2021, catastrophe losses exceed $100 billion, and we're already at $90 billion through the third quarter. This will be the fourth year in the last 5 years in which natural catastrophes have exceeded this threshold. We've never seen consistent CAT losses at this level and as an industry, need to acknowledge that frequency and severity has changed dramatically as a result of climate change and other factors.\n I'll make 3 observations. First, while CAT models tended to trend acceptable over the last 20 years, that has not been the case over the last 5 years. Second, over the last 5 years, on average, models have been 20% to 30% below the expected value at the lower return periods. If you add in wildfire, those numbers dramatically increase. Third, industry losses compared to model losses at the low end of the curve have been deficient and need rate adjustments to reflect the significant increase in frequency in CATs.\n To address these issues, at AIG, we've invested heavily in our CAT research team to develop our own view of risk in this new environment. As a result of this work, we made frequency and severity adjustments for wildfire, U.S. wind, storm surge, flood as well as numerous other perils in international. We will continue to leverage new scientific studies, improvements in vendor model work and our own claims data to calibrate our views on risk over time to ensure we're appropriately pricing CAT risks.\n Across our portfolio, our strategy and primary focus has been and will continue to be to deliver risk solutions that meet our clients' needs while aligning within our risk appetite, which takes into consideration terms and conditions, strategic deployment of limits and a recognition of increased frequency and severity. The significant focus that we've been applying to the critical work we've been doing is showing through in our financial results as you've seen over the course of 2021 with improving combined ratios, both including and excluding CATs.\n Now turning to Life and Retirement. Earnings continue to be strong, and in the third quarter were supported by stable equity markets, modestly improving interest rates relative to the second quarter and significant call and tender income. Adjusted pretax income in the third quarter was approximately $875 million.\n Individual Retirement, excluding Retail Mutual Funds, which we sold in the third quarter, maintained its upward trajectory with 27% growth in sales year-over-year. Our largest retail product, Index Annuity, was up 50% compared to the prior year quarter.\n Group Retirement collectively grew deposits 3% with new group acquisitions ahead of prior year, but below a robust second quarter. Kevin and his team continued to actively manage the impacts from a low interest rate and tighter credit spreads environment. And their earlier provided range for expected annual spread compression has not changed as base investment spreads for the third quarter were within the annual 8 to 6 points (sic) [ 8 to 16 basis points ] guidance.\n With respect to the operational separation of Life and Retirement, we continue to make considerable progress on a number of fronts. Our goal is to deliver a clean separation with minimal business disruption and emphasis on speed execution, operational efficiency and thoughtful talent allocation.\n We have many work streams in execution mode, including designing a target operating model that will position Life and Retirement to be a successful stand-alone public company, separating IT systems, data centers, software applications, real estate and material vendor contracts and determining where transition services will be required and minimizing their duration with clear exit plans.\n We continue to expect an IPO to occur in the first quarter of 2022 or potentially in the second quarter, subject to regulatory approvals and market conditions. As I mentioned on our last call, due to the sale of our affordable housing portfolio and the execution of certain tax strategies, we are no longer constrained in terms of how much of Life and Retirement we can sell on an IPO.\n Having said that, we currently expect to retain a greater than 50% interest immediately following the IPO and to continue to consolidate Life and Retirement's financial statements until such time as we fall below the 50% ownership threshold. As we plan for the full separation of Life and Retirement, the timing of further secondary offerings will be based on market conditions and other relevant factors over time.\n With respect to AIG 200, we continue to advance this program and remain on track to deliver $1 billion in run rate savings across the company by the end of 2022 against a cost to achieve of $1.3 billion. $660 million of run rate savings are already executed or contracted, with approximately $400 million recognized to date in our income statement.\n As with the underwriting turnaround, which created a culture of underwriting excellence, AIG 200 is creating a culture of operational excellence that is becoming the way we work across AIG.\n Before turning the call over to Mark, I'd like to take a moment to discuss the senior leadership changes we announced last week. Having made significant progress during the first 9 months of 2021 across our strategic priorities and in light of the momentum we have heading towards the end of the year, this was an ideal time to make these appointments.\n I'll start with Mark, who will step into a newly created role, Global Chief Actuary and Head of Portfolio Management for AIG on January 1. As you all know, over the last 3 years, Mark has played a critical role in the repositioning of AIG. He originally joined AIG in 2018 as our Chief Actuary. And this new role will get him back into the core of our business, driving portfolio improvement, growth and prudent decision-making by providing guidance on important performance metrics within our risk appetite and evolving our reinsurance program.\n Shane Fitzsimons will take over for Mark as Chief Financial Officer on January 1. Shane joined AIG in 2019, and his strong leadership helped accelerate aspects of AIG 200 and instill discipline and rigor around our finance transformation, strategic planning, budgeting and forecasting processes. He has a strong financial and accounting background having worked at GE for over 20 years in many senior finance roles, including as Head of FP&A and Chief Financial Officer of GE's international operations. Shane has already begun working with Mark on a transition plan, and we've shifted his AIG 200 and shared services responsibility to other senior leaders.\n We also announced that Elias Habayeb has been named Chief Financial Officer of Life and Retirement. Elias has been with AIG for over 15 years and was most recently our Deputy CFO and Principal Accounting Officer for AIG as well as the CFO for General Insurance. Elias has deep expertise about AIG. And his transition to Life and Retirement will be seamless as he is well known to that management team, the investments team that is now part of Life and Retirement, our regulators, rating agencies and many other stakeholders.\n Overall, I am very pleased with our team, our third quarter results and the tremendous progress we're making on many fronts across AIG.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark. Great, Mark, thank you. Operator, we'll take our first question. Well, thanks, Elyse. Let me answer the first part why we're so confident that the momentum that we have and the sub-90% combined ratio is achievable. When you look at this quarter and last quarter, just the improvement from the core of the businesses continues to improve at an accelerated pace. And Dave McElroy and the leadership team on the underwriting side, Shane who's now going to move into the CFO role driving AIG 200, just the execution has been terrific.\n And why we're confident it's just, again, the momentum when we look at the fundamentals of the business, we're growing top line. We talk, Mark and I, about that we're getting pricing above loss cost, developing margin, expense ratio. All of that goes into our confidence. We have higher retentions on a policy count, very strong new business and think that applied to quality. We have more relevance each quarter in the marketplace.\n And so the assumptions are modest. It's not that it has to stay in the same pricing environment. But it is one that we are going to continue to be very disciplined of driving profitability and making sure that where we're deploying capital, that on a risk-adjusted basis, we're going to be getting margin. So I think that -- again, I don't want to give guidance beyond that but feel that next year, we have the momentum. We're executing on all of our strategic imperatives, and we're delivering the results. Well, we've been trying to give a lot of guidance in terms of what we intend to do in the short run because of a number of moving pieces. We have strong liquidity, which is what we had talked about in the prepared remarks. Some of the big moving pieces as we get to the back half of the year will be the affordable housing proceeds, the closing of Blackstone, the fact that we're going to continue to execute on debt reduction, share repurchases.\n And I think as we get to the fourth quarter call and we have a better line of sight in terms of what we think the actual timing will be on the IPO plus liquidity at year-end, we'll give further guidance as we move forward. But for now, I think we're just going to stick with what we've outlined, and we continue to execute on that each quarter. Thanks, Meyer. Well, I mean, Validus Re, since we've acquired them, we have not increased risk appetite. And as a matter of fact, they take a very conservative position in terms of their nets. And I think that was evidenced in the quarter in terms of our overall CAT number. That's number one.\n I think Chris Schaper and the team have done a terrific job of diversification on the portfolio. So we've reduced our aggregates in peak zones, such as Florida, significantly from the original portfolio that we acquired. We're getting better balance in the portfolio across the world, and that's with multiple perils and multiple geographies.\n So I think that, that continuation of that strategy of getting balanced diversification and making sure that we're not taking significant nets in the portfolio and making sure that we're driving risk-adjusted returns as we look to 1/1 is going to be very important for Validus Re. But we've been executing on that throughout the year. Go ahead, Mark. Mark, since you mentioned Financial Lines, I think maybe Dave can provide some context as to some of the changes and how he's looking at the portfolio. So Dave, maybe you can add to what Mark commented on. Dave, your passion is coming through very much. We probably want to take another question. That's terrific. Thank you. Mark, why don't you comment on Josh's question on loss ratios? And then I think Dave should talk about the pricing. And if it's a financial question on the Financial Lines, it will be the last one because I'm going to have to turn it over to Dave again. Thanks, Brian. As we've said in the past, and I really have the same answer, which is we're really focused on driving the profitability earnings, reducing volatility. We're making great progress on the combined ratio, looking at the investment portfolio over time to have less volatility on the Property and Casualty side. We're working through the separation.\n And it's hard to give you an answer in terms of the absolute combined ratio and returns until we know all the math in terms of the numerator and denominator. Meaning we just need a little bit more time over the next couple of quarters to separate Life and Retirement, have the path of the IPO and the capital structure that we'll outline in more detail for you. But we know that, that is an important guidance in terms of when we are in future state, and we'll work towards that.\n But I think now with the number of moving pieces between the 9.9% in terms of what we're doing to set up the IPO and what we're doing with General Insurance in terms of growth, we see a lot of opportunities to grow with margin and with improved combined ratios over time. And so that's really the primary focus now that giving the ROE guidance once we know the variable is a little bit more fixed, we can do that. Well, we are in progress of implementing the new standards and working through it. And so we're analyzing the guidance that's been issued today, formulating approach. We know that we have the IPO coming up, so we have an enormous amount of resources on it. But it's really just too early for us to provide the estimates. But it's a key area of focus for the company and one that we'll give guidance as we get in subsequent quarters.\n Thanks, Brian. I think that's going to wrap it. Look, I really appreciate it. Appreciate the time. I want to thank all of our colleagues for all the great work, and I hope everybody has a great day. Thank you."

            "name": "David McElroy",
            "content": "Yes. Thank you, Peter. Thank you, Mark. The -- I know it's probably top of mind, but the Financial Lines book has been one that has been stored at AIG. And most of you know I've been involved with P&L and Financial Lines for my entire 40-year career. So I've seen the bodies float by me. I've seen the strategies avowed and disavowed. And we knew exactly what we were doing when we came in here to look at this portfolio.\n So today, I would say that both North America and International are completely different and fundamentally different books than what we had in the '16 to '18 cohort years. That's personal to me. That's also Michael Price, who's running North America for us. But we did the things that are -- that matter, and we've been doing it across all of our lines of business in terms of risk selection, limit management, portfolio balance, the diligence on terms and conditions. Mark talked about a little bit on private, and then we're measuring it on claims.\n So the -- this is what this -- I view this as the story that we needed to complete. Mark hit our public company book. That is by and large the measure of a D&O underwriter. And if you're in the public company space, you're talking about your securities class action exposure, and the 67% of your annual loss costs are driven by those cases.\n So when you think about that, it's a math equation of 200 of these are normally filed out of 5,500 total public companies. So risk selection matters. What we found here was probably chasing premium versus chasing quality accounts. So we might -- we were overweighted in technology and life science and health care and new economy and unicorns trying to go public instead of trying to build a portfolio of what I'd consider to be stable, less volatile stocks.\n So from a company class industry standpoint, we gave some more definition to our underwriting teams about what they should be looking at and then trying to stay away from what I consider to be the target-rich environment of the plains thus far, which are stock volatility, market cap volatility and basically a ready-made securities class action case.\n So that's a lot of the re-underwriting that's been done. It's -- we knew it was going to take a little bit of time. The evidence of that is now showing up. We've taken out $65 billion of limits. We -- you've heard our story around $650 billion of limits taken out across the portfolio. $65 billion of it is in these products alone. And more importantly, and that's sort of often how I'm looking at the business is we took it out in primary D&O, okay?\n So the natural order of looking at large -- Fortune 500 companies used to be at $25 million. They're now at $10 million. 81% of our portfolio is at $10 million there versus what would have been $25 million 4 years ago. The same with a -- what I consider to be NASDAQ mid-cap, they were 15s and 10s. They're now $5 million. 66% of the book is now $5 million.\n So we've compressed limits. We've addressed the retention issue. We were trying to -- we recognize that M&A bump-up claims were actually affecting primary underwriters -- and I think that's been on other calls. They were affecting primary underwriters more disparately than excess underwriters. So we increased our retentions there.\n These are all the tools that were always available to us. We just actually pushed them forward. And I -- we're trying to get in front of it, but basically, we believe strongly that this portfolio today is a very different portfolio from a risk selection standpoint, from a balance perspective in terms of excess and side A versus primary versus the limits versus our controlling the aggregate.\n I would also sort of finalize that by saying this is a claims-made book. So in many ways, we'll actually know within that 3- to 5-year window all the work that's been done. And our frequency and severity has dropped dramatically in these '20, '21 years, not only in securities class actions, we're running at less than half. But because of limit management, we're running at 2/3 lower in terms of limits exposed to class action suits as well. So these the are tools... And then, by the way, we have gotten compounded rate increases of 100%. So I apologize, that's... Yes. Thanks, Mark and Josh. Yes, the only thing I'd say there is that you've seen a lot of variability in the schedule piece in terms of portfolios over the years. There can be 40- to 50-point differences consistently. So that speaks to risk selection and the portfolios. But that said, there's definitely verticality that's been happening in those years. That is showing up in the 2019 and 2022 -- 2020 years because the courts did not close for this motion to dismiss and the securities class action. So in fact, if you look at Cornerstone, there were the equal number of settlements in 2020 during COVID that there were in 2019.\n So verticality still exists in this business, market cap loss, disclosed damages and what that happens. So I think there's a lot of immaturity in those years that will continue to show up because the cases are still sort of fermenting. There's a 3- to 5-year window on these claims made. It all ties to the motion to dismiss, but they continue to be argued. I think what we saw was a lot of them were argued, and then when they're decided on -- in the client's behalf, then you start negotiating settlements, okay? If the company wins, they normally go away, therapeutics or defense costs, but that's still an unknown in that '16 to '18 cohort year as the verticality of loss for those cases, okay? A number of them got settled in '20. There's a number that are still getting settled in '21, and there'll still be a number that will be settled in '22."

            "name": "Mark Lyons;Executive VP & CFO",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter, and good morning to all. I am extremely pleased with the strong adjusted earnings this quarter of $0.97 per share and our profitable General Insurance calendar quarter combined ratio, which includes CATs, of 99.7%. The year-over-year adjusted EPS improvement was driven by a 750 basis point reduction in the General Insurance calendar quarter combined ratio, strong growth in net premiums written and earned and a related 280 basis point decrease in the underlying accident year combined ratio ex CAT. Life and Retirement also produced strong APTI of $877 million, along with a healthy adjusted ROE of 12.2%.\n The quarter's strong operating earnings and consistent investment performance helped increase adjusted book value per share by 3% sequentially and nearly 9% compared to 1 year ago. The strength of our balance sheet and strong liquidity position were highlights in the period as we made continued progress on our leverage goals with a GAAP debt leverage reduction of 90 basis points sequentially and 350 basis points from 1 year ago today to 26.1%, generated through retained earnings and liability management actions.\n Shifting to General Insurance. Due to our achieved profitable growth to date, together with demonstrable volatility reduction and smart cycle management, makes us even more confident in achieving our stated goal of a sub-90% accident year combined ratio ex CAT for full year 2022 rather than just exiting 2022.\n Shifting now to current conditions. The markets in which we operate persist in strength and show resiliency. AIG's global platform continues to see rate strengthening internationally, which adds to our overall uplift unlike more U.S.-centric competitors. As you recall, International Commercial rate increases lagged those in North America initially. But beginning in 2021, as noted by Peter in his remarks, International is now producing rate increases that surpass those strong rates still being achieved in North America, and in some areas, meaningfully so.\n These rate increases continue to outstrip loss cost trends on a global basis across a broadband of assumptions and are additive towards additional margin expansion. In fact, for a more extensive view, within North America over the 3-year period, 2019 through 2021, product lines that achieved cumulative rate increases near or above 100% are found within Excess Casualty, both admitted and non-admitted; Property Lines, both admitted and non-admitted; and Financial Lines. We believe these levels of tailwind will continue driving earned margin expansion into the foreseeable future.\n In the current inflationary environment, it's important to remember that products with inflation-sensitive exposure bases, such as sales, receipts and payroll, act as an inflation mitigant and furthermore are subject to additional audit premiums as the economy recovers.\n Last quarter, we provided commentary about U.S. portfolio loss cost trends of 4% to 5% and in some aspects were viewed as being near term. We believe that this range still holds but now gravitates towards the upper end given another quarter of data. And in fact, our U.S. loss cost trends range from approximately 3.5% to 10%, depending on the line of business.\n From a pricing perspective, we feel that we are integrating these near-term inflationary impact into our rating and portfolio tools. And we are not lowering any line of business loss cost trends since lighter claims reporting may be misconstrued as a false positive due to COVID-19 societal impacts.\n It's also worth noting that all of our North America Commercial Lines loss cost trends, with the exception of workers' compensation, are materially lower than the corresponding rate increases we are seeing. This discussion around compound rate increases and loss cost trends collectively give rise to the related topic of current year loss ratio picks or indications and the result in bookings. The strong market that we now enjoy, in conjunction with the significant underwriting transformation at AIG, has driven other aspects of the portfolio that affect loss ratios.\n In many lines and classes of business, the degree that cumulative rate changes have outpaced cumulative loss cost trend is substantial. And these lead to meaningfully reduced loss ratio indications between 2018 and the 2021 years. Unfortunately, this is where most discussions usually cease with external stakeholders. However, in reality, that is not the end of the discussion but merely the beginning.\n Some other aspects that can have material favorable implications towards the profitability of underlying businesses are, one, terms and conditions, which can rival price in the impact; two, a much more balanced submission flow across the insured risk quality spectrum, thereby improving rate adequacy and mitigating adverse selection; three, strategic capacity deployment across various layers of an insurance tower, which can produce preferred positioning and ongoing retention with the customer; and fourth, reinsurance that tempers volatility and mitigates net losses.\n Accordingly, even if modest loss ratio beneficial impacts are assigned to each of these nuances, they will additionally contribute to further driving down the 2021 indicated loss ratio beyond that signaled by rate versus loss trend alone. And these are real, and these are happening.\n So why are product lines booked at this implied level of profitability by any insurer? Well, there is at least 4 reasons. First, insurers assume the heterogeneous risk of others, and each year is composed of different exposures, rendering so-called on-level projections to be imperfect. Second, most policies are written on an occurrence basis, which means the policy language can be challenged for years, if not decades, potentially including novel series of liability. Third, many lines are extremely volatile and even if every insured is underwritten perfectly -- even if every insured is underwritten perfectly. And fourth, booking an overly optimistic initial loss ratio merely increases the chance of future unfavorable development. Therefore, these types of issues require prudence in the establishment of initial loss ratio picks for most commercial lines of business.\n Shifting now to our third quarter reserve review. Approximately $42 billion of reserves were reviewed this quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to approximately 90% of carried pre-ADC reserves. I'd like to spend a little time taking you through the results of our quarterly reserve analysis, which resulted in minimal net movement, confirming the strength of our overall reserve position.\n On a pre-ADC basis, the prior year development was $153 million favorable. On a post-ADC basis, it was $3 million favorable. And when reflecting the $47 million ADC amortization on the deferred gain, it was $50 million favorable in total. This means that our overall reserves continue to be adequate, with favorable and unfavorable development balanced across lines of business, resulting in an improved yet neutral alignment of reserves.\n Now before looking at the quarter on a segment basis, I'd like to strip away some noise that's in the quarter so we don't get overly lost in the details. One should think of this quarter's reserve analysis as performing all of the scheduled product reviews and then having to overlay 2 seemingly unrelated impacts caused by the receipt of a large subrogation recovery associated with the 2017 and 2018 California wildfires.\n The first of these 2 impacts is the direct reduction from North America Personal Insurance reserves of $326 million, resulting from the subrogation recoveries. As a result, we also had to reverse a previously recorded 2018 accident year reinsurance recovery in North America Commercial Insurance of $206 million since the attachment point was no longer penetrated once the subrogation recoveries were received.\n These 2 impacts from the subrogation recovery resulted in a net $120 million of favorable development. So excluding their impact restates the total General Insurance PYD as being $70 million unfavorable in total rather than the $50 million of favorable development discussed earlier. This is a better framework to discuss the true underlying reserve movements this quarter.\n This $70 million of global unfavorable stems from $85 million unfavorable in global CAT losses together with $50 million favorable in global non-CAT or attritional losses. The $85 million unfavorable in CAT is driven by marginal adjustments involving multiple prior year events from 2019 and 2020. The $15 million non-CAT favorable stems from the net of $255 million unfavorable from Global Commercial and $270 million of favorable development, predominantly from short-tail personal lines businesses within accident year 2020, mostly in our International book. Consistent with our overall reserving philosophy, we were cautious towards reacting to this $270 million favorable indication until we allow the accident year to season.\n North America Commercial had unfavorable development of $112 million, which was driven by Financial Lines' strengthening of approximately $400 million with favorable development and other lines led by workers' compensation with approximately $200 million, emanating mostly from accident years 2015 and prior and approximately $100 million across various other units. North America Financial Lines were negatively impacted by primary public D&O, largely in the more complex national accounts arena and within private not-for-profit D&O unit, in addition to some excess coverage mostly in the public D&O space, with 90% emanating from accident years 2016 to 2018.\n International Commercial had unfavorable development of $143 million, which was comprised of Financial Lines' strengthening in D&O and professional indemnity of approximately $300 million led by the U.K. and Europe, but the accident year impacts are more spread out. Favorable development was led by our Specialty businesses at roughly $110 million with an additional favorable of approximately $50 million stemming from various lines and regions.\n Now as Peter noted, the changes we've made to our underwriting culture and risk appetite over the last few years, coupled with strong market conditions, are now showing through in our financial results. U.S. Financial Lines, in particular, through careful underwriting and risk selection has meaningfully reduced our exposure to securities class actions or SCA lawsuits over the last few years.\n Evidence of this underwriting change is best seen through the proportion of SCAs for which the U.S. operation has provided coverage. In 2017, AIG provided D&O coverage to 67 insurers involved in SCAs, which represents 42% of all U.S. federal security class actions in that year. Whereas in 2020, that shrunk to just 18%, and through 9 months of 2021 is only 15 insurers or 14%. This is significant because roughly 60% to 70% of public D&O loss dollars historically emanate from SCAs.\n The North America private not-for-profit D&O book has also been significantly transformed. The policy retention rate here between 2018 and 2021, which is a key strategic target, is just 15%. And yet it should also be noted that the corresponding cumulative rate increase over the same period is nearly 130%. This purposeful change in risk selection criteria away from billion-dollar revenue large private companies and nonprofit universities and hospitals to instead a more balanced middle market book will also drive profitability substantially.\n International Financial Lines has implemented similar underwriting actions with comparable 3-year cumulative rate increases, along with a singular underwriting authority around the world as respect U.S.-listed D&O exposure through close collaboration with the U.S. Chief Underwriting Office.\n In summary, our reserving philosophy remains consistent in that we will continue to be prudent and conservative. This is evidenced by our slower recognition of attritional improvements in short-tail lines from accident year 2020 and from the sound decision to strengthen Financial Line reserves, even though there are some interpretive challenges stemming from a difficult claims environment, changes within our internal claims operations over the last couple of years and potential COVID-19 impacts on claim reporting patterns. All of these underwriting actions we've taken over the last few years make us even more confident in our total reserve position across both prior and current accident years.\n Moving on to Life and Retirement. The year-to-date ROE has been a strong 14.3% compared to 12.8% in the first 9 months of last year. APTI during the third quarter saw higher net investment income and higher fee income, offset by the unfavorable impact from the annual actuarial assumption update, which is $166 million pretax, negatively affected the ROE by approximately 250 basis points on an annual basis and EPS by $0.15 per share. The main source of the impact was in the Individual Retirement division associated with fixed annuity spread compression.\n Life Insurance reflected a slightly elevated COVID-19-related mortality provision in the quarter. But our exposure sensitivity of $65 million to $75 million per 100,000 population deaths proved accurate based on the reported third quarter COVID-related deaths in the United States. Mortality exclusive of COVID-19 was also slightly elevated in the period.\n Within Individual Retirement, excluding the Retail Mutual Fund business, net flows were a positive $250 million this quarter compared to net outflows of $110 million in the prior year quarter largely due to the recovery from the broad industry-wide sales disruption resulting from COVID-19, which we view as a material rebound indicator.\n Prior sensitivities in respect to yield and equity market movements affecting APTI continue to hold true. And new business margins generally remain within our targets at current new money returns due to active product management and disciplined pricing approach.\n Moving to other operations. The adjusted pretax loss before consolidations and eliminations was $370 million, $2 million higher than the prior quarter of 2020, driven by higher corporate GOE primarily from increases in performance-based employee compensation, partially offset by higher investment income and lower corporate interest expense resulting from year-to-date debt redemption activity.\n Shifting to investments. Overall net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.3 billion, an increase of $78 million compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting mostly higher private equity gains.\n By business, Life and Retirement benefited most due to asset growth, higher call and tender income and another strong period of private equity returns. General Insurance's NII declined approximately 6% year-over-year due to continued yield compression and underperformance in the hedge fund position. Also, General Insurance has a much higher percentage allocation to private equity and hedge funds, which is likely to change moving forward.\n As respect share count, our average total diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 864 million, and we repurchased approximately 20 million shares. The end-of-period outstanding shares for book value per share purposes was approximately 836 million and anticipated to be approximately 820 million at year-end 2021 depending upon share price performance, given Peter's comments on additional share repurchases.\n Lastly, our primary operating subsidiaries remain profitable and well capitalized, with General Insurance's U.S. pool fleet risk-based capital ratio for the third quarter estimated to be between 450% and 460%. And the Life and Retirement U.S. fleet is estimated to be between 440% and 450%, both above our target ranges.\n With that, I'll now turn it back over to Peter. Yes, thanks. Yes, thank you, Peter. Thanks, Meyer. Actually, we feel very good about accident year '20 and '21, I think the core of your question. And I think I've made a pretty strong case for the changes that have occurred, which I think have been, I think, pretty enormous on it.\n And interestingly, overall, I'm confident not just in the current accident years. I'm confident where we are now on the reserve position even and for Financial Lines and in total across the book. And you could kind of say, well, why are you confident? And there's a lot of reasons for it.\n I mean when Dave McElroy and his group got in here, they started making some pretty material underwriting changes step by step. And I think it's just endemic upon the analysis of it for not only the past years but the current year is to focus in on exactly what those changes were and then go back with a very tight eye to look at it. And that's exactly what we did. But the transformation of the book, as I itemized on private not-for-profit and public, has been enormous. So I feel very strongly about where we are on those recent years. Great question, Michael. So I would say there's only a handful that are really claims-made, right? It's management liability, it's professional indemnity that really drive it, and super tough product liability case is really claims-made.\n It's one thing to shift it gross, it's another thing to ship it net, right? So as we've used different reinsurances over time, that changes the proportions. So we're comfortable with the mix of occurrence and claims-made. There's growth in Financial Lines, as Peter pointed out. And there's some growth in Excess Casualty. The nets are somewhat different but we think appropriate for what we're doing. Well, yes, I think how Dave explained it is the way the business actually flows, the business actually works. So the key thing is upfront identifying the right classes and the right risk, which they've really done, I think, exceptionally well. And then the second is what goes through the court systems. Given that you have SCAs, even though we are massively reduced in the SCAs, you got to go through all the motions to dismiss and other procedurals that take it there.\n So that's what Dave's comment about 3 plus -- 3 to 5 years has to work its way through the court system. But given our reduced exposure, back to a similar answer, that makes us feel so strongly about the recent accident years. Josh, I know you're speaking of business. And if you go back -- because speaking to the industry is a little different. I don't want to get out ahead of the industry, but I know you're a schedule fee guy. You go back and look at that, of course, that's U.S. only. And you can look direct, not just net. And that's a combination of management liability and professional, right, in there. But we know it's dominated by the management liability side.\n So you can go back and look at the annual statements through 2020 and get an idea. But with regard to syndication, and Dave will pick this up better than I will, but generally, primaries are 100% written. And as you go up the tower, there could be some co-participations, but it's not syndicated like in a huge property transaction the way you're thinking of it. But Dave, do you want to pick that up?"

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, good day, and welcome to AIG's Second Quarter 2021 Financial Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead. \nQuentin McMillan: Thank you, Nora. Today's remarks may contain forward-looking statements, including comments related to company performance, strategic priorities, including AIG's pursuit of a separation of its Life and Retirement business, business mix and market conditions and the effects of COVID-19 on AIG. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. Actual performance and events may differ materially. \n Factors that could cause results to differ include the factors described in our first quarter 2021 report on Form 10-Q, our 2020 annual report on Form 10-K and other recent filings made with the SEC. AIG is not under any obligation and expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. \n Additionally, some remarks may refer to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at www.aig.com. \n With that, I will now turn the call over to Peter Zaffino, President and CEO of AIG. \nPeter Zaffino: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. We have a lot of topics to cover this morning as we made significant progress on many initiatives over the last 90 days. \n I will start today's remarks with an overview of AIG's outstanding consolidated financial results for the second quarter. Then I will review results for General Insurance and Life and Retirement in more detail. Following that, I will provide an update on the progress we're making on AIG 200 and the operational separation of Life and Retirement from AIG. \n Next, I will provide details on the strategic partnership we announced with Blackstone in July, which represents a significant milestone for AIG and a major step forward towards the IPO of Life and Retirement. And lastly, I will provide an update on our capital management strategy where our near-term priorities remain the same as what I've outlined in the past: debt reduction, return of capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and investment in organic growth. Mark will provide additional details on the quarter and we'll then take questions. \n Starting with our consolidated results, I'm pleased to report that AIG had an outstanding second quarter. We have sustained the significant momentum we had coming into 2021 through the first half of the year and delivered exceptional performance in General Insurance with strong top line growth and significant improvement in our combined ratios. Our pivot to growth and focus on demonstrating leadership in the marketplace accelerated through the second quarter as we continued to prioritize underwriting discipline, portfolio optimization, reducing volatility and growing in segments where market conditions are favorable and fall within our risk appetite. \n We also saw very good results in our Life and Retirement business, primarily driven by improved investment performance. Life and Retirement's adjusted pretax income increased 26% year-over-year, and the business delivered a return on adjusted segment common equity of 16.4%. We continue to advance AIG 200 with the transformation remaining on track to deliver $1 billion in run rate savings across the company by the end of 2022 against a cost to achieve of $1.3 billion. And as you saw in our press release, our adjusted after-tax income in the second quarter was $1.52 per diluted share compared to $0.64 in the prior year quarter. \n Turning to our financial results. I'll start with General Insurance. Growth in net premiums written was very strong in the second quarter, accelerating from the first quarter and continuing the trend that began in 2020 as our heaviest remediation efforts were nearing completion. Net premiums written increased 24% year-over-year to $6.9 billion or approximately 20%, excluding foreign exchange. Growth was strong across both Global Commercial and Personal. Global Commercial net premiums written increased 13%, excluding foreign exchange, reflecting growth in areas with attractive risk-adjusted returns, improving renewal retentions and more than 25% increase in new business compared to the prior year quarter and overall rate increases of 13%. \n North America Commercial net premiums written increased 15%, excluding foreign exchange, including strong growth in Excess Casualty, Financial Lines, Retail Property, AIG Re and Lexington. New business increased 25% from the prior year quarter, led by Financial Lines and Lexington wholesale. And renewal retentions improved 300 basis points over the same period. It's worth noting that Lexington had its strongest quarter of new business since we fully repositioned its operating model to focus on wholesale distribution and Excess & Surplus Lines. This business has significant momentum, which we expect will continue for the foreseeable future. \n Shifting to International Commercial. Net premiums written grew 10%, excluding foreign exchange, primarily driven by Financial Lines across the U.K., EMEA and Asia Pacific; global specialty, particularly marine and energy; and Talbot, our Lloyd's syndicate. New business increased 26% from the prior year period, led by Financial Lines, marine, energy and Talbot. And renewal retentions increased by 500 basis points over the same period. It's important to emphasize that the growth we are achieving across Commercial is aligned with our risk appetite that we have been executing against over the past 3 years. \n We continue to prudently deploy limits, including with respect to new business, with an intense focus on risk aggregation. In addition to strong retention, our growth is being driven by exceptional new business, which in Global Commercial was $1 billion in the second quarter. With respect to Personal Insurance, as we discussed on last quarter's call, the unusually high growth in net premiums written was largely reflective of the creation of Syndicate 2019 in the second quarter of 2020 and the reinsurance cessions associated with creating that syndicate. \n Turning to rate. Momentum continued with overall Global Commercial rate increases of 13%. North America Commercial rate increases were 13% with the most notable improvements in Excess Casualty, which was up 20%; Lexington Casualty, which was up 19%; and Lexington wholesale property, which was up 15%. International Commercial rate increases were also 13%, driven by Financial Lines, which was up 21%; property, which was up 18%; and energy, which was up 16%. \n Across the global portfolio, the largest rate increases were in cyber, where rates were up almost 40% with the strongest rate increases in North America. We continue to carefully reduce cyber limits and are obtaining tighter terms and conditions to address increasing cyber loss trends, the rising threat associated with ransomware and the systemic nature of cyber risk generally. Underwriting excellence, thoughtful risk selection, tighter terms and conditions and improving rate adequacy have been core areas of focus as we transformed our portfolio. \n The General Insurance accident year combined ratio ex CAT improved for the 12th consecutive quarter, coming in at 91.1%, an improvement of 380 basis points from the second quarter of 2020 and an improvement of 990 basis points from the second quarter of 2018. This improvement was comprised of 160 basis point improvement in the accident year loss ratio ex CAT and a 220 basis point improvement in the expense ratio as AIG 200 and the benefits of premium growth continued to contribute to profitability. \n Global Commercial achieved an accident year combined ratio ex CAT of 89.3%, an improvement of 500 basis points year-over-year. This is the best result Commercial has reported in the last 15 years. In Personal Insurance, the accident year combined ratio ex CAT was 95.1%, a 70 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter. \n Now just a quick comment on reinsurance purchased across General Insurance, where we continue to evolve our reinsurance program to reflect our significantly improved underlying portfolio. In the second quarter, we were very active in the market with 25 specific layers on a variety of treaties placed. Notably, in nearly every instance, we were able to enhance our terms and conditions and our placements were at equivalent or improved pricing in a reinsurance market that is experiencing tighter terms and conditions and rate increases. \n With respect to our property CAT program in particular, we took the opportunity in the second quarter to further reduce our per occurrence attachment point in North America through several buy-down CAT layers for peak zone exposures. Lastly, on General Insurance, we remain confident that we will achieve a sub-90% accident year combined ratio ex CAT by the end of 2022. \n Based on the progress that I've seen in our underwriting, the ongoing efforts in optimizing our portfolio, the terrific execution of AIG 200 and the significant momentum we've developed, I'm optimistic we'll get there sooner. As we move through the second half of the year and get further into AIG 200 in separation execution, we will provide further comment on our combined ratio expectations. \n Now let me turn to AIG Re, which oversees our global assumed reinsurance business. Net premiums written across all lines increased more than 30% in the second quarter compared to the prior year period. Writings were balanced across multiple lines of business with risk-adjusted returns and underwriting ratios improving across the portfolio. Highlights of AIG Re's second quarter results include the following. In U.S. property CAT, we saw rate improvements across all U.S. property business sectors. Increases range from mid-single-digits to upwards of 25%, depending on geography and loss-affected accounts. \n In Florida, Validus Re net limits at June 2021 were reduced by more than 40% in coordination with AlphaCat. Since AIG's acquisition of Validus Re in 2018, we reduced the overall limit in Florida by more than 65% or approximately $400 million of annual limit, demonstrating Validus Re's continued discipline and focus on volatility reduction. Further, Florida-specific firms now represent less than 2% of Validus Re's total net premiums written. Our focus remains on regional and nationwide firms in the U.S. as well as international diversification. \n In addition, in 2020 and through the second quarter of 2021, less than 25% of AIG Re's net premiums written came from property lines. Building on our retrocessional purchase on 1/1 of worldwide aggregate protection, Validus Re secured further retrocessional protections in June. Specifically, we purchased more peak zone coverage for U.S. wind, Asia wind and California earthquake for the 2021 season. Overall, we have substantially enhanced our portfolio despite heightened competition. \n We're very pleased with how AIG Re has evolved. We have exceptionally strong intermediary market support as well as strong client relationships, which have resulted in significant renewal retention and signings. In addition, we've upgraded the talent across the board and have broadened the skill sets of our leaders. We believe this business is much more prepared to assess and opportunistically respond to market conditions. \n Turning to Life and Retirement. This business once again delivered very strong results. Life and Retirement's broad leadership position across products and channels enabled us to take advantage of the significant rebound in retail annuity sales with total annuity sales up significantly across our entire annuity offering. Our strong sales resulted in positive Individual Retirement annuity net flows during the quarter. Group Retirement deposits were higher compared to first quarter 2021 levels. And second quarter 2021 new plan participant enrollments increased 20% year-over-year. \n As demonstrated regularly in recent quarters, our high-quality investment portfolio is well positioned to navigate uncertain environments. Our variable annuity hedging program has continued to perform as expected, providing downside protection during prolonged periods of volatility. Finally, the strategic partnership with Blackstone further positions Life and Retirement to expand its distribution relationships, enhance its product offerings, and the business will benefit from Blackstone's significant capabilities. \n Now let me turn to AIG 200, our global multiyear effort to position AIG for the long term. AIG 200 is continuing with a sense of urgency with all 10 operational programs deep into execution mode. We're 18 months into the transformation. And we have a clear execution path to $1 billion in run rate cost savings with $550 million already executed or contracted, $355 million of which has been recognized to date in our income statement. AIG 200 continues to build a strong foundation across the company and instill a culture of operational excellence. \n Turning to the separation of Life and Retirement. We made considerable progress in the second quarter with a focus on speed execution with minimal business disruption. Our separation management office has identified day 1 requirements for Life and Retirement to become a stand-alone company and multiple work streams are under way. This work includes aligning our investments unit with Life and Retirement and preparing for the Blackstone partnership to close. The speed with which our colleagues have moved would not have been possible without the foundational work that's been done as part of AIG 200. \n As I've discussed on prior calls, an IPO of up to 19.9% of Life and Retirement was our base case since we announced our intention to separate the business from AIG last October. And we continue to believe an IPO will maximize value for our stakeholders and position the business for additional value creation as a public company. I also noted on our last call that following our announcement, we received several credible inquiries from parties interested in purchasing a minority stake in Life and Retirement as well as our entire investment management group. One of those parties was Blackstone. \n We ultimately decided not to pursue the original proposed transactions because we determined that selling the entire investment management group was not in the long-term interest of Life and Retirement. And some of the proposals also contemplated significant reinsurance transactions ahead of an IPO, which we didn't believe would optimize the outcome for shareholders at this stage in the process. In June, Blackstone reengaged with us to determine if we could find a mutually beneficial way to partner that would further our goals for the separation of Life and Retirement. These discussions led to the announcement of the strategic partnership we entered into in mid-July. \n We continue to work with a sense of urgency towards an IPO of the Life and Retirement business. Following the 9.9% equity investment by Blackstone, the IPO will likely be the first quarter of 2022 event, subject to required regulatory approvals and market conditions. We previously viewed the fourth quarter of this year as the earliest in IPO would occur with the first quarter of 2022 as a more likely outcome. So our time line is essentially unchanged even with the announced Blackstone transaction. \n Additionally, the gain on sale of Affordable Housing, coupled with other factors, provides us with the flexibility to sell down beyond 19.9% as we now expect to fully utilize our foreign tax credits in 2022. This development facilitated our partnership with Blackstone and, as a result, made it more compelling compared to structures we considered since our separation announcement last October. We believe that we are better positioned to accelerate operational separation. And as a result, Life and Retirement will be more comprehensively established as an independent company when the IPO occurs. \n Now let me provide additional detail on the Blackstone partnership, which represents a significant milestone for AIG and provides meaningful momentum for the IPO of Life and Retirement. As I mentioned, this partnership represents the culmination of discussions that took place over the last year on several strategic initiatives, and we view it as very beneficial for AIG and Blackstone. Blackstone's leadership has indicated for some time that insurance is a key strategic priority for their firm. And the investment Blackstone is making in our Life and Retirement business is the single largest corporate investment the firm has made in its 35-year history. And Life and Retirement is now Blackstone's single largest client. \n This substantial commitment by Blackstone highlights the strength of Life and Retirement's business, Blackstone's belief in the value of the investment and it's a validation of Life and Retirement's market-leading position. Furthermore, Jon Gray, President and COO of Blackstone, was directly involved in the negotiations. He has been a great partner throughout and will join the Board of Directors of the IPO entity at the closing of the equity investment, which we expect to occur in September. \n Let me recap some of the terms of the transactions and how we're thinking about future capital structures for AIG and Life and Retirement as stand-alone businesses. Blackstone will acquire a 9.9% cornerstone equity stake in the holding company for AIG's Life and Retirement business for $2.2 billion in an all-cash transaction. The purchase price is equivalent to a multiple of 1.1x the target pro forma adjusted book value of $20.2 billion. \n The adjusted book value reflects the combined book value of our Life and Retirement business and a majority of our investments unit as well as the financing arrangements to be undertaken and the amounts to be paid from that entity to AIG just prior to the IPO. As we look to the permanent structure of the IPO entity, we will be raising debt at this entity, consistent with its ratings and peer leverage ratios. The new debt will be used to pay down AIG debt such that the debt stack at AIG and at the IPO entity will both be in line with each company's peers and what we view as the optimal debt-to-total capital ratio for each company. \n Life and Retirement will also enter into separately managed account agreements, or SMAs, with Blackstone, whereby Blackstone will manage $50 billion of specific asset classes with that amount growing to $92.5 billion over a 6-year period. Lastly, as I alluded to earlier, we sold certain Affordable Housing assets to Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust for $5.1 billion in an all-cash transaction, which is expected to close by the year-end 2021. \n Turning to capital management. We ended the second quarter with $7.2 billion of parent liquidity. The net proceeds from the Blackstone transactions resulted in additional liquidity of $6.2 billion to AIG by year-end 2021. Through the remainder of this year, we plan to pay down $2.5 billion of AIG debt and buy back at least $2 billion of common stock. As we announced in our press release, the AIG Board has authorized additional share repurchases, which, together with the remaining approximately $1 billion left on our prior authorization, brings our total stock buyback authorization to $6 billion. \n Together, these capital management actions demonstrate our commitment to delever and return capital to shareholders. In addition, the strength of our overall capital position leaves us with ample capacity to continue to invest in growth, particularly in General Insurance, where market conditions continue to be extremely favorable. \n Now I'll turn it over to Mark to provide more detail on the quarter. \nMark Lyons: Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter of 2021, AIG reported adjusted pretax income, or APTI, of $1.7 billion and adjusted after-tax income of $1.3 billion. We produced an annualized return on adjusted common equity of 10.5% for AIG, 12.3% for General Insurance and 16.4% for Life and Retirement. \n The annualized return on adjusted tangible common equity was 11.6% for the quarter. On a GAAP basis, AIG reported $91 million of net income with the principal difference between GAAP and adjusted after-tax income of $1.3 billion being the accounting treatment of Fortitude, net investment income and associated realized gains and losses. \n Before I move to General Insurance though, I'd like to add to Peter's remarks on the Blackstone SMA. This arrangement incorporates specific specialty asset classes comprised mostly of private credit, alternatives and structured products, where Blackstone is a world leader in sourcing and origination and has a demonstrated track record of delivering yield uplift and not public fixed income securities. \n The fee structure is 30 basis points on the initial $50 billion of AUM, increasing to 45 basis points for the annual new AUM of $8.5 billion starting 4 quarters later as well as for the reinvested run-off AUM. Therefore, fee should rise from 30 basis points initially towards 43 basis points by the end of the initial 6-year contract term for Blackstone's share of the assets. For this part of our portfolio, it's fair to expect that fees will somewhat precede the benefits of the impact of enhanced origination and differentiated asset classes and recognition of related yield uplift. \n We believe this SMA arrangement is unique in that L&R maintains control over its overall asset allocation, asset-liability management, liquidity and credit profile and the nature of individual investment structures. In addition, Life and Retirement has the opportunity to enhance overall investment management by focusing on improving efficiencies and asset classes that are not part of the SMA as well as optimizing performance across the whole portfolio. We believe the combination of these efficiencies, together with the Blackstone focus on maximizing the performance of SMA assets and growth opportunities on the overall AUM, should drive net yield uplift. \n Before leaving the Blackstone transaction, I want to note that a GAAP loss on sale is anticipated with a 9.9% equity purchase by Blackstone as well as with subsequent IPO sell-downs due to the inclusion of OCI and GAAP book value. Given that OCI in future periods is subject to market fluctuations, the impact cannot be fully estimated at this time. \n As respects Affordable Housing, note that the $5.1 billion purchase price translates to an approximate $3 billion after-tax gain on sale, which will benefit book value and provides approximately $4 billion of cash to parent with a minority portion held back in a regulated Life and Retirement entity to further strengthen an already historically strong RBC level. This transaction is expected to close by year-end 2021. \n Moving to General Insurance. Second quarter adjusted pretax income was $1.2 billion, up $1 billion even year-over-year, primarily reflecting increased pretax underwriting income of over $800 million, along with $200 million and change of increased pretax net investment income, driven primarily by private equity returns. Catastrophe losses of $118 million were significantly lower this quarter compared to $674 million in the prior year quarter. \n Prior year development was $51 million favorable this quarter compared to favorable development of $74 million in the prior year quarter. This included $58 million of net favorable development in North America and $7 million of net unfavorable development in International, both of which reflect marginal changes in the underlying operations. As usual, there is net favorable amortization from the adverse development cover, which amounted to $49 million this quarter. \n It's important to put in context though the recent strength of the property and casualty market and how General Insurance has executed within this environment. As Peter mentioned in his remarks, the book has had nearly 3 turns at correction since 2018. Risk appetite and risk selection have been materially sharpened. Complementary and properly evolving reinsurance programs have been implemented. Certain lines and segments were exited or massively reduced. Clearer and broader distribution has been embraced. And Lexington has been stood up as a major E&S platform. \n All of this was accomplished while simultaneously achieving significant rate in excess of loss cost trends with materially better terms and conditions. These actions formed the foundation as to why General Insurance has shown material improvement in the underlying accident year ex CAT combined ratios in both the historically underperforming North America Commercial segment and the International Commercial segment as well. \n North America Commercial has shown a 620 basis point improvement in the accident year ex CAT combined ratio over the prior year quarter. The International Commercial segment has continued to improve profitability with 370 basis points improvement compared to the prior year quarter. This shows demonstrable margin improvement stemming from the totality of the actions enumerated earlier. And this level of Global Commercial improvement is noteworthy as Global Commercial made up 71% of worldwide net premiums written through the first half of 2021. \n Additionally, the Global Commercial book is increasingly becoming a global specialty book comprised of below-frequency, high-severity coverages. As a result, General Insurance Commercial, although large and global in scope, is not a mere index of the market, but instead an underwriting company, where risk selection and business mix are important factors in achieving profitable growth while mitigating volatility. \n Turning to Personal Insurance. As we noted on our first quarter earnings call, our year-over-year net premium written comparison for the second quarter would improve, given the timing of the initial COVID-19 impact and the distortions from Syndicate 2019 being reflected also during the second quarter of 2020. Global Personal Lines net premiums written grew by approximately 45% or 41% on a constant dollar basis, aided by the Syndicate 2019 comparison. \n Elsewhere within the segment, the second quarter of 2021 North America Personal Insurance saw premiums in travel and warranty business increase. This was driven by a rebound in travel activity and increased consumer spending but not yet back to the pre-pandemic levels. Our outlook for net premiums written for the next 6 months in North America Personal Insurance is between $450 million and $500 million per quarter. \n We continue to anticipate earned margin expansion throughout 2021 and into 2022, resulting from AIG's favorable underwriting actions taken and global market conditions involving strong rate increases well above loss trend, improved terms and conditions and a more profitable, less volatile mix. Given the specific market dynamics of where we choose to play, we don't foresee any material slowing-down in achieved rate levels throughout the balance of the year. \n Now I'd like to comment a bit on inflation, which one needs to think about in terms of both economic and social inflation. Based on the Consumer Price Index and the Producer Price Index, headline inflation indicates an annualized rate of about 5.5% to 7.5%, which has accelerated since March. Some components of the indices have become worrisome, such as used cars and trucks being up about 45% and energy commodities being north of 40%. But medical care services, whose impact stretches across most casualty, auto, workers' compensation and excess placements, although higher, are much more tame than headline inflation would indicate with physician services up about 4% recently and hospital services up about 2.5%. \n Costs involving labor, materials, construction and related services are up and will impact property coverages and CAT claim costs in the near term. These indications demonstrate that the inflationary impact on any given insurer is a direct function of the products and the mix they write and where they play within an insurance program. Social inflation, however, is much more of a U.S.-centric phenomenon, driven by a highly litigious culture. Social inflation also has correlations to social change initiatives, including income inequality and changing sentiments towards business, to name a few. \n Being further away from risk though is a meaningful inflation counter. And AIG's General Insurance has taken strong preemptive action in that regard by minimizing lead umbrellas in favor of higher positions within insurance programs. For example, our Excess Casualty average attachment points for national and corporate U.S. accounts have increased approximately 3.5x and 5.5x, respectively, since 2018. This significantly increased distance from attaching is a key overall portfolio benefit. Taken all together, a U.S. view towards a total inflation rate of 4% to 5% is arguably reasonable for the near to medium term. Our second quarter rate increases, together with our view of pricing for the rest of the year, provide continued margin in excess of this loss cost trend. \n Now turning to Life and Retirement. When compared with the prior year, favorable equity markets drove higher alternative investment returns, principally higher private equity returns, which reflect the impact of the 1 quarter lag on the period. Life Insurance continues to reflect the COVID-19-related mortality provision that has dropped relative to the prior quarters. We estimate our exposure to the population is approximately $65 million to $75 million per 100,000 population deaths. Mortality, however, exclusive of COVID-19, continues to be favorable compared to pricing assumptions. \n Within Individual Retirement, excluding the Retail Mutual Fund business, net flows were positive for the quarter and favorable by over $1.2 billion when compared with the second quarter of 2020, led by Index Annuities rebounding to be higher by approximately $700 million with Variable Annuity net flow being about $365 million stronger year-over-year. Group Retirement premiums and deposits were up with net flows being relatively flat while also experiencing an improved surrender rate sequentially. \n The Life business has seen consistent premiums and lower lapse surrender rates over the last 4 quarters than prior. And for Institutional Markets, premiums and deposits were up compared to the prior year and sequentially. GIC issuance was also higher both sequentially and year-over-year. And we executed several large pension risk transfer transactions during the quarter. The pipeline for pension risk transfer opportunities, both direct and through reinsurance, remain very strong in both the U.S. and in the U.K. \n We continue to actively manage the impacts from the low interest rate and tighter credit spread environment. And our earlier provided range for expected annual spread compression has not changed as our base investment spreads for the second quarter were within our annual 8 to 16 point guidance. Further, new business margins generally remain within our targets at current new money returns due to active product management and a disciplined pricing approach. Lastly, post June 30, we closed on the sale of our Retail Mutual Fund operation. As you are aware, Retail Mutual Funds has contributed negative net flows over the last 2 years, and the drag from this will now cease. \n Moving to Other Operations. The adjusted pretax loss was $610 million, inclusive of $94 million from consolidation and elimination entries, which principally reflect adjustments offsetting investment returns in the subsidiaries, which are then eliminated at Other Operations. Before consolidations and eliminations, the adjusted pretax loss was $516 million, $184 million worse than the second quarter of 2020. But that quarter included 2 months of Fortitude Re results of $96 million. \n In addition, during the second quarter of 2021, we also increased prior year legacy loss reserves by a net $65 million, driven mostly by Blackboard exposures. And we increased our incentive program accrual to reflect the strong performance year-to-date, whereas in 2020, we began adjusting our incentive program accrual in the third quarter. After applying these adjustments, the comparison is actually favorable year-over-year. \n Shifting to investments. Overall net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.2 billion, virtually flat from the second quarter of 2020. But again, adjusting the second quarter of 2020 for Fortitude net investment income over that 2-month period, this quarter's net investment income was $362 million higher than the prior year, reflecting strong private equity returns at an annualized 27% return rate for the quarter and hedge fund results at a 21% annualized return rate for the quarter, along with stable interest and dividend income. \n Turning to the balance sheet. At June 30, book value per common share was $76.73, up 7% from 1 year ago. Adjusted book value per common share was $60.07 per share, up 7.5% from 1 year ago, driven primarily by strong operating performance. And adjusted tangible book value per common share was $54.24, up 8.1% from a year ago. As Peter noted, at quarter end, AIG parent liquidity was $7.2 billion. During the second quarter, we made a $354 million prepayment to the U.S. Treasury in connection with certain tax settlement agreements emanating from the pre-2007 period as well as completed debt tenders for an aggregate purchase price of $359 million. \n Our debt leverage at June 30 was 27% even, down 140 basis points from the end of 2020 and down 360 basis points from June 30, 1 year ago. Our primary operating subsidiaries remain profitable and well capitalized. For General Insurance, we estimate the U.S. pool fleet risk-based capital ratio for the second quarter to be between 460% and 470% and Life and Retirement is estimated to be between 440% and 450%, both above our target ranges. \n Lastly, as respects tax, I want to reiterate that the remaining net operating loss or NOL portion of AIG's DTA at the time of deconsolidating L&R for tax purposes will still be available to offset future General Insurance and/or AIG taxable income through their natural expiration. As of June 30, that portion of the DTA totaled $6.3 billion and is available to offset up to $30 billion of taxable income. Upon tax deconsolidation, what will cease is the ability to utilize up to 35% of Life Insurance company income against NOLs or any remaining FTC. \n With that, I will now turn it back over to Peter. \nPeter Zaffino: Thank you, Mark. Operator, we'll go to question and answer. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. \nElyse Greenspan: My first question, Peter, you said you guys could get to that sub-90% margin target within General Insurance perhaps sooner than expected. I was hoping you could expand on that just in terms of time frame. And when you make that comment, are you assuming stable pricing and inflation kind of remains around 4% to 5% based off of what Mark said into 2022? \nPeter Zaffino: Thanks, Elyse. I've talked about it in the past that there's many components that are going to drive improved combined ratio. The first is the absolute underwriting performance, and we're seeing that come through in what Mark covered in his script in terms of severity, attritional losses and just less volatility. In addition, we have seen strong top line growth and believe that's in the Commercial side. We're in that market now and see that continuing. \n We need less reinsurance that we once needed because of the makeup of the portfolio. So those are all tailwinds. And then in addition to that, you have AIG 200, which I gave some numbers on my prepared remarks that we have real tailwinds there. Not only are we going to continue to have a clear sight in the overall path to $1 billion, but it's starting to earn through in the income statement and just our overall expense discipline. \n So we don't heavily rely on one component. There's 4 to 5 that drive it. And no, it does not require us to be in the same rate environment. I mean you have to be in the range on the social inflation and loss cost inflation. But we watch that all the time and believe that we have a lot of momentum. And I'll give more guidance specifically in the next couple of quarters. I mean, the momentum I've seen and the excellent job that Dave McElroy and the entire leadership team have done in General Insurance is a real differentiator. And the momentum they have is tremendous. So it just leaves me with a lot of optimism. \nElyse Greenspan: Great. And then my second question, in terms of Life and Retirement, now that you did this initial sale with Blackstone and you emphasized using most of the foreign tax credits, so it sounds like tax considerations won't impact the amount of L&R that you guys bring to the public market. Do you have a sense of how much you're going to bring on to the public market? And then in terms of the proceeds, do you guys get there? Since you're paying down $2.5 billion of debt now, will the majority of the proceeds from future transactions just be used for buyback and organic growth? \nPeter Zaffino: Yes. Thanks, Elyse. In terms of the timing, as I said, we're targeting a first quarter IPO. We're working really hard on the operational separation. We'll close with Blackstone, who's going to be a tremendous partner for us, we hope, in July. And so working over the next 6 months to position Life and Retirement to have a very successful IPO is the primary focus. \n Second is we have to think about, I said in my prepared remarks, of like the regulatory environment and the market itself. So that will really dictate in terms of how much we do. And it just gives us a lot of flexibility to accordion it up if there's really favorable market conditions or just to go in with a -- we wouldn't go to an IPO with a 9.9%. We'll do something larger than that. But the size, timing, we'll continue to give you guidance as we get further along in the year with the progress that we're making. I don't know, Mark, if you want to add anything to the capital management, the debt. \nMark Lyons: Just I think that -- I think the core point was to emphasize that this removes the constraint. So rather than on the specifics of the sizing, which as Peter said, which is very market-sensitive and contingent, but having that ability now to not have such a constraint is the main point we really wanted to push over. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Meyer Shields from KBW Investment Bank. \nMeyer Shields: First question on the Blackstone partnership. Can you give us a sense of what the internal expenses are that are comparable to the 30 and 45 basis points that will constitute the fees? \nPeter Zaffino: Yes. Meyer, thank you for the question. I'll turn it over to Mark in a second. But I think that when we looked at the partnership with Blackstone, there was a variety of factors that went into it, certainly them making a commitment on the equity investment, making certain that Life and Retirement still maintained its authority and ability to shape the investments with Blackstone. So we contained that. A lot of the assets that we have or will transfer are classes that they have exceptional track records on, and so we're working through that. \n We do believe that the AUM will grow over time with Life and Retirement. And so this will become a smaller percentage, and the base case was that not only with the Blackstone partnership that our overall business model will evolve to be more efficient over time. But Mark, maybe you could fill in a couple of the details of that. \nMark Lyons: Yes. Well, Meyer, as Peter said, the level of these specialty assets are usually much more labor-intensive and are always on the higher end of the scale, if you think of it in a rate card sense. And so that part is completely within expectations of what we would say. Within -- with our own internal structures, we would have also increasing costs as you graduate up to the overall asset class categories that they are experiencing for us. So there's some gap, but some of that cost accounting view is less clear than you think. But we know what the value we're going to be getting out of that is going to be more than worth it. \nMeyer Shields: Okay. Understood. Second question, I guess, this is probably for Mark. I know the expense ratios in North American Personal have been distorted up until the second quarter because of, I guess, depressed travel insurance and the syndicate. Is the second quarter expense ratio run rate, are those representative of what we should see going forward? \nMark Lyons: It's -- what I think that you're going to -- let me make a general statement first. And that is that I think Peter tried a position that's been -- and we may have said this a little bit in past calls. But you should think of the combined ratio gains on the Commercial side of being loss ratio and expense ratio driven and on the Personal Line side, more expense ratio driven. We've gotten a lot more stability in the loss ratios on there, so you'll continue to see that. But to the extent -- it's roughly a -- I would actually say you should anticipate the expense ratio to continue to improve in North America Personal. \nPeter Zaffino: And one thing I would add, Meyer, in terms of what Mark just noted is that the high net worth space is changing dramatically in peak zones. We expect to see a continued change in the Excess & Surplus Lines as more alternatives -- it was basically split in the second quarter between admitted and non-admitted new business. So that's just something that we're going to watch. I mean, there's no specific trends that are going to be substantially different than the guidance we've given. But there is some change in that business that we want to make sure with the market-leading position that we take advantage of solving problems for clients but also repositioning the portfolio to have less volatility. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. \nErik Bass: I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the asset management agreement with Blackstone and how you see this affecting Life and Retirement's NII over the next couple of years. It sounds like you expect some initial dilution. But when should this turn and start being accretive to NII? And also, will any of the assets they manage be used to support new business? And could this help you be even more competitive in your fixed indexed annuity offerings? \nPeter Zaffino: Yes. Mark, why don't you start and then turn it over to Kevin in terms of talking about product? \nMark Lyons: Yes. Thank you, Peter. Yes. And I think Kevin will have a few things to help you with there as well. So on the asset management, think of it this way, Erik. You've got the -- the uplift will come more delayed than the fees, to your point, firstly. And secondly is as the $50 billion of AUM is worked through, we have been thinking about it mostly, it takes 7 years for that runoff to turn over. As that occurs, it also shifts from 30 to 45 basis points. The $8.5 million annually that will also come in to take it to the 92.5% will be at 45 bps. So you kind of have that curve that I was alluding to in my prepared remarks. \n So as a result of that, you're going to have a net yield uplift coming through as a function of when those investments can be made. So if you think of it, you're really -- at the end of year 1, you still have 85% of the original AUM still not turned over, which is why you get the delay aspect. But it's -- we expect that to chip away and close a lot sooner than you might think. But that -- the important point to remember is that L&R completely has that control. So the takeoff between the liquidity and the rating distributions and the asset distribution and capital trade-offs and so forth is all within the management discretion of L&R. Kevin? \nKevin Hogan: Yes. Thank you. So Erik, I think what's important is to keep in mind that this is not a change in our portfolio strategy. This is an enhancement of our portfolio strategy. Blackstone has tremendous origination capability. And we believe that their ability to originate in these asset classes exceeds our current ability. And in addition to that, they have a broader range of assets within the subclasses. And the combination of their ability to originate with more capacity and also the breadth of their asset classes, we believe, will allow us to create new products to support transactions. \n And our intention will be to work together to innovate strategies that will allow us to grow faster. We do not think of the balance sheet as static. We think about a growing balance sheet. And so rather than focusing just on the yield of this part of the portfolio, I think about the overall portfolio strategy. So again, this is not a change in our strategy. This is an enhancement of it, and that's how we think about it. \nErik Bass: And then can you help us think about the level of new public expenses that Life and Retirement will have? And will these be able to be offset by savings elsewhere? And then how should we think about the level of expenses that are running through other ops that will remain with the parent, kind of post-separation? \nPeter Zaffino: Erik, let me handle that one. The guidance that I provided in the past and we'll stay with is that there are meaningful savings for Life and Retirement within AIG 200. That will be tailwinds to them. We had said around $125 million, Life and Retirement achieved some of that. But there's a big number left for us in terms of earning through that over the next 18 months. So think about roughly $100 million of AIG 200 benefits. Then there is allocations and parent service fees that goes over to Life and Retirement today that will either dissipate or we'll still have those services as we transition for Life and Retirement to become a public company. \n So that's in the range of $75-plus million. So Kevin has a decent amount to invest towards building out the public company. And we think with other initiatives for expense savings through separation office that it should largely be neutral to Life and Retirement. And we think the synergies that exist within the remaining company, AIG, that it's neutral to beneficial. And we'll give more guidance as we get closer to the end of the year when we've done more work in the separation office. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Phil Stefano from Deutsche Bank. \nPhil Stefano: Yes. Looking at the General Insurance book and mostly focused on Commercial, when we look at the gap in net written versus net earned, I mean, it's clearly there's a runway, just given where the pricing is today for the continued improvement in the underlying loss ratios there. How are you thinking about rate adequacy, the need to continue to push for rate versus just growing and dialing back the rate that you're getting now? Like how are you balancing these 2 dynamics? \nPeter Zaffino: Thank you very much for the question. Mark put a lot of comments in his prepared remarks. We watch loss cost inflation and margin on everything we do in terms of portfolio optimization. That's really what I refer to when I talk about how do we position General Insurance, particularly on the Commercial side, to have an optimized portfolio. We've had several years of rate increases. We're building margin. \n And some specific lines of business have been getting more rate than others and they're the ones that need it. But it's something that Dave McElroy and the entire team spend every day thinking about and believe that there is absolute runway to continue to develop margin. But Dave, do you want to talk a little bit about how you're approaching it in some of the different segments of the business that you're focused on? \nDavid McElroy: Yes. Thank you, Peter. Thank you, Phil. Phil, the rate increase story is one you don't -- you want to make sure it's calibrated off of all the other things you're doing in the portfolio. So what we've done over the last 3 years is a lot of risk selection and terms and conditions and attachment point and account exposures and managing that. So if you fall in love with a singular rate increase number and you define your book, you ultimately probably end up adversely selected against. So you actually have to put that in context. \n And I always use examples. It's like I might have gotten a 10% rate increase on a contractor in New York and I'm still chasing New York labor law, I will lose, okay? And for the industry, it's a little bit of like commercial auto. We've been getting rate increases in commercial auto for 8 years and we still haven't solved that problem. So rate increase can be a false positive. What we've done with a sort of technical understanding of it, looking at it and aggressively realizing that we have a large account book, upper middle-market book, and we need more rate to reflect the more complexity of that book. \n So that's -- we think that's sustainable going into the latter part of this year, okay? We think we can accommodate what would be expected loss cost inflations. And at the same time, and this is what I've observed in the last quarter, is there's more pricing to the account, the account characteristics. Is it moderated? Yes, a little bit, okay? But it's moderated off of still over loss cost trends. And what I would say, when I look at my dispersion charts, we don't have the same outlier plus 30% up, but we have a swell of more of a plus 5% to 10%, plus 10% to 20%, plus 20% to 30% type of accounts that are basically aggregating in that in terms of rate reflecting the exposure. \n The other piece, and I -- we have to be careful with it because we want to reflect our book and our clients. But we do -- we are in the multiyear phase of a re-underwriting and an influence in the market. And when you look at compounding and you look at the compounding that might exist in Excess Casualty or primary D&O, okay, or even programs, okay, these are numbers that are plus 93%, plus 86%, okay, plus 70% over a period of time of starting in late '18 to the first half of 2021. It's not a panacea, okay? If you're -- if I was trying to write investment banking E&O and I've got 90%, I probably would still lose. But I mean, it's a good baseline for the progress that we've done with the business. \n The last thing I'd say is that we had a lot of new business this quarter. I think it was cited on a couple of calls. And remember, this is also being priced now with an elevated rate/price structure. So the same business 2 years ago or 3 years ago is now up that 30% to 40% when we can produce it as a piece of new business. And that's very much formed a lot of our success in this quarter was moving from remediation to an offensive point, capturing the quality of what AIG has with multinational claims reputation complexity and actually building off of that for the strongest new business we've had in a while. So that flows off of technical rate increases and our consistent view of that. But it's important to sort of lay that all out, so you understand that we're not -- we're really looking at this with the lens on all aspects of the business. So with that, I'll... \nPhil Stefano: Yes. That's very thorough. Look, maybe a quicker one... \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Tracy Benguigui from Barclays. \nTracy Dolin-Benguigui: I see that there is an IPO contingency in the Blackstone transaction. Is that just a timing thing? Or is the IPO contingency also considering a pricing floor for minority IPO proceeds or a minimum equity stake size? \nPeter Zaffino: Thanks, Tracy. No, the 9.9% is predicated on a strategic partnership that starts to accelerate all the things that we want to do to set Life and Retirement up to be a public company. And we're really focused on getting that done within the first quarter and making sure that the organization is set up to do that. And again, there's regulatory and market considerations that we'll always look at. But those are really the bigger ones than tying really what the cornerstone investor has brought to the table versus the eventual IPO. As Mark mentioned, we have a lot more flexibility because of the consumption of the foreign tax credits. And so 2022, we'll start to outline what we think will likely happen as we get closer to the end of the year. \nTracy Dolin-Benguigui: Okay. Yes, I was just referring to some fine print in your 8-K that if the IPO didn't happen, there were some recourse. So I didn't know if there was something else that I should also be considering. \nPeter Zaffino: No. \nTracy Dolin-Benguigui: Okay. Perfect. Look, anyone could trade growth for margin expansion, but you're at a spot where you're doing both. And I guess, the only place where I don't have visibility is your loss pick. So can you contextualize how your current accident year loss picks have been tracking maybe relative to last year and your 5-year average? \nPeter Zaffino: Mark, do you want to cover that? \nMark Lyons: Sure. I guess, a couple of things. First off, we are viewing -- although we're showing substantial margin improvement on a quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year basis, we actually think we're being conservative in this. As I said, I think, on past calls, there has been a lot of change over the last 3 years, including some of the fundamental channels in which we get business. So we think we got every one of those correctly. \n Nobody bats 1,000, so you wind up having a little bit of risk margin associated with each of the last several accident years. So we feel good overall. And we feel about the trajectory of the improvement and where it's coming from and that we're not booking and displaying things without having an appropriate risk margin associated with it. I hope that's helpful. \nPeter Zaffino: Yes. Thanks, Mark. And I want to just thank everyone for joining us today. Before we end the call, I want to thank our colleagues around the world for what they've accomplished over the last 6 months, especially considering the challenges that have been presented in work remote environments. We have a talented, hardworking colleague base that's executing on multiple complex initiatives simultaneously, which I think makes us very unique, very proud of the team, remains very focused on ensuring quality in everything that we do and delivering significant value to all of our stakeholders. Have a great day. \nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you, everyone, for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Peter Zaffino",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. We have a lot of topics to cover this morning as we made significant progress on many initiatives over the last 90 days. \n I will start today's remarks with an overview of AIG's outstanding consolidated financial results for the second quarter. Then I will review results for General Insurance and Life and Retirement in more detail. Following that, I will provide an update on the progress we're making on AIG 200 and the operational separation of Life and Retirement from AIG. \n Next, I will provide details on the strategic partnership we announced with Blackstone in July, which represents a significant milestone for AIG and a major step forward towards the IPO of Life and Retirement. And lastly, I will provide an update on our capital management strategy where our near-term priorities remain the same as what I've outlined in the past: debt reduction, return of capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and investment in organic growth. Mark will provide additional details on the quarter and we'll then take questions. \n Starting with our consolidated results, I'm pleased to report that AIG had an outstanding second quarter. We have sustained the significant momentum we had coming into 2021 through the first half of the year and delivered exceptional performance in General Insurance with strong top line growth and significant improvement in our combined ratios. Our pivot to growth and focus on demonstrating leadership in the marketplace accelerated through the second quarter as we continued to prioritize underwriting discipline, portfolio optimization, reducing volatility and growing in segments where market conditions are favorable and fall within our risk appetite. \n We also saw very good results in our Life and Retirement business, primarily driven by improved investment performance. Life and Retirement's adjusted pretax income increased 26% year-over-year, and the business delivered a return on adjusted segment common equity of 16.4%. We continue to advance AIG 200 with the transformation remaining on track to deliver $1 billion in run rate savings across the company by the end of 2022 against a cost to achieve of $1.3 billion. And as you saw in our press release, our adjusted after-tax income in the second quarter was $1.52 per diluted share compared to $0.64 in the prior year quarter. \n Turning to our financial results. I'll start with General Insurance. Growth in net premiums written was very strong in the second quarter, accelerating from the first quarter and continuing the trend that began in 2020 as our heaviest remediation efforts were nearing completion. Net premiums written increased 24% year-over-year to $6.9 billion or approximately 20%, excluding foreign exchange. Growth was strong across both Global Commercial and Personal. Global Commercial net premiums written increased 13%, excluding foreign exchange, reflecting growth in areas with attractive risk-adjusted returns, improving renewal retentions and more than 25% increase in new business compared to the prior year quarter and overall rate increases of 13%. \n North America Commercial net premiums written increased 15%, excluding foreign exchange, including strong growth in Excess Casualty, Financial Lines, Retail Property, AIG Re and Lexington. New business increased 25% from the prior year quarter, led by Financial Lines and Lexington wholesale. And renewal retentions improved 300 basis points over the same period. It's worth noting that Lexington had its strongest quarter of new business since we fully repositioned its operating model to focus on wholesale distribution and Excess & Surplus Lines. This business has significant momentum, which we expect will continue for the foreseeable future. \n Shifting to International Commercial. Net premiums written grew 10%, excluding foreign exchange, primarily driven by Financial Lines across the U.K., EMEA and Asia Pacific; global specialty, particularly marine and energy; and Talbot, our Lloyd's syndicate. New business increased 26% from the prior year period, led by Financial Lines, marine, energy and Talbot. And renewal retentions increased by 500 basis points over the same period. It's important to emphasize that the growth we are achieving across Commercial is aligned with our risk appetite that we have been executing against over the past 3 years. \n We continue to prudently deploy limits, including with respect to new business, with an intense focus on risk aggregation. In addition to strong retention, our growth is being driven by exceptional new business, which in Global Commercial was $1 billion in the second quarter. With respect to Personal Insurance, as we discussed on last quarter's call, the unusually high growth in net premiums written was largely reflective of the creation of Syndicate 2019 in the second quarter of 2020 and the reinsurance cessions associated with creating that syndicate. \n Turning to rate. Momentum continued with overall Global Commercial rate increases of 13%. North America Commercial rate increases were 13% with the most notable improvements in Excess Casualty, which was up 20%; Lexington Casualty, which was up 19%; and Lexington wholesale property, which was up 15%. International Commercial rate increases were also 13%, driven by Financial Lines, which was up 21%; property, which was up 18%; and energy, which was up 16%. \n Across the global portfolio, the largest rate increases were in cyber, where rates were up almost 40% with the strongest rate increases in North America. We continue to carefully reduce cyber limits and are obtaining tighter terms and conditions to address increasing cyber loss trends, the rising threat associated with ransomware and the systemic nature of cyber risk generally. Underwriting excellence, thoughtful risk selection, tighter terms and conditions and improving rate adequacy have been core areas of focus as we transformed our portfolio. \n The General Insurance accident year combined ratio ex CAT improved for the 12th consecutive quarter, coming in at 91.1%, an improvement of 380 basis points from the second quarter of 2020 and an improvement of 990 basis points from the second quarter of 2018. This improvement was comprised of 160 basis point improvement in the accident year loss ratio ex CAT and a 220 basis point improvement in the expense ratio as AIG 200 and the benefits of premium growth continued to contribute to profitability. \n Global Commercial achieved an accident year combined ratio ex CAT of 89.3%, an improvement of 500 basis points year-over-year. This is the best result Commercial has reported in the last 15 years. In Personal Insurance, the accident year combined ratio ex CAT was 95.1%, a 70 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter. \n Now just a quick comment on reinsurance purchased across General Insurance, where we continue to evolve our reinsurance program to reflect our significantly improved underlying portfolio. In the second quarter, we were very active in the market with 25 specific layers on a variety of treaties placed. Notably, in nearly every instance, we were able to enhance our terms and conditions and our placements were at equivalent or improved pricing in a reinsurance market that is experiencing tighter terms and conditions and rate increases. \n With respect to our property CAT program in particular, we took the opportunity in the second quarter to further reduce our per occurrence attachment point in North America through several buy-down CAT layers for peak zone exposures. Lastly, on General Insurance, we remain confident that we will achieve a sub-90% accident year combined ratio ex CAT by the end of 2022. \n Based on the progress that I've seen in our underwriting, the ongoing efforts in optimizing our portfolio, the terrific execution of AIG 200 and the significant momentum we've developed, I'm optimistic we'll get there sooner. As we move through the second half of the year and get further into AIG 200 in separation execution, we will provide further comment on our combined ratio expectations. \n Now let me turn to AIG Re, which oversees our global assumed reinsurance business. Net premiums written across all lines increased more than 30% in the second quarter compared to the prior year period. Writings were balanced across multiple lines of business with risk-adjusted returns and underwriting ratios improving across the portfolio. Highlights of AIG Re's second quarter results include the following. In U.S. property CAT, we saw rate improvements across all U.S. property business sectors. Increases range from mid-single-digits to upwards of 25%, depending on geography and loss-affected accounts. \n In Florida, Validus Re net limits at June 2021 were reduced by more than 40% in coordination with AlphaCat. Since AIG's acquisition of Validus Re in 2018, we reduced the overall limit in Florida by more than 65% or approximately $400 million of annual limit, demonstrating Validus Re's continued discipline and focus on volatility reduction. Further, Florida-specific firms now represent less than 2% of Validus Re's total net premiums written. Our focus remains on regional and nationwide firms in the U.S. as well as international diversification. \n In addition, in 2020 and through the second quarter of 2021, less than 25% of AIG Re's net premiums written came from property lines. Building on our retrocessional purchase on 1/1 of worldwide aggregate protection, Validus Re secured further retrocessional protections in June. Specifically, we purchased more peak zone coverage for U.S. wind, Asia wind and California earthquake for the 2021 season. Overall, we have substantially enhanced our portfolio despite heightened competition. \n We're very pleased with how AIG Re has evolved. We have exceptionally strong intermediary market support as well as strong client relationships, which have resulted in significant renewal retention and signings. In addition, we've upgraded the talent across the board and have broadened the skill sets of our leaders. We believe this business is much more prepared to assess and opportunistically respond to market conditions. \n Turning to Life and Retirement. This business once again delivered very strong results. Life and Retirement's broad leadership position across products and channels enabled us to take advantage of the significant rebound in retail annuity sales with total annuity sales up significantly across our entire annuity offering. Our strong sales resulted in positive Individual Retirement annuity net flows during the quarter. Group Retirement deposits were higher compared to first quarter 2021 levels. And second quarter 2021 new plan participant enrollments increased 20% year-over-year. \n As demonstrated regularly in recent quarters, our high-quality investment portfolio is well positioned to navigate uncertain environments. Our variable annuity hedging program has continued to perform as expected, providing downside protection during prolonged periods of volatility. Finally, the strategic partnership with Blackstone further positions Life and Retirement to expand its distribution relationships, enhance its product offerings, and the business will benefit from Blackstone's significant capabilities. \n Now let me turn to AIG 200, our global multiyear effort to position AIG for the long term. AIG 200 is continuing with a sense of urgency with all 10 operational programs deep into execution mode. We're 18 months into the transformation. And we have a clear execution path to $1 billion in run rate cost savings with $550 million already executed or contracted, $355 million of which has been recognized to date in our income statement. AIG 200 continues to build a strong foundation across the company and instill a culture of operational excellence. \n Turning to the separation of Life and Retirement. We made considerable progress in the second quarter with a focus on speed execution with minimal business disruption. Our separation management office has identified day 1 requirements for Life and Retirement to become a stand-alone company and multiple work streams are under way. This work includes aligning our investments unit with Life and Retirement and preparing for the Blackstone partnership to close. The speed with which our colleagues have moved would not have been possible without the foundational work that's been done as part of AIG 200. \n As I've discussed on prior calls, an IPO of up to 19.9% of Life and Retirement was our base case since we announced our intention to separate the business from AIG last October. And we continue to believe an IPO will maximize value for our stakeholders and position the business for additional value creation as a public company. I also noted on our last call that following our announcement, we received several credible inquiries from parties interested in purchasing a minority stake in Life and Retirement as well as our entire investment management group. One of those parties was Blackstone. \n We ultimately decided not to pursue the original proposed transactions because we determined that selling the entire investment management group was not in the long-term interest of Life and Retirement. And some of the proposals also contemplated significant reinsurance transactions ahead of an IPO, which we didn't believe would optimize the outcome for shareholders at this stage in the process. In June, Blackstone reengaged with us to determine if we could find a mutually beneficial way to partner that would further our goals for the separation of Life and Retirement. These discussions led to the announcement of the strategic partnership we entered into in mid-July. \n We continue to work with a sense of urgency towards an IPO of the Life and Retirement business. Following the 9.9% equity investment by Blackstone, the IPO will likely be the first quarter of 2022 event, subject to required regulatory approvals and market conditions. We previously viewed the fourth quarter of this year as the earliest in IPO would occur with the first quarter of 2022 as a more likely outcome. So our time line is essentially unchanged even with the announced Blackstone transaction. \n Additionally, the gain on sale of Affordable Housing, coupled with other factors, provides us with the flexibility to sell down beyond 19.9% as we now expect to fully utilize our foreign tax credits in 2022. This development facilitated our partnership with Blackstone and, as a result, made it more compelling compared to structures we considered since our separation announcement last October. We believe that we are better positioned to accelerate operational separation. And as a result, Life and Retirement will be more comprehensively established as an independent company when the IPO occurs. \n Now let me provide additional detail on the Blackstone partnership, which represents a significant milestone for AIG and provides meaningful momentum for the IPO of Life and Retirement. As I mentioned, this partnership represents the culmination of discussions that took place over the last year on several strategic initiatives, and we view it as very beneficial for AIG and Blackstone. Blackstone's leadership has indicated for some time that insurance is a key strategic priority for their firm. And the investment Blackstone is making in our Life and Retirement business is the single largest corporate investment the firm has made in its 35-year history. And Life and Retirement is now Blackstone's single largest client. \n This substantial commitment by Blackstone highlights the strength of Life and Retirement's business, Blackstone's belief in the value of the investment and it's a validation of Life and Retirement's market-leading position. Furthermore, Jon Gray, President and COO of Blackstone, was directly involved in the negotiations. He has been a great partner throughout and will join the Board of Directors of the IPO entity at the closing of the equity investment, which we expect to occur in September. \n Let me recap some of the terms of the transactions and how we're thinking about future capital structures for AIG and Life and Retirement as stand-alone businesses. Blackstone will acquire a 9.9% cornerstone equity stake in the holding company for AIG's Life and Retirement business for $2.2 billion in an all-cash transaction. The purchase price is equivalent to a multiple of 1.1x the target pro forma adjusted book value of $20.2 billion. \n The adjusted book value reflects the combined book value of our Life and Retirement business and a majority of our investments unit as well as the financing arrangements to be undertaken and the amounts to be paid from that entity to AIG just prior to the IPO. As we look to the permanent structure of the IPO entity, we will be raising debt at this entity, consistent with its ratings and peer leverage ratios. The new debt will be used to pay down AIG debt such that the debt stack at AIG and at the IPO entity will both be in line with each company's peers and what we view as the optimal debt-to-total capital ratio for each company. \n Life and Retirement will also enter into separately managed account agreements, or SMAs, with Blackstone, whereby Blackstone will manage $50 billion of specific asset classes with that amount growing to $92.5 billion over a 6-year period. Lastly, as I alluded to earlier, we sold certain Affordable Housing assets to Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust for $5.1 billion in an all-cash transaction, which is expected to close by the year-end 2021. \n Turning to capital management. We ended the second quarter with $7.2 billion of parent liquidity. The net proceeds from the Blackstone transactions resulted in additional liquidity of $6.2 billion to AIG by year-end 2021. Through the remainder of this year, we plan to pay down $2.5 billion of AIG debt and buy back at least $2 billion of common stock. As we announced in our press release, the AIG Board has authorized additional share repurchases, which, together with the remaining approximately $1 billion left on our prior authorization, brings our total stock buyback authorization to $6 billion. \n Together, these capital management actions demonstrate our commitment to delever and return capital to shareholders. In addition, the strength of our overall capital position leaves us with ample capacity to continue to invest in growth, particularly in General Insurance, where market conditions continue to be extremely favorable. \n Now I'll turn it over to Mark to provide more detail on the quarter. Thank you, Mark. Operator, we'll go to question and answer. Thanks, Elyse. I've talked about it in the past that there's many components that are going to drive improved combined ratio. The first is the absolute underwriting performance, and we're seeing that come through in what Mark covered in his script in terms of severity, attritional losses and just less volatility. In addition, we have seen strong top line growth and believe that's in the Commercial side. We're in that market now and see that continuing. \n We need less reinsurance that we once needed because of the makeup of the portfolio. So those are all tailwinds. And then in addition to that, you have AIG 200, which I gave some numbers on my prepared remarks that we have real tailwinds there. Not only are we going to continue to have a clear sight in the overall path to $1 billion, but it's starting to earn through in the income statement and just our overall expense discipline. \n So we don't heavily rely on one component. There's 4 to 5 that drive it. And no, it does not require us to be in the same rate environment. I mean you have to be in the range on the social inflation and loss cost inflation. But we watch that all the time and believe that we have a lot of momentum. And I'll give more guidance specifically in the next couple of quarters. I mean, the momentum I've seen and the excellent job that Dave McElroy and the entire leadership team have done in General Insurance is a real differentiator. And the momentum they have is tremendous. So it just leaves me with a lot of optimism. Yes. Thanks, Elyse. In terms of the timing, as I said, we're targeting a first quarter IPO. We're working really hard on the operational separation. We'll close with Blackstone, who's going to be a tremendous partner for us, we hope, in July. And so working over the next 6 months to position Life and Retirement to have a very successful IPO is the primary focus. \n Second is we have to think about, I said in my prepared remarks, of like the regulatory environment and the market itself. So that will really dictate in terms of how much we do. And it just gives us a lot of flexibility to accordion it up if there's really favorable market conditions or just to go in with a -- we wouldn't go to an IPO with a 9.9%. We'll do something larger than that. But the size, timing, we'll continue to give you guidance as we get further along in the year with the progress that we're making. I don't know, Mark, if you want to add anything to the capital management, the debt. Yes. Meyer, thank you for the question. I'll turn it over to Mark in a second. But I think that when we looked at the partnership with Blackstone, there was a variety of factors that went into it, certainly them making a commitment on the equity investment, making certain that Life and Retirement still maintained its authority and ability to shape the investments with Blackstone. So we contained that. A lot of the assets that we have or will transfer are classes that they have exceptional track records on, and so we're working through that. \n We do believe that the AUM will grow over time with Life and Retirement. And so this will become a smaller percentage, and the base case was that not only with the Blackstone partnership that our overall business model will evolve to be more efficient over time. But Mark, maybe you could fill in a couple of the details of that. And one thing I would add, Meyer, in terms of what Mark just noted is that the high net worth space is changing dramatically in peak zones. We expect to see a continued change in the Excess & Surplus Lines as more alternatives -- it was basically split in the second quarter between admitted and non-admitted new business. So that's just something that we're going to watch. I mean, there's no specific trends that are going to be substantially different than the guidance we've given. But there is some change in that business that we want to make sure with the market-leading position that we take advantage of solving problems for clients but also repositioning the portfolio to have less volatility. Yes. Mark, why don't you start and then turn it over to Kevin in terms of talking about product? Erik, let me handle that one. The guidance that I provided in the past and we'll stay with is that there are meaningful savings for Life and Retirement within AIG 200. That will be tailwinds to them. We had said around $125 million, Life and Retirement achieved some of that. But there's a big number left for us in terms of earning through that over the next 18 months. So think about roughly $100 million of AIG 200 benefits. Then there is allocations and parent service fees that goes over to Life and Retirement today that will either dissipate or we'll still have those services as we transition for Life and Retirement to become a public company. \n So that's in the range of $75-plus million. So Kevin has a decent amount to invest towards building out the public company. And we think with other initiatives for expense savings through separation office that it should largely be neutral to Life and Retirement. And we think the synergies that exist within the remaining company, AIG, that it's neutral to beneficial. And we'll give more guidance as we get closer to the end of the year when we've done more work in the separation office. Thank you very much for the question. Mark put a lot of comments in his prepared remarks. We watch loss cost inflation and margin on everything we do in terms of portfolio optimization. That's really what I refer to when I talk about how do we position General Insurance, particularly on the Commercial side, to have an optimized portfolio. We've had several years of rate increases. We're building margin. \n And some specific lines of business have been getting more rate than others and they're the ones that need it. But it's something that Dave McElroy and the entire team spend every day thinking about and believe that there is absolute runway to continue to develop margin. But Dave, do you want to talk a little bit about how you're approaching it in some of the different segments of the business that you're focused on? Thanks, Tracy. No, the 9.9% is predicated on a strategic partnership that starts to accelerate all the things that we want to do to set Life and Retirement up to be a public company. And we're really focused on getting that done within the first quarter and making sure that the organization is set up to do that. And again, there's regulatory and market considerations that we'll always look at. But those are really the bigger ones than tying really what the cornerstone investor has brought to the table versus the eventual IPO. As Mark mentioned, we have a lot more flexibility because of the consumption of the foreign tax credits. And so 2022, we'll start to outline what we think will likely happen as we get closer to the end of the year. No. Mark, do you want to cover that? Yes. Thanks, Mark. And I want to just thank everyone for joining us today. Before we end the call, I want to thank our colleagues around the world for what they've accomplished over the last 6 months, especially considering the challenges that have been presented in work remote environments. We have a talented, hardworking colleague base that's executing on multiple complex initiatives simultaneously, which I think makes us very unique, very proud of the team, remains very focused on ensuring quality in everything that we do and delivering significant value to all of our stakeholders. Have a great day."

            "content": "Yes. Thank you. So Erik, I think what's important is to keep in mind that this is not a change in our portfolio strategy. This is an enhancement of our portfolio strategy. Blackstone has tremendous origination capability. And we believe that their ability to originate in these asset classes exceeds our current ability. And in addition to that, they have a broader range of assets within the subclasses. And the combination of their ability to originate with more capacity and also the breadth of their asset classes, we believe, will allow us to create new products to support transactions. \n And our intention will be to work together to innovate strategies that will allow us to grow faster. We do not think of the balance sheet as static. We think about a growing balance sheet. And so rather than focusing just on the yield of this part of the portfolio, I think about the overall portfolio strategy. So again, this is not a change in our strategy. This is an enhancement of it, and that's how we think about it."

            "content": "Yes. Thank you, Peter. Thank you, Phil. Phil, the rate increase story is one you don't -- you want to make sure it's calibrated off of all the other things you're doing in the portfolio. So what we've done over the last 3 years is a lot of risk selection and terms and conditions and attachment point and account exposures and managing that. So if you fall in love with a singular rate increase number and you define your book, you ultimately probably end up adversely selected against. So you actually have to put that in context. \n And I always use examples. It's like I might have gotten a 10% rate increase on a contractor in New York and I'm still chasing New York labor law, I will lose, okay? And for the industry, it's a little bit of like commercial auto. We've been getting rate increases in commercial auto for 8 years and we still haven't solved that problem. So rate increase can be a false positive. What we've done with a sort of technical understanding of it, looking at it and aggressively realizing that we have a large account book, upper middle-market book, and we need more rate to reflect the more complexity of that book. \n So that's -- we think that's sustainable going into the latter part of this year, okay? We think we can accommodate what would be expected loss cost inflations. And at the same time, and this is what I've observed in the last quarter, is there's more pricing to the account, the account characteristics. Is it moderated? Yes, a little bit, okay? But it's moderated off of still over loss cost trends. And what I would say, when I look at my dispersion charts, we don't have the same outlier plus 30% up, but we have a swell of more of a plus 5% to 10%, plus 10% to 20%, plus 20% to 30% type of accounts that are basically aggregating in that in terms of rate reflecting the exposure. \n The other piece, and I -- we have to be careful with it because we want to reflect our book and our clients. But we do -- we are in the multiyear phase of a re-underwriting and an influence in the market. And when you look at compounding and you look at the compounding that might exist in Excess Casualty or primary D&O, okay, or even programs, okay, these are numbers that are plus 93%, plus 86%, okay, plus 70% over a period of time of starting in late '18 to the first half of 2021. It's not a panacea, okay? If you're -- if I was trying to write investment banking E&O and I've got 90%, I probably would still lose. But I mean, it's a good baseline for the progress that we've done with the business. \n The last thing I'd say is that we had a lot of new business this quarter. I think it was cited on a couple of calls. And remember, this is also being priced now with an elevated rate/price structure. So the same business 2 years ago or 3 years ago is now up that 30% to 40% when we can produce it as a piece of new business. And that's very much formed a lot of our success in this quarter was moving from remediation to an offensive point, capturing the quality of what AIG has with multinational claims reputation complexity and actually building off of that for the strongest new business we've had in a while. So that flows off of technical rate increases and our consistent view of that. But it's important to sort of lay that all out, so you understand that we're not -- we're really looking at this with the lens on all aspects of the business. So with that, I'll..."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Mark Lyons",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter of 2021, AIG reported adjusted pretax income, or APTI, of $1.7 billion and adjusted after-tax income of $1.3 billion. We produced an annualized return on adjusted common equity of 10.5% for AIG, 12.3% for General Insurance and 16.4% for Life and Retirement. \n The annualized return on adjusted tangible common equity was 11.6% for the quarter. On a GAAP basis, AIG reported $91 million of net income with the principal difference between GAAP and adjusted after-tax income of $1.3 billion being the accounting treatment of Fortitude, net investment income and associated realized gains and losses. \n Before I move to General Insurance though, I'd like to add to Peter's remarks on the Blackstone SMA. This arrangement incorporates specific specialty asset classes comprised mostly of private credit, alternatives and structured products, where Blackstone is a world leader in sourcing and origination and has a demonstrated track record of delivering yield uplift and not public fixed income securities. \n The fee structure is 30 basis points on the initial $50 billion of AUM, increasing to 45 basis points for the annual new AUM of $8.5 billion starting 4 quarters later as well as for the reinvested run-off AUM. Therefore, fee should rise from 30 basis points initially towards 43 basis points by the end of the initial 6-year contract term for Blackstone's share of the assets. For this part of our portfolio, it's fair to expect that fees will somewhat precede the benefits of the impact of enhanced origination and differentiated asset classes and recognition of related yield uplift. \n We believe this SMA arrangement is unique in that L&R maintains control over its overall asset allocation, asset-liability management, liquidity and credit profile and the nature of individual investment structures. In addition, Life and Retirement has the opportunity to enhance overall investment management by focusing on improving efficiencies and asset classes that are not part of the SMA as well as optimizing performance across the whole portfolio. We believe the combination of these efficiencies, together with the Blackstone focus on maximizing the performance of SMA assets and growth opportunities on the overall AUM, should drive net yield uplift. \n Before leaving the Blackstone transaction, I want to note that a GAAP loss on sale is anticipated with a 9.9% equity purchase by Blackstone as well as with subsequent IPO sell-downs due to the inclusion of OCI and GAAP book value. Given that OCI in future periods is subject to market fluctuations, the impact cannot be fully estimated at this time. \n As respects Affordable Housing, note that the $5.1 billion purchase price translates to an approximate $3 billion after-tax gain on sale, which will benefit book value and provides approximately $4 billion of cash to parent with a minority portion held back in a regulated Life and Retirement entity to further strengthen an already historically strong RBC level. This transaction is expected to close by year-end 2021. \n Moving to General Insurance. Second quarter adjusted pretax income was $1.2 billion, up $1 billion even year-over-year, primarily reflecting increased pretax underwriting income of over $800 million, along with $200 million and change of increased pretax net investment income, driven primarily by private equity returns. Catastrophe losses of $118 million were significantly lower this quarter compared to $674 million in the prior year quarter. \n Prior year development was $51 million favorable this quarter compared to favorable development of $74 million in the prior year quarter. This included $58 million of net favorable development in North America and $7 million of net unfavorable development in International, both of which reflect marginal changes in the underlying operations. As usual, there is net favorable amortization from the adverse development cover, which amounted to $49 million this quarter. \n It's important to put in context though the recent strength of the property and casualty market and how General Insurance has executed within this environment. As Peter mentioned in his remarks, the book has had nearly 3 turns at correction since 2018. Risk appetite and risk selection have been materially sharpened. Complementary and properly evolving reinsurance programs have been implemented. Certain lines and segments were exited or massively reduced. Clearer and broader distribution has been embraced. And Lexington has been stood up as a major E&S platform. \n All of this was accomplished while simultaneously achieving significant rate in excess of loss cost trends with materially better terms and conditions. These actions formed the foundation as to why General Insurance has shown material improvement in the underlying accident year ex CAT combined ratios in both the historically underperforming North America Commercial segment and the International Commercial segment as well. \n North America Commercial has shown a 620 basis point improvement in the accident year ex CAT combined ratio over the prior year quarter. The International Commercial segment has continued to improve profitability with 370 basis points improvement compared to the prior year quarter. This shows demonstrable margin improvement stemming from the totality of the actions enumerated earlier. And this level of Global Commercial improvement is noteworthy as Global Commercial made up 71% of worldwide net premiums written through the first half of 2021. \n Additionally, the Global Commercial book is increasingly becoming a global specialty book comprised of below-frequency, high-severity coverages. As a result, General Insurance Commercial, although large and global in scope, is not a mere index of the market, but instead an underwriting company, where risk selection and business mix are important factors in achieving profitable growth while mitigating volatility. \n Turning to Personal Insurance. As we noted on our first quarter earnings call, our year-over-year net premium written comparison for the second quarter would improve, given the timing of the initial COVID-19 impact and the distortions from Syndicate 2019 being reflected also during the second quarter of 2020. Global Personal Lines net premiums written grew by approximately 45% or 41% on a constant dollar basis, aided by the Syndicate 2019 comparison. \n Elsewhere within the segment, the second quarter of 2021 North America Personal Insurance saw premiums in travel and warranty business increase. This was driven by a rebound in travel activity and increased consumer spending but not yet back to the pre-pandemic levels. Our outlook for net premiums written for the next 6 months in North America Personal Insurance is between $450 million and $500 million per quarter. \n We continue to anticipate earned margin expansion throughout 2021 and into 2022, resulting from AIG's favorable underwriting actions taken and global market conditions involving strong rate increases well above loss trend, improved terms and conditions and a more profitable, less volatile mix. Given the specific market dynamics of where we choose to play, we don't foresee any material slowing-down in achieved rate levels throughout the balance of the year. \n Now I'd like to comment a bit on inflation, which one needs to think about in terms of both economic and social inflation. Based on the Consumer Price Index and the Producer Price Index, headline inflation indicates an annualized rate of about 5.5% to 7.5%, which has accelerated since March. Some components of the indices have become worrisome, such as used cars and trucks being up about 45% and energy commodities being north of 40%. But medical care services, whose impact stretches across most casualty, auto, workers' compensation and excess placements, although higher, are much more tame than headline inflation would indicate with physician services up about 4% recently and hospital services up about 2.5%. \n Costs involving labor, materials, construction and related services are up and will impact property coverages and CAT claim costs in the near term. These indications demonstrate that the inflationary impact on any given insurer is a direct function of the products and the mix they write and where they play within an insurance program. Social inflation, however, is much more of a U.S.-centric phenomenon, driven by a highly litigious culture. Social inflation also has correlations to social change initiatives, including income inequality and changing sentiments towards business, to name a few. \n Being further away from risk though is a meaningful inflation counter. And AIG's General Insurance has taken strong preemptive action in that regard by minimizing lead umbrellas in favor of higher positions within insurance programs. For example, our Excess Casualty average attachment points for national and corporate U.S. accounts have increased approximately 3.5x and 5.5x, respectively, since 2018. This significantly increased distance from attaching is a key overall portfolio benefit. Taken all together, a U.S. view towards a total inflation rate of 4% to 5% is arguably reasonable for the near to medium term. Our second quarter rate increases, together with our view of pricing for the rest of the year, provide continued margin in excess of this loss cost trend. \n Now turning to Life and Retirement. When compared with the prior year, favorable equity markets drove higher alternative investment returns, principally higher private equity returns, which reflect the impact of the 1 quarter lag on the period. Life Insurance continues to reflect the COVID-19-related mortality provision that has dropped relative to the prior quarters. We estimate our exposure to the population is approximately $65 million to $75 million per 100,000 population deaths. Mortality, however, exclusive of COVID-19, continues to be favorable compared to pricing assumptions. \n Within Individual Retirement, excluding the Retail Mutual Fund business, net flows were positive for the quarter and favorable by over $1.2 billion when compared with the second quarter of 2020, led by Index Annuities rebounding to be higher by approximately $700 million with Variable Annuity net flow being about $365 million stronger year-over-year. Group Retirement premiums and deposits were up with net flows being relatively flat while also experiencing an improved surrender rate sequentially. \n The Life business has seen consistent premiums and lower lapse surrender rates over the last 4 quarters than prior. And for Institutional Markets, premiums and deposits were up compared to the prior year and sequentially. GIC issuance was also higher both sequentially and year-over-year. And we executed several large pension risk transfer transactions during the quarter. The pipeline for pension risk transfer opportunities, both direct and through reinsurance, remain very strong in both the U.S. and in the U.K. \n We continue to actively manage the impacts from the low interest rate and tighter credit spread environment. And our earlier provided range for expected annual spread compression has not changed as our base investment spreads for the second quarter were within our annual 8 to 16 point guidance. Further, new business margins generally remain within our targets at current new money returns due to active product management and a disciplined pricing approach. Lastly, post June 30, we closed on the sale of our Retail Mutual Fund operation. As you are aware, Retail Mutual Funds has contributed negative net flows over the last 2 years, and the drag from this will now cease. \n Moving to Other Operations. The adjusted pretax loss was $610 million, inclusive of $94 million from consolidation and elimination entries, which principally reflect adjustments offsetting investment returns in the subsidiaries, which are then eliminated at Other Operations. Before consolidations and eliminations, the adjusted pretax loss was $516 million, $184 million worse than the second quarter of 2020. But that quarter included 2 months of Fortitude Re results of $96 million. \n In addition, during the second quarter of 2021, we also increased prior year legacy loss reserves by a net $65 million, driven mostly by Blackboard exposures. And we increased our incentive program accrual to reflect the strong performance year-to-date, whereas in 2020, we began adjusting our incentive program accrual in the third quarter. After applying these adjustments, the comparison is actually favorable year-over-year. \n Shifting to investments. Overall net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.2 billion, virtually flat from the second quarter of 2020. But again, adjusting the second quarter of 2020 for Fortitude net investment income over that 2-month period, this quarter's net investment income was $362 million higher than the prior year, reflecting strong private equity returns at an annualized 27% return rate for the quarter and hedge fund results at a 21% annualized return rate for the quarter, along with stable interest and dividend income. \n Turning to the balance sheet. At June 30, book value per common share was $76.73, up 7% from 1 year ago. Adjusted book value per common share was $60.07 per share, up 7.5% from 1 year ago, driven primarily by strong operating performance. And adjusted tangible book value per common share was $54.24, up 8.1% from a year ago. As Peter noted, at quarter end, AIG parent liquidity was $7.2 billion. During the second quarter, we made a $354 million prepayment to the U.S. Treasury in connection with certain tax settlement agreements emanating from the pre-2007 period as well as completed debt tenders for an aggregate purchase price of $359 million. \n Our debt leverage at June 30 was 27% even, down 140 basis points from the end of 2020 and down 360 basis points from June 30, 1 year ago. Our primary operating subsidiaries remain profitable and well capitalized. For General Insurance, we estimate the U.S. pool fleet risk-based capital ratio for the second quarter to be between 460% and 470% and Life and Retirement is estimated to be between 440% and 450%, both above our target ranges. \n Lastly, as respects tax, I want to reiterate that the remaining net operating loss or NOL portion of AIG's DTA at the time of deconsolidating L&R for tax purposes will still be available to offset future General Insurance and/or AIG taxable income through their natural expiration. As of June 30, that portion of the DTA totaled $6.3 billion and is available to offset up to $30 billion of taxable income. Upon tax deconsolidation, what will cease is the ability to utilize up to 35% of Life Insurance company income against NOLs or any remaining FTC. \n With that, I will now turn it back over to Peter. Just I think that -- I think the core point was to emphasize that this removes the constraint. So rather than on the specifics of the sizing, which as Peter said, which is very market-sensitive and contingent, but having that ability now to not have such a constraint is the main point we really wanted to push over. Yes. Well, Meyer, as Peter said, the level of these specialty assets are usually much more labor-intensive and are always on the higher end of the scale, if you think of it in a rate card sense. And so that part is completely within expectations of what we would say. Within -- with our own internal structures, we would have also increasing costs as you graduate up to the overall asset class categories that they are experiencing for us. So there's some gap, but some of that cost accounting view is less clear than you think. But we know what the value we're going to be getting out of that is going to be more than worth it. It's -- what I think that you're going to -- let me make a general statement first. And that is that I think Peter tried a position that's been -- and we may have said this a little bit in past calls. But you should think of the combined ratio gains on the Commercial side of being loss ratio and expense ratio driven and on the Personal Line side, more expense ratio driven. We've gotten a lot more stability in the loss ratios on there, so you'll continue to see that. But to the extent -- it's roughly a -- I would actually say you should anticipate the expense ratio to continue to improve in North America Personal. Yes. Thank you, Peter. Yes. And I think Kevin will have a few things to help you with there as well. So on the asset management, think of it this way, Erik. You've got the -- the uplift will come more delayed than the fees, to your point, firstly. And secondly is as the $50 billion of AUM is worked through, we have been thinking about it mostly, it takes 7 years for that runoff to turn over. As that occurs, it also shifts from 30 to 45 basis points. The $8.5 million annually that will also come in to take it to the 92.5% will be at 45 bps. So you kind of have that curve that I was alluding to in my prepared remarks. \n So as a result of that, you're going to have a net yield uplift coming through as a function of when those investments can be made. So if you think of it, you're really -- at the end of year 1, you still have 85% of the original AUM still not turned over, which is why you get the delay aspect. But it's -- we expect that to chip away and close a lot sooner than you might think. But that -- the important point to remember is that L&R completely has that control. So the takeoff between the liquidity and the rating distributions and the asset distribution and capital trade-offs and so forth is all within the management discretion of L&R. Kevin? Sure. I guess, a couple of things. First off, we are viewing -- although we're showing substantial margin improvement on a quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year basis, we actually think we're being conservative in this. As I said, I think, on past calls, there has been a lot of change over the last 3 years, including some of the fundamental channels in which we get business. So we think we got every one of those correctly. \n Nobody bats 1,000, so you wind up having a little bit of risk margin associated with each of the last several accident years. So we feel good overall. And we feel about the trajectory of the improvement and where it's coming from and that we're not booking and displaying things without having an appropriate risk margin associated with it. I hope that's helpful."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to AIG's First Quarter 2021 Financial Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. \n At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Sabra Purtill, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nSabra Purtill: Thank you. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. Today's call will cover AIG's first quarter 2021 financial results announced yesterday afternoon. The news release, the financial supplement and financial results presentation were posted on our website at www.aig.com, and the 10-Q for the quarter will be filed later today after the call. \n Our speakers today include Peter Zaffino, President and CEO; and Mark Lyons, Chief Financial Officer. Following their prepared remarks, we will have time for Q&A. David McElroy, CEO, General Insurance; and Kevin Hogan, CEO, Life and Retirement, will be available for Q&A.  \n Today's remarks may contain forward-looking statements, including comments relating to company performance, strategic priorities, including AIG's intent to pursue a separation of its Life and Retirement business, business mix and market conditions and the effects of COVID-19 on AIG. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. Actual performance and events may materially differ. \n Factors that could cause results to differ include the factors described in our 2020 annual report on Form 10-K and our other recent filings made with the SEC. AIG is not any -- under any obligation and expressly disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  \n Additionally, some remarks may refer to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website. \n I'll now turn the call over to Peter. \nPeter Zaffino: Hello, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, I will start our call with a high-level overview of AIG's consolidated financial results for the first quarter. I will then review results from General Insurance and the significant progress we've made with our portfolio, which allowed us to pivot from remediation to growth heading into 2021. Following that, I will review first quarter results for Life and Retirement. I will then provide an update on the work we're doing on the separation of Life and Retirement from AIG. And lastly, I'll provide an AIG 200 update. Mark will give you more details on the financial results, and then we will take questions. \n AIG had an excellent start to the year, and we have significant momentum across the entire organization. In the first quarter, we delivered outstanding performance in General Insurance. We saw continued solid results in Life and Retirement. We made meaningful progress on the separation of Life and Retirement from AIG, and we significantly advanced AIG 200 with the transformation remaining on track to deliver $1 billion in savings by the end of 2022 against the cost to achieve of $1.3 billion.  \n In addition, our balance sheet and financial flexibility remain exceptionally strong, allowing us to focus on profitable growth across our portfolio; prudent investments in modern technology and digital capabilities; separating Life and Retirement from AIG in a manner that maximizes value for our stakeholders and positions both companies for long-term success; and returning capital to our shareholders when appropriate.  \n As you saw in our press release, our adjusted after-tax income in the first quarter was $1.05 per diluted share compared to $0.12 in the prior year quarter. We ended the first quarter with parent liquidity of $7.9 billion, and we repurchased $92 million of common stock in connection with warrant exercises and an additional $270 million against the $500 million buyback plan we mentioned on our last call. We expect to complete the additional $230 million of that buyback plan by the end of the second quarter. \n Turning to General Insurance. Net premiums written increased approximately $600 million year-over-year or approximately 6% on an FX constant basis driven by nearly $1 billion or a 22% year-over-year increase in our global commercial businesses. This 22% increase in global Commercial was driven by higher retentions; excellent new business production, particularly in international; strong performance in first quarter portfolio repositioning; and continued rate momentum.  \n North America Commercial net premiums written grew by approximately 29%, an outstanding result, due to a variety of factors, including increased 1/1 writings of Validus Re, continued strong submission flow in Lexington, rate improvement, strong retention and higher new business in segments we have been targeting for growth.  \n In addition, as a result of the improved quality of our North America Commercial portfolio and our improved reinsurance program, which now includes lower attachment points in North America, we did not need to purchase as much CAT reinsurance limit in 2021, the benefits of which will come through in future quarters.  \n International Commercial had an exceptionally strong first quarter with the year-over-year growth in net premiums written of approximately 13% on an FX constant basis. Increases were balanced across the portfolio with the strongest growth in International Financial Lines, followed by our Specialty business. Looking ahead, we expect overall growth in net premiums written for the remainder of 2021 to be higher than the 6% we saw in the first quarter of this year with more balancing growth across our global commercial and personal portfolios. \n   With respect to rate, momentum continued with overall global commercial rate increases of 15%. North America Commercial rate increases were also 15% driven by improvements in Lexington Casualty with 36% rate increases, Excess Casualty with 31% rate increases and Financial Lines with rate increases over 24%. International Commercial rate increases maintained strong momentum at 14% in the first quarter of 2021, which is typically the largest quarter of the year for our European business. These increases were driven by Energy with 26% rate increases; Commercial Property with 19% rate increases; and Financial Lines with 20% rate increases. \n   Turning to global Personal Insurance. Net premiums written in the first quarter declined 23% on an FX constant basis due to our Travel business continuing to be impacted by the pandemic as well as reinsurance cessions to Syndicate 2019, our partnership with Lloyd's. Adjusted for these impacts, global Personal Insurance net premiums written were down only 1.6% on an FX constant basis. We expect to see strong year-over-year growth for the remainder of the year with a rebound in global Personal Insurance as the effects of COVID subside, the repositioning and reunderwriting this portfolio nears completion and a full year of reinsurance cessions relating to Syndicate 2019 will be complete. \n We are very pleased with the continued improvement in our combined ratios, including and excluding CATs. I don't need to remind everyone where we were when I outlined our turnaround strategy 3 years ago. In the first quarter this year, the adjusted accident year combined ratio was 92.4%, a 310 basis point improvement year-over-year, driven by a 440 basis point improvement in our adjusted commercial accident year combined ratio. The adjusted accident year loss ratio improved 160 basis points to 59.2%, driven by a 330 basis point improvement in global Commercial.\n The expense ratio improved 150 basis points, reflecting the impact of AIG 200 savings and continued expense discipline. We expect to continue to improve the expense ratio throughout 2021, particularly as we deliver on our AIG 200 programs.  \n To provide further color on combined ratio improvements, in North America, the adjusted accident year combined ratio improved to 95.6%, a 210 basis point improvement year-over-year. This reflects a 370 basis point improvement in the North America Commercial Lines adjusted accident year combined ratio, which came in at 93.9%.  \n In International, the adjusted accident year combined ratio improved to 90.2%, a 340 basis point improvement year-over-year. This reflects a 490 basis point improvement in the International Commercial Lines adjusted accident year combined ratio, which came in at 86.8%, a 150 basis point improvement in the International Personal Lines adjusted accident year combined ratio, which was 94%.  \n With respect to catastrophes, first quarter 2021 was the worst first quarter for the industry in over a decade in terms of weather-related CAT losses, largely due to winter storms in Texas. Net CAT losses in General Insurance were $422 million, primarily driven by the Texas storms and do not include any new COVID-related estimated losses for the first quarter.  \n Now let me touch on reinsurance assumed. As I noted, Validus Re saw strong 1/1 renewals across most lines, with attractive levels of risk-adjusted rate improvement. The team focused on prudent capital deployment and portfolio construction, while improving technical ratios and reducing volatility. With respect to April 1 renewals, within International Property, rate adjustments varied from mid-single digits to upwards of 30% on loss-impacted accounts, and our Japanese renewals were very successful with 100% client retention, net limits largely similar year-over-year and risk-adjusted rate increases, which were in the high single digits.  \n Before moving on, I want to highlight the quality and the strength of our General Insurance portfolio. Of course, optimization work will continue, but the magnitude of what was accomplished over the last 3 years is worth reflecting on because the first quarter of 2021 was an important inflection point for our team. Our focus pivoted from remediation to driving profitable growth.  \n These are a couple of concrete examples of how we have repositioned the global portfolio. Gross limits in global Commercial will reduce by over $650 billion. North America Excess Casualty removed over $10 billion in lead limits and increased writings in mid-excess layers in order to achieve a more balanced portfolio. And in Lexington, we repositioned this business to focus on wholesale distribution. The team grew the top line in 2020 for the first time in over a decade. The portfolio is now more balanced, and the submission flow has increased over 100% the last couple of years.  \n The enormity of the turnaround and the complexity of execution that was accomplished cannot be understated. We now have a disciplined culture that is grounded in underwriting fundamentals, a well-defined and articulated risk appetite. We remain laser-focused on terms and conditions and obtaining rate above loss costs. And we have an appropriate reinsurance program in place to manage severity and volatility. Our global portfolio is poised for improving profitability and more predictable results.  \n While all this was taking place in General Insurance, our colleagues in Life and Retirement did an excellent job, maintaining a market-leading position in the protection and retirement savings industry and, together with our investment colleagues, consistently delivered solid performance against the backdrop of persistent low interest rates and challenging market conditions.  \n Turning to Life and Retirement's first quarter. This business also had strong results. Adjusted pretax income in the first quarter was $941 million, and adjusted return on common equity was 14.2%, reflecting our diversified businesses and high-quality investment portfolio. The sensitivities we provided last quarter generally held up with respect to equity markets, 10-year reinvestment rates and mortality, although first quarter results were towards the higher end of our mortality expectations net of reinsurance and other offsets.\n We continue to actively manage impacts from the low interest rate and tighter credit spreads environment, and the range we previously provided for expected annual spread compression of 8 to 16 basis points has not changed. Our high-quality investment portfolio is well positioned to navigate uncertain environments, as demonstrated by our steady performance through the macroeconomic stress and high levels of volatility in 2020. And our variable annuity hedging program has continued to perform as expected, providing offsetting protection during periods of volatile capital markets.  \n We believe Life and Retirement is positioned to deliver strong, sustainable financial results due to the quality of its balance sheet, diversified product offerings and distribution, effective hedging programs and disciplined risk management.  \n With respect to the separation of Life and Retirement from AIG, we continue to work diligently and with a sense of urgency towards an IPO of up to 19.9% of the business. We made significant progress on several fronts, including preparing standalone audited financials and having an independent party conduct a thorough actuarial review. No concerns have been raised about Life and Retirement's portfolio as a result of this work.  \n As I noted on our last earnings call, we did receive a number of credible inquiries from parties interested in purchasing a minority stake in Life and Retirement and our Investment Management group. We conducted a robust evaluation of those opportunities to determine if they offered a better long-term outcome for our stakeholders than an IPO. At this time, we believe an IPO remains the optimal path forward to maximize value for our stakeholders and to position the business for additional value creation as a standalone company.  \n In addition, an IPO allows AIG to retain maximum flexibility regarding the operations of the business as well as the separation process. Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we've made.  \n Turning to AIG 200. All 10 operational programs are deep into execution mode. Our transformation teams continue to perform exceptionally well, despite the continued remote work environment. Recent progress on IT modernization has enabled us to reach the halfway point or $500 million of our run rate savings target. $250 million in cumulative run rate savings has been realized in APTI through the first quarter of this year, with $75 million of incremental savings achieved within the first quarter income statement.  \n Key highlights on our progress include the successful transition of our shared services operations in over 6,000 colleagues to Accenture at year-end 2020. This partnership is going extremely well, with KPIs at or better than pre-transition levels. We also negotiated a multiyear agreement with Amazon Web Services to execute on an accelerated cloud strategy, which is a significant step forward in modernizing our infrastructure. \n And with the new highly experienced leader in Japan, we made significant progress during the first quarter on our AIG 200 strategy in Japan and are on track to finalize target outcomes as we modernize this business by developing digital capabilities with agile product innovation.  \n Before turning the call over to Mark, I want to thank our global colleagues for their resilience and excellent support of our clients, policyholders, distribution partners and other stakeholders. The last year, in particular, brought unimaginable stress and tragedy across the world. And for our colleagues that came during a time of significant and foundational change, yet they never lost sight of our purpose at AIG and continue to be focused and dedicated to the important work we do, each other and the communities in which we live and work, I could not be prouder of what we've achieved together.  \n We are in great businesses, have global scale, loyal clients, exceptional relationships with distribution of reinsurance partners, world-class experts and industry veterans, and we strive to be a responsible corporate citizen with a diverse and inclusive workforce that delivers value to our shareholders and all other stakeholders. I am confident AIG is on its way to becoming a top-performing company in everything that we do.  \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark. \nMark Lyons: Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Since Peter has already provided a good overview of the quarter, I'll just add that we posted a 7.4% annualized adjusted return on common equity at the AIG level, an 8.2% adjusted return on tangible common equity at the AIG level, an 8.5% adjusted return on segment common equity for General Insurance and a 14.2% adjusted return on segment common equity for Life and Retirement.  \n Now moving to General Insurance. First quarter adjusted pretax income was $845 million, up $344 million year-over-year, primarily reflecting increased underwriting income in International as well as increased global net investment income driven by alternatives. Catastrophe losses totaled $422 million pretax or 7.3 loss ratio points this quarter compared to 6.9 loss ratio points in the prior year quarter. The CAT losses were mostly comprised of $390 million related to the winter storms, primarily impacting Commercial Lines, including AIG Re. The net impact of the winter storms reflects the benefit of our Commercial reinsurance program and changes to our PCG portfolio as a result of Syndicate 2019. \n  Overall, prior year development was $56 million favorable this quarter, which included $58 million of net favorable development in North America, driven by $52 million of favorable development from the ADC amortization and $2 million of net unfavorable development in International. It's worthwhile to note that General Insurance still has $6.6 billion remaining of the 80% quota share ADC cover. There was also, embedded within these figures, $33 million of unfavorable development related to COVID-19 claims that relate back to 2020 loss occurrences or a movement of less than 3%. Emanating primarily from Validus Re and Talbot are Lloyd's Syndicate. \n Our General Insurance business continued to materially improve driven largely by strong accident year 2021 ex-CAT showings in both North America and International Commercial lines. So rather than double up on facts that Peter has shared, the main drivers of the attritional underwriting gain improvements were for North America Commercial, Lexington, Financial Lines, and Excess Casualty. And from International Commercial, the main drivers of improvement stem from Property, Talbot and Financial Lines. As Peter noted, on a global Commercial Lines basis, the accident year combined ratio, excluding CAT, was 90.4%, which represents a 440 basis point improvement over the prior year's quarter with 75% of that improvement attributable to a lower loss ratio and 25% of the improvement attributable to a lower expense ratio. \n  Turning to Personal Insurance. Starting in the second quarter of this year, meaning next quarter, our year-over-year comparisons will begin to improve, given the timing of the initial COVID-19 impact and the formation of Syndicate 2019 in May of 2020. Although North American personal lines had a 74% drop in net premiums written, as Peter highlighted, it's also important to understand that the other units within the segment, which represented nearly 50% of the quarter's net earned premium, is comprised mostly of Warranty and Personal A&H business had their net premium only fall off marginally. Our International Personal Lines business, which by size, dominates our overall global Personal Insurance business, continues to perform well with 150 basis points improvement in the accident year ex CAT combined ratio, reflecting an improved loss ratio and expense discipline. \n Now to expand on some of Peter's marketplace commentary, various areas continued to accelerate the adequacy of achieved rate beyond that of prior quarters. For example, the level of Excess Casualty rate increases continued and then many units exceed prior results, such as CAT excess coverage out of Bermuda, North America Corporate and National Admitted Excess and the Lexington. The increase achieved in the first quarter of 2020 and compounded in the first quarter of 2021 alone, ignoring prior to 2020 rate increases, exceeded 150% for Bermuda-based capacity business, which makes sense given recent years' price efficiency on these capacity excess layers, and approximately 115% for the other mentioned units. U.S. Financial Lines on the same compound basis has seen an excess of 80% increases for the staples of D&O and EPLI. \n Internationally, the 14% first quarter overall rate increase saw continued rate expansion in key markets such as the U.K. at plus 23%; Global Specialty at plus 15%; Europe and the Middle East at 14%; Latin America at 13%; and Asia Pacific also at 13%, when excluding the tempering influence of predominantly Japan at 3%.  \n Lastly, Cyber achieved our highest rate increase yet at 41% for the quarter. These increases are clearly broad based by region and line of business all around the world.  \n I'd now like to spend a few minutes on 2 observations: one, the impact of net rate change versus gross rate change; and two, some examples of new business rate adequacy relative to a renewal rate adequacy. So first, our achieved North America Commercial rate change for the quarter on a net basis is now estimated to be at least 150 basis points stronger than the corresponding gross rate change largely due to our increased net positions across selected product lines. \n Last year, much of the achieved gross rate increase was being ceded to reinsurers, where now there is much less so. The shift to higher net positions resulted directly from our prior stated strategy of improving the gross book such that we had increased confidence to retain the appropriate amount of net, and because we could not take a higher net position previously because of the legacy imbalance of very large limits written.  \n Now moving on to relative rate adequacy. We see continuing indications in North America of new business having stronger relative rate adequacy over renewal rate levels in most lines of business. This likely doesn't reflect different class mixes, but instead an additional margin for a lesser-known exposure. However, this should be expected and is also historically supported given where we are in the underwriting cycle as new business is less established with an insurer versus an existing client renewal relationship.  \n A further related item involves renewal retention. As General Insurance implemented revised underwriting standards, renewal retentions predictably would have been impacted, especially in the target line. Now even with superior risk selection, rate and term condition changes that have been achieved, renewal retentions have improved to the mid-80% in the aggregate across all Commercial Lines in both North America and across internationally.  \n We also see improvement in the Lexington, where E&S has lower industry retentions based on the nature of the business, and this is very positive for the book, and we see it across Specialty lines and across most admitted retail books. This is indicative of the reunderwriting actions being successful, having settled down and now with General Insurance being comfortable with the underlying insured exposures that meet our risk appetite.\n Based on current market conditions and our view of the foreseeable future, we continue to anticipate earned margin expansion throughout 2021 and into 2022, resulting from AIG's favorable underwriting actions taken, favorable global market conditions, materially improved terms and conditions and a more profitable, less volatile business mix.  \n As a result, I would like to reconfirm our outlook for a sub-90% accident year combined ratio, excluding CAT by the end of 2022. Global Commercial Lines are very nearly at the sub-90% level now, and global Personal Lines is running at 96% for the first quarter. Given our portfolio composition, the market conditions and our strategic repositioning of North America Personal, we anticipate greater continued margin expansion within Commercial Lines than Personal Lines. We are highly confident that we will achieve our sub-90% target and have several paths to help us get there, some via mix, some via reasonable market conditions persisting and some via expense levers. \n Now I'd also like to unpack some of Peter's high-level net written premium growth comments for 2021 with an emphasis here on next quarter -- second quarter. North America Commercial is expecting to see growth of approximately 10% for the second quarter of 2021 relative to the prior year quarter driven mostly from Lexington across a host of product lines and Admitted Casualty, both primary and excess. This growth will be two-pronged as growth on the front end will be coupled with lower reinsurance cessions, especially from those lines subject to the casualty quota share.  \n North America Personal is expected to see significant second quarter 2021 growth, but it is driven by the Syndicate 2019 reinsurance cession change that we've been signaling. You will recall, North American Personal had a negative $150 million net written premium in the second quarter of 2020 due to many Syndicate 2019 treaties becoming effective, including an unearned premium cover for the PCG high net worth book. That distortive spike in cession, which is not repeatable in the second quarter of 2021, will give the appearance of considerable growth but instead will provide a PCG net premium that is more stable on an ongoing basis. so overall, for North America, both Personal and Commercial combined, we anticipate net written premium growth between 35% to 40% for the second quarter over the second quarter of the prior year. International Commercial in the second quarter of 2021 is expected to be roughly plus 7% net written premium growth driven by Global Specialty, Financial Lines and Talbot, and International Personal is expected to be approximately flat relative to the prior year quarter. \n Now turning to Life and Retirement. Adjusted pretax income increased by 57% or $340 million compared to the first quarter of 2020, with favorable equity markets driving higher private equity returns, lower deferred acquisition cost amortization, a rebound in most areas of sales and higher fee income. The increase also reflects favorable short-term impacts from tighter credit spreads, driving higher call and tender income and higher fair value option bond returns. This increase was partially offset by adverse mortality as U.S. COVID-related population death of approximately 205,000 in the first quarter were higher than earlier anticipated, which was also reflected in our own experience.  \n In terms of premiums and deposits, we continue to see encouraging improvement in retail sales. Individual Retirement premium and deposits grew 8% from the prior year quarter, which we consider a pre-COVID quarter, as the sales pipeline carried through March of last year, with index and variable annuities both exceeding prior year levels. \n In Group Retirement, group acquisition deposits increased significantly from prior year, although both periodic and non-periodic deposits declined leading to a marginal reduction in overall gross group premiums and deposits of 2%. \n In Life Insurance, premiums and deposits grew 6% overall with year-over-year growth in both the U.S. and international. \n Finally, while Institutional Markets did not conclude any significant pension risk transfer transactions in the quarter, the pipeline of direct and reinsurance transactions going into the second quarter is very strong. particularly with many defined benefit plans nearing fully funded status.  \n Turning to net flows and related activity. Our portfolio reflects the dynamic environment quarter-by-quarter of the last year. Individual Retirement net flows improved by approximately $1 billion over the first quarter of 2020 driven by variable annuities and retail mutual fund. And yet when excluding retail mutual funds, net flows were positive, led by index annuities rebounding to be plus $1 billion for the quarter, which is vertically identical to 1 year ago, but with steady progress from a low of $439 million in the second quarter of 2020 to the plus $1 billion this quarter.  \n Surrender rates were up slightly over the last few quarters within Individual Retirement, for fixed and index, whereas variable annuity surrender rates have been more comparable as have for Group Retirement. Similarly, the Life business has seen consistently lower lapse and surrender rates over the last 4 quarters than prior.  \n Life and Retirement continues to actively manage the impacts from the low interest rate and tighter credit spread environment, and the previously provided range for expected annual spread compression has not changed. New business margins generally remain within our targets at current new money returns due to active product management, disciplined pricing approaches and our significant asset origination and structuring capabilities.  \n Moving to Other Operations. Adjusted pretax loss was $530 million, which was inclusive of $176 million of losses from the consolidation and eliminations line, which principally reflects adjustments offsetting investment returns in the subsidiaries by being eliminated in Other Operations, so it wouldn't be double counting.  \n Before consolidation and eliminations, adjusted pretax loss was $354 million, which was $481 million better than the first quarter of 2020, which included a $317 million adjusted pretax loss related to Fortitude and a $30 million onetime cash grant given to employees to help with unanticipated costs when the global pandemic began last March. \n The first quarter also reflects lower corporate interest expense and lower corporate general expenses, and we expect this to continue throughout 2021. However, one might expect some continued volatility within the consolidations and eliminations line, which can fluctuate based on investment returns.  \n Now shifting to investment. Net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.2 billion or $492 million higher than the first quarter of 2020. Adjusting first quarter 2020 for Fortitude's investment income to make the comparison apples to apples, this quarter's net investment income on an APTI basis was actually $611 million higher than the prior year or plus 23%, reflecting strong private equity and real estate returns as well as bond tender and call premiums, which more than offset the lower income on the AFS fixed income portfolio. We continue to have a high-quality investment portfolio that is positioned well under any market condition.  \n Turning to the balance sheet. At March 31, book value per common share was $72.37, down 5.3% from year-end, reflecting net unrealized mark-to-market losses on the investment portfolio. Adjusted book value per share was $58.69, up nearly 3% from December 31. \n At quarter end, AIG parent, as Peter noted, had cash and short-term liquidity assets of $7.9 billion, and we repaid our March debt maturity of $1.5 billion and repurchased the $362 million of shares, as Peter outlined. Our GAAP debt leverage at March 31 was 28.4%, flat to year-end given downward fixed income market movements negatively impacting AOCI, despite the repaid debt maturity mentioned earlier.  \n Our primary operating subsidiaries remain profitable and well capitalized. For General Insurance, we estimate the U.S. pool fleet risk-based capital ratio for the first quarter to be between 465% and 475%, and Life and Retirement fleet is estimated to be between 435% and 445%, both well above our target ranges. \n And with that, I will now turn it back over to Peter. \nPeter Zaffino: Thank you, Mark. And Jake, I think we're ready to start Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we will begin with Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. \nElyse Greenspan: My first question is on the -- sorry, the Life and Retirement separation. I appreciate the update in terms of working towards the IPO. Is the plan in terms of timing for that to still take place at some point later this year? Or do you have a more finer tune around that? \nPeter Zaffino: Yes. Thanks, Elyse. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're working with a sense of urgency on the IPO. We've made really significant progress working on standalone financial statements, actuarial, have set up the organization to operationally separate. So we're working very hard on several fronts related to the IPO. \n I mean, the ultimate timing of completing this step should depend on a number of factors. Some are out of our control, such as regulatory and market conditions, but we're still working towards the same time line, which is by the end of 2021. But again, depending on those factors, it could always slip into the first quarter 2022. But it's -- the company is focused, and we're going through all the details and moving forward. \nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then my second question is on the market commentary you guys gave. A lot of helpful color. Mark, you said that you guys expect continued earned margin expansion throughout 2021 and into 2022. So is -- I guess, you're kind of giving us a market view, it sounds like, for the next year. \n Is the expectation that rates would stabilize and get closer to trend in 2022? I'm just trying to put that together. You're just kind of giving us the outlook that rates should remain strong through 2021, and then we'll see how 2022 transpires with earned versus plus trends. \nPeter Zaffino: Let me start with your question on rate, and then I'll turn it over to Mark to provide a little more context and then talk about the earned. But I think, look, this is the third year where we're seeing rate, at least at AIG, above loss cost. And again, you really have to just take a look at the overall portfolio because quarter-to-quarter, it may be a little bit different, meaning just the seasonality of our business, whether it's Validus Re having a big inception date in the first quarter, crop specialty Europe driven more towards the first quarter. \n So when we look at it, we're looking at first quarter to first quarter, and there has been no slowdown in terms of the rate environment and believe that we're building margin above loss cost rate on rate, and I think that's kind of where Mark was alluding to. \n The market environment, Elyse, is always hard to predict, but we think the market that we're in is the market we're going to see for the remaining part of the year, and it's very hard to predict beyond that. \n Mark, do you want to add any more context? \nMark Lyons: Just a bit. Thank you, Peter. I think Peter nailed it both, Elyse. I want to reemphasize, though, what Peter said. Every quarter's mix is pretty different, and I know that's a written viewpoint that earns in. But we've already written business in -- that we can -- last year that's going to earn into 2021. And we've already written one quarter that's going to go into 2022. So we're not counting -- we believe we're going to have the margin expansion, as has been noted. That doesn't really depend on the existing level of rate levels in the market. \nOperator: Next question will come from Brian Meredith with UBS. \nBrian Meredith: So a couple here. Quickly, just Mark, I'm curious, you said you had some COVID development in the quarter. Where did that come from? And are we pretty close to, you think, kind of being done with the COVID-related losses, at least in the General Insurance business? I understand there could still be some more in Life. \nPeter Zaffino: Go ahead, Mark. \nMark Lyons: So yes, we can localize a lot of that to contingency business out of Talbot. And on Validus, I think there was really just 2 contracts involved, so it's not like a widespread in any way. So that overwhelmingly accounts for it. \n And I think for your second question, yes, we didn't put any additional provisions. We're happy where we are associated with it. So I think we're on the downflow, to say the least. \nBrian Meredith: Got you. And then my second question, I guess, for Peter for both of you all. What is your kind of view with respect to loss trend or kind of tort inflation and loss trend as we kind of -- the economy reopens here, courts reopen? Kind of how are you thinking about that from a reserving perspective and maybe also from a pricing perspective? \nPeter Zaffino: Yes. So I'll have Mark add to my comments. We're watching it very carefully, Brian. It's something that, again, as it emerges throughout the world, the economy starts to reopen, we look at it line of business by line of business, lead versus excess, different trends that we're seeing in the portfolio emerging over the last year and then how we forecast that to look for the future. \n So I think the balance of the portfolio is being shaped in a way to mitigate that, and we're very focused on making sure that, even in the growth that we outlined in the first quarter that we're growing, where we know that we're going to get the risk-adjusted returns in terms of deploying the capital. \n So I think we're very disciplined. It's circular with underwriting actuarial claims. We're learning a lot and making sure that we're positioned the portfolio accordingly. \n Mark, do you want to add anything to that? \nMark Lyons: Yes. Thank you, Peter. I think I may have commented on this before, but I think it's probably worth bearing again is, long term, there's generally been a 200 basis point addition beyond economic inflation for social inflation. Clearly, that's been south of that over the last few years. \n But that's one way of looking at it by having a range of loss trends and not necessarily just point estimating it, and it really varies by line of business, clearly. I think in the past, I've also commented that our loss trend in Excess Casualty, for example, is very close to double digits, number one, and so really it varies across the board. \n And when you get to Peter's comment on portfolio, think of the best way to insulate yourself from unexpected spikes in economic or social inflation, irrespective of which one, is by having the portfolio change. And the mix away from leads and having more mid excess, not just in casualty, but other places, aggregated lead moves that portfolio further away from risk insulating you more from any compound views of that. So I think that's how we look at it. And I think all of that is important and it comes to bear. \nBrian Meredith: Yes, yes. Mark, I was just -- part of my question, though, was also just asking this. Do you think about, when you make reserve assumptions or pick assumptions, are you making different assumptions with respect to what potential loss trend and when you're pricing the business? \nMark Lyons: Not materially because you have calendar year views, right? So claims when they're settled or when they're reported don't care what their accident year was. \nOperator: We'll now hear from Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler. \nJon Paul Newsome: And congratulations on the quarter. I was hoping you could turn to maybe a big picture question about the Life Insurance business and just -- is there kind of a path to positive net flows? \n Obviously, the Institutional business is volatile quarter-to-quarter, but maybe you could just give us a sense of -- especially as we get closer to thinking about the Life IPO, how those net flows might recover to a positive level. \nPeter Zaffino: Okay. Thanks, Paul. Kevin? \nKevin Hogan: Yes. Thanks, Paul. Look, net flows reflect the trends of premiums and deposits as against the surrender behavior. As Mark pointed out, we haven't really seen much material change in the surrender behavior a little bit within sort of expected margins, but premiums and deposits is really another story. \n And we said that the second quarter last year was going to be the low water mark. It certainly was. And in fact, the first quarter of this year is one of the largest sales quarters we've had in the Individual businesses since we created AIG Financial Distributors. And while the month of January was actually still below last year, and we consider last year's first quarter a pre-COVID quarter because, really, the pipelines were full right through March, April. We saw growth from February over January, March over February a pretty significant growth. \n So the end of the quarter, we're really back at what we consider to be normal run rates for that business. And as Mark pointed out, both index and variable annuity, very strong for us there. \n And so the one line of business, fixed annuities, they're a little bit lower than historical levels, but we also saw recovery in fixed annuities towards the end of the quarter. And so we're feeling optimistic about the forward curve for the individual business. And as Mark pointed out, across annuities, because we've announced relative to the retail mutual funds, right, we had positive flows. So I'm confident relative to the flows in the Individual Retirement business. \n For Group Retirement, it's a little bit of a different story. The group acquisitions -- the new group acquisitions actually were one of our strongest quarters and increased by $150 million over the prior year, whereas periodics were down about $50 million, and I think that reflects furloughs and people leaving the workforce. And then the non-periodic were also down a little bit for a variety of reasons. \n And in the Group Retirement business, we still see some modest negative flows, but I think that reflects the fact that we're a small, medium-sized plan provider. And in the consolidation that continues to go on in health care, we do see some of that large case consolidation. But the assets under management have continued to grow, obviously, supported by equity markets, and that's an important base of earnings for the fee side of the business. \n So we feel confident. We're being careful about capital deployment. We're seeing conditions improve, and our diverse product range and channel allow us to be careful where we deploy the capital, and we're seeing that start to come through in the first quarter. \nJon Paul Newsome: Is there a market component to -- or an interest rate component to keeping the ROE at least stable in Life business, in your opinion? \nKevin Hogan: Well, certainly, we provide the sensitivities and depending upon where equity markets are, where interest rates are, where credit spreads are and which way they're going, they have kind of a short-term impact on earnings volatility. But we price our products to make sure that we're making our returns based on broadly expected market conditions, not necessarily a single deterministic scenario. So we're not relying on market returns necessarily in the pricing of our products. \nOperator: Next question will come from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. \nRyan Tunis: I had one for Mark, and would you even be interested in David's thought if he's on the call. But I guess, thinking about classic economic inflation, wage-driven historically been kind of bad for workers' confidence. It's been a long time since we've had it. \n Are the risks from that type of scenarios on that line kind of still the same as they were 20 years ago? Are there mitigating factors? Just how are you thinking about workers' comp, if we do have just a normal inflationary economic cycle. \nPeter Zaffino: Let me start. You got to remember that 2/3 of our business is on high retentions, and so the fluctuation of frequency and in wage inflation and loss cost inflation is largely retained by our clients. I mean, so we've seen some fluctuation just because of high attachment points in which we have in the workers' comp book. \n And so Dave has been working really hard on our large account business and as well as workers' compensation in terms of the positioning in that. And I think the attachment points, the positioning of the book is really important. \n Dave, do you want to just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the marketplace and how we are reacting to it? \nDavid McElroy: Yes. Thank you, Peter. The -- I think workers' comp, I think there was some concern with COVID that there would be presumption. That mostly does not affect our book, okay, because of the high retentions that our clients have. That's very different than the middle market books and the small commercial books that might exist. \n I think the more illuminating issue is that workers' comp has been a profitable line, whether it was the state laws that muted it. And often, we get lost in our generalization of what is rate increase. Workers' comp has had modest to negative rate increase because it's been profitable for the industry. And I think it's very important for everybody to understand that, that's a discrete market, and a lot of the different parts of the market that we trade in, we -- that's absorbed by our clients. \n So the -- if that same client has General Liability or Financial Lines or even Property, that's a different market with different pricing than might be existing in the workers' comp market. So workers' comp market has actually worked, and everybody talks about it in terms of the rate increase, but that's a discrete-type market that reflects that. \n And I think our industry is fairly sophisticated to understand why that happens and then why other businesses need rate or need rate to expect -- to reflect exposure. So it's -- that's the workers' comp market. It's been a winner for this industry because of the reforms that happened at the state level. \nMark Lyons: Ryan, I'd add just one quick thing, if I could. You really started the question in the correlation on wage. And given Peter really talking about 2/3 of the book is really lost sensitive over high attachment points, it's actually more of a medical question than a wage indemnity question because medical trend is what could sneak over, especially on major permanent partial and things of that nature and permanent totals. So that's why it was actually a -- we're in a really good position on that because of the analysis that was done about 3 years ago on that book that's still holding today. So all those past assumptions are absolutely holding. \nRyan Tunis: Understood. And then my follow-up is just thinking about -- you're running at a little bit over 92, so you need about 2 points to get sub-90. Just you said rate alone, assumingly, would be able to get you there. Obviously, I think that there are some offsetting headwinds or just other things that, along the way, you got to get past. I'm not sure if that's more new business or what. Could you just remind us of some offsets to rate in terms of getting down to that 90 over the next couple of years? \nPeter Zaffino: Thanks, Ryan. So there's multiple factors in terms of driving the sub-90 combined ratio. One is we had a terrific start to the year, and so you can see we're driving top line growth, driving margin, improving combined ratios. So we like the momentum that we have. \n I think we're going to focus on continuing on the underwriting side. Certainly, the culture we're building out of risk selection, terms and conditions, making sure that we're getting rate above loss cost is the discipline that Dave is driving through General Insurance, and they're doing very well. \n I think you'll start to see -- I talked about in my prepared remarks,the AIG 200, while we announced run rate, we got to catch up a little bit in terms of some of the implementations. So we know that we have expense tailwinds in terms of what will be coming through with AIG 200. In addition to that, just normal expense management and being very disciplined on reinvestment and making sure that we are a company that's very focused on ways in which we can improve what we're doing and create our own investment capacity. \n I think you'll start to see the earned premium increasing from growth and strong new business. International had the best quarter new business that they've had since the new teams arrived. So that's -- there's a lot of momentum there. And then expect to see new business pick up as we continue throughout the year and the economy starts to recover. \n And then what I also mentioned in my prepared remarks is that we are not going to need as much reinsurance going forward just based on the gross portfolio. And so like we needed to probably buy a little bit more CAT, a little bit more on the risk side. Those are all improving, and those will be tailwinds over a period of time. So there's 4 or 5 components that will drive improved combined ratio in the subsequent quarters and into next year. \nOperator: We'll hear from Meyer Shields with KBW. \nMeyer Shields: Can you hear me? \nPeter Zaffino: Yes, Meyer. \nMeyer Shields: Okay. Sorry about that. So Mark, I'm trying to tie together a couple of comments because you're expecting, if I understand correctly, margin improvement into 2020, but we still get below the 90% on the underlying by year-end. So does that mean that we should expect to be there sooner if you won't need margin improvement later in 2022 to get below 90? \nMark Lyons: Do you want me to start that, Peter. \nPeter Zaffino: Yes. Go ahead, Mark. \nMark Lyons: So I think what we're trying to say in various ways is that looking sequentially is really not the way. You've got to really look at it quarter-over-quarter for the points that Peter brought up before about the mix being pretty different. The fact that although we've reduced the volatility dramatically, we still write volatile lines, right? So you still have a pop here or there that may not have really occurred in this quarter or the last quarter that still could at another time. \n We really need to see a few more accident quarters, if you will, pop in before we can declare victory in that sense. So you can't look at each quarter as a totally independent stand-alone on a sequential basis. \nMeyer Shields: Okay. That makes sense. The second question, I guess you talked about cyber rate increases, and I don't know whether sort of the way we typically think about trend is relevant. But is there any way you can outline how cyber loss expectations are changing? \nPeter Zaffino: Dave, do you want to take that? \nDavid McElroy: Yes. The -- thank you. The -- when we looked -- sometimes there's -- we index off of rate increases. And in fact, a big part of our story here at AIG has actually been risk selective and limit management and retentions and terms and conditions. And cyber was this year's case stuff, okay?\n It had been a profitable business. Ransomware started showing up, and what we've done is we've cauterized that with sublimits and coinsurance to reflect the fact that we're a big primary player, and we need to manage ransomware, and that's what we've done. \n And our renewal retention has come down. Our rate increase, which may be something cited and exciting for others, is up 40 -- it's 41%. But for us, it's actually managing the risk on the other side. So I look at that rate increase as a factor as opposed to our not only vertical but horizontal risk. \n It's a tough risk. We have it worldwide. We're leaders. We've been very active in terms of our prophylactic and our involvement in terms of trying to stem the actual loss itself. And we look at that as a viable product that we have controlled horizontally with reinsurance and vertically with reinsurance and with partnerships. \n And we look at that not only like every other Specialty business that we have in this company. We have a lot of them. We have to attack it, and we have to underwrite it with the facts of that business, and that's what we're doing. It should be -- it should scare the industry. It certainly gives us pause, and that's why we've been underwriting it very aggressively over the last 3 years. \nOperator: That last question will come from Tom Gallagher with Evercore. \nThomas Gallagher: Peter, just first a question on the decision to pursue the IPO versus the private sale. Was it mainly because we've gotten so much improvement in peer L&R public valuations that the gap narrowed where it wouldn't give you as much of a benefit? But any color you can give us as to what drove that decision. \nPeter Zaffino: Thanks, Tom. That is certainly one component. We always said the base case was going to be the IPO of 19.9%. So when we had entertained some of the inbounds from terrific companies, we evaluated the relative merits of the sale compared to the minority IPO. \n We took into account value creation, execution certainty, regulatory and rating agency implications, the delivery of Life and Retirement growth strategy over the long term, where we're going to be making the right investments to make sure we're getting the value of the 80.1%. It's a great business, and so we want to make sure that we are investing in it. \n And so when we weighed all those merits, ultimately, we felt that an IPO was going to fulfill the value for our stakeholders and decided that, that was the appropriate path for us. \nThomas Gallagher: Okay, okay. And then just a follow-up for Kevin on L&R. I think -- Peter, I think I heard you say you're reiterating the 8 to 16 basis point spread compression guide. \n I guess, my question is interest rates have risen a pretty good amount. Would you change within the 8 to 16 basis point band where you expect to operate? I think you used to say it was toward the high end of that. \nPeter Zaffino: Kevin, do you want to finish? \nKevin Hogan: Yes, absolutely. Yes, Tom. We have moved from the high end of the 8 to 16 towards the middle to the lower end based on the recent improvement in the yields. You have to monitor, obviously, the combination of where credit spreads are versus where actual base rates are. So it's not all what we saw in the base rates. You just have to look at the total reinvestment position. \nPeter Zaffino: All right. Great. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today, and have a great day. \nOperator: And with that, ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Peter Zaffino",
            "content": "Hello, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, I will start our call with a high-level overview of AIG's consolidated financial results for the first quarter. I will then review results from General Insurance and the significant progress we've made with our portfolio, which allowed us to pivot from remediation to growth heading into 2021. Following that, I will review first quarter results for Life and Retirement. I will then provide an update on the work we're doing on the separation of Life and Retirement from AIG. And lastly, I'll provide an AIG 200 update. Mark will give you more details on the financial results, and then we will take questions. \n AIG had an excellent start to the year, and we have significant momentum across the entire organization. In the first quarter, we delivered outstanding performance in General Insurance. We saw continued solid results in Life and Retirement. We made meaningful progress on the separation of Life and Retirement from AIG, and we significantly advanced AIG 200 with the transformation remaining on track to deliver $1 billion in savings by the end of 2022 against the cost to achieve of $1.3 billion.  \n In addition, our balance sheet and financial flexibility remain exceptionally strong, allowing us to focus on profitable growth across our portfolio; prudent investments in modern technology and digital capabilities; separating Life and Retirement from AIG in a manner that maximizes value for our stakeholders and positions both companies for long-term success; and returning capital to our shareholders when appropriate.  \n As you saw in our press release, our adjusted after-tax income in the first quarter was $1.05 per diluted share compared to $0.12 in the prior year quarter. We ended the first quarter with parent liquidity of $7.9 billion, and we repurchased $92 million of common stock in connection with warrant exercises and an additional $270 million against the $500 million buyback plan we mentioned on our last call. We expect to complete the additional $230 million of that buyback plan by the end of the second quarter. \n Turning to General Insurance. Net premiums written increased approximately $600 million year-over-year or approximately 6% on an FX constant basis driven by nearly $1 billion or a 22% year-over-year increase in our global commercial businesses. This 22% increase in global Commercial was driven by higher retentions; excellent new business production, particularly in international; strong performance in first quarter portfolio repositioning; and continued rate momentum.  \n North America Commercial net premiums written grew by approximately 29%, an outstanding result, due to a variety of factors, including increased 1/1 writings of Validus Re, continued strong submission flow in Lexington, rate improvement, strong retention and higher new business in segments we have been targeting for growth.  \n In addition, as a result of the improved quality of our North America Commercial portfolio and our improved reinsurance program, which now includes lower attachment points in North America, we did not need to purchase as much CAT reinsurance limit in 2021, the benefits of which will come through in future quarters.  \n International Commercial had an exceptionally strong first quarter with the year-over-year growth in net premiums written of approximately 13% on an FX constant basis. Increases were balanced across the portfolio with the strongest growth in International Financial Lines, followed by our Specialty business. Looking ahead, we expect overall growth in net premiums written for the remainder of 2021 to be higher than the 6% we saw in the first quarter of this year with more balancing growth across our global commercial and personal portfolios. \n   With respect to rate, momentum continued with overall global commercial rate increases of 15%. North America Commercial rate increases were also 15% driven by improvements in Lexington Casualty with 36% rate increases, Excess Casualty with 31% rate increases and Financial Lines with rate increases over 24%. International Commercial rate increases maintained strong momentum at 14% in the first quarter of 2021, which is typically the largest quarter of the year for our European business. These increases were driven by Energy with 26% rate increases; Commercial Property with 19% rate increases; and Financial Lines with 20% rate increases. \n   Turning to global Personal Insurance. Net premiums written in the first quarter declined 23% on an FX constant basis due to our Travel business continuing to be impacted by the pandemic as well as reinsurance cessions to Syndicate 2019, our partnership with Lloyd's. Adjusted for these impacts, global Personal Insurance net premiums written were down only 1.6% on an FX constant basis. We expect to see strong year-over-year growth for the remainder of the year with a rebound in global Personal Insurance as the effects of COVID subside, the repositioning and reunderwriting this portfolio nears completion and a full year of reinsurance cessions relating to Syndicate 2019 will be complete. \n We are very pleased with the continued improvement in our combined ratios, including and excluding CATs. I don't need to remind everyone where we were when I outlined our turnaround strategy 3 years ago. In the first quarter this year, the adjusted accident year combined ratio was 92.4%, a 310 basis point improvement year-over-year, driven by a 440 basis point improvement in our adjusted commercial accident year combined ratio. The adjusted accident year loss ratio improved 160 basis points to 59.2%, driven by a 330 basis point improvement in global Commercial.\n The expense ratio improved 150 basis points, reflecting the impact of AIG 200 savings and continued expense discipline. We expect to continue to improve the expense ratio throughout 2021, particularly as we deliver on our AIG 200 programs.  \n To provide further color on combined ratio improvements, in North America, the adjusted accident year combined ratio improved to 95.6%, a 210 basis point improvement year-over-year. This reflects a 370 basis point improvement in the North America Commercial Lines adjusted accident year combined ratio, which came in at 93.9%.  \n In International, the adjusted accident year combined ratio improved to 90.2%, a 340 basis point improvement year-over-year. This reflects a 490 basis point improvement in the International Commercial Lines adjusted accident year combined ratio, which came in at 86.8%, a 150 basis point improvement in the International Personal Lines adjusted accident year combined ratio, which was 94%.  \n With respect to catastrophes, first quarter 2021 was the worst first quarter for the industry in over a decade in terms of weather-related CAT losses, largely due to winter storms in Texas. Net CAT losses in General Insurance were $422 million, primarily driven by the Texas storms and do not include any new COVID-related estimated losses for the first quarter.  \n Now let me touch on reinsurance assumed. As I noted, Validus Re saw strong 1/1 renewals across most lines, with attractive levels of risk-adjusted rate improvement. The team focused on prudent capital deployment and portfolio construction, while improving technical ratios and reducing volatility. With respect to April 1 renewals, within International Property, rate adjustments varied from mid-single digits to upwards of 30% on loss-impacted accounts, and our Japanese renewals were very successful with 100% client retention, net limits largely similar year-over-year and risk-adjusted rate increases, which were in the high single digits.  \n Before moving on, I want to highlight the quality and the strength of our General Insurance portfolio. Of course, optimization work will continue, but the magnitude of what was accomplished over the last 3 years is worth reflecting on because the first quarter of 2021 was an important inflection point for our team. Our focus pivoted from remediation to driving profitable growth.  \n These are a couple of concrete examples of how we have repositioned the global portfolio. Gross limits in global Commercial will reduce by over $650 billion. North America Excess Casualty removed over $10 billion in lead limits and increased writings in mid-excess layers in order to achieve a more balanced portfolio. And in Lexington, we repositioned this business to focus on wholesale distribution. The team grew the top line in 2020 for the first time in over a decade. The portfolio is now more balanced, and the submission flow has increased over 100% the last couple of years.  \n The enormity of the turnaround and the complexity of execution that was accomplished cannot be understated. We now have a disciplined culture that is grounded in underwriting fundamentals, a well-defined and articulated risk appetite. We remain laser-focused on terms and conditions and obtaining rate above loss costs. And we have an appropriate reinsurance program in place to manage severity and volatility. Our global portfolio is poised for improving profitability and more predictable results.  \n While all this was taking place in General Insurance, our colleagues in Life and Retirement did an excellent job, maintaining a market-leading position in the protection and retirement savings industry and, together with our investment colleagues, consistently delivered solid performance against the backdrop of persistent low interest rates and challenging market conditions.  \n Turning to Life and Retirement's first quarter. This business also had strong results. Adjusted pretax income in the first quarter was $941 million, and adjusted return on common equity was 14.2%, reflecting our diversified businesses and high-quality investment portfolio. The sensitivities we provided last quarter generally held up with respect to equity markets, 10-year reinvestment rates and mortality, although first quarter results were towards the higher end of our mortality expectations net of reinsurance and other offsets.\n We continue to actively manage impacts from the low interest rate and tighter credit spreads environment, and the range we previously provided for expected annual spread compression of 8 to 16 basis points has not changed. Our high-quality investment portfolio is well positioned to navigate uncertain environments, as demonstrated by our steady performance through the macroeconomic stress and high levels of volatility in 2020. And our variable annuity hedging program has continued to perform as expected, providing offsetting protection during periods of volatile capital markets.  \n We believe Life and Retirement is positioned to deliver strong, sustainable financial results due to the quality of its balance sheet, diversified product offerings and distribution, effective hedging programs and disciplined risk management.  \n With respect to the separation of Life and Retirement from AIG, we continue to work diligently and with a sense of urgency towards an IPO of up to 19.9% of the business. We made significant progress on several fronts, including preparing standalone audited financials and having an independent party conduct a thorough actuarial review. No concerns have been raised about Life and Retirement's portfolio as a result of this work.  \n As I noted on our last earnings call, we did receive a number of credible inquiries from parties interested in purchasing a minority stake in Life and Retirement and our Investment Management group. We conducted a robust evaluation of those opportunities to determine if they offered a better long-term outcome for our stakeholders than an IPO. At this time, we believe an IPO remains the optimal path forward to maximize value for our stakeholders and to position the business for additional value creation as a standalone company.  \n In addition, an IPO allows AIG to retain maximum flexibility regarding the operations of the business as well as the separation process. Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we've made.  \n Turning to AIG 200. All 10 operational programs are deep into execution mode. Our transformation teams continue to perform exceptionally well, despite the continued remote work environment. Recent progress on IT modernization has enabled us to reach the halfway point or $500 million of our run rate savings target. $250 million in cumulative run rate savings has been realized in APTI through the first quarter of this year, with $75 million of incremental savings achieved within the first quarter income statement.  \n Key highlights on our progress include the successful transition of our shared services operations in over 6,000 colleagues to Accenture at year-end 2020. This partnership is going extremely well, with KPIs at or better than pre-transition levels. We also negotiated a multiyear agreement with Amazon Web Services to execute on an accelerated cloud strategy, which is a significant step forward in modernizing our infrastructure. \n And with the new highly experienced leader in Japan, we made significant progress during the first quarter on our AIG 200 strategy in Japan and are on track to finalize target outcomes as we modernize this business by developing digital capabilities with agile product innovation.  \n Before turning the call over to Mark, I want to thank our global colleagues for their resilience and excellent support of our clients, policyholders, distribution partners and other stakeholders. The last year, in particular, brought unimaginable stress and tragedy across the world. And for our colleagues that came during a time of significant and foundational change, yet they never lost sight of our purpose at AIG and continue to be focused and dedicated to the important work we do, each other and the communities in which we live and work, I could not be prouder of what we've achieved together.  \n We are in great businesses, have global scale, loyal clients, exceptional relationships with distribution of reinsurance partners, world-class experts and industry veterans, and we strive to be a responsible corporate citizen with a diverse and inclusive workforce that delivers value to our shareholders and all other stakeholders. I am confident AIG is on its way to becoming a top-performing company in everything that we do.  \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark. Thank you, Mark. And Jake, I think we're ready to start Q&A. Yes. Thanks, Elyse. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're working with a sense of urgency on the IPO. We've made really significant progress working on standalone financial statements, actuarial, have set up the organization to operationally separate. So we're working very hard on several fronts related to the IPO. \n I mean, the ultimate timing of completing this step should depend on a number of factors. Some are out of our control, such as regulatory and market conditions, but we're still working towards the same time line, which is by the end of 2021. But again, depending on those factors, it could always slip into the first quarter 2022. But it's -- the company is focused, and we're going through all the details and moving forward. Let me start with your question on rate, and then I'll turn it over to Mark to provide a little more context and then talk about the earned. But I think, look, this is the third year where we're seeing rate, at least at AIG, above loss cost. And again, you really have to just take a look at the overall portfolio because quarter-to-quarter, it may be a little bit different, meaning just the seasonality of our business, whether it's Validus Re having a big inception date in the first quarter, crop specialty Europe driven more towards the first quarter. \n So when we look at it, we're looking at first quarter to first quarter, and there has been no slowdown in terms of the rate environment and believe that we're building margin above loss cost rate on rate, and I think that's kind of where Mark was alluding to. \n The market environment, Elyse, is always hard to predict, but we think the market that we're in is the market we're going to see for the remaining part of the year, and it's very hard to predict beyond that. \n Mark, do you want to add any more context? Go ahead, Mark. Yes. So I'll have Mark add to my comments. We're watching it very carefully, Brian. It's something that, again, as it emerges throughout the world, the economy starts to reopen, we look at it line of business by line of business, lead versus excess, different trends that we're seeing in the portfolio emerging over the last year and then how we forecast that to look for the future. \n So I think the balance of the portfolio is being shaped in a way to mitigate that, and we're very focused on making sure that, even in the growth that we outlined in the first quarter that we're growing, where we know that we're going to get the risk-adjusted returns in terms of deploying the capital. \n So I think we're very disciplined. It's circular with underwriting actuarial claims. We're learning a lot and making sure that we're positioned the portfolio accordingly. \n Mark, do you want to add anything to that? Okay. Thanks, Paul. Kevin? Let me start. You got to remember that 2/3 of our business is on high retentions, and so the fluctuation of frequency and in wage inflation and loss cost inflation is largely retained by our clients. I mean, so we've seen some fluctuation just because of high attachment points in which we have in the workers' comp book. \n And so Dave has been working really hard on our large account business and as well as workers' compensation in terms of the positioning in that. And I think the attachment points, the positioning of the book is really important. \n Dave, do you want to just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the marketplace and how we are reacting to it? Thanks, Ryan. So there's multiple factors in terms of driving the sub-90 combined ratio. One is we had a terrific start to the year, and so you can see we're driving top line growth, driving margin, improving combined ratios. So we like the momentum that we have. \n I think we're going to focus on continuing on the underwriting side. Certainly, the culture we're building out of risk selection, terms and conditions, making sure that we're getting rate above loss cost is the discipline that Dave is driving through General Insurance, and they're doing very well. \n I think you'll start to see -- I talked about in my prepared remarks,the AIG 200, while we announced run rate, we got to catch up a little bit in terms of some of the implementations. So we know that we have expense tailwinds in terms of what will be coming through with AIG 200. In addition to that, just normal expense management and being very disciplined on reinvestment and making sure that we are a company that's very focused on ways in which we can improve what we're doing and create our own investment capacity. \n I think you'll start to see the earned premium increasing from growth and strong new business. International had the best quarter new business that they've had since the new teams arrived. So that's -- there's a lot of momentum there. And then expect to see new business pick up as we continue throughout the year and the economy starts to recover. \n And then what I also mentioned in my prepared remarks is that we are not going to need as much reinsurance going forward just based on the gross portfolio. And so like we needed to probably buy a little bit more CAT, a little bit more on the risk side. Those are all improving, and those will be tailwinds over a period of time. So there's 4 or 5 components that will drive improved combined ratio in the subsequent quarters and into next year. Yes, Meyer. Yes. Go ahead, Mark. Dave, do you want to take that? Thanks, Tom. That is certainly one component. We always said the base case was going to be the IPO of 19.9%. So when we had entertained some of the inbounds from terrific companies, we evaluated the relative merits of the sale compared to the minority IPO. \n We took into account value creation, execution certainty, regulatory and rating agency implications, the delivery of Life and Retirement growth strategy over the long term, where we're going to be making the right investments to make sure we're getting the value of the 80.1%. It's a great business, and so we want to make sure that we are investing in it. \n And so when we weighed all those merits, ultimately, we felt that an IPO was going to fulfill the value for our stakeholders and decided that, that was the appropriate path for us. Kevin, do you want to finish? All right. Great. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today, and have a great day."

            "name": "Kevin Hogan",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Paul. Look, net flows reflect the trends of premiums and deposits as against the surrender behavior. As Mark pointed out, we haven't really seen much material change in the surrender behavior a little bit within sort of expected margins, but premiums and deposits is really another story. \n And we said that the second quarter last year was going to be the low water mark. It certainly was. And in fact, the first quarter of this year is one of the largest sales quarters we've had in the Individual businesses since we created AIG Financial Distributors. And while the month of January was actually still below last year, and we consider last year's first quarter a pre-COVID quarter because, really, the pipelines were full right through March, April. We saw growth from February over January, March over February a pretty significant growth. \n So the end of the quarter, we're really back at what we consider to be normal run rates for that business. And as Mark pointed out, both index and variable annuity, very strong for us there. \n And so the one line of business, fixed annuities, they're a little bit lower than historical levels, but we also saw recovery in fixed annuities towards the end of the quarter. And so we're feeling optimistic about the forward curve for the individual business. And as Mark pointed out, across annuities, because we've announced relative to the retail mutual funds, right, we had positive flows. So I'm confident relative to the flows in the Individual Retirement business. \n For Group Retirement, it's a little bit of a different story. The group acquisitions -- the new group acquisitions actually were one of our strongest quarters and increased by $150 million over the prior year, whereas periodics were down about $50 million, and I think that reflects furloughs and people leaving the workforce. And then the non-periodic were also down a little bit for a variety of reasons. \n And in the Group Retirement business, we still see some modest negative flows, but I think that reflects the fact that we're a small, medium-sized plan provider. And in the consolidation that continues to go on in health care, we do see some of that large case consolidation. But the assets under management have continued to grow, obviously, supported by equity markets, and that's an important base of earnings for the fee side of the business. \n So we feel confident. We're being careful about capital deployment. We're seeing conditions improve, and our diverse product range and channel allow us to be careful where we deploy the capital, and we're seeing that start to come through in the first quarter. Well, certainly, we provide the sensitivities and depending upon where equity markets are, where interest rates are, where credit spreads are and which way they're going, they have kind of a short-term impact on earnings volatility. But we price our products to make sure that we're making our returns based on broadly expected market conditions, not necessarily a single deterministic scenario. So we're not relying on market returns necessarily in the pricing of our products. Yes, absolutely. Yes, Tom. We have moved from the high end of the 8 to 16 towards the middle to the lower end based on the recent improvement in the yields. You have to monitor, obviously, the combination of where credit spreads are versus where actual base rates are. So it's not all what we saw in the base rates. You just have to look at the total reinvestment position."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "David McElroy",
            "content": "Yes. Thank you, Peter. The -- I think workers' comp, I think there was some concern with COVID that there would be presumption. That mostly does not affect our book, okay, because of the high retentions that our clients have. That's very different than the middle market books and the small commercial books that might exist. \n I think the more illuminating issue is that workers' comp has been a profitable line, whether it was the state laws that muted it. And often, we get lost in our generalization of what is rate increase. Workers' comp has had modest to negative rate increase because it's been profitable for the industry. And I think it's very important for everybody to understand that, that's a discrete market, and a lot of the different parts of the market that we trade in, we -- that's absorbed by our clients. \n So the -- if that same client has General Liability or Financial Lines or even Property, that's a different market with different pricing than might be existing in the workers' comp market. So workers' comp market has actually worked, and everybody talks about it in terms of the rate increase, but that's a discrete-type market that reflects that. \n And I think our industry is fairly sophisticated to understand why that happens and then why other businesses need rate or need rate to expect -- to reflect exposure. So it's -- that's the workers' comp market. It's been a winner for this industry because of the reforms that happened at the state level. Yes. The -- thank you. The -- when we looked -- sometimes there's -- we index off of rate increases. And in fact, a big part of our story here at AIG has actually been risk selective and limit management and retentions and terms and conditions. And cyber was this year's case stuff, okay?\n It had been a profitable business. Ransomware started showing up, and what we've done is we've cauterized that with sublimits and coinsurance to reflect the fact that we're a big primary player, and we need to manage ransomware, and that's what we've done. \n And our renewal retention has come down. Our rate increase, which may be something cited and exciting for others, is up 40 -- it's 41%. But for us, it's actually managing the risk on the other side. So I look at that rate increase as a factor as opposed to our not only vertical but horizontal risk. \n It's a tough risk. We have it worldwide. We're leaders. We've been very active in terms of our prophylactic and our involvement in terms of trying to stem the actual loss itself. And we look at that as a viable product that we have controlled horizontally with reinsurance and vertically with reinsurance and with partnerships. \n And we look at that not only like every other Specialty business that we have in this company. We have a lot of them. We have to attack it, and we have to underwrite it with the facts of that business, and that's what we're doing. It should be -- it should scare the industry. It certainly gives us pause, and that's why we've been underwriting it very aggressively over the last 3 years."
        },
        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Mark Lyons",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Since Peter has already provided a good overview of the quarter, I'll just add that we posted a 7.4% annualized adjusted return on common equity at the AIG level, an 8.2% adjusted return on tangible common equity at the AIG level, an 8.5% adjusted return on segment common equity for General Insurance and a 14.2% adjusted return on segment common equity for Life and Retirement.  \n Now moving to General Insurance. First quarter adjusted pretax income was $845 million, up $344 million year-over-year, primarily reflecting increased underwriting income in International as well as increased global net investment income driven by alternatives. Catastrophe losses totaled $422 million pretax or 7.3 loss ratio points this quarter compared to 6.9 loss ratio points in the prior year quarter. The CAT losses were mostly comprised of $390 million related to the winter storms, primarily impacting Commercial Lines, including AIG Re. The net impact of the winter storms reflects the benefit of our Commercial reinsurance program and changes to our PCG portfolio as a result of Syndicate 2019. \n  Overall, prior year development was $56 million favorable this quarter, which included $58 million of net favorable development in North America, driven by $52 million of favorable development from the ADC amortization and $2 million of net unfavorable development in International. It's worthwhile to note that General Insurance still has $6.6 billion remaining of the 80% quota share ADC cover. There was also, embedded within these figures, $33 million of unfavorable development related to COVID-19 claims that relate back to 2020 loss occurrences or a movement of less than 3%. Emanating primarily from Validus Re and Talbot are Lloyd's Syndicate. \n Our General Insurance business continued to materially improve driven largely by strong accident year 2021 ex-CAT showings in both North America and International Commercial lines. So rather than double up on facts that Peter has shared, the main drivers of the attritional underwriting gain improvements were for North America Commercial, Lexington, Financial Lines, and Excess Casualty. And from International Commercial, the main drivers of improvement stem from Property, Talbot and Financial Lines. As Peter noted, on a global Commercial Lines basis, the accident year combined ratio, excluding CAT, was 90.4%, which represents a 440 basis point improvement over the prior year's quarter with 75% of that improvement attributable to a lower loss ratio and 25% of the improvement attributable to a lower expense ratio. \n  Turning to Personal Insurance. Starting in the second quarter of this year, meaning next quarter, our year-over-year comparisons will begin to improve, given the timing of the initial COVID-19 impact and the formation of Syndicate 2019 in May of 2020. Although North American personal lines had a 74% drop in net premiums written, as Peter highlighted, it's also important to understand that the other units within the segment, which represented nearly 50% of the quarter's net earned premium, is comprised mostly of Warranty and Personal A&H business had their net premium only fall off marginally. Our International Personal Lines business, which by size, dominates our overall global Personal Insurance business, continues to perform well with 150 basis points improvement in the accident year ex CAT combined ratio, reflecting an improved loss ratio and expense discipline. \n Now to expand on some of Peter's marketplace commentary, various areas continued to accelerate the adequacy of achieved rate beyond that of prior quarters. For example, the level of Excess Casualty rate increases continued and then many units exceed prior results, such as CAT excess coverage out of Bermuda, North America Corporate and National Admitted Excess and the Lexington. The increase achieved in the first quarter of 2020 and compounded in the first quarter of 2021 alone, ignoring prior to 2020 rate increases, exceeded 150% for Bermuda-based capacity business, which makes sense given recent years' price efficiency on these capacity excess layers, and approximately 115% for the other mentioned units. U.S. Financial Lines on the same compound basis has seen an excess of 80% increases for the staples of D&O and EPLI. \n Internationally, the 14% first quarter overall rate increase saw continued rate expansion in key markets such as the U.K. at plus 23%; Global Specialty at plus 15%; Europe and the Middle East at 14%; Latin America at 13%; and Asia Pacific also at 13%, when excluding the tempering influence of predominantly Japan at 3%.  \n Lastly, Cyber achieved our highest rate increase yet at 41% for the quarter. These increases are clearly broad based by region and line of business all around the world.  \n I'd now like to spend a few minutes on 2 observations: one, the impact of net rate change versus gross rate change; and two, some examples of new business rate adequacy relative to a renewal rate adequacy. So first, our achieved North America Commercial rate change for the quarter on a net basis is now estimated to be at least 150 basis points stronger than the corresponding gross rate change largely due to our increased net positions across selected product lines. \n Last year, much of the achieved gross rate increase was being ceded to reinsurers, where now there is much less so. The shift to higher net positions resulted directly from our prior stated strategy of improving the gross book such that we had increased confidence to retain the appropriate amount of net, and because we could not take a higher net position previously because of the legacy imbalance of very large limits written.  \n Now moving on to relative rate adequacy. We see continuing indications in North America of new business having stronger relative rate adequacy over renewal rate levels in most lines of business. This likely doesn't reflect different class mixes, but instead an additional margin for a lesser-known exposure. However, this should be expected and is also historically supported given where we are in the underwriting cycle as new business is less established with an insurer versus an existing client renewal relationship.  \n A further related item involves renewal retention. As General Insurance implemented revised underwriting standards, renewal retentions predictably would have been impacted, especially in the target line. Now even with superior risk selection, rate and term condition changes that have been achieved, renewal retentions have improved to the mid-80% in the aggregate across all Commercial Lines in both North America and across internationally.  \n We also see improvement in the Lexington, where E&S has lower industry retentions based on the nature of the business, and this is very positive for the book, and we see it across Specialty lines and across most admitted retail books. This is indicative of the reunderwriting actions being successful, having settled down and now with General Insurance being comfortable with the underlying insured exposures that meet our risk appetite.\n Based on current market conditions and our view of the foreseeable future, we continue to anticipate earned margin expansion throughout 2021 and into 2022, resulting from AIG's favorable underwriting actions taken, favorable global market conditions, materially improved terms and conditions and a more profitable, less volatile business mix.  \n As a result, I would like to reconfirm our outlook for a sub-90% accident year combined ratio, excluding CAT by the end of 2022. Global Commercial Lines are very nearly at the sub-90% level now, and global Personal Lines is running at 96% for the first quarter. Given our portfolio composition, the market conditions and our strategic repositioning of North America Personal, we anticipate greater continued margin expansion within Commercial Lines than Personal Lines. We are highly confident that we will achieve our sub-90% target and have several paths to help us get there, some via mix, some via reasonable market conditions persisting and some via expense levers. \n Now I'd also like to unpack some of Peter's high-level net written premium growth comments for 2021 with an emphasis here on next quarter -- second quarter. North America Commercial is expecting to see growth of approximately 10% for the second quarter of 2021 relative to the prior year quarter driven mostly from Lexington across a host of product lines and Admitted Casualty, both primary and excess. This growth will be two-pronged as growth on the front end will be coupled with lower reinsurance cessions, especially from those lines subject to the casualty quota share.  \n North America Personal is expected to see significant second quarter 2021 growth, but it is driven by the Syndicate 2019 reinsurance cession change that we've been signaling. You will recall, North American Personal had a negative $150 million net written premium in the second quarter of 2020 due to many Syndicate 2019 treaties becoming effective, including an unearned premium cover for the PCG high net worth book. That distortive spike in cession, which is not repeatable in the second quarter of 2021, will give the appearance of considerable growth but instead will provide a PCG net premium that is more stable on an ongoing basis. so overall, for North America, both Personal and Commercial combined, we anticipate net written premium growth between 35% to 40% for the second quarter over the second quarter of the prior year. International Commercial in the second quarter of 2021 is expected to be roughly plus 7% net written premium growth driven by Global Specialty, Financial Lines and Talbot, and International Personal is expected to be approximately flat relative to the prior year quarter. \n Now turning to Life and Retirement. Adjusted pretax income increased by 57% or $340 million compared to the first quarter of 2020, with favorable equity markets driving higher private equity returns, lower deferred acquisition cost amortization, a rebound in most areas of sales and higher fee income. The increase also reflects favorable short-term impacts from tighter credit spreads, driving higher call and tender income and higher fair value option bond returns. This increase was partially offset by adverse mortality as U.S. COVID-related population death of approximately 205,000 in the first quarter were higher than earlier anticipated, which was also reflected in our own experience.  \n In terms of premiums and deposits, we continue to see encouraging improvement in retail sales. Individual Retirement premium and deposits grew 8% from the prior year quarter, which we consider a pre-COVID quarter, as the sales pipeline carried through March of last year, with index and variable annuities both exceeding prior year levels. \n In Group Retirement, group acquisition deposits increased significantly from prior year, although both periodic and non-periodic deposits declined leading to a marginal reduction in overall gross group premiums and deposits of 2%. \n In Life Insurance, premiums and deposits grew 6% overall with year-over-year growth in both the U.S. and international. \n Finally, while Institutional Markets did not conclude any significant pension risk transfer transactions in the quarter, the pipeline of direct and reinsurance transactions going into the second quarter is very strong. particularly with many defined benefit plans nearing fully funded status.  \n Turning to net flows and related activity. Our portfolio reflects the dynamic environment quarter-by-quarter of the last year. Individual Retirement net flows improved by approximately $1 billion over the first quarter of 2020 driven by variable annuities and retail mutual fund. And yet when excluding retail mutual funds, net flows were positive, led by index annuities rebounding to be plus $1 billion for the quarter, which is vertically identical to 1 year ago, but with steady progress from a low of $439 million in the second quarter of 2020 to the plus $1 billion this quarter.  \n Surrender rates were up slightly over the last few quarters within Individual Retirement, for fixed and index, whereas variable annuity surrender rates have been more comparable as have for Group Retirement. Similarly, the Life business has seen consistently lower lapse and surrender rates over the last 4 quarters than prior.  \n Life and Retirement continues to actively manage the impacts from the low interest rate and tighter credit spread environment, and the previously provided range for expected annual spread compression has not changed. New business margins generally remain within our targets at current new money returns due to active product management, disciplined pricing approaches and our significant asset origination and structuring capabilities.  \n Moving to Other Operations. Adjusted pretax loss was $530 million, which was inclusive of $176 million of losses from the consolidation and eliminations line, which principally reflects adjustments offsetting investment returns in the subsidiaries by being eliminated in Other Operations, so it wouldn't be double counting.  \n Before consolidation and eliminations, adjusted pretax loss was $354 million, which was $481 million better than the first quarter of 2020, which included a $317 million adjusted pretax loss related to Fortitude and a $30 million onetime cash grant given to employees to help with unanticipated costs when the global pandemic began last March. \n The first quarter also reflects lower corporate interest expense and lower corporate general expenses, and we expect this to continue throughout 2021. However, one might expect some continued volatility within the consolidations and eliminations line, which can fluctuate based on investment returns.  \n Now shifting to investment. Net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.2 billion or $492 million higher than the first quarter of 2020. Adjusting first quarter 2020 for Fortitude's investment income to make the comparison apples to apples, this quarter's net investment income on an APTI basis was actually $611 million higher than the prior year or plus 23%, reflecting strong private equity and real estate returns as well as bond tender and call premiums, which more than offset the lower income on the AFS fixed income portfolio. We continue to have a high-quality investment portfolio that is positioned well under any market condition.  \n Turning to the balance sheet. At March 31, book value per common share was $72.37, down 5.3% from year-end, reflecting net unrealized mark-to-market losses on the investment portfolio. Adjusted book value per share was $58.69, up nearly 3% from December 31. \n At quarter end, AIG parent, as Peter noted, had cash and short-term liquidity assets of $7.9 billion, and we repaid our March debt maturity of $1.5 billion and repurchased the $362 million of shares, as Peter outlined. Our GAAP debt leverage at March 31 was 28.4%, flat to year-end given downward fixed income market movements negatively impacting AOCI, despite the repaid debt maturity mentioned earlier.  \n Our primary operating subsidiaries remain profitable and well capitalized. For General Insurance, we estimate the U.S. pool fleet risk-based capital ratio for the first quarter to be between 465% and 475%, and Life and Retirement fleet is estimated to be between 435% and 445%, both well above our target ranges. \n And with that, I will now turn it back over to Peter. Just a bit. Thank you, Peter. I think Peter nailed it both, Elyse. I want to reemphasize, though, what Peter said. Every quarter's mix is pretty different, and I know that's a written viewpoint that earns in. But we've already written business in -- that we can -- last year that's going to earn into 2021. And we've already written one quarter that's going to go into 2022. So we're not counting -- we believe we're going to have the margin expansion, as has been noted. That doesn't really depend on the existing level of rate levels in the market. So yes, we can localize a lot of that to contingency business out of Talbot. And on Validus, I think there was really just 2 contracts involved, so it's not like a widespread in any way. So that overwhelmingly accounts for it. \n And I think for your second question, yes, we didn't put any additional provisions. We're happy where we are associated with it. So I think we're on the downflow, to say the least. Yes. Thank you, Peter. I think I may have commented on this before, but I think it's probably worth bearing again is, long term, there's generally been a 200 basis point addition beyond economic inflation for social inflation. Clearly, that's been south of that over the last few years. \n But that's one way of looking at it by having a range of loss trends and not necessarily just point estimating it, and it really varies by line of business, clearly. I think in the past, I've also commented that our loss trend in Excess Casualty, for example, is very close to double digits, number one, and so really it varies across the board. \n And when you get to Peter's comment on portfolio, think of the best way to insulate yourself from unexpected spikes in economic or social inflation, irrespective of which one, is by having the portfolio change. And the mix away from leads and having more mid excess, not just in casualty, but other places, aggregated lead moves that portfolio further away from risk insulating you more from any compound views of that. So I think that's how we look at it. And I think all of that is important and it comes to bear. Not materially because you have calendar year views, right? So claims when they're settled or when they're reported don't care what their accident year was. Ryan, I'd add just one quick thing, if I could. You really started the question in the correlation on wage. And given Peter really talking about 2/3 of the book is really lost sensitive over high attachment points, it's actually more of a medical question than a wage indemnity question because medical trend is what could sneak over, especially on major permanent partial and things of that nature and permanent totals. So that's why it was actually a -- we're in a really good position on that because of the analysis that was done about 3 years ago on that book that's still holding today. So all those past assumptions are absolutely holding. Do you want me to start that, Peter. So I think what we're trying to say in various ways is that looking sequentially is really not the way. You've got to really look at it quarter-over-quarter for the points that Peter brought up before about the mix being pretty different. The fact that although we've reduced the volatility dramatically, we still write volatile lines, right? So you still have a pop here or there that may not have really occurred in this quarter or the last quarter that still could at another time. \n We really need to see a few more accident quarters, if you will, pop in before we can declare victory in that sense. So you can't look at each quarter as a totally independent stand-alone on a sequential basis."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to AIG's Fourth Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. This conference is being recorded. Now at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please, go ahead. \nQuentin McMillan: Thanks very much, and good morning. Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by applicable securities laws, AIG is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements if circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change.  \n Additionally, today's remarks may refer to non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at www.aig.com.  \n Finally, today's remarks will discuss the results of AIG's Life and Retirement segment and Other Operations on the same basis as prior quarters, which is how we expect to continue to report until the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial Inc. \n AIG's segments and U.S. GAAP financial results as well as AIG's key financial metrics with respect thereto differ from those reported by Corebridge Financial. Corebridge Financial will host its own earnings call tomorrow on Friday, February 17, and will provide additional details on its results.  \n With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results. Following my remarks, Sabra will provide more detail on certain topics, including Life and Retirement results and our path to a 10%-or-greater ROCE, and then we will take questions. Kevin Hogan and David McElroy would join us for the Q&A portion of the call.  \n Today, I will cover 4 topics: First, I will provide an overview of our fourth quarter financial results. Second, I will review highlights from the full year, including some of our major accomplishments, which were remarkable given the very challenging conditions we faced throughout 2022 in the equity markets and the insurance industry. Third, I will unpack in some detail market conditions leading up to January 1 reinsurance renewals, where we saw significant shifts that we believe will impact the industry throughout 2023 and perhaps longer. Suffice it to say, this 1/1 renewal season was the most challenged that many, including myself, have seen in our careers. And fourth, I will outline our 2023 priorities and outlook regarding capital management.  \n Before turning to our results, I'd like to welcome Sabra to the call. We are fortunate to have her in the interim CFO role, while Shane is on a medical leave. Regarding Shane, I am personally, deeply appreciative of the tremendous outreach from many of you, the number of people who have sent good wishes for a speedy recovery is incredibly meaningful to me, and our management team, and particularly, to Shane and his family. We look forward to welcoming him back to AIG.  \n Now let me begin with a brief overview of AIG's fourth quarter results. Adjusted after-tax income in the fourth quarter was $1 billion and $1.36 per diluted common share. We repurchased approximately 780 million of AIG common stock and redeemed $1.8 billion of debt. AIG paid $243 million in dividends in the fourth quarter and Corebridge paid 2 dividends, totaling approximately $300 million following its IPO in September of 2022.  \n Turning to General Insurance. In the fourth quarter, the accident year combined ratio, ex CATs, improved 140 basis points year-over-year to 88.4%, representing the 18th consecutive quarter of margin improvement. Notably, underwriting income in the fourth quarter increased 27% year-over-year to $635 million.  \n Global Commercial drove the year-over-year increase, achieving an accident year combined ratio,  ex CATs, of 84.1%, a 380 basis point improvement and a 69% increase in underwriting income.  \n Global Personal reported an accident year combined ratio, ex CATs, of 100.4%, a 610 basis point increase from the prior year quarter, as we continued to reposition this portfolio.  \n Moving to Global Commercial. On an FX-adjusted basis, North America Commercial net premiums written increased 3% and international increased 2%. Global Commercial had strong renewal retention in its in-force portfolio, and new business continued to be strong.  \n Turning to REIT. Momentum continued in North America Commercial, with overall rate increases in the quarter of 3%, 7% if you exclude Financial Lines and 9% if you also exclude workers' compensation. These rate increases were driven by Retail Property at 15%, Lexington at 12% and Excess Casualty at 9%, and the exposure increase in the North America portfolio was 3%.  \n International Commercial rate increases were 4%, driven by Asia Pacific at 9% and EMEA at 7%, and the exposure increase in the international portfolio was around 2%. Pricing, which includes rate plus exposure, was up 6% in both North America and international. While we experienced downward pressure on rate in certain lines early in the fourth quarter, we saw a reacceleration of price increases towards the end of the quarter.  \n For example, Retail Property was up 15% in the fourth quarter with rate improvement of 24% in December when market impacts from increased catastrophes started to be felt. We saw a similar upward movement at Lexington and particularly within the Property portfolio, with December seeing the strongest rate increases in the fourth quarter. Overall, we continue to earn rate above loss cost trends, which contributed to positive margin expansion.  \n In Global Personal, starting with North America, net premiums written declined 7%, reflecting our ongoing reshaping of this portfolio, particularly in the high and ultra-high net worth businesses that are part of PCG. Later in my remarks, I will discuss our announcement on Monday relating to PCG and our partnership with Stone Point Capital to create a new Managing General Agency or MGA.  \n In International Personal, net premiums written slightly increased by 1% on an FX-adjusted basis due to a rebound in travel and growth in A&H.  \n Now turning to the full year. We made tremendous progress throughout 2022 on a number of key priorities. I could not be more pleased with our team's ability to execute on multiple, complex, strategic objectives across AIG at once. Our most significant and impactful accomplishment was completing the IPO of Corebridge in September of 2022. Despite the very challenging equity market conditions we had to navigate. Notably, Corebridge was last year's largest IPO in the U.S. and the largest financial services IPO since 2020.  \n We also continue to grow underwriting income in General Insurance, which increased approximately $1 billion year-over-year, the second year in a row with over $1 billion of growth in underwriting income. As I noted on last quarter's call, we also reached significant milestones on AIG 200 that have modernized our technology infrastructure and operational capabilities while executing on an exit run rate savings of $1 billion, 6 months ahead of schedule.  \n We also changed AIG's investment management strategy and structure through successful partnerships with Blackstone and BlackRock, and we are seeing the benefits of these partnerships across AIG and Corebridge.  \n Turning to full year consolidated financial results for AIG. Adjusted after-tax income in 2022 reached $3.6 billion and was $4.55 per diluted common share. We returned $6.1 billion to shareholders through $5.1 billion of AIG common stock repurchases and $1 billion of dividends. We finished 2022 with 734 million shares outstanding, a 10% decrease since the end of 2021. And we executed on a number of capital management actions to establish the stand-alone Corebridge capital structure while reducing AIG debt by roughly $10 billion.  \n Consolidated financial debt outstanding was approximately $21 billion at year-end with $11.8 billion at AIG and $9.4 billion at Corebridge.  \n Now let me cover full year 2022 results for General Insurance. As you know, an important aspect of our turnaround over the last few years has been instituting a culture of underwriting excellence. And our rigor in this area is now clearly benefiting our financial results. General Insurance achieved underwriting income of $2 billion in 2022, despite the industry again experiencing over $100 billion of insured natural catastrophe losses. And we exceeded our combined ratio commitment by achieving a sub-90 accident year combined ratio, ex CATs, in all 4 quarters. \n As I've noted on prior calls, and it's worth repeating, since 2018, we completely overhauled our underwriting standards and overlaid these standards with a comprehensive reinsurance program that can adapt to market conditions into our portfolio as it continues to change and improve. Overall, gross limits deployed were reduced by over $1.2 trillion during this period. We also meaningfully and deliberately shifted our global portfolio mix in order to reposition AIG for the future.  \n For example, Global Commercial now represents 74% of our net premiums written, up from 57% in 2018. And Lexington is now 17% of our North America Commercial business, up from 12% in 2018. If you exclude Validus Re, Lexington is now 23% of North America Commercial. As a result of this work, our current portfolio is very well positioned for 2023. I will discuss in more detail later, when I review January 1 reinsurance renewals, how market dynamics have shifted and how AIG should benefit as we look to capitalize on attractive opportunities for better risk-adjusted returns.  \n Now let me highlight a few of the key businesses in General Insurance that contributed to our performance in 2022. Lexington, our market-leading excess and surplus lines business, had 18% net premiums written growth in 2022, up over 50% since we transitioned this business to focus on the wholesale market. This business also increased underwriting profitability, excluding CATs, by 60%, and it achieved a sub-80% accident year combined ratio, ex CATs, for 2022.  \n Glatfelter continued its terrific performance, growing net premiums written by 14%, increasing underwriting income and achieving an 85% accident year combined ratio, ex CATs. The acquisition of Glatfelter allowed us to significantly elevate the quality of our programs business.  \n Global Specialty, which includes our Global Marine, Energy and Aviation businesses, grew net premiums written by over 15% on an FX-adjusted basis. This was driven by strong client retention of 88%, new business growth and rate increases across the portfolio. Global Specialty generated strong earnings in 2022 with an impressive accident year combined ratio, excluding CATs, of 80%.  \n These are just some examples of businesses that we prioritized last year based on their market position, our differentiated value proposition to clients and our ability to generate strong underwriting results. We see great opportunities for these businesses going forward, and they are strong anchors for AIG that we expect will contribute to profitable growth in 2023.  \n Our Global Personal business performed well considering some of the post-pandemic headwinds we saw in the first half of 2022 and our strategic repositioning of the business. Also, as I mentioned on our last call, the impact from deemed hospitalizations in Japan and, to a lesser extent, Taiwan, contributed over $160 million in losses in 2022, having a 290 basis point impact on the International Personal accident year combined ratio. This accident health product was discontinued in 2022.  \n Turning to full year net premiums written. General Insurance grew 4% on an FX-adjusted basis, driven by 6% growth in Global Commercial. North America grew 7% and International Commercial grew 6%. We had strong renewal retention in our in-force portfolio, with North America improving by 300 basis points to 86% and International achieving 86% for the full year. And as a reminder, we calculate renewal retention prior to the impact of rate and exposure changes.  \n Turning to underwriting profitability for the full year. 2022 was another year with strong progress. The General Insurance accident year combined ratio, ex CATs, was 88.7%, an improvement of 230 basis points year-over-year. The full year saw a 180 basis point improvement in the accident year loss ratio, ex CATs, and a 50 basis point improvement in the expense ratio.  \n Global Commercial achieved an impressive accident year combined ratio, ex CATs, of 84.5%, an improvement of 460 basis points year-over-year. The loss ratio was the biggest contributor with a 330 basis point improvement, and the combined ratio, including CATs and PYD of 89.6%, represented a 920 basis point improvement year-over-year.  \n The accident year combined ratio, ex CATs, in Global Personal deteriorated 430 basis points to 99.2% for the reasons I've outlined before.  \n Now let me turn to reinsurance renewals at January 1 of this year. As I stated on our last earnings call, we knew this renewal season will be very challenging and lead to fundamental changes in the market that would impact 1/1 renewals. The market was faced with a combination of factors that added further pressure to dynamics that were already creating considerable stress. We had top global macroeconomic trends. We had geopolitical uncertainty. We had short-term pressure on the asset side of the balance sheet as a consequence of rising interest rates, inflation and currency fluctuation. We had additional natural catastrophe losses late in the fourth quarter and increasing frequency and severity of secondary perils continued.  \n And 2022 ended with over $130 billion of insured natural catastrophe losses, making 2022 the fifth costliest year on record for insurers, with 5 out of the last 6 years having exceeded $100 billion. Hurricane Ian, in particular, proved to be a catalyst that changed market dynamics even more significantly than expected and ultimately led to shifts in the market that required the industry to rethink reinsurance placements and the commensurate changes that needed to take place in the primary market.  \n The unprecedented levels of natural catastrophes on a global scale massively impacted the reinsurance market in a couple of ways. Increased natural CAT activity has resulted in elevated property CAT ceded loss ratios, with average incurred loss ratios from 2017 through 2022 exceeding 85% compared to 2012 through 2016 when average incurred loss ratios trended below 30%, a dramatic deterioration.  \n And over the last 5 years, secondary perils contributed more than 50% to ultimate loss when compared to primary perils. These market dynamics also impacted the supply of reinsurance and retrocessional capacity and the cost of capital increase for the industry, which impacted almost all lines of business and territories, regardless of loss experienced. On top of all of this, very little new capital entered the market. Available capital is estimated to have decreased approximately 20% year-over-year.  \n Now let me outline what happened in the property CAT and retro markets in particular, due to the high level of CAT losses in 2022, which were further exacerbated by events in the fourth quarter. 50% of global Property CAT limits, which we estimate to be $425 billion, renewed at January 1. Approximately 70% of Global retro limits estimated at $60 billion incept at January 1. Reinsurers heavily reliant on peak peril retro protection face greater pressure as a result, whereas larger, more diversified reinsurers were better able to manage retro capacity constraints. As a result, a majority of programs placed on January 1 saw insurance companies forced increase retentions.  \n Despite these market challenges, AIG navigated this complex and intense renewal season extremely well. We knew we were in a strong position heading into January 1, given the repositioning and the improved quality of our Global portfolio, coupled with our considerable efforts to reduce our gross portfolio peak exposures. As we expected, this allowed us to capitalize on many attractive opportunities, and this proved to be a competitive advantage as we had an exceptionally successful renewal season.  \n It's also worth noting that AIG's reinsurance purchasing is, by design, more heavily weighted to January 1 than the wider market. The benefits of this are twofold. Concentrating the bulk of our purchasing at January 1 allows AIG to maximize the outcome across all of our reinsurance placements. And we have clear line of sight on our reinsurance cost for the full year, which is particularly valuable in a market, which we believe will continue to be incredibly challenging.  \n Some of the highlights of our January placements include the following: with respect to property catastrophe placements, we obtained more limit than we purchased in 2022; and we believe we have the lowest attachment points on a return period measurement for North America windstorm and earthquake amongst our peer group; and our modeled exhaust limits are at higher return periods compared to last year for each of our placements. These placements should further reduce volatility, which is something we remain very focused on, and they provide us with significant balance sheet protection in the event one or a series of significant catastrophe events occur.  \n Specifically, we separately made appropriate changes to our North America property CAT treaties to reflect our improving portfolio, with the retention of our commercial CAT portfolio attaching at $500 million and Lexington in our Programs business having an attachment point of $300 million. The property CAT aggregate cover that we placed has 4 retentions before attaching, and for North America, Japan, and Rest of World, it now could attach in the second event, which is an improvement from 2022.  \n Our property CAT [ per occurrence ] structures largely stayed the same for International, and we believe they are market-leading with Japan's retention staying flat at $200 million and the rest of world attaching at $125 million.  \n Many factors improved our overall property CAT reinsurance program, with highlights being: we were able to attain approximately $6 billion of limit, including increasing our per occurrence excess of loss placement; we maintained low attachment points on a model basis; we received support for a $500 million aggregate placement; and our overall spend for AIG increased less than 10% on an absolute and risk-adjusted basis versus 2022.  \n With respect to PCG, we accelerated portfolio remediation, which is driving further gross exposure reductions in key CAT-exposed states where loss costs, inflation and necessary modeling changes have not kept pace. This allowed us to reduce the total limit purchase for the PCG-specific CAT program, which partially offset increased pricing pressure due to Hurricane Ian.  \n Overall, casualty renewals, both excess of loss and our quota share placements, renewed close to expiring terms on a risk-adjusted basis with no impact on ceding commissions. Our reinsurance partners maintain their support for AIG with consistent capacity deployment and reinsurance terms in clear recognition of the quality of our portfolio. The outcomes we achieved at January 1 also reflect the value of the investments we have made in our reinsurance strategy, and, coupled with our relationships and credibility with reinsurance partners, are a testament to the confidence the reinsurance marketplace has in AIG and its management team. We appreciate the ongoing support we have received from our reinsurance partners.  \n As we look ahead to 2023, the world faces many uncertainties. And in uncertain times, our role as a market-leading global insurance company is even more important. With the momentum we have built and the strength of our portfolio, AIG is now extremely well positioned to strategically grow and lead the market by providing thoughtful, expert advice on risk solutions for our clients, distribution partners and other stakeholders.  \n By 2022, we have set out ambitious, strategic, and operational priorities for 2023. We will continue to improve and invest in lines of business and General Insurance, where we see significant growth potential, notably Lexington and Global Specialty. I highlight Lexington because it is presented and will continue to present tremendous growth and profitability opportunities for us. And early indications are that the rate momentum we saw in this business at the end of 2022 and into early 2023 will continue. We expect meaningful growth in Lexington this year, led by Property where, over the last few years, we have prudently tightened limits, improved terms and conditions and increased profitability while driving top line growth.  \n We also plan to increase investment in our assumed reinsurance business in 2023, particularly through Validus Re. As we have discussed on prior calls, over the past few years, we've been highly focused on driving value through a disciplined approach, involving strong risk assessments, sound portfolio construction, a steadfast commitment to underwriting excellence and prudent capital management. \n Over this period of time, the derisking within Validus Re was particularly acute in the Global Property CAT market, where year-over-year, we reduced participations across the portfolio while concurrently purchasing sound retrocessional protections to prudently manage the portfolio and reduce volatility, all in line with our cycle management strategy. As a result, we were in a strong position to capitalize on attractive opportunities at January 1. The property market, in particular, repositioned and became very compelling in terms of risk-adjusted rates along with enhanced structures as well as beneficial terms and conditions.  \n Rate changes within property CAT range between 30% and 100% in the U.S. as well as in peak zones outside the U.S. Risk-adjusted rate increases were approximately 50% in the U.S. Property and 35% in International Property. And similarly, average margin improvement was approximately 50% year-over-year across the entire portfolio.  \n Property CAT ROEs for both the U.S. and International business increased by greater than 100% year-over-year. Additionally, we obtained improved terms and conditions, including favorable movement in attachment points in all Property lines.  \n For Casualty lines, quota shares remained sound with ceding commissions moving favorably for reinsurers by 1 to 2 points, along with terms and conditions remaining in line or improved. The result of these actions included: net premiums written at January 1 increased over $500 million or 50% year-over-year. This increase was driven roughly 30% from U.S., property 15% from International Property, 45% from casualty placements and the remaining 10% was from Specialty, including marine and energy.  \n The majority of new property limit was deployed to existing clients with a significant level of private terms being achieved on our U.S. property writings.  \n Looking ahead, we will continue our measured approach for other renewals. For example, if meaningful market changes continue, we will carefully consider our positions at the April 1 Japan renewals, and we will continue to be very cautious with capital deployed at June 1 in Florida.  \n Turning to Private Client Group or PCG. This business remains a strategic priority for us in 2023. As you know, over the last 2 years, we have undertaken a significant re-underwriting effort in this portfolio, reduced aggregate exposure, transitioned certain states to the non-admitted market and developed strong partnerships with Lloyd's and reinsurers to reduce volatility.  \n On Monday, we announced our intention to launch, in partnership with Stone Point Capital, a newly formed MGA that will underwrite on behalf of AIG and eventually other capital providers in the high- and ultra-high net worth markets. AIG will transfer core PCG solutions to the MGA, which will offer a single end-to-end broker and client portal, a comprehensive set of product offerings, a simplified data warehouse and the underwriting capabilities of AIG. The MGA will be rebranded as Private Client Select, or PCS, and will be led by Kathleen Zortman and our current team at PCG. We see this new structure as a logical next step in the evolution of PCG and believe it will create significant value for clients, brokers and other stakeholders.  \n Additionally, expense discipline will continue to be a priority for AIG. In addition to savings from AIG 200 that we expect to earn in during 2023, we plan to move $300 million of expenses currently sitting in AIG corporate GOE to Corebridge upon deconsolidation. Separately, we will continue to align our target operating model and further reduce absolute expenses across AIG parent and General Insurance to reflect the fact that AIG is becoming one company.  \n This year, we will also remain focused on completing the operational separation of Corebridge from AIG, and we are working towards a secondary offering of Corebridge common stock by the end of the first quarter, subject to market conditions and regulatory approvals. Our current expectation is that the majority of net proceeds of the secondary offering will be used for AIG common stock repurchases.  \n And as I stated on our last call, we are revisiting AIG's dividend, which has not changed in many years. We expect to say more about this on our first quarter call in May.  \n With respect to capital management priorities, in 2022, we did a significant amount of work to materially improve the capital structures of both AIG and Corebridge. With the reduction in AIG debt we achieved, our post-deconsolidation leverage will be in line with best-in-class peers. And with respect to share buybacks, we have $3.8 billion remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization.  \n Our balanced capital management philosophy will continue to allow for investment in growth opportunities, while returning appropriate levels of capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. We also remain open to compelling inorganic growth opportunities, should they arise.  \n Before turning the call over to Sabra, I would like to pause and say that 2022 was another incredibly important year for AIG. Our colleagues did an exceptional job, particularly on the Corebridge IPO and the continued underwriting and operational improvements that are clearly showing through in our financial results. Our journey to be a top-performing company continues, and I fully expect 2023 to be another year with significant momentum and progress across the organization. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Sabra. \nSabra Purtill: Thank you, Peter. Today, I will review net investment income, additional color on our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results in capital management and also update you on the progress we are making on our path to a 10%-plus adjusted return on common equity or ROCE. \n Turning to net investment income. On an APTI basis, fourth quarter net investment income was $3.0 billion, down $331 million or 10% compared to 4Q '21. Similar to trends throughout 2022, the decrease was due to lower alternative investment income, principally on private equity investments, and lower bond call and tender premiums and mortgage prepayment fees. For the full year, net investment income on an APTI basis was $11.0 billion, down $1.9 billion due to the same trends. \n For the quarter and the full year, we achieved higher new money reinvestment rates and rate resets from floating rate securities. In 4Q '22, net investment income on fixed maturities and mortgage and other loans rose $224 million sequentially, with 29 basis points of yield improvement, which was ahead of our 10 to 15 basis point forecast. Since second quarter of '22, when we began to bend the curve on investment yields, the increase has been 55 basis points. \n In 4Q '22, the average new money yield was just over 6% and about 173 basis points above sales and maturities. New money rates were roughly 157 basis points higher in General Insurance and 190 basis points higher in Life and Retirement. In addition, during the fourth quarter, we repositioned some of the General Insurance portfolio to lock in higher yields, while maintaining similar credit quality and duration. This resulted in a modest capital loss of $57 million, but we expect the portfolio to generate higher net investment income in '23 as a result. Given current market levels, we expect additional yield uplift of 10 to 15 basis points on the consolidated portfolio in 1Q '23. \n Before I head into results for the quarter, I want to note that in the fourth quarter, we eliminated the 1-month reporting lag in General Insurance International, which had a $100 million positive impact on our GAAP net income for the quarter. This change did not impact 4Q APTI, which remain on the same reporting basis as the prior year. But in 2023, GI International results will be on a calendar quarter basis and 1 month different than 2022, which will create some slight timing mismatch in quarterly net premiums written comparisons, but with minimal impact for the full year. Please see Page 25 of the financial supplement for more details. \n As Peter noted, AIG reported adjusted after-tax income of $1.0 billion or $1.36 per diluted share. General Insurance delivered APTI of $1.2 billion compared to $1.5 billion in the prior year quarter due to lower investment income, partially offset by a $136 million increase in underwriting income. Prior year development was $151 million favorable in the fourth quarter, up from $44 million of favorable development in 4Q '21. \n Net favorable amortization for the ADC was $41 million, while North America favorable development was $148 million, and International was $38 million adverse, mostly driven by casualty. \n Fourth quarter Other Operations adjusted pretax loss of $451 million improved $197 million from last year, despite $23 million of additional expenses related to the Corebridge separation. Annualized adjusted ROCE was 7.5% in 4Q '22, down from 9.9% in 4Q '21, principally due to lower alternative investment income. \n Turning to Life and Retirement. Strong sales momentum continued in the fourth quarter. Life and Retirement APTI was $781 million, down from $969 million in 4Q '21, due to lower investment income on alternatives and other yield enhancements, partially offset by higher base investment income and more favorable mortality. \n Individual Retirement sales were $3.8 billion, a 16% increase over the prior year quarter with Fixed Annuity sales up 78% and Fixed Index sales up 34%, near record sales for both products. \n Group Retirement deposits grew 20%, driven by higher out-of-plan Fixed Annuity sales and large plan acquisitions. The Life Insurance business had solid sales with an improving mix of business in the U.S. and continued growth in the U.K. \n In Institutional Markets, premiums and deposits were $1.6 billion, driven by $1.3 billion in pension risk transfer activity. New product margins in L&R were attractive and in excess of long-term targets, supported by higher new money yields, including from Blackstone. After years of spread compression, L&R spreads are expected to improve in 2023. \n I wanted to make you aware of an update to our LDTI estimate. In the first quarter of 2023, we will adopt a change in accounting principle for LDTI with a transition date of January 1, 2021. Our current estimate is that as of September 30, 2022, the adoption would increase shareholders' equity between $800 million and $1.3 billion and AIG's adjusted shareholders' equity would increase between $1.2 billion and $1.7 billion. This increase in the estimate has been predominantly driven by capital market movements during 2021 and 2022. \n Turning to full year 2022. AIG reported adjusted after-tax income of $3.6 billion or $4.55 per diluted share compared to $4.4 billion or $5.12 per diluted share in 2021. These results include much stronger underwriting profitability in GI, offset by lower alternative investment income, as previously described. \n General Insurance APTI for the full year 2022 was $4.4 billion, up 2% from 2021 due to the $1 billion increase in underwriting profitability, offset by lower investment income. L&R APTI was $2.7 billion, down from $3.9 billion in 2021, principally because of lower investment income. \n Other Operations adjusted pretax loss improved about $400 million in 2022 due to lower general operating expenses and higher income on short-term investments. Full year 2022 included additional expenses from the Corebridge separation of $51 million. And in 2023, we expect an incremental cost of $75 million to $100 million in Other Operations' GOE related to the separation. \n Adjusted book value per share was $73.87 at December 31, 2022, up 7% from year-end 2021. Full year adjusted ROCE was 6.5%, down from 8.6% in 2021, primarily due to lower alternative investment income, which was down $1.8 billion from 2021 or about 340 basis points of ROCE compared to 2021. At year-end, our primary insurance subsidiaries remain above target ranges for statutory capital, with GI's U.S. pool estimated in the range of 485% to 495% and L&R estimated in the range of 410% to 420%. \n In addition to the strong financial results, we also executed on multiple capital management priorities in 2022. As Peter described, we established a separate debt capitalization structure for Corebridge and subsequently reduced AIG holding company debt by $9.8 billion. This reduction in AIG debt will lower AIG's holding company interest expense from about $1 billion in 2021 to roughly $500 million in 2023, excluding interest expense on Corebridge issued debt. \n In 2022, we also returned over $6.1 billion to shareholders with $1 billion of dividends and $5.1 billion of share repurchases, yielding a 10% reduction in shares outstanding. We ended the year with Parent liquidity of $3.7 billion. \n Looking ahead, we remain highly committed and laser-focused on delivering a 10%-plus ROCE after the deconsolidation of Corebridge. As Peter and Shane have shared previously, achieving this goal is based on sustained and improved underwriting profitability; executing a leaner operating model across AIG; separation and deconsolidation of Corebridge; and continued balanced capital management, including reducing AIG common shares to between 600 million and 650 million shares through repurchases, while targeting debt to total capital leverage at the lower end of the 20% to 25% range post deconsolidation. Progress on each of these will increase ROCE, along with additional tailwinds from higher reinvestment yields and alternative returns more consistent with long-term averages. \n As Peter mentioned, expense reduction remains an important goal. In the following years, we expect to achieve $300 million of additional savings from AIG 200, with the majority earning in through 2023; $300 million of AIG corporate general operating expense moving to Corebridge upon deconsolidation; and additional savings as we transition to a leaner operating model. As a reminder, every $500 million of expense savings equates to 1 point of ROCE improvement. \n I will now turn the call back over to Peter. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Thank you. Michelle, we'll take our first question, please. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. \nElyse Greenspan: My first question is on the path to the double-digit ROE target. So the starting point is the 6.5% from '22, but I know that, that does include some contribution from L&R and will in the near term. So can you help us with what the starting point would be, if you stripped out the earnings contribution and equity of Life and Retirement? Just trying to get a sense of the ROE of the ongoing business and how the walk and that starting point changes, if you weren't including the Life and Retirement business. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Thanks, Elyse. I would think in terms of how you should think about this, and for us to get to the 10% ROE, Sabra outlined in detail, there's really 3 major ways in which we'll get there. One is through the underwriting results, the other is expense savings. The other is sort of the capital rebalance with share repurchases and other capital management. So you should think about that as a 300 to 350 basis point target in terms of us getting to the double-digit ROCE. Of course, net investment income can benefit, and that's more of a timing issue. We've never said, even in the prior calls, that contribution from increased NOI. NII will be the one that needs to contribute to get us to the 10%, but I think -- I would think of it in that range for the different components. \nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then my second question, you guys had taken up your loss trend assumption to 6.5% last quarter. I'm assuming that didn't change, but correct me if I'm wrong. And Peter, you spoke to pricing of 6%, which would put written pricing below loss trend, but you also did say, right, that rates got better as we ended the year in December. So would you expect the 6% to go above loss trend in the first quarter? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Yes. Thank you. The first part, Elyse, we do not change our loss cost assumptions from what we had outlined in the third quarter, so 6.5% remains our view. When you look at the fourth quarter, like you said, overall, there was around 6%. But when you -- you have to take a couple of things into consideration. One is fourth quarter is our seasonally sort of lowest-sized quarter. But if you look at financial lines, like financial lines is even throughout the entire year, first quarter through fourth, so had a little bit more of a contribution to the overall rate index in the fourth quarter. \n Our International was very well balanced. We had strong rate in areas where we felt we needed it, which is like Property, Excess Casualty. We're driving rate as we have been for the last several years in Lexington, the Excess & Surplus Lines. And then I look at the full year in terms of North America, the Excess Casualty, Retail Property, Lexington, all getting double-digit rate increases. And so like we have been very focused on the rate above loss cost to continue to develop margin. I think that's been evidenced through the culture that we've developed in terms of underwriting excellence. We are very focused on making sure that we continue that, and it's terms and conditions and adjustments to how we structure businesses going forward. December was much stronger than the first part of the quarter. And as we look to January, that momentum is continuing. Dave, maybe just spend a minute on what happened in Financial Lines and D&O specifically? \nDavid McElroy: Yes. Thank you, Peter. And thank you, Elyse. To Peter's point, we have to be careful around generalizations because we are actually hitting rate over trend in most of our big businesses. The outlier is Financial Lines. And Financial Lines, you also have to unpack a little bit and understand that excess D&O, and excess D&O in large public companies is probably driving some of the macro numbers, but it's not driving the behavior underneath. So in our Financial Lines business, we have professional liability. We have cyber. We have private company business. We have financial institutions. And all those businesses are actually getting rate over trend. But sometimes, when you aggregate up the excess public company business, it suppresses it. \n And in that case, Elyse, it's hard to rationalize. I'll be very frank. That's a place where, if you're primary, you're still getting rate. You're still getting flat maybe down a little bit, but you have risk-adjusted rate that's helping. \n In the Excess business, it's been very competitive. It's a different sort of market. And it's actually a market that I would say that cycle manage and companies that are being thoughtful need to actually wrestle with, whether that's a place they're going to trade, okay? If the rates are going down 20% to 30%, it's probably influencing some of the numbers that you look at on an aggregate basis. And inside that portfolio, your decisions are going to have to be made as to how you trade there, okay? \n In our case, it represents a small amount of the portfolio. But I'm conjecting that, that's actually where the commoditization of the business is going to cause a little bit of pain in the 2023, 2024 year, okay? But it's -- I do -- Peter hit it. We look at rate over trend on a very granular basis, and I think we're comfortable with what that means to our big businesses and even in Financial Lines, what it means to our subproducts there. And I think that's an important part of our story. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Thanks, Dave. And don't forget, like the cumulative rate increases we've achieved in D&O over the last 3 years have been north of 80%. So again, it's a line, as Dave says, we're laser focused on. We're not going to chase the market down. But the cumulative rate increases and margin development hasn't been fully recognized, and we're going to look to 2023 with a lot of discipline. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler. \nJon Paul Newsome: There's been an enormous amount of conversation, and you obviously did a lot to add to about Excess Casualty -- or excess of loss reinsurance and -- but as a large account commercial writer, I assume you're using a lot of facultative as well. And I was curious if the comments that you're making extend into not just sort of excessive loss, but also facultative and even quota share as being as impacted as some of the other pieces of the business and how that would affect AIG. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Thanks, Paul. We do purchase facultative in certain segments of our business, but we were really referencing the core treaties. When we look at risk appetite, when we are thinking through our ability to protect the balance sheet and where we want to structure treaties, we don't require facultative reinsurance for other segments in order to supplement the core structure. So when I was referencing in my prepared remarks, the treaty structures, we did an exceptional job. The team really focused on modeling changes, inflationary changes and where we thought capital was going to be less expensive versus more expensive. \n An example of that would be taking big excess of loss CAT across the world. It gets too expensive for allocation of capital, and that is something we moved away from. So we've built more vertical towers in North America and in international and Japan specifically. So I think the overall market has responded most to Property. Casualty has started to tighten up. I still think that there's ample capacity in quota shares. They may be with some tighter terms and conditions and ceding commissions or, by and large, it was placeable. And yes, facultative, I think, has become harder to place on property just based on the capital available. But for us, we don't heavily rely on facultative to deliver results. It's really our core treaty structures. \nJon Paul Newsome: Makes sense. Can you also talk about the change in conditions in commercial lines? Obviously, AIG led the market in changing terms and conditions in commercial lines. Is the impact pretty much fully there now today at AIG? And have you seen -- are you seeing any change in the market as well for terms and conditions that's meaningful sort of outside the pricing change? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: I think we've done an exceptional job on the underwriting side with terms and conditions. I think the entire team has focused over the last several years as not only -- certainly pricing's an output, but how we structure our insurance deals, how we focus on client needs, but also how we customize terms and conditions to make sure that we have the appropriate policies and endorsements in the marketplace. I don't think it's over. It's something that's a nuance. But as we look to the property market in 2023, it's one of the areas where, when you report out rate, you really have to understand the risk-adjusted implications of rate increases. \n For instance, in Excess & Surplus Lines property, I expect to see higher deductibles, more wind deductibles, tighter terms and conditions. We've seen what used to be all risk, which covered all perils, now to name perils, and so you can strip out a lot of coverage in terms of when you're placing it, whether you're trying to solve for wind or quake or flood, you don't provide all of the perils. And so if you said to me, what's one of the big areas that you'll see an improvement in 2023, it will be on the terms and conditions and how we price those perils. And I think we will offer, particularly in Excess & Surplus Lines, the appropriate coverage, but we will be restrictive on terms of conditions if we don't feel we're getting paid for. So I don't think it's over. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Erik Bass with Autonomous. \nErik Bass: Just hoping you could help us think about the base NII trajectory for 2023. So we've seen a nice step up in the past couple of quarters, and you gave some guidance for the first quarter. But how much of the increase is coming from resets on floating rate assets? And how much is the tailwind from higher reinvestment yields and the portfolio changes that you're making that should continue to build throughout the year? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Thanks, Erik. As you know, this has been an active strategy for us, particularly over the back half of 2022. I think the team has done an exceptional job. And Sabra, maybe you can just provide a little bit of insight in terms of some of the NII and the reinvestment rates. \nSabra Purtill: Yes, happy to do that. And I would just note, we added a new footnote on Page 47 of the financial supplement that gives you the walk of the yield on fixed maturity securities and loans. So you can see the quarter-to-quarter improvement in the portfolio yield on that portfolio, which basically begin to bend the curve in the second quarter for a step-up in yields. And we also, there, give you the impact of the other yield enhancements, which year-over-year was about a $400 million headwind for AIG consolidated NII. \n But to go back to your question about the path forward, and I'll put alternatives to the side. I mean, those are obviously volatile quarter-to-quarter. But like I said, that was 340 basis points of headwind year-over-year. 2021 was an exceptional year for alternative returns, whereas full year 2022 was about a 5.6% yield. So more in line with our average assumption. \n But to go back, so in the quarter, as I said, the new portfolio yield or the new money rates were just above 6% and about 173 basis points over the assets going forward. And if you look at in the quarter, fourth quarter '22 grew about $160 million just due to the rate resets and about 14 basis points from the pickup in yield on the portfolio. Now in 2023, the impact is going to really depend on the path and timing of market rates, fed rate hikes, changes in credit spreads as well as the movement in the yield curve. As you know, the GI has got a shorter duration than L&R. And right now, we've got an inverted curve. So depending on where you're investing, and you're going to have different impacts on your yield. \n So what I would just kind of point you to is, for the full year, we are projecting about $8 billion of reinvestment on the GI portfolio, $20 billion in Corebridge. And for the first quarter, we're projecting about 10 to 15 basis points of yield uplift just based on where we are for rates. Since the market is expecting additional rate increases, I would -- from the Fed, I would expect to see more pickup from the floating rate note resets during the course of the year. And then like I said, really what we pick up in the second or third quarter is going to be a function of how the shape of the yield curve changes. \n But the point I would just make in total is that we are definitely having a tailwind from higher rates and higher spreads in the market. In addition, during the last several months, because of the -- basically the changes in the spreads and where some of the opportunities were, we were able to move up in quality on the bond portfolio investments while still getting a pickup in the yield because of the market environment. \n So at this point in time, I think it's premature to give any sort of actual projection on a dollar basis. But from a yield pickup trend, we're very confident that we'll continue to see that during 2023. \nErik Bass: That's helpful. And then secondly, I just was hoping you could help us think about the trajectory for the other operations loss both before and after the Corebridge separation. So it sounds like GOE there should go up in 2023 because of some of the Corebridge expenses, maybe that's offset a little bit by interest savings. But then you'll get a big step down when you deconsolidate Corebridge, when the $300 million comes out. Is that the right way to think about it? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Yes, Erik, it is. We -- in Other Operations, think about it in a couple of components. I think you've outlined most of them, is that upon deconsolidation, we would have $300 million or there thereabouts go with Corebridge. I mean, there could be some stair step up. I mean, it's hard in 2023 to look at each quarter because we're building Corebridge, as we've talked about before, as a stand-alone public company. So those amounts will be in each quarter, depending on the progress that we're making. So think about the $300 million. \n I think we'll have savings in Other Operations throughout the year separate from that in the $100 million to $200 million range. And then as we get to the future target operating model, we've given guidance from the past that we anticipate that we'll get around $500 million, not out of all -- that will not all come out of Other Operations. It come out of the combination of what is General Insurance in the parent company today. But that will take deconsolidation. It will take us to get to the target operating model. But I think in the short run, you should think about Corebridge's $300 million, and that between $100 million to $200 million of other reductions in Other Ops is how I would think about it in 2023. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. \nTaylor Scott: First one I had is just on net premium written growth in General Insurance. I mean we saw it slow in 2022, particularly towards the back end of the year. And it sounds pretty interesting, some of the opportunities you have, both in Validus Re and Lexington. But I just wanted to get sort of a high level perspective from you on what the strategy has been to sort of slow some of that premium growth in the back half of this year. And how you see that potentially inflecting as we go into 2023? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Thank you for the question. You have to really look at the full year, I believe, in terms of showing the progress of what we've done as a company. First and foremost, again, I'll mention it again, which is a culture of underwriting excellence. When we look at Commercial with a 340 basis point improvement in the fourth quarter in terms of its action year combined ratio, ex CATs, 440 for the year, I mean that's substantial progress. I mean, we made enormous improvements in profitability. \n And so we've shaped the portfolio the way we like it, where again, the fourth quarter, not all roads lead to Financial Lines. But again, it was just a disproportionate amount of premium relative to the overall size. Fourth quarter's small. We saw real good growth in the businesses that we want to grow in, which is in the Excess & Surplus Lines, Global Specialty. But as we've been talking about, I hope it's evidenced through what we did at 1/1, which is why we wanted to put it in the prepared remarks, which is, I kept talking about taking aggregate down where we didn't think we were getting the appropriate risk-adjusted returns. \n But when we thought we felt that the risk-adjusted returns were there, like in the reinsurance business, we expanded significantly and expect to see that through 2023. Can't really predict the market, but I don't believe this is all played through. We had a very complicated 1/1, but you have Japan coming up. \n And the hardest part in terms of the reinsurance market and thus then the primary market on peak zone is going to be Florida at [ 6/1 ]. And so we think there's great opportunities in Excess & Surplus Lines continue to grow. Again, Global Specialties, Retail Property across the world. We'll watch International, but I don't believe that the treaty increased pricing that happened, which was substantial at 1/1, will play its way through the International business until 2024. Because a lot of the deals, 60% of it comes up at 1/1, was priced off of prior year treaties. \n And so I think this has momentum. We are incredibly well positioned. We have no aggregate restrictions. And where we see risk-adjusted returns that are attractive, which we already have, we're going to deploy capital. That was the whole idea of putting more capital in subsidiaries, and then it goes to other lines of business. I mean, you cross-sell what we do in casualty, how we play in these different markets, we have such tremendous following as lead experts in underwriting that we believe, across the world, our platform will be very helpful to our clients, and we expect to find really strong areas for growth. \nTaylor Scott: That's really helpful. Second one I had is more specifically on Casualty -- Excess Casualty pricing. We've heard some peers kind of talk about pricing and expressed the need for it to reaccelerate. And I think some investors seem to be getting a little more cautious about the potential for continued deceleration there. I felt like your prepared remarks were a little more optimistic. I'd just be interested in your perspective on the portfolio at AIG, what you're seeing in the market and where you'd expect things to go there. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: We watch it carefully. I mean Excess Casualty, we're still getting very strong rate we have for the last couple of years. And that didn't stop in the fourth quarter. My prepared remarks were really just focused on, I don't think the market that we entered in the fourth quarter is the market that we're in. There's been a lot of changes over the last 60 days. And like every other line of business, it needs to stand on its own. It needs to develop margin. We want to be conservative in our position and making certain that the underwriting terms and conditions are appropriate. But we're watching it carefully. I haven't seen a substantial downturn in terms of pricing. It's been right in the sort of same range for, as I said, the last 6 quarters. And it's something that we're going to watch very carefully in 2023.\n Okay. We greatly appreciate the engagement and all the questions and appreciate the interest. And so I just wish everybody a great day, and thank you for being here. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference for today. Thank you for your participation.

            "name": "Sabra Purtill",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter. Today, I will review net investment income, additional color on our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results in capital management and also update you on the progress we are making on our path to a 10%-plus adjusted return on common equity or ROCE. \n Turning to net investment income. On an APTI basis, fourth quarter net investment income was $3.0 billion, down $331 million or 10% compared to 4Q '21. Similar to trends throughout 2022, the decrease was due to lower alternative investment income, principally on private equity investments, and lower bond call and tender premiums and mortgage prepayment fees. For the full year, net investment income on an APTI basis was $11.0 billion, down $1.9 billion due to the same trends. \n For the quarter and the full year, we achieved higher new money reinvestment rates and rate resets from floating rate securities. In 4Q '22, net investment income on fixed maturities and mortgage and other loans rose $224 million sequentially, with 29 basis points of yield improvement, which was ahead of our 10 to 15 basis point forecast. Since second quarter of '22, when we began to bend the curve on investment yields, the increase has been 55 basis points. \n In 4Q '22, the average new money yield was just over 6% and about 173 basis points above sales and maturities. New money rates were roughly 157 basis points higher in General Insurance and 190 basis points higher in Life and Retirement. In addition, during the fourth quarter, we repositioned some of the General Insurance portfolio to lock in higher yields, while maintaining similar credit quality and duration. This resulted in a modest capital loss of $57 million, but we expect the portfolio to generate higher net investment income in '23 as a result. Given current market levels, we expect additional yield uplift of 10 to 15 basis points on the consolidated portfolio in 1Q '23. \n Before I head into results for the quarter, I want to note that in the fourth quarter, we eliminated the 1-month reporting lag in General Insurance International, which had a $100 million positive impact on our GAAP net income for the quarter. This change did not impact 4Q APTI, which remain on the same reporting basis as the prior year. But in 2023, GI International results will be on a calendar quarter basis and 1 month different than 2022, which will create some slight timing mismatch in quarterly net premiums written comparisons, but with minimal impact for the full year. Please see Page 25 of the financial supplement for more details. \n As Peter noted, AIG reported adjusted after-tax income of $1.0 billion or $1.36 per diluted share. General Insurance delivered APTI of $1.2 billion compared to $1.5 billion in the prior year quarter due to lower investment income, partially offset by a $136 million increase in underwriting income. Prior year development was $151 million favorable in the fourth quarter, up from $44 million of favorable development in 4Q '21. \n Net favorable amortization for the ADC was $41 million, while North America favorable development was $148 million, and International was $38 million adverse, mostly driven by casualty. \n Fourth quarter Other Operations adjusted pretax loss of $451 million improved $197 million from last year, despite $23 million of additional expenses related to the Corebridge separation. Annualized adjusted ROCE was 7.5% in 4Q '22, down from 9.9% in 4Q '21, principally due to lower alternative investment income. \n Turning to Life and Retirement. Strong sales momentum continued in the fourth quarter. Life and Retirement APTI was $781 million, down from $969 million in 4Q '21, due to lower investment income on alternatives and other yield enhancements, partially offset by higher base investment income and more favorable mortality. \n Individual Retirement sales were $3.8 billion, a 16% increase over the prior year quarter with Fixed Annuity sales up 78% and Fixed Index sales up 34%, near record sales for both products. \n Group Retirement deposits grew 20%, driven by higher out-of-plan Fixed Annuity sales and large plan acquisitions. The Life Insurance business had solid sales with an improving mix of business in the U.S. and continued growth in the U.K. \n In Institutional Markets, premiums and deposits were $1.6 billion, driven by $1.3 billion in pension risk transfer activity. New product margins in L&R were attractive and in excess of long-term targets, supported by higher new money yields, including from Blackstone. After years of spread compression, L&R spreads are expected to improve in 2023. \n I wanted to make you aware of an update to our LDTI estimate. In the first quarter of 2023, we will adopt a change in accounting principle for LDTI with a transition date of January 1, 2021. Our current estimate is that as of September 30, 2022, the adoption would increase shareholders' equity between $800 million and $1.3 billion and AIG's adjusted shareholders' equity would increase between $1.2 billion and $1.7 billion. This increase in the estimate has been predominantly driven by capital market movements during 2021 and 2022. \n Turning to full year 2022. AIG reported adjusted after-tax income of $3.6 billion or $4.55 per diluted share compared to $4.4 billion or $5.12 per diluted share in 2021. These results include much stronger underwriting profitability in GI, offset by lower alternative investment income, as previously described. \n General Insurance APTI for the full year 2022 was $4.4 billion, up 2% from 2021 due to the $1 billion increase in underwriting profitability, offset by lower investment income. L&R APTI was $2.7 billion, down from $3.9 billion in 2021, principally because of lower investment income. \n Other Operations adjusted pretax loss improved about $400 million in 2022 due to lower general operating expenses and higher income on short-term investments. Full year 2022 included additional expenses from the Corebridge separation of $51 million. And in 2023, we expect an incremental cost of $75 million to $100 million in Other Operations' GOE related to the separation. \n Adjusted book value per share was $73.87 at December 31, 2022, up 7% from year-end 2021. Full year adjusted ROCE was 6.5%, down from 8.6% in 2021, primarily due to lower alternative investment income, which was down $1.8 billion from 2021 or about 340 basis points of ROCE compared to 2021. At year-end, our primary insurance subsidiaries remain above target ranges for statutory capital, with GI's U.S. pool estimated in the range of 485% to 495% and L&R estimated in the range of 410% to 420%. \n In addition to the strong financial results, we also executed on multiple capital management priorities in 2022. As Peter described, we established a separate debt capitalization structure for Corebridge and subsequently reduced AIG holding company debt by $9.8 billion. This reduction in AIG debt will lower AIG's holding company interest expense from about $1 billion in 2021 to roughly $500 million in 2023, excluding interest expense on Corebridge issued debt. \n In 2022, we also returned over $6.1 billion to shareholders with $1 billion of dividends and $5.1 billion of share repurchases, yielding a 10% reduction in shares outstanding. We ended the year with Parent liquidity of $3.7 billion. \n Looking ahead, we remain highly committed and laser-focused on delivering a 10%-plus ROCE after the deconsolidation of Corebridge. As Peter and Shane have shared previously, achieving this goal is based on sustained and improved underwriting profitability; executing a leaner operating model across AIG; separation and deconsolidation of Corebridge; and continued balanced capital management, including reducing AIG common shares to between 600 million and 650 million shares through repurchases, while targeting debt to total capital leverage at the lower end of the 20% to 25% range post deconsolidation. Progress on each of these will increase ROCE, along with additional tailwinds from higher reinvestment yields and alternative returns more consistent with long-term averages. \n As Peter mentioned, expense reduction remains an important goal. In the following years, we expect to achieve $300 million of additional savings from AIG 200, with the majority earning in through 2023; $300 million of AIG corporate general operating expense moving to Corebridge upon deconsolidation; and additional savings as we transition to a leaner operating model. As a reminder, every $500 million of expense savings equates to 1 point of ROCE improvement. \n I will now turn the call back over to Peter. Yes, happy to do that. And I would just note, we added a new footnote on Page 47 of the financial supplement that gives you the walk of the yield on fixed maturity securities and loans. So you can see the quarter-to-quarter improvement in the portfolio yield on that portfolio, which basically begin to bend the curve in the second quarter for a step-up in yields. And we also, there, give you the impact of the other yield enhancements, which year-over-year was about a $400 million headwind for AIG consolidated NII. \n But to go back to your question about the path forward, and I'll put alternatives to the side. I mean, those are obviously volatile quarter-to-quarter. But like I said, that was 340 basis points of headwind year-over-year. 2021 was an exceptional year for alternative returns, whereas full year 2022 was about a 5.6% yield. So more in line with our average assumption. \n But to go back, so in the quarter, as I said, the new portfolio yield or the new money rates were just above 6% and about 173 basis points over the assets going forward. And if you look at in the quarter, fourth quarter '22 grew about $160 million just due to the rate resets and about 14 basis points from the pickup in yield on the portfolio. Now in 2023, the impact is going to really depend on the path and timing of market rates, fed rate hikes, changes in credit spreads as well as the movement in the yield curve. As you know, the GI has got a shorter duration than L&R. And right now, we've got an inverted curve. So depending on where you're investing, and you're going to have different impacts on your yield. \n So what I would just kind of point you to is, for the full year, we are projecting about $8 billion of reinvestment on the GI portfolio, $20 billion in Corebridge. And for the first quarter, we're projecting about 10 to 15 basis points of yield uplift just based on where we are for rates. Since the market is expecting additional rate increases, I would -- from the Fed, I would expect to see more pickup from the floating rate note resets during the course of the year. And then like I said, really what we pick up in the second or third quarter is going to be a function of how the shape of the yield curve changes. \n But the point I would just make in total is that we are definitely having a tailwind from higher rates and higher spreads in the market. In addition, during the last several months, because of the -- basically the changes in the spreads and where some of the opportunities were, we were able to move up in quality on the bond portfolio investments while still getting a pickup in the yield because of the market environment. \n So at this point in time, I think it's premature to give any sort of actual projection on a dollar basis. But from a yield pickup trend, we're very confident that we'll continue to see that during 2023."

            "name": "Peter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results. Following my remarks, Sabra will provide more detail on certain topics, including Life and Retirement results and our path to a 10%-or-greater ROCE, and then we will take questions. Kevin Hogan and David McElroy would join us for the Q&A portion of the call.  \n Today, I will cover 4 topics: First, I will provide an overview of our fourth quarter financial results. Second, I will review highlights from the full year, including some of our major accomplishments, which were remarkable given the very challenging conditions we faced throughout 2022 in the equity markets and the insurance industry. Third, I will unpack in some detail market conditions leading up to January 1 reinsurance renewals, where we saw significant shifts that we believe will impact the industry throughout 2023 and perhaps longer. Suffice it to say, this 1/1 renewal season was the most challenged that many, including myself, have seen in our careers. And fourth, I will outline our 2023 priorities and outlook regarding capital management.  \n Before turning to our results, I'd like to welcome Sabra to the call. We are fortunate to have her in the interim CFO role, while Shane is on a medical leave. Regarding Shane, I am personally, deeply appreciative of the tremendous outreach from many of you, the number of people who have sent good wishes for a speedy recovery is incredibly meaningful to me, and our management team, and particularly, to Shane and his family. We look forward to welcoming him back to AIG.  \n Now let me begin with a brief overview of AIG's fourth quarter results. Adjusted after-tax income in the fourth quarter was $1 billion and $1.36 per diluted common share. We repurchased approximately 780 million of AIG common stock and redeemed $1.8 billion of debt. AIG paid $243 million in dividends in the fourth quarter and Corebridge paid 2 dividends, totaling approximately $300 million following its IPO in September of 2022.  \n Turning to General Insurance. In the fourth quarter, the accident year combined ratio, ex CATs, improved 140 basis points year-over-year to 88.4%, representing the 18th consecutive quarter of margin improvement. Notably, underwriting income in the fourth quarter increased 27% year-over-year to $635 million.  \n Global Commercial drove the year-over-year increase, achieving an accident year combined ratio,  ex CATs, of 84.1%, a 380 basis point improvement and a 69% increase in underwriting income.  \n Global Personal reported an accident year combined ratio, ex CATs, of 100.4%, a 610 basis point increase from the prior year quarter, as we continued to reposition this portfolio.  \n Moving to Global Commercial. On an FX-adjusted basis, North America Commercial net premiums written increased 3% and international increased 2%. Global Commercial had strong renewal retention in its in-force portfolio, and new business continued to be strong.  \n Turning to REIT. Momentum continued in North America Commercial, with overall rate increases in the quarter of 3%, 7% if you exclude Financial Lines and 9% if you also exclude workers' compensation. These rate increases were driven by Retail Property at 15%, Lexington at 12% and Excess Casualty at 9%, and the exposure increase in the North America portfolio was 3%.  \n International Commercial rate increases were 4%, driven by Asia Pacific at 9% and EMEA at 7%, and the exposure increase in the international portfolio was around 2%. Pricing, which includes rate plus exposure, was up 6% in both North America and international. While we experienced downward pressure on rate in certain lines early in the fourth quarter, we saw a reacceleration of price increases towards the end of the quarter.  \n For example, Retail Property was up 15% in the fourth quarter with rate improvement of 24% in December when market impacts from increased catastrophes started to be felt. We saw a similar upward movement at Lexington and particularly within the Property portfolio, with December seeing the strongest rate increases in the fourth quarter. Overall, we continue to earn rate above loss cost trends, which contributed to positive margin expansion.  \n In Global Personal, starting with North America, net premiums written declined 7%, reflecting our ongoing reshaping of this portfolio, particularly in the high and ultra-high net worth businesses that are part of PCG. Later in my remarks, I will discuss our announcement on Monday relating to PCG and our partnership with Stone Point Capital to create a new Managing General Agency or MGA.  \n In International Personal, net premiums written slightly increased by 1% on an FX-adjusted basis due to a rebound in travel and growth in A&H.  \n Now turning to the full year. We made tremendous progress throughout 2022 on a number of key priorities. I could not be more pleased with our team's ability to execute on multiple, complex, strategic objectives across AIG at once. Our most significant and impactful accomplishment was completing the IPO of Corebridge in September of 2022. Despite the very challenging equity market conditions we had to navigate. Notably, Corebridge was last year's largest IPO in the U.S. and the largest financial services IPO since 2020.  \n We also continue to grow underwriting income in General Insurance, which increased approximately $1 billion year-over-year, the second year in a row with over $1 billion of growth in underwriting income. As I noted on last quarter's call, we also reached significant milestones on AIG 200 that have modernized our technology infrastructure and operational capabilities while executing on an exit run rate savings of $1 billion, 6 months ahead of schedule.  \n We also changed AIG's investment management strategy and structure through successful partnerships with Blackstone and BlackRock, and we are seeing the benefits of these partnerships across AIG and Corebridge.  \n Turning to full year consolidated financial results for AIG. Adjusted after-tax income in 2022 reached $3.6 billion and was $4.55 per diluted common share. We returned $6.1 billion to shareholders through $5.1 billion of AIG common stock repurchases and $1 billion of dividends. We finished 2022 with 734 million shares outstanding, a 10% decrease since the end of 2021. And we executed on a number of capital management actions to establish the stand-alone Corebridge capital structure while reducing AIG debt by roughly $10 billion.  \n Consolidated financial debt outstanding was approximately $21 billion at year-end with $11.8 billion at AIG and $9.4 billion at Corebridge.  \n Now let me cover full year 2022 results for General Insurance. As you know, an important aspect of our turnaround over the last few years has been instituting a culture of underwriting excellence. And our rigor in this area is now clearly benefiting our financial results. General Insurance achieved underwriting income of $2 billion in 2022, despite the industry again experiencing over $100 billion of insured natural catastrophe losses. And we exceeded our combined ratio commitment by achieving a sub-90 accident year combined ratio, ex CATs, in all 4 quarters. \n As I've noted on prior calls, and it's worth repeating, since 2018, we completely overhauled our underwriting standards and overlaid these standards with a comprehensive reinsurance program that can adapt to market conditions into our portfolio as it continues to change and improve. Overall, gross limits deployed were reduced by over $1.2 trillion during this period. We also meaningfully and deliberately shifted our global portfolio mix in order to reposition AIG for the future.  \n For example, Global Commercial now represents 74% of our net premiums written, up from 57% in 2018. And Lexington is now 17% of our North America Commercial business, up from 12% in 2018. If you exclude Validus Re, Lexington is now 23% of North America Commercial. As a result of this work, our current portfolio is very well positioned for 2023. I will discuss in more detail later, when I review January 1 reinsurance renewals, how market dynamics have shifted and how AIG should benefit as we look to capitalize on attractive opportunities for better risk-adjusted returns.  \n Now let me highlight a few of the key businesses in General Insurance that contributed to our performance in 2022. Lexington, our market-leading excess and surplus lines business, had 18% net premiums written growth in 2022, up over 50% since we transitioned this business to focus on the wholesale market. This business also increased underwriting profitability, excluding CATs, by 60%, and it achieved a sub-80% accident year combined ratio, ex CATs, for 2022.  \n Glatfelter continued its terrific performance, growing net premiums written by 14%, increasing underwriting income and achieving an 85% accident year combined ratio, ex CATs. The acquisition of Glatfelter allowed us to significantly elevate the quality of our programs business.  \n Global Specialty, which includes our Global Marine, Energy and Aviation businesses, grew net premiums written by over 15% on an FX-adjusted basis. This was driven by strong client retention of 88%, new business growth and rate increases across the portfolio. Global Specialty generated strong earnings in 2022 with an impressive accident year combined ratio, excluding CATs, of 80%.  \n These are just some examples of businesses that we prioritized last year based on their market position, our differentiated value proposition to clients and our ability to generate strong underwriting results. We see great opportunities for these businesses going forward, and they are strong anchors for AIG that we expect will contribute to profitable growth in 2023.  \n Our Global Personal business performed well considering some of the post-pandemic headwinds we saw in the first half of 2022 and our strategic repositioning of the business. Also, as I mentioned on our last call, the impact from deemed hospitalizations in Japan and, to a lesser extent, Taiwan, contributed over $160 million in losses in 2022, having a 290 basis point impact on the International Personal accident year combined ratio. This accident health product was discontinued in 2022.  \n Turning to full year net premiums written. General Insurance grew 4% on an FX-adjusted basis, driven by 6% growth in Global Commercial. North America grew 7% and International Commercial grew 6%. We had strong renewal retention in our in-force portfolio, with North America improving by 300 basis points to 86% and International achieving 86% for the full year. And as a reminder, we calculate renewal retention prior to the impact of rate and exposure changes.  \n Turning to underwriting profitability for the full year. 2022 was another year with strong progress. The General Insurance accident year combined ratio, ex CATs, was 88.7%, an improvement of 230 basis points year-over-year. The full year saw a 180 basis point improvement in the accident year loss ratio, ex CATs, and a 50 basis point improvement in the expense ratio.  \n Global Commercial achieved an impressive accident year combined ratio, ex CATs, of 84.5%, an improvement of 460 basis points year-over-year. The loss ratio was the biggest contributor with a 330 basis point improvement, and the combined ratio, including CATs and PYD of 89.6%, represented a 920 basis point improvement year-over-year.  \n The accident year combined ratio, ex CATs, in Global Personal deteriorated 430 basis points to 99.2% for the reasons I've outlined before.  \n Now let me turn to reinsurance renewals at January 1 of this year. As I stated on our last earnings call, we knew this renewal season will be very challenging and lead to fundamental changes in the market that would impact 1/1 renewals. The market was faced with a combination of factors that added further pressure to dynamics that were already creating considerable stress. We had top global macroeconomic trends. We had geopolitical uncertainty. We had short-term pressure on the asset side of the balance sheet as a consequence of rising interest rates, inflation and currency fluctuation. We had additional natural catastrophe losses late in the fourth quarter and increasing frequency and severity of secondary perils continued.  \n And 2022 ended with over $130 billion of insured natural catastrophe losses, making 2022 the fifth costliest year on record for insurers, with 5 out of the last 6 years having exceeded $100 billion. Hurricane Ian, in particular, proved to be a catalyst that changed market dynamics even more significantly than expected and ultimately led to shifts in the market that required the industry to rethink reinsurance placements and the commensurate changes that needed to take place in the primary market.  \n The unprecedented levels of natural catastrophes on a global scale massively impacted the reinsurance market in a couple of ways. Increased natural CAT activity has resulted in elevated property CAT ceded loss ratios, with average incurred loss ratios from 2017 through 2022 exceeding 85% compared to 2012 through 2016 when average incurred loss ratios trended below 30%, a dramatic deterioration.  \n And over the last 5 years, secondary perils contributed more than 50% to ultimate loss when compared to primary perils. These market dynamics also impacted the supply of reinsurance and retrocessional capacity and the cost of capital increase for the industry, which impacted almost all lines of business and territories, regardless of loss experienced. On top of all of this, very little new capital entered the market. Available capital is estimated to have decreased approximately 20% year-over-year.  \n Now let me outline what happened in the property CAT and retro markets in particular, due to the high level of CAT losses in 2022, which were further exacerbated by events in the fourth quarter. 50% of global Property CAT limits, which we estimate to be $425 billion, renewed at January 1. Approximately 70% of Global retro limits estimated at $60 billion incept at January 1. Reinsurers heavily reliant on peak peril retro protection face greater pressure as a result, whereas larger, more diversified reinsurers were better able to manage retro capacity constraints. As a result, a majority of programs placed on January 1 saw insurance companies forced increase retentions.  \n Despite these market challenges, AIG navigated this complex and intense renewal season extremely well. We knew we were in a strong position heading into January 1, given the repositioning and the improved quality of our Global portfolio, coupled with our considerable efforts to reduce our gross portfolio peak exposures. As we expected, this allowed us to capitalize on many attractive opportunities, and this proved to be a competitive advantage as we had an exceptionally successful renewal season.  \n It's also worth noting that AIG's reinsurance purchasing is, by design, more heavily weighted to January 1 than the wider market. The benefits of this are twofold. Concentrating the bulk of our purchasing at January 1 allows AIG to maximize the outcome across all of our reinsurance placements. And we have clear line of sight on our reinsurance cost for the full year, which is particularly valuable in a market, which we believe will continue to be incredibly challenging.  \n Some of the highlights of our January placements include the following: with respect to property catastrophe placements, we obtained more limit than we purchased in 2022; and we believe we have the lowest attachment points on a return period measurement for North America windstorm and earthquake amongst our peer group; and our modeled exhaust limits are at higher return periods compared to last year for each of our placements. These placements should further reduce volatility, which is something we remain very focused on, and they provide us with significant balance sheet protection in the event one or a series of significant catastrophe events occur.  \n Specifically, we separately made appropriate changes to our North America property CAT treaties to reflect our improving portfolio, with the retention of our commercial CAT portfolio attaching at $500 million and Lexington in our Programs business having an attachment point of $300 million. The property CAT aggregate cover that we placed has 4 retentions before attaching, and for North America, Japan, and Rest of World, it now could attach in the second event, which is an improvement from 2022.  \n Our property CAT [ per occurrence ] structures largely stayed the same for International, and we believe they are market-leading with Japan's retention staying flat at $200 million and the rest of world attaching at $125 million.  \n Many factors improved our overall property CAT reinsurance program, with highlights being: we were able to attain approximately $6 billion of limit, including increasing our per occurrence excess of loss placement; we maintained low attachment points on a model basis; we received support for a $500 million aggregate placement; and our overall spend for AIG increased less than 10% on an absolute and risk-adjusted basis versus 2022.  \n With respect to PCG, we accelerated portfolio remediation, which is driving further gross exposure reductions in key CAT-exposed states where loss costs, inflation and necessary modeling changes have not kept pace. This allowed us to reduce the total limit purchase for the PCG-specific CAT program, which partially offset increased pricing pressure due to Hurricane Ian.  \n Overall, casualty renewals, both excess of loss and our quota share placements, renewed close to expiring terms on a risk-adjusted basis with no impact on ceding commissions. Our reinsurance partners maintain their support for AIG with consistent capacity deployment and reinsurance terms in clear recognition of the quality of our portfolio. The outcomes we achieved at January 1 also reflect the value of the investments we have made in our reinsurance strategy, and, coupled with our relationships and credibility with reinsurance partners, are a testament to the confidence the reinsurance marketplace has in AIG and its management team. We appreciate the ongoing support we have received from our reinsurance partners.  \n As we look ahead to 2023, the world faces many uncertainties. And in uncertain times, our role as a market-leading global insurance company is even more important. With the momentum we have built and the strength of our portfolio, AIG is now extremely well positioned to strategically grow and lead the market by providing thoughtful, expert advice on risk solutions for our clients, distribution partners and other stakeholders.  \n By 2022, we have set out ambitious, strategic, and operational priorities for 2023. We will continue to improve and invest in lines of business and General Insurance, where we see significant growth potential, notably Lexington and Global Specialty. I highlight Lexington because it is presented and will continue to present tremendous growth and profitability opportunities for us. And early indications are that the rate momentum we saw in this business at the end of 2022 and into early 2023 will continue. We expect meaningful growth in Lexington this year, led by Property where, over the last few years, we have prudently tightened limits, improved terms and conditions and increased profitability while driving top line growth.  \n We also plan to increase investment in our assumed reinsurance business in 2023, particularly through Validus Re. As we have discussed on prior calls, over the past few years, we've been highly focused on driving value through a disciplined approach, involving strong risk assessments, sound portfolio construction, a steadfast commitment to underwriting excellence and prudent capital management. \n Over this period of time, the derisking within Validus Re was particularly acute in the Global Property CAT market, where year-over-year, we reduced participations across the portfolio while concurrently purchasing sound retrocessional protections to prudently manage the portfolio and reduce volatility, all in line with our cycle management strategy. As a result, we were in a strong position to capitalize on attractive opportunities at January 1. The property market, in particular, repositioned and became very compelling in terms of risk-adjusted rates along with enhanced structures as well as beneficial terms and conditions.  \n Rate changes within property CAT range between 30% and 100% in the U.S. as well as in peak zones outside the U.S. Risk-adjusted rate increases were approximately 50% in the U.S. Property and 35% in International Property. And similarly, average margin improvement was approximately 50% year-over-year across the entire portfolio.  \n Property CAT ROEs for both the U.S. and International business increased by greater than 100% year-over-year. Additionally, we obtained improved terms and conditions, including favorable movement in attachment points in all Property lines.  \n For Casualty lines, quota shares remained sound with ceding commissions moving favorably for reinsurers by 1 to 2 points, along with terms and conditions remaining in line or improved. The result of these actions included: net premiums written at January 1 increased over $500 million or 50% year-over-year. This increase was driven roughly 30% from U.S., property 15% from International Property, 45% from casualty placements and the remaining 10% was from Specialty, including marine and energy.  \n The majority of new property limit was deployed to existing clients with a significant level of private terms being achieved on our U.S. property writings.  \n Looking ahead, we will continue our measured approach for other renewals. For example, if meaningful market changes continue, we will carefully consider our positions at the April 1 Japan renewals, and we will continue to be very cautious with capital deployed at June 1 in Florida.  \n Turning to Private Client Group or PCG. This business remains a strategic priority for us in 2023. As you know, over the last 2 years, we have undertaken a significant re-underwriting effort in this portfolio, reduced aggregate exposure, transitioned certain states to the non-admitted market and developed strong partnerships with Lloyd's and reinsurers to reduce volatility.  \n On Monday, we announced our intention to launch, in partnership with Stone Point Capital, a newly formed MGA that will underwrite on behalf of AIG and eventually other capital providers in the high- and ultra-high net worth markets. AIG will transfer core PCG solutions to the MGA, which will offer a single end-to-end broker and client portal, a comprehensive set of product offerings, a simplified data warehouse and the underwriting capabilities of AIG. The MGA will be rebranded as Private Client Select, or PCS, and will be led by Kathleen Zortman and our current team at PCG. We see this new structure as a logical next step in the evolution of PCG and believe it will create significant value for clients, brokers and other stakeholders.  \n Additionally, expense discipline will continue to be a priority for AIG. In addition to savings from AIG 200 that we expect to earn in during 2023, we plan to move $300 million of expenses currently sitting in AIG corporate GOE to Corebridge upon deconsolidation. Separately, we will continue to align our target operating model and further reduce absolute expenses across AIG parent and General Insurance to reflect the fact that AIG is becoming one company.  \n This year, we will also remain focused on completing the operational separation of Corebridge from AIG, and we are working towards a secondary offering of Corebridge common stock by the end of the first quarter, subject to market conditions and regulatory approvals. Our current expectation is that the majority of net proceeds of the secondary offering will be used for AIG common stock repurchases.  \n And as I stated on our last call, we are revisiting AIG's dividend, which has not changed in many years. We expect to say more about this on our first quarter call in May.  \n With respect to capital management priorities, in 2022, we did a significant amount of work to materially improve the capital structures of both AIG and Corebridge. With the reduction in AIG debt we achieved, our post-deconsolidation leverage will be in line with best-in-class peers. And with respect to share buybacks, we have $3.8 billion remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization.  \n Our balanced capital management philosophy will continue to allow for investment in growth opportunities, while returning appropriate levels of capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. We also remain open to compelling inorganic growth opportunities, should they arise.  \n Before turning the call over to Sabra, I would like to pause and say that 2022 was another incredibly important year for AIG. Our colleagues did an exceptional job, particularly on the Corebridge IPO and the continued underwriting and operational improvements that are clearly showing through in our financial results. Our journey to be a top-performing company continues, and I fully expect 2023 to be another year with significant momentum and progress across the organization. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Sabra. Thank you. Michelle, we'll take our first question, please. Thanks, Elyse. I would think in terms of how you should think about this, and for us to get to the 10% ROE, Sabra outlined in detail, there's really 3 major ways in which we'll get there. One is through the underwriting results, the other is expense savings. The other is sort of the capital rebalance with share repurchases and other capital management. So you should think about that as a 300 to 350 basis point target in terms of us getting to the double-digit ROCE. Of course, net investment income can benefit, and that's more of a timing issue. We've never said, even in the prior calls, that contribution from increased NOI. NII will be the one that needs to contribute to get us to the 10%, but I think -- I would think of it in that range for the different components. Yes. Thank you. The first part, Elyse, we do not change our loss cost assumptions from what we had outlined in the third quarter, so 6.5% remains our view. When you look at the fourth quarter, like you said, overall, there was around 6%. But when you -- you have to take a couple of things into consideration. One is fourth quarter is our seasonally sort of lowest-sized quarter. But if you look at financial lines, like financial lines is even throughout the entire year, first quarter through fourth, so had a little bit more of a contribution to the overall rate index in the fourth quarter. \n Our International was very well balanced. We had strong rate in areas where we felt we needed it, which is like Property, Excess Casualty. We're driving rate as we have been for the last several years in Lexington, the Excess & Surplus Lines. And then I look at the full year in terms of North America, the Excess Casualty, Retail Property, Lexington, all getting double-digit rate increases. And so like we have been very focused on the rate above loss cost to continue to develop margin. I think that's been evidenced through the culture that we've developed in terms of underwriting excellence. We are very focused on making sure that we continue that, and it's terms and conditions and adjustments to how we structure businesses going forward. December was much stronger than the first part of the quarter. And as we look to January, that momentum is continuing. Dave, maybe just spend a minute on what happened in Financial Lines and D&O specifically? Thanks, Dave. And don't forget, like the cumulative rate increases we've achieved in D&O over the last 3 years have been north of 80%. So again, it's a line, as Dave says, we're laser focused on. We're not going to chase the market down. But the cumulative rate increases and margin development hasn't been fully recognized, and we're going to look to 2023 with a lot of discipline. Thanks, Paul. We do purchase facultative in certain segments of our business, but we were really referencing the core treaties. When we look at risk appetite, when we are thinking through our ability to protect the balance sheet and where we want to structure treaties, we don't require facultative reinsurance for other segments in order to supplement the core structure. So when I was referencing in my prepared remarks, the treaty structures, we did an exceptional job. The team really focused on modeling changes, inflationary changes and where we thought capital was going to be less expensive versus more expensive. \n An example of that would be taking big excess of loss CAT across the world. It gets too expensive for allocation of capital, and that is something we moved away from. So we've built more vertical towers in North America and in international and Japan specifically. So I think the overall market has responded most to Property. Casualty has started to tighten up. I still think that there's ample capacity in quota shares. They may be with some tighter terms and conditions and ceding commissions or, by and large, it was placeable. And yes, facultative, I think, has become harder to place on property just based on the capital available. But for us, we don't heavily rely on facultative to deliver results. It's really our core treaty structures. I think we've done an exceptional job on the underwriting side with terms and conditions. I think the entire team has focused over the last several years as not only -- certainly pricing's an output, but how we structure our insurance deals, how we focus on client needs, but also how we customize terms and conditions to make sure that we have the appropriate policies and endorsements in the marketplace. I don't think it's over. It's something that's a nuance. But as we look to the property market in 2023, it's one of the areas where, when you report out rate, you really have to understand the risk-adjusted implications of rate increases. \n For instance, in Excess & Surplus Lines property, I expect to see higher deductibles, more wind deductibles, tighter terms and conditions. We've seen what used to be all risk, which covered all perils, now to name perils, and so you can strip out a lot of coverage in terms of when you're placing it, whether you're trying to solve for wind or quake or flood, you don't provide all of the perils. And so if you said to me, what's one of the big areas that you'll see an improvement in 2023, it will be on the terms and conditions and how we price those perils. And I think we will offer, particularly in Excess & Surplus Lines, the appropriate coverage, but we will be restrictive on terms of conditions if we don't feel we're getting paid for. So I don't think it's over. Thanks, Erik. As you know, this has been an active strategy for us, particularly over the back half of 2022. I think the team has done an exceptional job. And Sabra, maybe you can just provide a little bit of insight in terms of some of the NII and the reinvestment rates. Yes, Erik, it is. We -- in Other Operations, think about it in a couple of components. I think you've outlined most of them, is that upon deconsolidation, we would have $300 million or there thereabouts go with Corebridge. I mean, there could be some stair step up. I mean, it's hard in 2023 to look at each quarter because we're building Corebridge, as we've talked about before, as a stand-alone public company. So those amounts will be in each quarter, depending on the progress that we're making. So think about the $300 million. \n I think we'll have savings in Other Operations throughout the year separate from that in the $100 million to $200 million range. And then as we get to the future target operating model, we've given guidance from the past that we anticipate that we'll get around $500 million, not out of all -- that will not all come out of Other Operations. It come out of the combination of what is General Insurance in the parent company today. But that will take deconsolidation. It will take us to get to the target operating model. But I think in the short run, you should think about Corebridge's $300 million, and that between $100 million to $200 million of other reductions in Other Ops is how I would think about it in 2023. Thank you for the question. You have to really look at the full year, I believe, in terms of showing the progress of what we've done as a company. First and foremost, again, I'll mention it again, which is a culture of underwriting excellence. When we look at Commercial with a 340 basis point improvement in the fourth quarter in terms of its action year combined ratio, ex CATs, 440 for the year, I mean that's substantial progress. I mean, we made enormous improvements in profitability. \n And so we've shaped the portfolio the way we like it, where again, the fourth quarter, not all roads lead to Financial Lines. But again, it was just a disproportionate amount of premium relative to the overall size. Fourth quarter's small. We saw real good growth in the businesses that we want to grow in, which is in the Excess & Surplus Lines, Global Specialty. But as we've been talking about, I hope it's evidenced through what we did at 1/1, which is why we wanted to put it in the prepared remarks, which is, I kept talking about taking aggregate down where we didn't think we were getting the appropriate risk-adjusted returns. \n But when we thought we felt that the risk-adjusted returns were there, like in the reinsurance business, we expanded significantly and expect to see that through 2023. Can't really predict the market, but I don't believe this is all played through. We had a very complicated 1/1, but you have Japan coming up. \n And the hardest part in terms of the reinsurance market and thus then the primary market on peak zone is going to be Florida at [ 6/1 ]. And so we think there's great opportunities in Excess & Surplus Lines continue to grow. Again, Global Specialties, Retail Property across the world. We'll watch International, but I don't believe that the treaty increased pricing that happened, which was substantial at 1/1, will play its way through the International business until 2024. Because a lot of the deals, 60% of it comes up at 1/1, was priced off of prior year treaties. \n And so I think this has momentum. We are incredibly well positioned. We have no aggregate restrictions. And where we see risk-adjusted returns that are attractive, which we already have, we're going to deploy capital. That was the whole idea of putting more capital in subsidiaries, and then it goes to other lines of business. I mean, you cross-sell what we do in casualty, how we play in these different markets, we have such tremendous following as lead experts in underwriting that we believe, across the world, our platform will be very helpful to our clients, and we expect to find really strong areas for growth. We watch it carefully. I mean Excess Casualty, we're still getting very strong rate we have for the last couple of years. And that didn't stop in the fourth quarter. My prepared remarks were really just focused on, I don't think the market that we entered in the fourth quarter is the market that we're in. There's been a lot of changes over the last 60 days. And like every other line of business, it needs to stand on its own. It needs to develop margin. We want to be conservative in our position and making certain that the underwriting terms and conditions are appropriate. But we're watching it carefully. I haven't seen a substantial downturn in terms of pricing. It's been right in the sort of same range for, as I said, the last 6 quarters. And it's something that we're going to watch very carefully in 2023.\n Okay. We greatly appreciate the engagement and all the questions and appreciate the interest. And so I just wish everybody a great day, and thank you for being here."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to AIG's Third Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. This conference is being recorded. \n Now at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead. \nQuentin McMillan: Thanks very much, and good morning. Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC provide details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by the applicable securities laws, AIG is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements if circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change. \n Additionally, today's remarks may refer to non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at www.aig.com. Finally, today's remarks will include a discussion of the financial results of AIG's Life and Retirement segment and Other Operations on the same basis as prior quarters, which is how we expect to continue to report Life and Retirement and Other Operations until the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial. \n AIG's segments and U.S. GAAP financial results, as well as AIG's key financial metrics with respect thereto differ from those reported by Corebridge Financial. As such, we will be intentional when referring to AIG's Life and Retirement segment versus Corebridge Financial when commenting on financial results. Corebridge Financial will host its first earnings call post IPO next week on November 9, and its management team will provide additional details on the Corebridge Financial third quarter results. \n With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Thank you, Quentin. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review our third quarter financial results, which I'm pleased to report were very strong, along with the excellent progress we've made on our strategic priorities. Following my remarks, Shane will provide more detail on the third quarter financial results, and then we'll take questions. Kevin Hogan, David McElroy and Mark Lyons will join us for the Q&A portion of today's call. \n The third quarter represented an inflection point for AIG, with important milestones achieved across the organization. Our team once again demonstrated its ability to execute on significant strategic initiatives that position AIG for a strong future, to apply discipline and the successful execution of these initiatives and to achieve high-quality outcomes even against a backdrop of very complicated capital and insurance markets. \n Before I cover the third quarter in more detail, I'd like to comment on the successful Corebridge Financial IPO, which we completed in mid-September despite very challenging equity capital market conditions. On our second quarter earnings call, we explained that volatility in the capital markets was significantly elevated and that attempting to complete an IPO at that time would not have been in the best interest of AIG, Corebridge or our stakeholders. \n As a result, we decided to defer the IPO and revisit timing in the third quarter. We knew that there would be limited open windows and remain committed to completing a transaction as soon as we believed an appropriate opportunity was available. Throughout the summer, our team did a remarkable job and worked diligently on the operational separation of Corebridge from AIG as well as to prepare the business for a successful IPO. \n As we noted on our last call, we had already increased the targeted savings program at Corebridge from an initial range of $200 million to $300 million to $400 million within 2 to 3 years. With the additional time available pre-IPO, the business accelerated certain actions and is now expected to deliver run rate savings of over $100 million by the end of 2022, ahead of our original schedule. \n We were also prepared to secure the capital structure of Corebridge prior to the IPO and access the debt markets in late summer during a short window when conditions became more favorable. In August, Corebridge issued $1 billion of hybrid debt securities and in early September drew down on a $1.5 billion bank facility to complete its initial capital structure. Using part of the net proceeds from these debt transactions, Corebridge closed out the remaining $1.9 billion due to AIG under a promissory note. \n Throughout this time, we also engage in continuous discussions with our financial and other advisers about equity market conditions, investor sentiment and our ability to execute the IPO in a complicated market. While equity markets remain uncertain, volatility was not as extreme leading up to Labor Day. We were confident we could complete the IPO within an acceptable valuation range, and we continue to believe it was very important for the future of AIG and Corebridge to establish Corebridge as a public company in 2022. \n Throughout the third quarter, we also made significant progress in the implementation of a new investment management model for AIG and Corebridge. As you know, in mid-2021, we finalized a strategic partnership with Blackstone, which includes the transfer of $50 billion of Corebridge AUM to Blackstone, with that number growing to $92.5 billion over 6 years. \n In addition, earlier this year, we announced a partnership with BlackRock, under which we will transfer up to $150 billion of liquid assets from both AIG and Corebridge. To date, we have transferred $100 billion of assets, with $37 billion moving from AIG and $63 billion moving from Corebridge. The complexity of operationally separating Corebridge from AIG as well as implementing our new operating model for investment management cannot be understated. \n Keep in mind, these businesses have been in a combined structure for over 2 decades, with aspects of each business shifting over time between segments until just a few years ago. And until we announced our intention to separate Corebridge from AIG in late 2020, investments was a stand-alone unit at AIG, servicing all businesses across the organization. Our partnerships with Blackstone and BlackRock enable us to accelerate the reshaping of our investment portfolios. \n With respect to the financial commitments Corebridge made as part of the IPO, I'd like to reiterate them as they too will create significant value for shareholders over time. We continue to expect Corebridge to pay $600 million in annual dividends, with its first quarterly dividend of $148 million declared 15 days after the IPO close and already paid, to have the financial flexibility to repurchase shares or reduce AIG's ownership stake as early as the second quarter of 2023 and to achieve a return on equity of 12% to 14% over the next 24 months. \n Completing the Corebridge IPO within a very narrow window was a testament to the careful preparation, hard work and dedication of our teams at AIG and Corebridge and to the quality of the business. This was a major accomplishment for our teams, and we are all very proud of the outcome. \n Turning to other highlights in the third quarter. Adjusted after-tax net income per diluted common share was $0.66. General Insurance delivered very strong performance and continued profitability improvement despite significant natural CATs in the quarter. The accident year combined ratio, ex CATs, was 88.4%, a 210 basis point improvement year-over-year and the 17th consecutive quarter of improvement. \n This result was primarily due to Global Commercial, which had an excellent quarter, with an accident year combined ratio, ex CATs, of 83%, a 590 basis point improvement year-over-year, driven by International Commercial, which had an impressive 80.4% accident year combined ratio, ex CATs. The accident year combined ratio was 98.2%, a 200 basis point improvement year-over-year. The calendar year combined ratio was 97.3%, a 240 basis point improvement year-over-year. \n CAT losses in the third quarter were $600 million, or 9.8 points of the combined ratio. Shane will break this number down for you in his remarks. Our CAT total includes losses from AIG Re related to Hurricane Ian, which came in at $125 million. This result reflects the terrific work the team has done to reduce peak zone exposure in our assumed reinsurance business, particularly in Florida, where we've reduced limits deployed by approximately 60% since 2018 and have minimal exposure to Florida domestic insurers. \n Considering Hurricane Ian and other CATs in the third quarter, our CAT losses validate the quality of our underwriting, our reinsurance strategy and our ability to successfully manage volatility. With respect to PYD, there was a favorable release in the third quarter of $72 million or 90 basis points of the calendar year combined ratio. \n In Life and Retirement, the business had another quarter of strong sales with premiums and deposits coming in at approximately $9 billion, up from $7.2 billion in the prior year, with positive year-over-year growth in each of its 4 business segments. Effective capital management remains a priority for AIG. In the third quarter, we repurchased $1.3 billion of common stock and paid $247 million of dividends. We also announced $1.8 billion of debt repayments, which we commenced in the third quarter and closed last week, further strengthening our balance sheet. And lastly, AIG ended the third quarter with $6.5 billion of parent liquidity. \n Now let me provide additional detail on General Insurance and the continued, sustained improvement and very good absolute performance in our underwriting. When referring to gross and net premiums written, note that all numbers are on an FX-adjusted basis. Gross premiums written increased 5% to $9.2 billion, with Global Commercial growing 8% and Global Personal decreasing 3%. Net premiums written increased 3% to $6.4 billion. \n The growth was in our Global Commercial business, which grew 6%, with Global Personal decreasing 4%. North America Commercial net premiums written increased 7%, and International Commercial net premiums written increased 5% or approximately 8%, excluding the impact of nonrenewal and cancellations related to known Russia exposure. \n In North America Commercial, we saw very strong growth in net premiums written in Lexington led by wholesale property, retail property and Glatfelter. In International Commercial, we also saw strong growth in net premiums written in Global Specialty, led by International Specialty, marine and energy as well as property. \n In Global Commercial, we also had very strong renewal retention of 85% in our in-force portfolio, with North America up 400 basis points year-over-year to 86% and international at 85%. As a reminder, we calculate renewal retention prior to the impact of rate and exposure changes. And across Global Commercial, our new business continues to be strong. North America new business was $458 million led by Lexington. International new business was $474 million led by specialty. \n Turning to rate. Momentum continued in North America Commercial with overall rate increases of 9% in the third quarter, excluding workers' compensation. Areas within North America Commercial achieved double-digit rate increases. These included Lexington, which increased 20%; cyber, which increased 32%; and excess casualty, which increased 12%. International Commercial rate increases were 6%, driven by Talbot, EMEA, Asia Pacific, each of which increased 10%. \n Our team analyzes loss cost trends every quarter. On our last call, we indicated that our loss cost trend view in the second quarter for North America Commercial lines had migrated upwards to 6%. Due to inflationary and other related factors that have resulted in an increase in property loss costs, we are increasing our aggregate loss cost trend to 6.5%, both in North America and international. Overall, we continue to receive rate above loss cost trends, which contributes to margin expansion on a written basis. \n Moving to Global Personal Insurance, we continue our work across the portfolio to prioritize growth in A&H, to reposition our capabilities in Japan Personal and to transform our North America high net worth portfolio. Starting with North America, personal net premiums written declined 11%, driven by warranty as well as our ongoing reshaping of our high net worth business that we've discussed on prior calls. \n We continue to make progress in our high net worth business by reducing peak zone aggregation, improving the overall quality of the portfolio, transitioning a portion of the portfolio where appropriate to excess and surplus lines and enhancing the value we offer to clients. Third quarter results reflect this repositioning, with North America's gross and net premiums written declining as we continue to reduce exposures and increase reinsurance sessions to mitigate volatility. \n North America Personal Insurance's premium declines were partially offset by continued momentum in individual travel and Personal A&H. In International Personal, net premiums written declined 2% due to a reduction in warranty that was partially offset by a rebound in individual travel as well as growth in A&H, which is our largest and most profitable International Personal portfolio. \n One item to note in the International Personal Insurance third quarter accident year loss ratio is that it reflects approximately $100 million of losses related to COVID claims in Japan and, to a lesser extent, Taiwan. These losses were primarily due to the Japanese government instituting a policy relating to deemed hospitalizations resulting from COVID, which impacted our A&H book. \n This government policy was revised in the third quarter, and as a result, we expect the issue to have a de minimis impact in future quarters, starting with the fourth quarter of this year. Additionally, some of these losses related to cleanup expense benefits offered to small businesses, which AIG no longer provides. \n Turning to PYD, we conducted our annual review of approximately 75% of pre-ADC loss reserves in the third quarter. We applied conservative assumptions in this review as we believe it is appropriate to be prudent given current economic conditions. As a result of our review, we recorded $72 million of net favorable development for the third quarter or 90 basis points of the loss ratio. This reflects $42 million of amortization from the ADC combined with $30 million of other favorable development. \n Our international operations were favorable in every region totaling $328 million, whereas North America was unfavorable by $256 million. Furthermore, in North America, virtually every line of business was favorable, except for U.S. financial lines, which was unfavorable by $660 million net of the ADC, predominantly in accident years 2018 and 2019 and, to a lesser extent, 2020. \n Let me unpack the drivers of unfavorable development in U.S. financial lines a bit more because it's been an area of focus for us for several years given AIG's history in this line of business. The unfavorable development was primarily driven by excess D&O written out of both the U.S. and our Bermuda business. And while there was some movement on the primary side, the excess book was the most significant driver. D&O prior year emergence continues to be driven by large losses. Many from security class actions and earlier accident years also experienced stacking exposures where primary mid-excess and high-excess policies were all exposed on the same insured. \n This issue is similar to what we saw across the portfolio when we first started our remediation strategy. The company had too much vertical limit on a per account basis. As we've discussed on prior calls, our underwriting strategy and ventilation standards were completely overhauled over the last few years, including U.S. financial lines to prevent stacking and overexposure to anyone insured. And we've dramatically reduced limits deployed on individual policies, obtained tighter terms and conditions and achieved higher attachment points on primary limits. Shane will provide more detail on PYDs in his remarks. \n Now I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about Hurricane Ian, which was a very tragic event on a human level that also left devastating physical damage. AIG rapidly deployed significant resources to the affected areas, providing immediate support and infrastructure to help individuals, businesses and communities rebuild. Hurricane Ian is projected to be the second largest insured natural CAT loss in U.S. history. \n There remain a considerable number of variables contributing to industry ultimate losses, but based on what we know today, total insurable losses are expected to be in the range of $50 billion to $60 billion. For context, Hurricane Katrina and Irma, the first and third largest U.S. natural CAT losses in the last 100 years, are estimated at $85 billion and $40 billion of insured losses, respectively, on an inflation-adjusted basis. \n While Hurricane Ian will have an impact on the broader insurance, reinsurance and retro markets, we believe AIG is well positioned. Very importantly, we have strong and strategic relationships with our major reinsurers, and we are confident in our ability to obtain similar levels of capacity for 2023 as we did in 2022. In addition, we've improved and continued to improve our portfolio, and therefore, the reinsurance we require will reflect this during 2023. And we see significant growth opportunities across the market, especially in the near term and for property specifically, and our significant financial flexibility will allow us to be nimble as we deploy capital at attractive risk-adjusted returns to Retail Property, wholesale property, Talbot, global specialties and AIG Re. \n With respect to the industry and markets more broadly, as we noted on our second quarter call, there are a few things you need to believe about the market prior to Ian in order to understand the impact Ian may have in the future. If you believe, as we do, that the retro market was already contracting from last year's available capacity, which itself was reduced from the prior year and the anticipated capital for 2023 was already going to further contract approximately 10%, the retro market and the property CAT market would have already been challenged even prior to Ian. \n In addition to reduced capacity over 2022, prior to Ian, there was also an expectation of increased retentions, more specific peril coverage as well as rate increases resulting from several factors including increased frequency and severity of CATs over the last several years. Keeping this context in mind, 2022 will be another year with over $100 billion in natural CAT industry losses. Prior to 2017, on an inflation-adjusted basis, there were only 2 years, 2005 and 2011, that had greater than $100 billion of global natural CAT losses. And in both of these years, losses were led by primary perils.  \n Since 2017, 5 of the last 6 years have had greater than $100 billion in global natural CAT losses, with the predominant portion of losses in the aggregate coming from secondary perils. Furthermore, other issues potentially impacting 1/1 capacity prior to Ian were the strengthening of the dollar, euro-denominated capacity likely decreasing due to currency devaluation, asset valuations, inflation and demand surge from the post pandemic economy, just to name a few. \n When considering the impact of Ian and the complexity it adds to already challenging market conditions, there are a few additional factors to consider. In Florida, residential total insured values have increased by more than 50% over the last 10 years. The significance of commercial losses, which will likely exceed 40% of the ultimate losses for Ian, compared to the average of prior natural catastrophes, where commercial losses were 30% of the ultimate loss. The prevalence of commercial losses exacerbates the complexity of CAT modeling generally and the resulting deficiencies regarding appropriate CAT load and pricing. \n When considering the modeled estimated output for losses related to Ian, for example, commercial losses were deficient by 2.5x and personal by 1.5x after adjusting for inflation and other factors. Furthermore, when major CATs occur in Florida, a disproportionate amount of the loss finds its way to the reinsurance market because of the proportional and low attaching excess to loss placements completed by Florida domestic insurers as their capital structures require significant reinsurance. Available reinsurance capacity is forecasted to be the lowest aggregate limit available in over a decade, making conditions in the property CAT reinsurance market even more challenging. \n Now turning to Life and Retirement. Adjusted pretax income was $589 million, decreasing from $877 million in the prior year period, mainly due to lower alternative investment income and lower call and tender income. There were no significant reserve adjustments arising out of the third quarter actuarial assumption review. As I mentioned earlier, Life and Retirement had excellent sales with premiums and deposits of approximately $9 billion, up 23% year-over-year. Sales of annuities over the course of 2022 have benefited from our relationship with Blackstone with $5 billion of assets originated year-to-date in private ABS, direct credit lending and structured assets. \n While our strategic partnership with Blackstone is still in the early days, the quality and the performance of the portfolio relative to what the business could have done on its own are very encouraging. Sequential improvement in fixed income and loan portfolio yields accelerated, with a 24 basis point improvement in base investment yields. Year-over-year fixed income and loan portfolio yields also improved 8 basis points, confirming the business has surpassed year-over-year yield compression for the first time in recent memory. Shane will provide more information on the Life and Retirement segment and Corebridge in his remarks. \n Shifting to capital management, we continue to be balanced and disciplined as we maintain appropriate levels of capital in our subsidiaries for profitable growth opportunities across our global portfolio as well as reduced levels of debt while returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. Looking ahead, with respect to share buybacks, we have $4.3 billion remaining on our current share repurchase authorization and expect to end 2022 with over $5 billion of share repurchases for the full year. And balance sheet actions we've taken put us in a position of strength with significant financial flexibility that AIG has not had in many years. \n As we look to 2023, our lockup agreement with the underwriters of the IPO with respect to Corebridge common stock expires in March. Subject to ordinary course blackout periods, this means that our likely windows for a secondary offering of Corebridge common stock in the first half of 2023 will be in mid- to late March as well as mid-May to late June. Our current expectation is that the net proceeds will largely be deployed to share repurchases. \n While we remain committed to consistently returning capital through share repurchases for the foreseeable future, we believe there will be attractive organic growth opportunities in General Insurance and AIG Re given current market dislocations that may prove compelling. Lastly, as we discussed on our second quarter call, we continue to expect that post deconsolidation of Corebridge, AIG will achieve a return on common equity at or above 10%. Shane will provide more details in his remarks. \n As we approach year-end and plan for 2023, our path forward is clear with General Insurance solidifying its position as a global market leader, the deconsolidation and eventual full separation of Corebridge firmly underway and a significantly strengthened balance sheet. With that, Shane, I'll turn the call over to you. \nShane Fitzsimons: Thank you, Peter. As Peter noted, I will provide more detail on the third quarter results, specifically EPS, reserve reviews, net investment income, capital management and the path to achieving an above 10% return on common equity. Adjusted after-tax income was $509 million or $0.66 per share compared to $837 million or $0.97 per share in the prior year quarter. This was driven by a $741 million decline in net investment income, offset by improved underwriting results in General Insurance and solid performance in Life and Retirement as well as improved GOE and Other Operations. \n General Insurance finished the third quarter with adjusted pretax income of $750 million. Underwriting income was up $148 million despite Hurricane Ian, offset by a $209 million decline in net investment income due to alternative investment returns. Life and Retirement contributed adjusted pretax income of $589 million, which is $288 million below prior year quarter driven by lower alternative investment and call and tender income. \n Other Operations adjusted pretax loss of $614 million compared to $562 million prior year quarter, mostly due to lower alternative investment income, partially offset by lower interest expense. This quarter, Other Operations included $16 million of additional expenses for setting up Corebridge as a stand-alone company. Excluding such expenses, GOE improved by $17 million versus prior year. \n As Peter noted, results in General Insurance reflects strong underwriting performance with continued combined ratio improvement of 240 basis points to 97.3%, an accident year combined ratio ex CAT of 210 basis points to 88.4%. North America Commercial accident year combined ratio, ex CAT, improved 590 basis points over the prior year quarter to 84.6%. International Commercial accident year combined ratio, ex CAT, at 80.4% showed 640 basis points of improvement.  \n North America Personal reported an accident year combined ratio, ex CAT, of 112.8%, primarily reflecting higher reinsurance costs and lower ceding commission for high net worth business. International Personal accident year combined ratio, ex CAT, was 99.9%, wholly due to increased frequency of A&H claims in Japan and Taiwan. Net CAT losses, excluding reinstatement premiums, were $600 million or 9.8 loss ratio points in the third quarter, which included $450 million from Hurricane Ian and $84 million from Japanese typhoons. Additionally, the reinstatement premium impact across all CAT events was $55 million. \n Switching to reserves, nearly $40 billion of reserves were reviewed this quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to approximately 90% of carried pre-ADC reserves. As Peter noted, prior year development, excluding related premium adjustments, was $72 million favorable this quarter compared to favorable development of $50 million in the prior year quarter. \n Prior year emergence in accident year 2019 and 2020 was largely due to policies written in 2017 and 2018. And an accident year 2020 was largely due to policies in private and not-for-profit where gross premiums have been reduced by 54% since 2018, and limits provided have been reduced by 85%. In 2018 and prior, AIG wrote multiyear policies that contributed to accident year 2019 and 2020 losses. So for example, a policy written in 2017 had loss emergence in accident year 2020. We have strategically shifted away from this business, which now makes up less than 1% of policies in those lines. \n As we've discussed previously, we overhauled the General Insurance underwriting strategy, including U.S. financial lines, resulting in reduced limits deployed on individual policies, tighter terms and conditions on higher attachment points on primary limits and termination of certain businesses. Since 2018, we have seen the following. Total primary limits exposed in U.S. financial lines have been reduced by $32 billion on a comparative basis or nearly 80% through the third quarter of this year. \n Total primary limits in both corporate and national D&O have been reduced by nearly 50% on a comparative basis, and private and not-for-profit primary limits have been reduced by nearly 85%. And in all cases, rates have increased substantially over this time period. Since 2018, we have achieved cumulative rate increases of nearly 85% in both primary corporate and national D&O on a third quarter cumulative basis and over 115% in private and not-for-profit primary business. \n Overall, we recognize bad news early but wait to recognize good news over time as we monitor developments, which we believe leads to a conservative view on our reserves. Along these lines, we've built in an expectation of higher inflation given the uncertainty over its potential impact on our reserves. \n Turning to Life and Retirement. Adjusted pretax income was $589 million compared to $877 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease was due to lower alternative investment, call and tender and fee income, partially offset by higher investment income from fixed maturity and loan portfolios, less adverse mortality and an improved outcome in the annual actuarial assumption review, which, other than DAC acceleration of $57 million, showed no meaningful net movement in reserves this year. \n Product margins were attractive and in excess of long-term targets in all businesses, supported by robust new business origination from Blackstone. Corebridge now expects spread compression to convert to expansion beginning in 2023. Strong sales momentum continued in Individual Retirement, with $3.8 billion in sales, a 16% increase year-over-year and led by over 100% growth in fixed annuity sales on a record $1.7 billion in index annuity sales. \n Group Retirement deposits grew 11%, driven by higher large plan acquisitions in the third quarter. The Life business had solid sales with an improving mix of business in the U.S. and continued underlying growth in the U.K. In Institutional Markets, premiums and deposits of $1.9 billion were up from $1 billion in the prior year quarter, with larger GIC issuances on higher pension risk transfer transactions. Mortality, including COVID losses, was once again below original pricing expectations.  COVID losses remain within original sensitivities of $65 million to $75 million for each 100,000 U.S. population deaths. \n Adjusted pretax net investment income for the third quarter was $2.54 billion, a decline of $741 million or 23% compared to prior year quarter, with $431 million attributable to Life and Retirement. $665 million of the decline was due to alternative investment income and $150 million was due to reduced call and tender income, offset by increase in the fixed maturity and loan portfolios of $153 million from yield uplift.\n Our fixed maturity and loan portfolio saw a lift in yield of 17 basis points in the third quarter, building on top of the 9 basis points from the second quarter, and we expect 10 to 15 basis points additional in the fourth quarter. The new money yields on our fixed maturity and loan portfolio was approximately 120 basis points above the assets rolling off during the third quarter, roughly 60 basis points higher in General Insurance and 130 basis points higher in Life and Retirement. \n Now turning to the balance sheet and capital management. We began 2022 with $10.7 billion of parent liquidity. And since then, we have paid dividends totaling $768 million, repurchased approximately $4.4 billion or 77 million shares of common stock, bringing our ending count to 747 million shares, a 9% reduction year-to-date. \n Including recently announced bond make-whole calls of $1.8 billion, we established a Corebridge debt structure of $9.4 billion and reduced $9.8 billion of AIG debt. We completed the Corebridge IPO with its parent liquidity at $1.7 billion. AIG received $1.6 billion of net proceeds from the IPO, and we exited the third quarter with $6.5 billion of AIG parent liquidity, including $1.8 billion to fund the make-whole calls. \n At third quarter end, our GAAP leverage was 36.5%, a 540 basis points increase quarter-over-quarter. The decrease in AOCI added 320 basis points to the overall leverage ratio, with over 80% of the change relating to Life and Retirement. AIG's debt leverage ratio, excluding AOCI, was 27.5%, up 220 basis points from the second quarter as a result of the issuance of Corebridge debt as planned prior to the IPO. Including the impact of the make-whole calls post quarter end, AIG's leverage is 34.7% or 26%, excluding AOCI. Total adjusted return on common equity was 3.7%, down from 6.5% in 3Q '21. The decrease is mostly caused by a decline in net investment income. \n Moving to the risk-based capital ratio, our primary operating subsidiaries remain profitable and well capitalized, with General Insurance's U.S. pool fleet and Life and Retirement's U.S. fleet RBC ratios both above our target ranges. We continue to make progress on the 4 priorities to achieve a 10% or greater return on capital employed. They are: underwriting profitability; leaner operating model; separation of the Life and Retirement business; and capital management. 2 points of improvement in combined ratio or $500 million of expense savings or $5 billion in share repurchases approximate to 1 point improvement in ROCE. \n We expect to achieve expense savings from multiple areas, including: the remaining $350 million of savings yet to be realized from AIG 200; roughly $300 million of corporate GOE and approximately $400 million of interest expense that will be transferred to Corebridge; an additional expense savings as we transition AIG to a leaner operating model. Additionally, we've seen a 26 basis point yield uplift in the fixed maturity and loan portfolios in the past 2 quarters. Over time, we expect the yield uplift from net investment income could add 1 to 2 points to ROCE. \n We are confident about delivering on our 10% plus ROCE commitment, and we will continue to execute on a prudent capital management strategy, which will reduce the share count to 600 million to 650 million range while maintaining leverage at the 20% to 25% level post deconsolidation. \n With that, I will turn the call back over to you, Peter. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Thank you, Shane. And operator, we're ready for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. [Operator Instructions] \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Operator, maybe we'll go to the next one in the queue, and then we'll come back to Elyse. \nOperator: So our next question comes from John Heagney from Dowling & Partners. [Operator Instructions] \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Do you want to try the next one in the queue, operator, please? \nOperator: Let's try J. Paul Newsome from Piper Sandler. \nJon Paul Newsome: Sorry about the confusion from the folks on the questions, hopefully, you can hear me. I actually wanted to ask you about sort of a little bit different broad M&A question about the turmoil in the market. I think, obviously, we've seen environments where there's quite a bit of change. And I don't know if you think or you're seeing maybe the sellers getting a little bit more willing to sell given the volatility of the environment, and just your general thoughts on M&A would be fantastic. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Yes. So let me first take a step back, thank you for the question, and talk a little bit about our capital management strategy. And as we've outlined in the past, that we're focused on putting additional capital in the subsidiaries for organic growth because we see great opportunities. We worked very hard on reducing leverage. So while we've leveraged up Corebridge, we've been redeeming debt at the AIG level, focused on returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases, and we'll look very hard at the dividend for 2023. \n And our view on M&A is, where there are compelling opportunities, I think you have seen weakness in this quarter in terms of some of the reporting. But our strategy is much more where it's compelling, where it's strategic. And I think if we use Glatfelter as an example, Glatfelter was a best-in-class program underwriter that had great distribution. We were not performing well in our Programs business. So we were able to reduce our position in programs and bring Glatfelter and Tony Campisi and the leadership team to AIG, and they just have thrived here together, where we've improved combined ratios, we've grown, and we've improved our overall performance. \n So I think we will look for ways. We don't really have portfolios that need to be rehabilitated like we would have the Programs 3 years ago, but we could find those bolt-ons and things that are additive to AIG, where we are both better from being together. So I think that's how we would think about acquisition in the sort of medium term. \nJon Paul Newsome: Fantastic. Shift to a different question, maybe some thoughts on Validus in the context -- in the reinsurance business, in the context of the broader steps that you folks have done to reduce CAT exposure and maybe a little bit about the trade-off. I mean -- because, obviously, the big achievements that you've done under AIG is reduce the CAT exposure immensely. And how do you think about sort of, as we go forward, the trade-off that there seems to be a lot of opportunities in property CAT, kind of exposed areas but especially in the reinsurance market. But obviously, you've managed that trade-off pretty aggressively in the past. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Yes. So I think the market that's in front of us is going to reward those who are disciplined leading up to it. We have been very thoughtful and careful about reducing aggregate where we felt we had too much in peak zones as well as too much exposed to natural catastrophes. So we've talked over time that we've reduced enormous limits over the period that we've been reunderwriting. \n Now on the AIG reassumed side, that's been just disciplined. We didn't like the risk-adjusted returns as we've cited in my prepared remarks, that we took down the aggregate by 60%. And I think the premiums, if you look on a gross basis in terms of CAT year-over-year, we're going to be down like 40%. And actually, some of that would be greater in North America. \n We will look at opportunities in terms of -- we have plenty of aggregate for CAT, but it'll all be what's the best risk-adjusted opportunities. I mean the good news is we have multiple entry points. So we have Lexington on an E&S basis. We have retail property capabilities across the world. We have a terrific syndicate in Talbot that can access specialty classes that are more first party. We have a tremendous global specialties business that did phenomenal, I think, in the quarter and showed their sort of global leadership. And then we have the assumed business for AIG Re, where there are opportunities to deploy capital there, we are going to be prepared. So I think that the market will be very good for us to deploy more property. But again, we'll be disciplined, and we'll see what really transpires over the next 60 to 90 days. Next question, please. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW. \nMeyer Shields: Great. Am I coming through? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Yes, Meyer. Good to talk to you. \nMeyer Shields: Fantastic. Okay. And Peter, just hoping you could talk a little bit about casualty loss trends because you mentioned property as one of the reasons for raising the overall trend 6.5%. And we obviously saw the financial lines issues that, at least superficially, could lead into other casualty lines. Can you sort of close the loop on that? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Sure. I'll ask Mark to provide more detail. I think what we do in our prepared remarks is say that we're looking at property, casualty, all of our lines and business in great detail. Really, what's been driving the upper end of the ranges up has been more the first-party business because of all the economic factors that are driving them. But Mark spends enormous time with the staff and the underwriting claims, looking at all the casualty trends as well. Mark, do you want to provide more detail, please? \nMark Lyons;Executive Vice President, Global Chief Actuary & Head of Portfolio Management: Sure. Peter, thank you. So yes, on the follow-up on that, Meyer, would be -- let's put it this way. The excess casualty loss cost trends are double digits. And the primary trends aren't too much lower than that, but they're single digits but on the upper end. So we think we've captured it in a pretty good fashion. But the incremental move from quarter-to-quarter, as Peter denoted, is marginally -- increases on the liability side, but it's mostly due to the much more apparent trends on the property loss cost side, which on a weighted average basis, drives it up. \nMeyer Shields: Okay. That's very helpful. The second question, I guess, in recent quarters, we've been hearing about increasing competition in, I guess, in excess public D&O, which seems a little bizarre. Are you seeing any other individual product lines where there's incremental softness? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Thanks, Meyer. Dave, why don't you talk a little bit about what we're seeing in D&O. We really are not seeing it in other lines to the extent that what's going on in D&O, but we've been very disciplined, and Dave could provide a little bit more context. \nDavid McElroy: Thank you, Peter and Meyer. Yes. The rates have rolled back after 4 years of cumulative increases north of 100% in public D&O. It's -- I'm not sure the logic path of that, okay? At the same time, we also have to discern different markets sitting inside what would be the public D&O. So primary versus first excess versus high excess versus Side A and classes and market cap differentiation, all those things have to be factored in. \n I think certainly, in our book, which has a weighting to primary, there's less pricing pressure in the primary. There's respect for the company that leads the tower, claims reputation, multinational and underwrite a reputation with distribution and clients. So that's a different piece, Meyer, that I'd say. \n Excess has been and will be a commodity product in many lines of business. D&O is showing up now. It often shows up in excess casualty and may show up in excess property. But right now, it's showing up in D&O. And once again, the risk matters, the account matters, the commoditization, it might be there, okay? It's -- I look at that as something maybe antithetical to the verticality in loss that's existing in the business and one that needs to be managed and managed by each individual company. And you will have that sort of a different portfolio that others may chase that down. And I would say that responsible markets will probably have a renewal retention that's lower in the excess capacity. And that will be showing up in future quarters. \n It does not make sense. I'll be very frank. The verticality of loss is real right now, whether in securities class actions or derivative cases. So it's just supply-demand competition. I think for our portfolio, we're confident because of the control that we have and the weighting that we have between primary and Side A that's tied to primary and the  financial strength of AIG that we will be there for the long duration claim. So with that, I'll turn it back. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. \nElyse Greenspan: Can you guys hear me? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Yes, Elyse. Yes. Sorry about the glitch. \nElyse Greenspan: No worries. So my first question, I know the timing of the deconsolidation depends upon secondary offerings of Corebridge. But when you do ultimately deconsolidate, do you envision at that point that General Insurance as a stand-alone entity will be running at a 10% ROE? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Yes, we do. I mean, again, like we've said, the timing of deconsolidation is subject to market conditions and the volatility in the market. But if you take that away and look at a normal course as to we get through 2023, when we deconsolidate, we expect we'll be, with all the variables that Shane outlined in the 10% ROE, we will be at that 10% ROE. \nElyse Greenspan: And then my second question is on the financial line adverse development. I know you guys mentioned part of it, right, is the multiyear covers that AIG used to write, but was there an impact on your current accident year picks as a pull forward of the charge? And if there wasn't, is it just because of the changes that you made in the business over the years? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Mark, would you take that one, please? \nMark Lyons;Executive Vice President, Global Chief Actuary & Head of Portfolio Management: Sure, Peter. Elyse, good to hear from you. So yes, that's a good question, Elyse, and it's actually the right question. So I guess think of it like this. Shane mentioned that we did $40 billion of reserves this quarter, that makes it 90% year-to-date, only 10% remaining. And the review was -- all our reviews have been comprehensive. But I would say particularly so this quarter, with improved actuarial methodologies but really augmented with a rigorous review of individual cases with the claims department, specifically focusing on downside risk that was more qualitatively, also incorporating, so I guess a couple of things. \n First, it would be that because of that concentration of real detail, the financial reserve position is strong, firstly. Secondly, as you mentioned the multiyear policies, yes, that's an impact and probably a larger impact than you might think, which kind of preceded Dave and the team. And that excess D&O and private not-for-profit are the major drivers as Peter and Shane highlighted. But I really do not see that as a follow forward into more recent accident years. \n And -- but let me just give you a few fact points on that. So Dave talked about it a bit indirectly, but I think more directly, from my point of view on risk selection, which is what it's really all about at the end of the day, back in 2017, 42% of our insurance -- or given that there was a class action -- security class action lawsuit, we had 42% of them on a primary insured basis, whereas now, it's 12%. So that's a clear risk selection difference. \n But from the severity point of view of how much capacity gets placed on those from -- it's an 80% reduction on capacity provided to those given that they had a security class action suit. So both elements of that, I think, are incredibly strong and point to the capacity deployment post those years, so more recently as well as the risk selection, which is the core to everything. \n But a couple of other quick things. I know you like stats, Elyse. So why do I think it -- especially on the levels that we say are more susceptible [ that caused it ]. So on primary not-for-profit, for example, when we look back at prior policy years, now it's close to accident years, which is the real driver of underwriting decisions and improvements, the loss ratio for policy year '21 at 18 months of development is 80% lower than the prior year. And on excess P&L, which is longer tail, you have a similar 80% reduction in the loss ratio. So all of these facts point to a much stronger book of business and increased confidence that what's the most recent accident years are -- is valid. So we're not seeing any change to those loss ratios. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Great. Thanks, Mark. Thanks, Elyse. Next question, operator. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Brian Meredith from UBS. \nBrian Meredith: Can you hear me? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Yes, Brian. Thank you. Nice to talk to you. \nBrian Meredith: Great. Awesome. Yes. Peter, I'm just curious, there's been a lot of debate about how the kind of rehardening here of the property market kind of affected the casualty markets. Just curious, your thoughts there in specifically casualty re and then on the primary side as well. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Thanks, Brian. Again, we will see as we get to 1/1 in terms of what the pricing environment will be. It will be led by property. I mean I talked about it in my prepared remarks, some of the capacity issues and how reinsurers decide to deploy their capital is going to be very disciplined. I do think on the primary side of casualty, there will be some impacts. We look at just the normal economic potential headwinds, but also just deploying capital. So it's not going to be a single -- just we're going to get rate on property and not pay attention to casualty. You're going to look at it in a holistic way. \n I think Dave and I have spent a lot of time on this, and we strongly believe that excess and surplus lines in casualty will grow more than admitted. On a same-store sale basis, meaning that the opportunities that exist today will find, I think, more growth in E&S and the specialty classes. And I think that the rate will reflect what the exposures are, and we would see the casualty lines being affected as well. But again, we'll see when we get into 2023. \nBrian Meredith: Great. And then my second question, I'm just curious, looking at your North American Commercial written premium growth. Given the rate and exposure that you guys are experiencing right now, I would have thought that you'd see close to double-digit growth in that line of -- in that area, not just 7%. Is there anything unusual happening there? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: No. Dave, why don't you add on in terms of what really happened in financial lines with M&A and IPO? But no, Brian, we saw very good growth. We outlined it in my prepared remarks, Lexington property, Glatfelter, Primary Casualty. So we saw real growth across North America and felt it was strong. Had a little bit of a headwind from financial lines just based on M&A and IPO. But Dave, maybe you can just cover that a little bit. \nDavid McElroy: Yes, Brian, I think when you unpack it and you really look at each of the key businesses, whether it's property or casualty or even our programs group and Glatfelter, there was strong growth. The vagaries of financial lines show up here, okay? It's always -- it's tied to the stock market. It's historically tied to the stock market. A lot of new business growth is tied to the stock market and particularly last year where you might have had a number of SPACs and IPOs, and they are nonrecurring in 2022. \n So -- and then there's a runoff business that's also tied to the stock market. So what we saw, it's really financial lines, and I would call it a financial lines disciplined underwriting. We weren't chasing anything into this quarter and therefore, the growth was down. We're confident around the book. But it's -- that's actually where you would say the underlying growth of a significant part of our portfolio wasn't showing up in 3Q for the right reasons, okay? The stock market is a dictate of  what happens in the opportunities in financial lines. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Thank you, Brian. I think we have time for one more question. \nOperator: And our final question will come from Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. \nTaylor Scott: First one I had for you is on the capital deployment commentary. Getting down to 600 million to 650 million share count, I just wanted to see if you could unpack sort of underlying assumptions that may be included in that. And maybe help us think through when we think about the excess capital you have today, potential Corebridge secondary proceeds. How would you think about debt reduction versus share repurchases and how that sort of triangulates to the 600 million to 650 million, if you could? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Yes. So thanks, Alex. We've talked about our capital management strategy over the past several quarters and focused on capital for growth, debt reduction, share repurchases. And as I said, going into 2023, we're going to focus on the dividend. The primary use of capital will be used for share repurchases and, again, like Corebridge, I think has done very well in a very challenging IPO market. We expect the value to continue to move in a very positive direction based on how strong the business is. And so I'm not going to get into like the P/E today versus the P/E of AIG, but think that the best use of capital over the foreseeable future is going to be to reduce share count to get us to the 600 million to 650 million range. \n Now if I could spend 2 seconds on outlining what we've done since we've announced Blackstone in July of 2021, so you go back into early third quarter of last year and we set up Corebridge's financial structure. Not only did we do the IPO of 12.4% but set up their structure of $9.4 billion of debt, $1.7 billion of parent liquidity. During that period, we've reduced ongoing debt at AIG by approximately $12 billion, including the $1.8 billion make-whole in October. We paid common and preferred dividends of $1.3 billion during that period of time. We've also repurchased over 100 million of common shares, which is over $6 billion, and we put around $2 billion of capital in our subsidiaries for growth. \n So that's a lot of capital deployment. All of it is set up to strengthen the balance sheet, strengthen AIG's strategic positioning as well as making sure that we can continue to put the capital in the subsidiaries to drive organic growth. So we're really pleased where we are, and we think that the path forward with the secondary offerings will put us even in a stronger position. \nTaylor Scott: Got it. That's helpful. And maybe as a follow-up question, just on reinsurance costs, is there anything you can tell us about your spend on your natural CAT reinsurance program as it stands today? And I appreciate that you probably don't want to provide too much and tip your hand one way or the other in terms of the way you'll work through negotiations on that next year. But any way to help us think through the current cost? And anything we should consider when thinking about the materiality of that headed into a harder reinsurance market? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Yes. I mean the first thing I would say is AIG is not an index of the market rhetoric. We are very different in terms of how we purchase reinsurance just based on the size and scale, geographic diversity, different products. And so like when reinsurers deploy capital -- and that's why I say we have very strategic relationships because there's enormous continuity on our programs year-over-year even when we change structures. So I think that we've gotten commitments from all of our major reinsurers to be able to deploy the same amount of capital to the extent we need it for our property CAT. That's number one. \n Number two is that the portfolio has changed. I mean when you are continuing to reduce gross exposures, you don't always need the same structures. And so I think we changed the structure in '22, which was to buy sort of global occurrence that sits above our per occurrence layers across the world and reduce the aggregate limit. And so we're looking at structures right now. I mean I think you're going to get -- no matter who you speak to, the truth will be it's going to be a very late renewal season. Retro needs to be put together. Nobody is quoting now. There's not going to be any firm order terms for quite some time. And I think that we're just going to have to work through the market. \n But I just don't think that AIG is going to be in a detrimental position just based on our portfolio structure, partnership and actually our performance. And I think the reinsurers would say, you have to ask them, but what they tell me is that we've exceeded expectations on all the variables in terms of the commitments we've made in terms of the underwriting, and that's on property and casualty. So I think we'll be very well positioned and we'll provide updates as we get further along into the renewal season.\n Okay. Yes. I want to thank everybody today for your time, and I hope everybody has a great day. Thank you. \nOperator: And once again, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

So that's a clear risk selection difference. \n But from the severity point of view of how much capacity gets placed on those from -- it's an 80% reduction on capacity provided to those given that they had a security class action suit. So both elements of that, I think, are incredibly strong and point to the capacity deployment post those years, so more recently as well as the risk selection, which is the core to everything. \n But a couple of other quick things. I know you like stats, Elyse. So why do I think it -- especially on the levels that we say are more susceptible [ that caused it ]. So on primary not-for-profit, for example, when we look back at prior policy years, now it's close to accident years, which is the real driver of underwriting decisions and improvements, the loss ratio for policy year '21 at 18 months of development is 80% lower than the prior year. And on excess P&L, which is longer tail, you have a similar 80% reduction in the loss ratio. So all of these facts point to a much stronger book of business and increased confidence that what's the most recent accident years are -- is valid. So we're not seeing any change to those loss ratios."

            "content": "Thank you, Peter and Meyer. Yes. The rates have rolled back after 4 years of cumulative increases north of 100% in public D&O. It's -- I'm not sure the logic path of that, okay? At the same time, we also have to discern different markets sitting inside what would be the public D&O. So primary versus first excess versus high excess versus Side A and classes and market cap differentiation, all those things have to be factored in. \n I think certainly, in our book, which has a weighting to primary, there's less pricing pressure in the primary. There's respect for the company that leads the tower, claims reputation, multinational and underwrite a reputation with distribution and clients. So that's a different piece, Meyer, that I'd say. \n Excess has been and will be a commodity product in many lines of business. D&O is showing up now. It often shows up in excess casualty and may show up in excess property. But right now, it's showing up in D&O. And once again, the risk matters, the account matters, the commoditization, it might be there, okay? It's -- I look at that as something maybe antithetical to the verticality in loss that's existing in the business and one that needs to be managed and managed by each individual company. And you will have that sort of a different portfolio that others may chase that down. And I would say that responsible markets will probably have a renewal retention that's lower in the excess capacity. And that will be showing up in future quarters. \n It does not make sense. I'll be very frank. The verticality of loss is real right now, whether in securities class actions or derivative cases. So it's just supply-demand competition. I think for our portfolio, we're confident because of the control that we have and the weighting that we have between primary and Side A that's tied to primary and the  financial strength of AIG that we will be there for the long duration claim. So with that, I'll turn it back. Yes, Brian, I think when you unpack it and you really look at each of the key businesses, whether it's property or casualty or even our programs group and Glatfelter, there was strong growth. The vagaries of financial lines show up here, okay? It's always -- it's tied to the stock market. It's historically tied to the stock market. A lot of new business growth is tied to the stock market and particularly last year where you might have had a number of SPACs and IPOs, and they are nonrecurring in 2022. \n So -- and then there's a runoff business that's also tied to the stock market. So what we saw, it's really financial lines, and I would call it a financial lines disciplined underwriting. We weren't chasing anything into this quarter and therefore, the growth was down. We're confident around the book. But it's -- that's actually where you would say the underlying growth of a significant part of our portfolio wasn't showing up in 3Q for the right reasons, okay? The stock market is a dictate of  what happens in the opportunities in financial lines."

            "name": "Peter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO",
            "content": "Thank you, Quentin. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review our third quarter financial results, which I'm pleased to report were very strong, along with the excellent progress we've made on our strategic priorities. Following my remarks, Shane will provide more detail on the third quarter financial results, and then we'll take questions. Kevin Hogan, David McElroy and Mark Lyons will join us for the Q&A portion of today's call. \n The third quarter represented an inflection point for AIG, with important milestones achieved across the organization. Our team once again demonstrated its ability to execute on significant strategic initiatives that position AIG for a strong future, to apply discipline and the successful execution of these initiatives and to achieve high-quality outcomes even against a backdrop of very complicated capital and insurance markets. \n Before I cover the third quarter in more detail, I'd like to comment on the successful Corebridge Financial IPO, which we completed in mid-September despite very challenging equity capital market conditions. On our second quarter earnings call, we explained that volatility in the capital markets was significantly elevated and that attempting to complete an IPO at that time would not have been in the best interest of AIG, Corebridge or our stakeholders. \n As a result, we decided to defer the IPO and revisit timing in the third quarter. We knew that there would be limited open windows and remain committed to completing a transaction as soon as we believed an appropriate opportunity was available. Throughout the summer, our team did a remarkable job and worked diligently on the operational separation of Corebridge from AIG as well as to prepare the business for a successful IPO. \n As we noted on our last call, we had already increased the targeted savings program at Corebridge from an initial range of $200 million to $300 million to $400 million within 2 to 3 years. With the additional time available pre-IPO, the business accelerated certain actions and is now expected to deliver run rate savings of over $100 million by the end of 2022, ahead of our original schedule. \n We were also prepared to secure the capital structure of Corebridge prior to the IPO and access the debt markets in late summer during a short window when conditions became more favorable. In August, Corebridge issued $1 billion of hybrid debt securities and in early September drew down on a $1.5 billion bank facility to complete its initial capital structure. Using part of the net proceeds from these debt transactions, Corebridge closed out the remaining $1.9 billion due to AIG under a promissory note. \n Throughout this time, we also engage in continuous discussions with our financial and other advisers about equity market conditions, investor sentiment and our ability to execute the IPO in a complicated market. While equity markets remain uncertain, volatility was not as extreme leading up to Labor Day. We were confident we could complete the IPO within an acceptable valuation range, and we continue to believe it was very important for the future of AIG and Corebridge to establish Corebridge as a public company in 2022. \n Throughout the third quarter, we also made significant progress in the implementation of a new investment management model for AIG and Corebridge. As you know, in mid-2021, we finalized a strategic partnership with Blackstone, which includes the transfer of $50 billion of Corebridge AUM to Blackstone, with that number growing to $92.5 billion over 6 years. \n In addition, earlier this year, we announced a partnership with BlackRock, under which we will transfer up to $150 billion of liquid assets from both AIG and Corebridge. To date, we have transferred $100 billion of assets, with $37 billion moving from AIG and $63 billion moving from Corebridge. The complexity of operationally separating Corebridge from AIG as well as implementing our new operating model for investment management cannot be understated. \n Keep in mind, these businesses have been in a combined structure for over 2 decades, with aspects of each business shifting over time between segments until just a few years ago. And until we announced our intention to separate Corebridge from AIG in late 2020, investments was a stand-alone unit at AIG, servicing all businesses across the organization. Our partnerships with Blackstone and BlackRock enable us to accelerate the reshaping of our investment portfolios. \n With respect to the financial commitments Corebridge made as part of the IPO, I'd like to reiterate them as they too will create significant value for shareholders over time. We continue to expect Corebridge to pay $600 million in annual dividends, with its first quarterly dividend of $148 million declared 15 days after the IPO close and already paid, to have the financial flexibility to repurchase shares or reduce AIG's ownership stake as early as the second quarter of 2023 and to achieve a return on equity of 12% to 14% over the next 24 months. \n Completing the Corebridge IPO within a very narrow window was a testament to the careful preparation, hard work and dedication of our teams at AIG and Corebridge and to the quality of the business. This was a major accomplishment for our teams, and we are all very proud of the outcome. \n Turning to other highlights in the third quarter. Adjusted after-tax net income per diluted common share was $0.66. General Insurance delivered very strong performance and continued profitability improvement despite significant natural CATs in the quarter. The accident year combined ratio, ex CATs, was 88.4%, a 210 basis point improvement year-over-year and the 17th consecutive quarter of improvement. \n This result was primarily due to Global Commercial, which had an excellent quarter, with an accident year combined ratio, ex CATs, of 83%, a 590 basis point improvement year-over-year, driven by International Commercial, which had an impressive 80.4% accident year combined ratio, ex CATs. The accident year combined ratio was 98.2%, a 200 basis point improvement year-over-year. The calendar year combined ratio was 97.3%, a 240 basis point improvement year-over-year. \n CAT losses in the third quarter were $600 million, or 9.8 points of the combined ratio. Shane will break this number down for you in his remarks. Our CAT total includes losses from AIG Re related to Hurricane Ian, which came in at $125 million. This result reflects the terrific work the team has done to reduce peak zone exposure in our assumed reinsurance business, particularly in Florida, where we've reduced limits deployed by approximately 60% since 2018 and have minimal exposure to Florida domestic insurers. \n Considering Hurricane Ian and other CATs in the third quarter, our CAT losses validate the quality of our underwriting, our reinsurance strategy and our ability to successfully manage volatility. With respect to PYD, there was a favorable release in the third quarter of $72 million or 90 basis points of the calendar year combined ratio. \n In Life and Retirement, the business had another quarter of strong sales with premiums and deposits coming in at approximately $9 billion, up from $7.2 billion in the prior year, with positive year-over-year growth in each of its 4 business segments. Effective capital management remains a priority for AIG. In the third quarter, we repurchased $1.3 billion of common stock and paid $247 million of dividends. We also announced $1.8 billion of debt repayments, which we commenced in the third quarter and closed last week, further strengthening our balance sheet. And lastly, AIG ended the third quarter with $6.5 billion of parent liquidity. \n Now let me provide additional detail on General Insurance and the continued, sustained improvement and very good absolute performance in our underwriting. When referring to gross and net premiums written, note that all numbers are on an FX-adjusted basis. Gross premiums written increased 5% to $9.2 billion, with Global Commercial growing 8% and Global Personal decreasing 3%. Net premiums written increased 3% to $6.4 billion. \n The growth was in our Global Commercial business, which grew 6%, with Global Personal decreasing 4%. North America Commercial net premiums written increased 7%, and International Commercial net premiums written increased 5% or approximately 8%, excluding the impact of nonrenewal and cancellations related to known Russia exposure. \n In North America Commercial, we saw very strong growth in net premiums written in Lexington led by wholesale property, retail property and Glatfelter. In International Commercial, we also saw strong growth in net premiums written in Global Specialty, led by International Specialty, marine and energy as well as property. \n In Global Commercial, we also had very strong renewal retention of 85% in our in-force portfolio, with North America up 400 basis points year-over-year to 86% and international at 85%. As a reminder, we calculate renewal retention prior to the impact of rate and exposure changes. And across Global Commercial, our new business continues to be strong. North America new business was $458 million led by Lexington. International new business was $474 million led by specialty. \n Turning to rate. Momentum continued in North America Commercial with overall rate increases of 9% in the third quarter, excluding workers' compensation. Areas within North America Commercial achieved double-digit rate increases. These included Lexington, which increased 20%; cyber, which increased 32%; and excess casualty, which increased 12%. International Commercial rate increases were 6%, driven by Talbot, EMEA, Asia Pacific, each of which increased 10%. \n Our team analyzes loss cost trends every quarter. On our last call, we indicated that our loss cost trend view in the second quarter for North America Commercial lines had migrated upwards to 6%. Due to inflationary and other related factors that have resulted in an increase in property loss costs, we are increasing our aggregate loss cost trend to 6.5%, both in North America and international. Overall, we continue to receive rate above loss cost trends, which contributes to margin expansion on a written basis. \n Moving to Global Personal Insurance, we continue our work across the portfolio to prioritize growth in A&H, to reposition our capabilities in Japan Personal and to transform our North America high net worth portfolio. Starting with North America, personal net premiums written declined 11%, driven by warranty as well as our ongoing reshaping of our high net worth business that we've discussed on prior calls. \n We continue to make progress in our high net worth business by reducing peak zone aggregation, improving the overall quality of the portfolio, transitioning a portion of the portfolio where appropriate to excess and surplus lines and enhancing the value we offer to clients. Third quarter results reflect this repositioning, with North America's gross and net premiums written declining as we continue to reduce exposures and increase reinsurance sessions to mitigate volatility. \n North America Personal Insurance's premium declines were partially offset by continued momentum in individual travel and Personal A&H. In International Personal, net premiums written declined 2% due to a reduction in warranty that was partially offset by a rebound in individual travel as well as growth in A&H, which is our largest and most profitable International Personal portfolio. \n One item to note in the International Personal Insurance third quarter accident year loss ratio is that it reflects approximately $100 million of losses related to COVID claims in Japan and, to a lesser extent, Taiwan. These losses were primarily due to the Japanese government instituting a policy relating to deemed hospitalizations resulting from COVID, which impacted our A&H book. \n This government policy was revised in the third quarter, and as a result, we expect the issue to have a de minimis impact in future quarters, starting with the fourth quarter of this year. Additionally, some of these losses related to cleanup expense benefits offered to small businesses, which AIG no longer provides. \n Turning to PYD, we conducted our annual review of approximately 75% of pre-ADC loss reserves in the third quarter. We applied conservative assumptions in this review as we believe it is appropriate to be prudent given current economic conditions. As a result of our review, we recorded $72 million of net favorable development for the third quarter or 90 basis points of the loss ratio. This reflects $42 million of amortization from the ADC combined with $30 million of other favorable development. \n Our international operations were favorable in every region totaling $328 million, whereas North America was unfavorable by $256 million. Furthermore, in North America, virtually every line of business was favorable, except for U.S. financial lines, which was unfavorable by $660 million net of the ADC, predominantly in accident years 2018 and 2019 and, to a lesser extent, 2020. \n Let me unpack the drivers of unfavorable development in U.S. financial lines a bit more because it's been an area of focus for us for several years given AIG's history in this line of business. The unfavorable development was primarily driven by excess D&O written out of both the U.S. and our Bermuda business. And while there was some movement on the primary side, the excess book was the most significant driver. D&O prior year emergence continues to be driven by large losses. Many from security class actions and earlier accident years also experienced stacking exposures where primary mid-excess and high-excess policies were all exposed on the same insured. \n This issue is similar to what we saw across the portfolio when we first started our remediation strategy. The company had too much vertical limit on a per account basis. As we've discussed on prior calls, our underwriting strategy and ventilation standards were completely overhauled over the last few years, including U.S. financial lines to prevent stacking and overexposure to anyone insured. And we've dramatically reduced limits deployed on individual policies, obtained tighter terms and conditions and achieved higher attachment points on primary limits. Shane will provide more detail on PYDs in his remarks. \n Now I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about Hurricane Ian, which was a very tragic event on a human level that also left devastating physical damage. AIG rapidly deployed significant resources to the affected areas, providing immediate support and infrastructure to help individuals, businesses and communities rebuild. Hurricane Ian is projected to be the second largest insured natural CAT loss in U.S. history. \n There remain a considerable number of variables contributing to industry ultimate losses, but based on what we know today, total insurable losses are expected to be in the range of $50 billion to $60 billion. For context, Hurricane Katrina and Irma, the first and third largest U.S. natural CAT losses in the last 100 years, are estimated at $85 billion and $40 billion of insured losses, respectively, on an inflation-adjusted basis. \n While Hurricane Ian will have an impact on the broader insurance, reinsurance and retro markets, we believe AIG is well positioned. Very importantly, we have strong and strategic relationships with our major reinsurers, and we are confident in our ability to obtain similar levels of capacity for 2023 as we did in 2022. In addition, we've improved and continued to improve our portfolio, and therefore, the reinsurance we require will reflect this during 2023. And we see significant growth opportunities across the market, especially in the near term and for property specifically, and our significant financial flexibility will allow us to be nimble as we deploy capital at attractive risk-adjusted returns to Retail Property, wholesale property, Talbot, global specialties and AIG Re. \n With respect to the industry and markets more broadly, as we noted on our second quarter call, there are a few things you need to believe about the market prior to Ian in order to understand the impact Ian may have in the future. If you believe, as we do, that the retro market was already contracting from last year's available capacity, which itself was reduced from the prior year and the anticipated capital for 2023 was already going to further contract approximately 10%, the retro market and the property CAT market would have already been challenged even prior to Ian. \n In addition to reduced capacity over 2022, prior to Ian, there was also an expectation of increased retentions, more specific peril coverage as well as rate increases resulting from several factors including increased frequency and severity of CATs over the last several years. Keeping this context in mind, 2022 will be another year with over $100 billion in natural CAT industry losses. Prior to 2017, on an inflation-adjusted basis, there were only 2 years, 2005 and 2011, that had greater than $100 billion of global natural CAT losses. And in both of these years, losses were led by primary perils.  \n Since 2017, 5 of the last 6 years have had greater than $100 billion in global natural CAT losses, with the predominant portion of losses in the aggregate coming from secondary perils. Furthermore, other issues potentially impacting 1/1 capacity prior to Ian were the strengthening of the dollar, euro-denominated capacity likely decreasing due to currency devaluation, asset valuations, inflation and demand surge from the post pandemic economy, just to name a few. \n When considering the impact of Ian and the complexity it adds to already challenging market conditions, there are a few additional factors to consider. In Florida, residential total insured values have increased by more than 50% over the last 10 years. The significance of commercial losses, which will likely exceed 40% of the ultimate losses for Ian, compared to the average of prior natural catastrophes, where commercial losses were 30% of the ultimate loss. The prevalence of commercial losses exacerbates the complexity of CAT modeling generally and the resulting deficiencies regarding appropriate CAT load and pricing. \n When considering the modeled estimated output for losses related to Ian, for example, commercial losses were deficient by 2.5x and personal by 1.5x after adjusting for inflation and other factors. Furthermore, when major CATs occur in Florida, a disproportionate amount of the loss finds its way to the reinsurance market because of the proportional and low attaching excess to loss placements completed by Florida domestic insurers as their capital structures require significant reinsurance. Available reinsurance capacity is forecasted to be the lowest aggregate limit available in over a decade, making conditions in the property CAT reinsurance market even more challenging. \n Now turning to Life and Retirement. Adjusted pretax income was $589 million, decreasing from $877 million in the prior year period, mainly due to lower alternative investment income and lower call and tender income. There were no significant reserve adjustments arising out of the third quarter actuarial assumption review. As I mentioned earlier, Life and Retirement had excellent sales with premiums and deposits of approximately $9 billion, up 23% year-over-year. Sales of annuities over the course of 2022 have benefited from our relationship with Blackstone with $5 billion of assets originated year-to-date in private ABS, direct credit lending and structured assets. \n While our strategic partnership with Blackstone is still in the early days, the quality and the performance of the portfolio relative to what the business could have done on its own are very encouraging. Sequential improvement in fixed income and loan portfolio yields accelerated, with a 24 basis point improvement in base investment yields. Year-over-year fixed income and loan portfolio yields also improved 8 basis points, confirming the business has surpassed year-over-year yield compression for the first time in recent memory. Shane will provide more information on the Life and Retirement segment and Corebridge in his remarks. \n Shifting to capital management, we continue to be balanced and disciplined as we maintain appropriate levels of capital in our subsidiaries for profitable growth opportunities across our global portfolio as well as reduced levels of debt while returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. Looking ahead, with respect to share buybacks, we have $4.3 billion remaining on our current share repurchase authorization and expect to end 2022 with over $5 billion of share repurchases for the full year. And balance sheet actions we've taken put us in a position of strength with significant financial flexibility that AIG has not had in many years. \n As we look to 2023, our lockup agreement with the underwriters of the IPO with respect to Corebridge common stock expires in March. Subject to ordinary course blackout periods, this means that our likely windows for a secondary offering of Corebridge common stock in the first half of 2023 will be in mid- to late March as well as mid-May to late June. Our current expectation is that the net proceeds will largely be deployed to share repurchases. \n While we remain committed to consistently returning capital through share repurchases for the foreseeable future, we believe there will be attractive organic growth opportunities in General Insurance and AIG Re given current market dislocations that may prove compelling. Lastly, as we discussed on our second quarter call, we continue to expect that post deconsolidation of Corebridge, AIG will achieve a return on common equity at or above 10%. Shane will provide more details in his remarks. \n As we approach year-end and plan for 2023, our path forward is clear with General Insurance solidifying its position as a global market leader, the deconsolidation and eventual full separation of Corebridge firmly underway and a significantly strengthened balance sheet. With that, Shane, I'll turn the call over to you. Thank you, Shane. And operator, we're ready for questions. Operator, maybe we'll go to the next one in the queue, and then we'll come back to Elyse. Do you want to try the next one in the queue, operator, please? Yes. So let me first take a step back, thank you for the question, and talk a little bit about our capital management strategy. And as we've outlined in the past, that we're focused on putting additional capital in the subsidiaries for organic growth because we see great opportunities. We worked very hard on reducing leverage. So while we've leveraged up Corebridge, we've been redeeming debt at the AIG level, focused on returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases, and we'll look very hard at the dividend for 2023. \n And our view on M&A is, where there are compelling opportunities, I think you have seen weakness in this quarter in terms of some of the reporting. But our strategy is much more where it's compelling, where it's strategic. And I think if we use Glatfelter as an example, Glatfelter was a best-in-class program underwriter that had great distribution. We were not performing well in our Programs business. So we were able to reduce our position in programs and bring Glatfelter and Tony Campisi and the leadership team to AIG, and they just have thrived here together, where we've improved combined ratios, we've grown, and we've improved our overall performance. \n So I think we will look for ways. We don't really have portfolios that need to be rehabilitated like we would have the Programs 3 years ago, but we could find those bolt-ons and things that are additive to AIG, where we are both better from being together. So I think that's how we would think about acquisition in the sort of medium term. Yes. So I think the market that's in front of us is going to reward those who are disciplined leading up to it. We have been very thoughtful and careful about reducing aggregate where we felt we had too much in peak zones as well as too much exposed to natural catastrophes. So we've talked over time that we've reduced enormous limits over the period that we've been reunderwriting. \n Now on the AIG reassumed side, that's been just disciplined. We didn't like the risk-adjusted returns as we've cited in my prepared remarks, that we took down the aggregate by 60%. And I think the premiums, if you look on a gross basis in terms of CAT year-over-year, we're going to be down like 40%. And actually, some of that would be greater in North America. \n We will look at opportunities in terms of -- we have plenty of aggregate for CAT, but it'll all be what's the best risk-adjusted opportunities. I mean the good news is we have multiple entry points. So we have Lexington on an E&S basis. We have retail property capabilities across the world. We have a terrific syndicate in Talbot that can access specialty classes that are more first party. We have a tremendous global specialties business that did phenomenal, I think, in the quarter and showed their sort of global leadership. And then we have the assumed business for AIG Re, where there are opportunities to deploy capital there, we are going to be prepared. So I think that the market will be very good for us to deploy more property. But again, we'll be disciplined, and we'll see what really transpires over the next 60 to 90 days. Next question, please. Yes, Meyer. Good to talk to you. Sure. I'll ask Mark to provide more detail. I think what we do in our prepared remarks is say that we're looking at property, casualty, all of our lines and business in great detail. Really, what's been driving the upper end of the ranges up has been more the first-party business because of all the economic factors that are driving them. But Mark spends enormous time with the staff and the underwriting claims, looking at all the casualty trends as well. Mark, do you want to provide more detail, please? Thanks, Meyer. Dave, why don't you talk a little bit about what we're seeing in D&O. We really are not seeing it in other lines to the extent that what's going on in D&O, but we've been very disciplined, and Dave could provide a little bit more context. Yes, Elyse. Yes. Sorry about the glitch. Yes, we do. I mean, again, like we've said, the timing of deconsolidation is subject to market conditions and the volatility in the market. But if you take that away and look at a normal course as to we get through 2023, when we deconsolidate, we expect we'll be, with all the variables that Shane outlined in the 10% ROE, we will be at that 10% ROE. Mark, would you take that one, please? Great. Thanks, Mark. Thanks, Elyse. Next question, operator. Yes, Brian. Thank you. Nice to talk to you. Thanks, Brian. Again, we will see as we get to 1/1 in terms of what the pricing environment will be. It will be led by property. I mean I talked about it in my prepared remarks, some of the capacity issues and how reinsurers decide to deploy their capital is going to be very disciplined. I do think on the primary side of casualty, there will be some impacts. We look at just the normal economic potential headwinds, but also just deploying capital. So it's not going to be a single -- just we're going to get rate on property and not pay attention to casualty. You're going to look at it in a holistic way. \n I think Dave and I have spent a lot of time on this, and we strongly believe that excess and surplus lines in casualty will grow more than admitted. On a same-store sale basis, meaning that the opportunities that exist today will find, I think, more growth in E&S and the specialty classes. And I think that the rate will reflect what the exposures are, and we would see the casualty lines being affected as well. But again, we'll see when we get into 2023. No. Dave, why don't you add on in terms of what really happened in financial lines with M&A and IPO? But no, Brian, we saw very good growth. We outlined it in my prepared remarks, Lexington property, Glatfelter, Primary Casualty. So we saw real growth across North America and felt it was strong. Had a little bit of a headwind from financial lines just based on M&A and IPO. But Dave, maybe you can just cover that a little bit. Thank you, Brian. I think we have time for one more question. Yes. So thanks, Alex. We've talked about our capital management strategy over the past several quarters and focused on capital for growth, debt reduction, share repurchases. And as I said, going into 2023, we're going to focus on the dividend. The primary use of capital will be used for share repurchases and, again, like Corebridge, I think has done very well in a very challenging IPO market. We expect the value to continue to move in a very positive direction based on how strong the business is. And so I'm not going to get into like the P/E today versus the P/E of AIG, but think that the best use of capital over the foreseeable future is going to be to reduce share count to get us to the 600 million to 650 million range. \n Now if I could spend 2 seconds on outlining what we've done since we've announced Blackstone in July of 2021, so you go back into early third quarter of last year and we set up Corebridge's financial structure. Not only did we do the IPO of 12.4% but set up their structure of $9.4 billion of debt, $1.7 billion of parent liquidity. During that period, we've reduced ongoing debt at AIG by approximately $12 billion, including the $1.8 billion make-whole in October. We paid common and preferred dividends of $1.3 billion during that period of time. We've also repurchased over 100 million of common shares, which is over $6 billion, and we put around $2 billion of capital in our subsidiaries for growth. \n So that's a lot of capital deployment. All of it is set up to strengthen the balance sheet, strengthen AIG's strategic positioning as well as making sure that we can continue to put the capital in the subsidiaries to drive organic growth. So we're really pleased where we are, and we think that the path forward with the secondary offerings will put us even in a stronger position. Yes. I mean the first thing I would say is AIG is not an index of the market rhetoric. We are very different in terms of how we purchase reinsurance just based on the size and scale, geographic diversity, different products. And so like when reinsurers deploy capital -- and that's why I say we have very strategic relationships because there's enormous continuity on our programs year-over-year even when we change structures. So I think that we've gotten commitments from all of our major reinsurers to be able to deploy the same amount of capital to the extent we need it for our property CAT. That's number one. \n Number two is that the portfolio has changed. I mean when you are continuing to reduce gross exposures, you don't always need the same structures. And so I think we changed the structure in '22, which was to buy sort of global occurrence that sits above our per occurrence layers across the world and reduce the aggregate limit. And so we're looking at structures right now. I mean I think you're going to get -- no matter who you speak to, the truth will be it's going to be a very late renewal season. Retro needs to be put together. Nobody is quoting now. There's not going to be any firm order terms for quite some time. And I think that we're just going to have to work through the market. \n But I just don't think that AIG is going to be in a detrimental position just based on our portfolio structure, partnership and actually our performance. And I think the reinsurers would say, you have to ask them, but what they tell me is that we've exceeded expectations on all the variables in terms of the commitments we've made in terms of the underwriting, and that's on property and casualty. So I think we'll be very well positioned and we'll provide updates as we get further along into the renewal season.\n Okay. Yes. I want to thank everybody today for your time, and I hope everybody has a great day. Thank you."

This conference is being recorded.\n Now at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead. \nQuentin McMillan: Thanks very much, and good morning. Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by the applicable securities laws, AIG is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements if circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change.\n Additionally, today's remarks may refer to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at www.aig.com.\n With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review our second quarter results. AIG had an excellent quarter with strong momentum continuing across all of our strategic, financial and operational objectives. I could not be more pleased with the exceptional results in General Insurance. And Life and Retirement again delivered good results despite very challenging equity market conditions, significant volatility and other headwinds. \n As you saw in our press release, adjusted after-tax net income per diluted common share was $1.19.\n General Insurance achieved a calendar year combined ratio of 87.4%, the first sub-90 quarter and best result this business has achieved in over 15 years. The accident year combined ratio, excluding CATs, was 88.5%, a 260 basis point improvement year-over-year and the 16th consecutive quarter of improvement. And the accident year combined ratio, excluding CATs, in Global Commercial was 85.3%, an improvement of 400 basis points year-over-year.\n Consistent with our strategy to manage volatility, catastrophe losses were very modest in the quarter, coming in at $121 million or 1.8% of a combined ratio. Life and Retirement has strong fixed annuity sales with over $1.3 billion in deposits for the second straight quarter, which benefited from the origination capabilities of Blackstone.\n AIG returned nearly $2 billion to shareholders in the second quarter through $1.7 billion of common stock repurchases and $256 million of dividends. In addition, we are on track to buy back at least $1 billion of common stock in the third quarter. We ended the second quarter with $5.6 billion of parent liquidity, which Shane will go through in more detail in his remarks.\n On today's call, I will provide more detail on 5 topics. First, I will provide an update on the IPO of our Life and Retirement business, which will be known as Corebridge Financial once the company is public, and discuss why we chose not to proceed with the IPO in the second quarter. I will also review the significant progress we've continued to make on various aspects of the separation of Corebridge as we prepare this business to be a stand-alone public company. \n Second, as a follow-on to the IPO discussion, I will review Life and Retirement results where, as I mentioned, the core business showed continued resilience and solid performance despite headwinds largely driven from a reduction in net investment income. \n Third, I will review the performance of General Insurance, where underwriting excellence continues to produce outstanding results with strong profitability and top line growth, particularly in our Global Commercial portfolio.\n Fourth, I will provide an update on AIG 200, where we achieved critical milestones and delivered on our stated goal of $1 billion in exit run rate savings 6 months ahead of schedule. \n Lastly, I'll provide an update on capital management, particularly with respect to stock buybacks and debt reduction.\n Following my remarks, Shane will provide more detail on the quarter and then we will take questions. Mark Lyons, David McElroy and Kevin Hogan will join us for the Q&A portion of today's call.\n As you can see, our team has accomplished a lot on many fronts. Before expanding on our financial and operating performance, I want to address the status of the Corebridge IPO. Our base case had always been to complete the IPO in the second quarter, subject to regulatory approvals and market conditions. In deciding whether to launch the initial public offering in May or June, we weighed several variables, which were all market-related, some specific to Corebridge and some more macro level. These included equity market conditions and particularly the trading values of companies in the Life and Retirement sector that we consider to be the most comparable to Corebridge.\n In the second quarter, equity markets were down 16% with only 3 weeks seeing positive market returns, the VIX, which was above 30 resulting in extremely elevated market volatility and feedback we received from advisers, analysts and many potential institutional investors following the public filing of the S-1. While completing the IPO is a significant priority for us and something we are laser-focused on, we believe this is an attractive business and did not want to execute a transaction that would be detrimental to stakeholders in the long run. Absent something we don't see today, we remain ready to execute on the IPO, subject to regulatory approvals and market conditions. And the next window will be in September. \n In the meantime, throughout the summer, we continue to make significant progress to position the business for long-term success. I'll highlight 3 areas of focus. One, expanding on our plan to achieve expense savings at Corebridge. Last quarter, we estimated these savings to be in the range of $200 million to $300 million, but we now expect to generate closer to $400 million of savings over the next 3 years with the majority of the run rate savings to be achieved in the next 24 months.\n Two, progressing the implementation of a new operating model for our investments unit. This includes our strategic partnership with Blackstone announced in July of 2021 and our partnership with BlackRock, where we began moving assets under management in the second quarter of this year pursuant to the arrangement we announced in late March.\n And three, planning our transition to BlackRock's Aladdin platform, which will replace aging and end-of-life technology infrastructure and provide enhanced risk analytics and reporting. We continue to expect that Corebridge will pay an annual dividend of $600 million post-IPO that will have a payout ratio of 60% to 65%, and that it will achieve a return on equity of 12% to 14% over the next 24 months.\n Now turning to Life and Retirement's performance in the second quarter. As I mentioned earlier, adjusted pretax income was $563 million, decreasing from the prior year period due to lower NII, which was driven by lower alternative investment income, accelerated DAC amortization and an increase in SOP reserves. Given the pending IPO, we remain somewhat limited in what we can say about the business, but let me provide some details from the second quarter. The core business produced strong sales in fixed annuities, which were up 48% to $1.4 billion and strong sales in indexed annuities, which were flat at $1.5 billion.\n In Group Retirement, contributions grew 1%, nonrecurring deposits grew 4% and enrollments were up 11%. Second quarter deposits of $1.8 billion were strong with base net investment spread growing 4 basis points sequentially due to the higher interest rate environment. The Life and Retirement balance sheet and capital position remains strong with an RBC ratio of 415% to 425%, still above our target ranges.\n Now let me provide more detail on our second quarter results in General Insurance, where we continue to drive improved financial performance. Gross premiums written increased 5% on an FX-adjusted basis to $9.6 billion, with Global Commercial growing 8% and Global Personal decreasing 3%. \n Net premiums written increased 5% on an FX-adjusted basis to $6.9 billion. This growth was led by our Global Commercial business, which grew 8% with Global Personal decreasing 4%. \n Global Commercial net premiums written increased 10%, excluding AIG Re, where we have significantly reduced property CAT writings and exposure, particularly in the Southeast region of the U.S. \n North America Commercial net premiums written increased 10% or 14% excluding AIG Re. And international net premiums written increased 5% or 8% excluding the impact of nonrenewal and cancellations related to Russia exposure in each case on an FX-adjusted basis.\n In North America Commercial, we saw very strong growth in net premiums written: In Lexington, which grew 31% led by wholesale property, which was up 46%; retail property, which grew 17%; and our Canadian commercial business, which grew 10%.\n In International Commercial, on an FX-adjusted basis, we also saw strong growth in net premiums written: In Global Specialty, which grew 16% led by energy, which was up 20%; and marine, which was up 10%; North America Specialty, which grew 17%; and International Specialty, which grew 15%.\n In Global Commercial, we also had very strong renewal retention of 85% in our in-force portfolio, with North America up 200 basis points to 85% and International holding steady at a very strong 86%. As a reminder, we calculate renewal retention prior to the impact of rate and exposure changes. And across Global Commercial, our new business continues to be very strong, coming in slightly over $1 billion for the fifth consecutive quarter.\n North America's new business grew to $542 million led by Lexington. International new business was $466 million, slightly down year-over-year due to intentional actions we took in Talbot and in our Specialty business related to Russia, Ukraine.\n Turning to rate. Momentum continued in Global Commercial with overall rate increases of 7%. And in the aggregate, rate continued to exceed loss cost trends. This is the fourth consecutive year in which we're achieving rate above loss cost trends and where we are successfully driving margin expansion.\n North America Commercial achieved 7% rate increases with some areas achieving double-digit increases led by Lexington, which increased 18% with 17% in Lexington wholesale property; Financial Lines, where professional increased 34% led by cyber, which increased 52%; and excess casualty, which increased 10%.\n International commercial rate increases were 7% driven by Financial Lines, which increased 11%, including more than 47% rate increases in cyber; property, which increased 10%; and EMEA, which also increased 10%.\n Last quarter, we indicated that our loss cost trend view in the aggregate for North America Commercial had migrated upwards from 4% to 5%, mostly driven by shorter tail lines. And as a result, we moved the upper end of the range to 5.5%.\n In the second quarter, trends in casualty and other liability lines continue to show no obvious impact in either internal or external data to support a large move on loss cost, whereas property businesses have been more clearly affected. As a result, based on a review of more recent information, we again modified our view on loss cost trend to 6%. Loss cost trend represents the composite of frequency and severity. However, there is an additional mitigant to inflation built into rate decisions. Exposure trend, which we view as a partial offset to loss cost trend, reflects the additional premiums an insurer receives driven by growth in underlying inflation sensitive exposure basis. When taking this exposure mitigant into account, our current North America Commercial loss cost trend net of these inflationary exposure benefits is approximately 4%.\n Additionally, our North America Commercial accident year loss ratio, ex CAT, is booked at 63% year-to-date, which is consistent with pure actuarial rate over loss cost and exposure trends but is a pure numerical approach and does not reflect our improved risk selection and continued improvement in terms of conditions. Those benefits will emerge over time.\n As we discussed on prior calls, since 2018, we have implemented a clear ventilation strategy in our casualty, financial lines and property portfolios that directs our capacity deployment towards higher average attachment points, which is a strong defensive measure towards rising inflation. And this strategy continues today. We also implemented the strategy in our AIG risk management loss-sensitive workers' compensation business. And over the last few years, average deductibles have increased 30% to $1.3 million.\n Turning to Personal Lines. In North America Personal, net premiums written declined nearly 4% driven by a reduction in warranty, which was partially offset by a rebound in travel. In International Personal, net premiums written declined 4% on FX-adjusted basis also due to a reduction in warranty and partially offset by growth in accident and health and travel.\n Now I'd like to spend a few minutes on our high net worth business. This is a business we will continue to invest in where there are attractive opportunities for profitability improvement. Over the last 2 years and through the second quarter, we've already invested $140 million to improve digital workflow, data, a customer interface that will provide enhanced insight and value to distribution partners and policyholders. The actions we are taking are designed to position this business to be more balanced with less density and lower volatility in order to provide more sustainable financial results.\n Let me review some of the market dynamics impacting this business that have created significant complexity and the resulting actions we are taking to reposition the portfolio. Currently, the level of reinsurance we purchased and the commensurate model ceded profit is a headwind to net premiums written growth and combined ratio improvement. This has been intentional as we are not willing to take volatility on frequency or tail risk on CAT in our high net worth business.\n Adding to this, the inability to pass on increased loss and reinsurance costs through rate increases or limit management largely due to regulatory constraints further deteriorates margin in the short run. But we have made a deliberate decision to continue writing this business as we believe the trade-off is appropriate in the near term given the opportunity we see over the long term.\n And while each of our CAT-exposed businesses has different attributes, I don't see reinsurance costs for the high net worth market generally becoming less expensive for the foreseeable future, but instead, seeing it putting pressure on the segment. In fact, for a business that is primarily underwritten in peak zones with high total insured values, reinsurance costs will likely increase and, in some cases, materially.\n To understand the complexity of reinsurance for peak zones, you need to look no further than in what has happened in the retrocessional market over the last few years. While overall small market, retrocession provides approximately $60 billion of available limit across various structures, of which roughly $20 billion is indemnity-based for reinsurers with this capacity primarily supported by alternative capital. \n The dynamics in the retrocessional market over the last few years are important to understand because they have materially changed even though overall retrocessional capacity has remained flat since 2017. First, the cost of retrocession has increased significantly more than in the reinsurance industry on a risk-adjusted basis. Second, available capacity has shifted from predominantly aggregate to predominantly occurrence. Third, first event aggregate and lower attaching occurrence retrocession have been put under significant stress. Fourth, the retrocessional market return period attachment points have increased 50%. And fifth, compounded risk-adjusted rate changes have also increased by over 50%, even though retrocessional exposure is reduced compared to prior year.\n When you couple these factors with the additional adjustments going forward for inflation, model changes, trapped capital, you have a very complicated and challenging market. Additionally, if you review global insured net cat retrocessional losses over the last decade, 9 out of 10 years have had larger contributions from secondary peril aggregate losses than peak peril losses, which highlights the complexity of modeling catastrophes.\n As a result of these dynamics and challenging circumstances, we concluded that to continue to provide high net worth clients with comprehensive solutions that meet their emerging risk issues, we needed to move property homeowners product to the non-admitted market, particularly in CAT-exposed states. In the second quarter, we exited the admitted personal property homeowners market in certain states as we could no longer maintain our level of aggregation especially given the inability to reflect the loss cost increases, inflation and increased reinsurance costs and rates as well as limitations on our ability to make coverage changes in this market.\n As part of our go-forward high net worth strategy, we're going to move homeowners and possibly other products in more states to the non-admitted market. And we plan to set up a structure that, over time, we expect to be supported by third-party capital providers in addition to AIG. This structure will provide more flexibility to manage aggregation, price, limit, terms and conditions and to innovate to solve evolving client needs. We will continue to provide coverage to our clients in the U.S. utilizing a hybrid model of non-admitted and admitted products in some states and admitted-only products in other states. \n We're already seeing the benefits of this strategy in our portfolio as the reduction in key catastrophe perils is apparent in these early stages. For example, since year-end 2021, gross wildfire PMLs are down approximately 35% to 40% across the entire PML return period curve.\n Now I want to review Russia, Ukraine. Last quarter, I addressed the many complexities and uncertainties that this situation presents, particularly those related to aviation policies issued to airline operators and leasing companies, including questions surrounding the occurrence of actual losses, loss mitigation efforts, whether any losses arise from war versus non-war apparels and the potential applicability of sanctions. These complexities and uncertainties very much continue. The claims we have received continue to be largely reported under political violence or political risk policies. And we continue to reserve our best estimate of ultimate losses, heavily comprised of IBNR despite the fact that the information we have received in connection with these claims remains very limited. Moreover, in the event of losses and the lines of business we have outlined that are subject to a potential loss, we have multiple reinsurance programs available.\n Turning to AIG 200. We started this 3-year journey in 2019. AIG 200 was designed to transform our core foundational capabilities across the company, and our financial objective was to deliver $1 billion of exit run rate savings with a cost to achieve of $1.3 billion. At the end of the second quarter, we achieved these goals 6 months earlier than expected. Delivering on these critical operational and financial objectives is a major accomplishment for our team.\n AIG 200 was successful because we maintained a tight governance structure and saw exceptional collaboration from colleagues across all major areas of the company. While the original objectives of AIG 200 have been completed, our team will remain focused on continuous improvement in operational excellence. \n AIG 200 has put the company in a significantly better place. Specifically, we modernized our IT platform, retiring over 50% of our identified applications and moving 80% of our infrastructure to the public cloud. We now have a global standard commercial underwriting platform that streamlines our processes and allows over 3,000 underwriters to make better risk management decisions in real time. This platform also includes a new global location management system that allows us to better understand and manage our PML exposure. We made significant investments in key capabilities, including building a consistent underlying data infrastructure, enhancing our digital capabilities through new distribution partner and client portals linked to a single common call center platform and fundamentally streamlined our finance reporting capabilities for faster decision-making. And we streamlined our global operations and shared services capabilities by moving over 10,000 roles to outsourcing partners.\n I want to thank all of our colleagues involved in AIG 200 for their outstanding performance. They should take great pride in knowing they established a new infrastructure and foundation for AIG that we will continue to build on and that will drive benefits for our stakeholders now and in the future.\n Turning to our capital management strategy. We will continue to be balanced and disciplined as we maintain appropriate levels of debt while returning capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends while also allowing for investment in growth opportunities across our global portfolio.\n As I said earlier, we had a very successful second quarter where we reduced net debt outstanding by $1.4 billion, repurchased $1.7 billion of common stock, paid $256 million in dividends and ended with $5.6 billion in parent liquidity. Looking ahead, with respect to debt repayment, AIG will receive the remaining $1.9 billion under the promissory note from Life and Retirement prior to the IPO. And we expect to use these proceeds to pay down additional AIG debt and for other purposes.\n With respect to share buybacks, we have $5.8 billion remaining on our current share repurchase authorization and expect to repurchase at least $1 billion of common stock in the third quarter. With respect to growth opportunities, our priorities continue to be focused on allocating capital in General Insurance where we see opportunities for profitable organic growth and further improvement in our risk-adjusted returns.\n As we discussed on our last call, we expect that post deconsolidation of the Life and Retirement business, AIG will achieve a return on common equity at or above 10%. Shane will provide more details on ROE and on capital management in his remarks.\n Shane, I'll turn the call over to you. \nShane Fitzsimons: Thank you, Peter, and good morning to all. As Peter noted, I will provide more detail on our second quarter financial results and unpack a number of our key performance metrics, specifically EPS, liquidity, leverage, net investment income and ROCE. \n I will begin by providing more detail on the financial results of General Insurance and Life and Retirement in the second quarter. I will then provide more detail on net investment income. I will then review our balance sheet, leverage, AOCI, liquidity and share count, which benefited from excellent execution on a number of capital transactions. And finally, I want to provide you more detail on the execution path to 10% ROCE for AIG and more detail on what we intend to do to get there, including income drivers, expense reduction and AIG 200 where, as Peter noted, we have contracted or executed on our stated goal of $1 billion of exit run rate savings 6 months ahead of our original time line.\n Turning to EPS. Adjusted after-tax EPS was $1.19 per diluted common share. Improvements in General Insurance profit of $1.26 billion contributed $0.06 year-over-year. Within General Insurance, strong underwriting income of $799 million contributed $0.31 of improvement, offset by a $0.25 decline in net investment income primarily driven by the decline in alternatives. And reduction in shares outstanding also contributed $0.10.\n Life and Retirement declined $0.52 in APTI to $563 million, which was below last year's second quarter primarily due to $0.36 or $387 million unfavorable from lower net investment income, $0.19 or $202 million from accelerated DAC amortization and an increased SOP 03-1 reserves. The net investment income decline in Life and Retirement was due to alternatives being down $0.21 and an $0.11 decline in yield enhancement income.\n As I noted, General Insurance's adjusted pretax income contribution in the second quarter was $1.26 billion, which reflects strong underwriting profit growth and continued improvement in the calendar year combined ratio of 510 basis points to 87.4%, and the accident year combined ratio ex CAT of 260 basis points to 88.5%. \n General Insurance adjusted pretax income improved by $63 million year-over-year. Underwriting income improved by $336 million driven by a $182 million improvement in accident year underwriting income in addition to $137 million from an improved PYD, offset by a reduction in alternative investment income in the quarter. The combined ratio improvement was due to improved underwriting income, earned premium growth, expense discipline, low catastrophe losses and favorable PYD, which all contributed to pretax underwriting income being up 73% year-over-year, increasing to $799 million from $463 million.\n North America Commercial had another 300 basis points improvement in the accident year combined ratio ex CAT over the prior year quarter, coming in at 88.2%. International Commercial also continued to improve profitability with 550 basis points improvement in the accident year combined ratio ex CAT this quarter, coming in at a strong 81.4% for the second quarter.\n North America Personal had a 40 basis points improvement in the accident year combined ratio ex CAT over the prior year quarter, coming in at 99.7%. International Personal experienced a 120 basis points deterioration in the accident year combined ratio ex CAT, coming in at 95.2% for the second quarter.\n In the second quarter, CAT losses were $121 million or 1.8 loss ratio points compared to $138 million or 2.1 loss ratio points in the prior year quarter. Prior year development, excluding related premium adjustments, was $202 million favorable this quarter compared to the favorable development of $51 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter, the ADC amortization provided $42 million of favorable development. And the balance of $160 million favorable arose mostly from old accident years in workers' compensation along with primary casualty lines in the U.S. The review in the quarter was mainly focused on North America and represents approximately 15% of reserves.\n Within both AIGRM loss-sensitive work comp and U.S. primary casualty lines, there were additional indications of higher favorable development, but we felt it prudent to wait and see how the inflationary environment evolves, particularly as it relates to the casualty bodily injury and the medical side of workers' comp. We look at this quarterly, and as is our standard practice, we will be reviewing approximately 75% of the total pre-ADC General insurance reserves in the third quarter.\n Life and Retirement adjusted pretax income of $563 million compared to $1.12 billion in the second quarter of 2021. The year-over-year decline was due to $387 million of lower net investment income, of which $224 million is from lower alternative investment income as well as accelerated DAC and increased SOP reserves of $202 million driven by the market declines in the second quarter. The DAC and SOP charges had approximately 300 basis points negative impact on ROCE in the quarter, but these are largely noncash.\n Within Individual Retirement, fixed annuity sales increased 48% year-over-year, aided by origination activity to the Blackstone relationship. And fixed index annuity had another solid quarter of sales. Sales of variable annuities declined in the quarter, consistent with market conditions.\n Net flows were positive $628 million this quarter compared to negative net flows of $77 million in the prior year quarter. And variable and indexed annuity spreads expanded 2 basis points from the first quarter of 2022.\n Group Retirement had strong deposits in the quarter of $1.8 billion, while surrenders declined and base net investment spread was up 4 basis points versus the first quarter of 2022.\n Life Insurance adjusted pretax income was $117 million. The second quarter represented the lowest COVID mortality quarter since the pandemic began, while non-COVID mortality also ran favorable in the period. Premiums and deposits also continued to benefit from the solid international life sales, which comprise approximately 45% of new sales activity.\n Our previously reported level of spread rate compression has been in the range of 8 to 16 basis points annually. But given current market conditions, we now expect to be better than 8 basis points for the full year.\n As you are aware, for the Life and Retirement business, we conduct our entire reserve review in the third quarter. However, with the recent focus on the guaranteed universal life product, I will provide a few comments. First, this is not a large block for us. So we do not have much exposure in our in-force block, which is approximately $3 billion in net statutory reserves, which represents 2% of our net liabilities. For context, we did participate in the recent industry study on this topic. And our projected lapse rates, fund bases and dynamic premium modeling approach are consistent with the recommendations of the study. As additional background, over the last 5 years, we have been reviewing and strengthening our reserve assumptions for the guaranteed universal life product. And as a result, we don't expect significant adjustments.\n Turning to other operations, which includes interest expense, corporate general operating expenses, institutional asset management expense, runoff portfolio and eliminations, it was a positive contributor to adjusted pretax income year-over-year by $149 million. Corporate general operating expenses improved $74 million year-over-year in the second quarter, benefiting from AIG 200 and continued emphasis on expense management.\n Adjusted pretax net investment income for the quarter was $2.5 billion, a decline of $678 million compared to the second quarter of 2021. As a reminder, we report the results of our private equity holdings on a 1-quarter lag, and we may have an impact in the third quarter as well.\n Over the last few years, we focused on improving the risk profile of the investment portfolio with continued vigilance around corporate and consumer credit and a strong capital and liquidity profile in both General Insurance and Life and Retirement, which support our ability to manage through difficult times as evidenced by our financial stability through COVID.\n In Life and Retirement, our weighted average credit rating has improved since the end of 2015, while the percentage of capital-intensive assets has declined in the portfolio from 10.5% to 8.3%. In the second quarter, we continued the proactive steps in the investment portfolio to avoid potential overexposure in the event credit deteriorates.\n We sold RMBS and ABS securities with a market value of $3.2 billion in the second quarter. In addition, we have alternative investments, particularly hedge funds, that have generated good returns over time but with more quarter-to-quarter fluctuations and that is more volatility than we would prefer.\n Going forward, we would expect to move over time to an asset allocation with less volatility. We've also executed on sales of approximately $4 billion of low-yielding longer-duration corporate bonds to buy higher-yielding, shorter-duration structured securities, privates, ABS and CMLs with many of them being floaters. We feel it is appropriate to take advantage of the higher rate environment and turn the portfolio over a little more quickly than would naturally occur at maturity, thereby enhancing our forward APTI and ROCE.\n The second quarter saw significant increases in benchmark treasury yields with a 65 basis point increase on the 10-year or 146 basis points through June 30. With General Insurance and Life and Retirement portfolio durations are just under 4 and 8 years, respectively, the overall rising interest rate environment will provide a tailwind to our investment portfolio returns.\n Our base fixed income portfolio saw a lift in yield of 18 basis points in the second quarter versus first quarter with $17 million additional within General Insurance and $28 million additional in Life and Retirement.\n The new money yield on our base portfolio was approximately 80 basis points above the assets rolling off the portfolio during the second quarter. At the end of the second quarter, the new money yield is roughly 130 basis points higher than the overall current portfolio in General Insurance and roughly 75 basis points higher in Life and Retirement.\n Moving on to the balance sheet, leverage and liquidity. As Peter noted, we closed the quarter with $5.6 billion of parent liquidity. The second quarter includes execution of $1.7 billion in share repurchases, $256 million of common and preferred dividends and $1.4 billion net spend on debt reduction actions, including AIG debt retirement and extinguishment costs of $7.9 billion that is partially offset by the Corebridge debt issuance of $6.5 billion.\n In the second quarter, we saw a large AOCI movement as a result of increasing interest rates. Adjusted AOCI, which excludes the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude, moved from negative $5.9 billion to negative $15.4 billion or an additional reduction of $9.5 billion. We exited the second quarter with GAAP leverage of 31.1%, up from 27.8%, a 330 basis point increase quarter-over-quarter. The decrease in AOCI in the period added 390 basis points to the leverage ratio. This was partially offset by the net debt reduction of $1.3 billion in the period in addition to net income gains. The impact of AOCI is substantially larger in Life and Retirement and General Insurance, given the duration of their respective asset portfolios. At quarter end, our debt leverage ratio, excluding AOCI, was 25.3%, down 60 basis points versus 25.9% at the end of the first quarter of 2022.\n Total adjusted return on common equity was 7%, down from 10.5% in 2Q '21. And total company adjusted tangible return on common equity was 7.6%. The decrease is mostly caused by decline in net investment income. General Insurance's adjusted attributable return on common equity was 12% in the second quarter while Life and Retirement was 7.6%.  Life and Retirement's ROCE was impacted by approximately 300 basis point drag from the acceleration of DAC, an increase in the SOP 03-1 reserves in the second quarter.\n Adjusted book value per share of $72.23 increased 2.1% sequentially and 20.2% year-over-year. Adjusted tangible book value per share of $66.06 increased 2.2% sequentially and 21.8% year-over-year. Our primary operating subsidiaries remain profitable and well capitalized with General Insurance's U.S. pool fleet risk-based capital ratio for the second quarter estimated to be between 475% and 485%. And the Life and Retirement U.S. fleet estimated to be between 415% and 425%, both above our target ranges.\n Finally, during the quarter, we repurchased approximately 30 million shares at an average cost of $58.25, bringing our GAAP ending share count to 771 million with the quarterly average of 801 million compared to 873 million in the prior year quarter, representing an 8% reduction in average share count.\n As we previously disclosed, our agreement with Blackstone includes an exchange right put option, which is not exercisable until November of 2024. That gives Blackstone the right to exchange their stake in Corebridge for shares in AIG. Under the applicable accounting principles, this put option was dilutive in the second quarter and resulted in 43 million additional shares outstanding for the purposes of the adjusted EPS calculations in the period. It is worth noting that this put option goes away upon the execution of the IPO.\n Looking ahead, we have 4 priorities, which all lead to ROCE improvement towards our 10% or greater goal: continued momentum on underwriting excellence, expense reduction through operational excellence and expense discipline, the successful IPO and separation of the Life and Retirement business and continued execution on our capital management priorities.\n Continued momentum on underwriting excellence will include further improvements in our underwriting profitability without an increase in volatility as well as underwriting portfolio optimization, which involves both measured growth on proper leverage to optimize return allocation. While we have made significant progress to date, we are still achieving written rate above trends, both in business today and that which we have not yet earned in.\n Expense reduction will come through continued cost discipline, operational excellence, earn-in of AIG 200 run rate savings and a reduction of parent GOE. As Peter mentioned, we have now contracted or executed on $1 billion of savings related to AIG 200, and we have realized $610 million of savings to date. That leaves $390 million of savings that AIG expects to earn in over the coming 12 to 18 months. \n We also expect roughly $300 million of the AIG corporate expenses will move to Life and Retirement upon deconsolidation. In addition, as Peter stated, we now expect Life and Retirement to execute a cost savings program, which will generate close to $400 million in savings and expect the program to deliver the first $100 million before year-end.\n With respect to the execution on our capital management priorities, we have already accelerated our share repurchases this year and expect additional repurchases as we get more clarity on the timing of the proceeds from the Corebridge IPO. Contemplated in our current plan, which includes the completion of the Corebridge IPO, we expect to reduce our share count to somewhere in the range of 600 million to 650 million shares, while maintaining leverage in the 20% to 25% level along with strong capitalization at the insurance subsidiary company level.\n Each of these drivers has some elements of tailwind to them. Additionally, yield enhancement in the base investment portfolio should provide meaningful lift in earnings power over time based on the current economic backdrop. To date, we're beginning to see the benefit of higher yields driving higher base portfolio returns where we are not dependent on higher interest rates to achieve our goal. These focus areas give us a line of sight to a minimum of 300 to 400 basis points of ROCE improvement. We will continue to provide updates over time.\n And with that, I will turn the call back over to you, Peter. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Great. Thank you, Shane. And operator, we're prepared to take questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Meyer Shields at KBW. \nMeyer Shields: Peter, you provided a ton of information on rates and trend and exposure. But I was hoping we could dig a little deeper, specifically into the exposure benefits for liability lines where premiums are based on receipts, but maybe the relationship between receipts and losses is not as obvious as, let's say, in property, and we've got the concerns of longer tail lines. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Sure, Meyer. Thank you for the question. Like you said, we've provided a lot of information in our prepared remarks. But I think, Mark, why don't you go through what the effects are in exposure and also talk a little bit about sort of the loss ratio implications in the observations that we made? \nMark Lyons;Executive Vice President, Global Chief Actuary and Head of Portfolio Management: Happy to. So a couple of things come to mind. First off, as Peter mentioned, North America Commercial aggregate loss trend is now up to 6% this quarter as opposed to our upper revision we did last quarter, the 5.5%, because we look at that every quarter. Short-tailed lines are driving much of this increase, and that is seen in our own data as well as external information. And over the last few years, because I'm talking about the weighted average loss cost trend there, the North American portfolio has reduced its property writings and has shrunk as a percentage of total, which helps ameliorate the growth in severity.\n So -- but we're seeing commercial property line loss cost trends of roughly 10% and in specialty-oriented property lines closer to 15%, driven by inflationary trends in construction materials, replacement costs, labor, transportation, things of that nature. Our view of casualty, bodily injury and the medical side of work comp, though, is unchanged from last quarter. And recall that even that reflected an increment of anticipatory medical cost increase. But as Peter said in his prepared remarks, we have yet to see it within our own data or with relevant external data.\n Now I think getting into some of your question as well, it's hard to discuss loss cost trend without discussing the related topic of margin, which reflects the exposure trend and how that mitigates the loss cost trend that we've already just talked about. The aggregate North American Commercial book has an approximate 2% exposure trend, which, as you mentioned, represents additional collected premium due to the positive impact of the underlying inflation sensitive exposure basis to which the rates are applied. And therefore, it does function as a partial inflation mitigant.\n And examples of that would be one of our growth engines, which is Lexington, which has approximately 60% of their book based on inflation-sensitive exposure basis. And another one would be retail property, where the focus on accurate and current statement of values is razor sharp in that level of focus. So the exposure trend is partially mitigating these loss cost trends, which then produces the approximate 4% all-in loss ratio trend that Peter commented on.\n But -- so when you put that in conjunction with the 7% rate increases achieved in the quarter, we're in excess of loss cost trend and loss ratio trend, let alone the loss ratio benefits of tighter terms and conditions. And rate change alone really doesn't tell the whole picture.\n We've spoken before about the power of the primary, especially in D&O. AIG's position there permits deploying [ ventilate ] capacity as we see fit, but just as important is the stronger pricing power resident in the primary versus high excess, which is fast becoming a good commodity driven by high price or highly by price and seeing the largest rate reductions. That's the strength of the primary.\n But I think lastly, just I think a clarification, it may or may make some sense, so think of it this way, let's not get confused on the difference between a real underlying exposure to loss with the measurement of that exposure to loss. So to keep it simple, if storekeeper A buys a GL policy, which is mostly a premises policy, and the insurer uses square footage as the exposure base, then the premium paid is rate times square footage, of course. And next year, if there is no rate change, he'll have the same premium.\n However, if storekeeper B has an identical store in the same geographic area and the same sales volume, but their insurer instead rates on gross receipts, and those receipts are 3% higher this year than last year, the true underlying exposure as measured by the propensity to have a claim didn't change, but the measurement of that exposure did change. So storekeeper B's premium will be 3% higher than that charged by insurer A, even though the stores are identical in every way. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: That's great, Mark. Thank you. Meyer, is there a follow-up? \nMeyer Shields: Yes. Just a very brief one really on the last comment. Is there an opportunity or an advantage to maybe shifting even more of the premium Phase 2 inflation-sensitive exposure? \nMark Lyons;Executive Vice President, Global Chief Actuary and Head of Portfolio Management: Yes. I mean, it's -- that is a potential strategy that you'd -- a little difficult to implement, right, because you have -- part of a profitable portfolio are those things, rated -- inflation exposure basis like premises. However, when you get into other lines, like the M&C side of GL, Meyer, I think what you're saying makes a lot of sense. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Yes. I think maybe I'd just add to that, and we'll take the next question, which is all the significant repositioning we've done in the excess and surplus lines, particularly with the Lexington. You hear a lot about in the prepared remarks because they've done such a great job between growth, rate, retention and pivoting that portfolio to be a significant contributor in terms of profitability improvement. I mean, we've gotten on property alone 16 consecutive quarters of double-digit rate increases. And as Mark alluded to, that just starts to drive margins. So we are repositioning the portfolio based on where we see the best risk-adjusted returns. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Erik Bass with Autonomous. \nErik Bass: So with the Corebridge IPO, it sounds like your strategy is to remain patient and wait for markets to recover since you're not a forced seller. Is this the right take? Or if the IPO window opens in the fall, would you look to take advantage and get some stock floated even if at a modest discount to what you view as the ultimate fair value? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Yes. Thanks, Erik. We provided a lot of sort of guidance in our prepared remarks, but let me try to add to it. Our plan has always been to do an IPO of Corebridge, and that has not changed. So now we are targeting September. I mean, we gave you some of the variables, but obviously there's more to consider like you outlined. We just felt that the market conditions in the second quarter were not conducive. We always intend to own greater than 50% following the IPO. And therefore, we'll continue to consolidate results for the foreseeable future.\n The base case is still to do secondary offerings, but those will likely take place in 2023. And so look, we're going to watch the market. We always have to be careful in terms of the conditions that exist in the regulatory approvals. But our base case has just shifted from May, June to September. And we'll watch it carefully, and we'd like to get it floating. \nErik Bass: Got it. And then one follow-up on Corebridge. I was just hoping you could talk a little bit more about the performance of your VA hedging program this quarter and the movements in the RBC ratio that we saw. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Yes, Shane, you and Kevin want to provide some insight on that? \nKevin Hogan: Yes, so... \nShane Fitzsimons: Go ahead, Kevin. \nKevin Hogan: So Erik, yes, our VA -- the hedging program, our economic target-based hedging program has continued to perform as we have expected throughout all of the market volatility. It is an economic target-based hedging program, and so the RBC decline was in part due to the variable annuity and index annuity portfolios. And as you know, those market impacts are reversible as markets recover. So we have hedged all hedgeable economic risks. We have an open credit spread position, which we believe is offset by our general account credit portfolio, and the hedge has performed as we have designed it. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Brian Meredith with UBS. \nBrian Meredith: Yes, two quick questions here for you. First one, thanks for all the detail on the expense outlook going forward. I'm just curious, is there another plan expense reduction program for the General Insurance business post the Corebridge split?\n And Pete, I'm curious, is there a G&A expense ratio did you think you need to be at or a target you're looking at to be among the most competitive from an expense leverage perspective in the commercial insurance business? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Yes. Thanks, Brian. Yes. So as we said, we're really proud and pleased that we just finished AIG 200, and that will start to continue to earn in. The work that we did in the summer for Corebridge, we increased our expectations there over the 3-year period to be now at the upper end of the range of $400 million. So our primary focus is the underwriting excellence in terms of the improvement, the focus on continuing AIG 200 and making sure that operational excellence becomes a core part of the organization, which it already has, but we want to continue that, and then making sure that the separation of Corebridge is done flawlessly. \n At the same time, we are looking at our overall cost structure. There's a ton of work underway. And as we start executing on those other pieces, there will be -- Shane put in his prepared remarks, where we're going to get out a meaningful amount up to $500 million more of expenses. That's the remaining company within AIG. So that will start to get executed.\n As we start to deconsolidate, we'll have a path forward as we flow Corebridge and be able to give you more guidance. I don't have a percentage. I focus on the nominal in terms of -- when I look at even like General Insurance over the last 5 quarters where we've invested a lot in the business, the nominal GOE has not gone up. I mean, so the expense discipline is there. And we want to continue to benefit from the earned savings with AIG 200 and what we will take out in terms of the combined entity when we go forward. But we want to have an organization that is going to be world-class in terms of its overall expense ratios.\n And I think we've proven that we not only can take it out in a really constructive way because we're investing for the future, but we maintain that level going forward. We have growth opportunities in the top line, which will help the ratios. I mean, the commercial business is growing, excluding AIG Re, which the reason why I've excluded is that we're not trying to grow that business based on the CAT exposures today, but growing at 10%. We see opportunities to grow in the future when we look to the back half of this year. We have very strong retention. The new business that's been coming in is going to be more retained. It's the fifth quarter in a row where we produced more than $1 billion of new business, all very positive, all helpful to our ratios. And so we feel like we have a lot of momentum. \nBrian Meredith: Great. That's really helpful. And then one last question on the whole exposure loss trend. Everybody is talking about increasing exposure. What happens if we go into a recession? Can that actually hurt your ability to see -- accrete margin? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: I don't think so based on the makeup of the portfolio. But Mark, why don't we end where we started with you just to give a little bit of perspective and then you can turn it back to me. \nMark Lyons;Executive Vice President, Global Chief Actuary and Head of Portfolio Management: Yes. Thank you, Peter. And Brian, good to hear from you. So to your question, remember, what Dave McElroy and his team are doing, Lexington is becoming an increasing proportion of the business. And on a non-admitted basis, you have a lot of interesting terms and conditions like minimum earned premiums. So even if that does fall off a bit, that doesn't necessarily translate on a downward movement. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Thanks, Mark. Thanks a lot, Brian. Have a great day. And thanks, everybody, for joining us. Really appreciate the time, and have a great day. \nOperator: And once again, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Shane Fitzsimons",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter, and good morning to all. As Peter noted, I will provide more detail on our second quarter financial results and unpack a number of our key performance metrics, specifically EPS, liquidity, leverage, net investment income and ROCE. \n I will begin by providing more detail on the financial results of General Insurance and Life and Retirement in the second quarter. I will then provide more detail on net investment income. I will then review our balance sheet, leverage, AOCI, liquidity and share count, which benefited from excellent execution on a number of capital transactions. And finally, I want to provide you more detail on the execution path to 10% ROCE for AIG and more detail on what we intend to do to get there, including income drivers, expense reduction and AIG 200 where, as Peter noted, we have contracted or executed on our stated goal of $1 billion of exit run rate savings 6 months ahead of our original time line.\n Turning to EPS. Adjusted after-tax EPS was $1.19 per diluted common share. Improvements in General Insurance profit of $1.26 billion contributed $0.06 year-over-year. Within General Insurance, strong underwriting income of $799 million contributed $0.31 of improvement, offset by a $0.25 decline in net investment income primarily driven by the decline in alternatives. And reduction in shares outstanding also contributed $0.10.\n Life and Retirement declined $0.52 in APTI to $563 million, which was below last year's second quarter primarily due to $0.36 or $387 million unfavorable from lower net investment income, $0.19 or $202 million from accelerated DAC amortization and an increased SOP 03-1 reserves. The net investment income decline in Life and Retirement was due to alternatives being down $0.21 and an $0.11 decline in yield enhancement income.\n As I noted, General Insurance's adjusted pretax income contribution in the second quarter was $1.26 billion, which reflects strong underwriting profit growth and continued improvement in the calendar year combined ratio of 510 basis points to 87.4%, and the accident year combined ratio ex CAT of 260 basis points to 88.5%. \n General Insurance adjusted pretax income improved by $63 million year-over-year. Underwriting income improved by $336 million driven by a $182 million improvement in accident year underwriting income in addition to $137 million from an improved PYD, offset by a reduction in alternative investment income in the quarter. The combined ratio improvement was due to improved underwriting income, earned premium growth, expense discipline, low catastrophe losses and favorable PYD, which all contributed to pretax underwriting income being up 73% year-over-year, increasing to $799 million from $463 million.\n North America Commercial had another 300 basis points improvement in the accident year combined ratio ex CAT over the prior year quarter, coming in at 88.2%. International Commercial also continued to improve profitability with 550 basis points improvement in the accident year combined ratio ex CAT this quarter, coming in at a strong 81.4% for the second quarter.\n North America Personal had a 40 basis points improvement in the accident year combined ratio ex CAT over the prior year quarter, coming in at 99.7%. International Personal experienced a 120 basis points deterioration in the accident year combined ratio ex CAT, coming in at 95.2% for the second quarter.\n In the second quarter, CAT losses were $121 million or 1.8 loss ratio points compared to $138 million or 2.1 loss ratio points in the prior year quarter. Prior year development, excluding related premium adjustments, was $202 million favorable this quarter compared to the favorable development of $51 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter, the ADC amortization provided $42 million of favorable development. And the balance of $160 million favorable arose mostly from old accident years in workers' compensation along with primary casualty lines in the U.S. The review in the quarter was mainly focused on North America and represents approximately 15% of reserves.\n Within both AIGRM loss-sensitive work comp and U.S. primary casualty lines, there were additional indications of higher favorable development, but we felt it prudent to wait and see how the inflationary environment evolves, particularly as it relates to the casualty bodily injury and the medical side of workers' comp. We look at this quarterly, and as is our standard practice, we will be reviewing approximately 75% of the total pre-ADC General insurance reserves in the third quarter.\n Life and Retirement adjusted pretax income of $563 million compared to $1.12 billion in the second quarter of 2021. The year-over-year decline was due to $387 million of lower net investment income, of which $224 million is from lower alternative investment income as well as accelerated DAC and increased SOP reserves of $202 million driven by the market declines in the second quarter. The DAC and SOP charges had approximately 300 basis points negative impact on ROCE in the quarter, but these are largely noncash.\n Within Individual Retirement, fixed annuity sales increased 48% year-over-year, aided by origination activity to the Blackstone relationship. And fixed index annuity had another solid quarter of sales. Sales of variable annuities declined in the quarter, consistent with market conditions.\n Net flows were positive $628 million this quarter compared to negative net flows of $77 million in the prior year quarter. And variable and indexed annuity spreads expanded 2 basis points from the first quarter of 2022.\n Group Retirement had strong deposits in the quarter of $1.8 billion, while surrenders declined and base net investment spread was up 4 basis points versus the first quarter of 2022.\n Life Insurance adjusted pretax income was $117 million. The second quarter represented the lowest COVID mortality quarter since the pandemic began, while non-COVID mortality also ran favorable in the period. Premiums and deposits also continued to benefit from the solid international life sales, which comprise approximately 45% of new sales activity.\n Our previously reported level of spread rate compression has been in the range of 8 to 16 basis points annually. But given current market conditions, we now expect to be better than 8 basis points for the full year.\n As you are aware, for the Life and Retirement business, we conduct our entire reserve review in the third quarter. However, with the recent focus on the guaranteed universal life product, I will provide a few comments. First, this is not a large block for us. So we do not have much exposure in our in-force block, which is approximately $3 billion in net statutory reserves, which represents 2% of our net liabilities. For context, we did participate in the recent industry study on this topic. And our projected lapse rates, fund bases and dynamic premium modeling approach are consistent with the recommendations of the study. As additional background, over the last 5 years, we have been reviewing and strengthening our reserve assumptions for the guaranteed universal life product. And as a result, we don't expect significant adjustments.\n Turning to other operations, which includes interest expense, corporate general operating expenses, institutional asset management expense, runoff portfolio and eliminations, it was a positive contributor to adjusted pretax income year-over-year by $149 million. Corporate general operating expenses improved $74 million year-over-year in the second quarter, benefiting from AIG 200 and continued emphasis on expense management.\n Adjusted pretax net investment income for the quarter was $2.5 billion, a decline of $678 million compared to the second quarter of 2021. As a reminder, we report the results of our private equity holdings on a 1-quarter lag, and we may have an impact in the third quarter as well.\n Over the last few years, we focused on improving the risk profile of the investment portfolio with continued vigilance around corporate and consumer credit and a strong capital and liquidity profile in both General Insurance and Life and Retirement, which support our ability to manage through difficult times as evidenced by our financial stability through COVID.\n In Life and Retirement, our weighted average credit rating has improved since the end of 2015, while the percentage of capital-intensive assets has declined in the portfolio from 10.5% to 8.3%. In the second quarter, we continued the proactive steps in the investment portfolio to avoid potential overexposure in the event credit deteriorates.\n We sold RMBS and ABS securities with a market value of $3.2 billion in the second quarter. In addition, we have alternative investments, particularly hedge funds, that have generated good returns over time but with more quarter-to-quarter fluctuations and that is more volatility than we would prefer.\n Going forward, we would expect to move over time to an asset allocation with less volatility. We've also executed on sales of approximately $4 billion of low-yielding longer-duration corporate bonds to buy higher-yielding, shorter-duration structured securities, privates, ABS and CMLs with many of them being floaters. We feel it is appropriate to take advantage of the higher rate environment and turn the portfolio over a little more quickly than would naturally occur at maturity, thereby enhancing our forward APTI and ROCE.\n The second quarter saw significant increases in benchmark treasury yields with a 65 basis point increase on the 10-year or 146 basis points through June 30. With General Insurance and Life and Retirement portfolio durations are just under 4 and 8 years, respectively, the overall rising interest rate environment will provide a tailwind to our investment portfolio returns.\n Our base fixed income portfolio saw a lift in yield of 18 basis points in the second quarter versus first quarter with $17 million additional within General Insurance and $28 million additional in Life and Retirement.\n The new money yield on our base portfolio was approximately 80 basis points above the assets rolling off the portfolio during the second quarter. At the end of the second quarter, the new money yield is roughly 130 basis points higher than the overall current portfolio in General Insurance and roughly 75 basis points higher in Life and Retirement.\n Moving on to the balance sheet, leverage and liquidity. As Peter noted, we closed the quarter with $5.6 billion of parent liquidity. The second quarter includes execution of $1.7 billion in share repurchases, $256 million of common and preferred dividends and $1.4 billion net spend on debt reduction actions, including AIG debt retirement and extinguishment costs of $7.9 billion that is partially offset by the Corebridge debt issuance of $6.5 billion.\n In the second quarter, we saw a large AOCI movement as a result of increasing interest rates. Adjusted AOCI, which excludes the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude, moved from negative $5.9 billion to negative $15.4 billion or an additional reduction of $9.5 billion. We exited the second quarter with GAAP leverage of 31.1%, up from 27.8%, a 330 basis point increase quarter-over-quarter. The decrease in AOCI in the period added 390 basis points to the leverage ratio. This was partially offset by the net debt reduction of $1.3 billion in the period in addition to net income gains. The impact of AOCI is substantially larger in Life and Retirement and General Insurance, given the duration of their respective asset portfolios. At quarter end, our debt leverage ratio, excluding AOCI, was 25.3%, down 60 basis points versus 25.9% at the end of the first quarter of 2022.\n Total adjusted return on common equity was 7%, down from 10.5% in 2Q '21. And total company adjusted tangible return on common equity was 7.6%. The decrease is mostly caused by decline in net investment income. General Insurance's adjusted attributable return on common equity was 12% in the second quarter while Life and Retirement was 7.6%.  Life and Retirement's ROCE was impacted by approximately 300 basis point drag from the acceleration of DAC, an increase in the SOP 03-1 reserves in the second quarter.\n Adjusted book value per share of $72.23 increased 2.1% sequentially and 20.2% year-over-year. Adjusted tangible book value per share of $66.06 increased 2.2% sequentially and 21.8% year-over-year. Our primary operating subsidiaries remain profitable and well capitalized with General Insurance's U.S. pool fleet risk-based capital ratio for the second quarter estimated to be between 475% and 485%. And the Life and Retirement U.S. fleet estimated to be between 415% and 425%, both above our target ranges.\n Finally, during the quarter, we repurchased approximately 30 million shares at an average cost of $58.25, bringing our GAAP ending share count to 771 million with the quarterly average of 801 million compared to 873 million in the prior year quarter, representing an 8% reduction in average share count.\n As we previously disclosed, our agreement with Blackstone includes an exchange right put option, which is not exercisable until November of 2024. That gives Blackstone the right to exchange their stake in Corebridge for shares in AIG. Under the applicable accounting principles, this put option was dilutive in the second quarter and resulted in 43 million additional shares outstanding for the purposes of the adjusted EPS calculations in the period. It is worth noting that this put option goes away upon the execution of the IPO.\n Looking ahead, we have 4 priorities, which all lead to ROCE improvement towards our 10% or greater goal: continued momentum on underwriting excellence, expense reduction through operational excellence and expense discipline, the successful IPO and separation of the Life and Retirement business and continued execution on our capital management priorities.\n Continued momentum on underwriting excellence will include further improvements in our underwriting profitability without an increase in volatility as well as underwriting portfolio optimization, which involves both measured growth on proper leverage to optimize return allocation. While we have made significant progress to date, we are still achieving written rate above trends, both in business today and that which we have not yet earned in.\n Expense reduction will come through continued cost discipline, operational excellence, earn-in of AIG 200 run rate savings and a reduction of parent GOE. As Peter mentioned, we have now contracted or executed on $1 billion of savings related to AIG 200, and we have realized $610 million of savings to date. That leaves $390 million of savings that AIG expects to earn in over the coming 12 to 18 months. \n We also expect roughly $300 million of the AIG corporate expenses will move to Life and Retirement upon deconsolidation. In addition, as Peter stated, we now expect Life and Retirement to execute a cost savings program, which will generate close to $400 million in savings and expect the program to deliver the first $100 million before year-end.\n With respect to the execution on our capital management priorities, we have already accelerated our share repurchases this year and expect additional repurchases as we get more clarity on the timing of the proceeds from the Corebridge IPO. Contemplated in our current plan, which includes the completion of the Corebridge IPO, we expect to reduce our share count to somewhere in the range of 600 million to 650 million shares, while maintaining leverage in the 20% to 25% level along with strong capitalization at the insurance subsidiary company level.\n Each of these drivers has some elements of tailwind to them. Additionally, yield enhancement in the base investment portfolio should provide meaningful lift in earnings power over time based on the current economic backdrop. To date, we're beginning to see the benefit of higher yields driving higher base portfolio returns where we are not dependent on higher interest rates to achieve our goal. These focus areas give us a line of sight to a minimum of 300 to 400 basis points of ROCE improvement. We will continue to provide updates over time.\n And with that, I will turn the call back over to you, Peter. Go ahead, Kevin."

            "name": "Peter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review our second quarter results. AIG had an excellent quarter with strong momentum continuing across all of our strategic, financial and operational objectives. I could not be more pleased with the exceptional results in General Insurance. And Life and Retirement again delivered good results despite very challenging equity market conditions, significant volatility and other headwinds. \n As you saw in our press release, adjusted after-tax net income per diluted common share was $1.19.\n General Insurance achieved a calendar year combined ratio of 87.4%, the first sub-90 quarter and best result this business has achieved in over 15 years. The accident year combined ratio, excluding CATs, was 88.5%, a 260 basis point improvement year-over-year and the 16th consecutive quarter of improvement. And the accident year combined ratio, excluding CATs, in Global Commercial was 85.3%, an improvement of 400 basis points year-over-year.\n Consistent with our strategy to manage volatility, catastrophe losses were very modest in the quarter, coming in at $121 million or 1.8% of a combined ratio. Life and Retirement has strong fixed annuity sales with over $1.3 billion in deposits for the second straight quarter, which benefited from the origination capabilities of Blackstone.\n AIG returned nearly $2 billion to shareholders in the second quarter through $1.7 billion of common stock repurchases and $256 million of dividends. In addition, we are on track to buy back at least $1 billion of common stock in the third quarter. We ended the second quarter with $5.6 billion of parent liquidity, which Shane will go through in more detail in his remarks.\n On today's call, I will provide more detail on 5 topics. First, I will provide an update on the IPO of our Life and Retirement business, which will be known as Corebridge Financial once the company is public, and discuss why we chose not to proceed with the IPO in the second quarter. I will also review the significant progress we've continued to make on various aspects of the separation of Corebridge as we prepare this business to be a stand-alone public company. \n Second, as a follow-on to the IPO discussion, I will review Life and Retirement results where, as I mentioned, the core business showed continued resilience and solid performance despite headwinds largely driven from a reduction in net investment income. \n Third, I will review the performance of General Insurance, where underwriting excellence continues to produce outstanding results with strong profitability and top line growth, particularly in our Global Commercial portfolio.\n Fourth, I will provide an update on AIG 200, where we achieved critical milestones and delivered on our stated goal of $1 billion in exit run rate savings 6 months ahead of schedule. \n Lastly, I'll provide an update on capital management, particularly with respect to stock buybacks and debt reduction.\n Following my remarks, Shane will provide more detail on the quarter and then we will take questions. Mark Lyons, David McElroy and Kevin Hogan will join us for the Q&A portion of today's call.\n As you can see, our team has accomplished a lot on many fronts. Before expanding on our financial and operating performance, I want to address the status of the Corebridge IPO. Our base case had always been to complete the IPO in the second quarter, subject to regulatory approvals and market conditions. In deciding whether to launch the initial public offering in May or June, we weighed several variables, which were all market-related, some specific to Corebridge and some more macro level. These included equity market conditions and particularly the trading values of companies in the Life and Retirement sector that we consider to be the most comparable to Corebridge.\n In the second quarter, equity markets were down 16% with only 3 weeks seeing positive market returns, the VIX, which was above 30 resulting in extremely elevated market volatility and feedback we received from advisers, analysts and many potential institutional investors following the public filing of the S-1. While completing the IPO is a significant priority for us and something we are laser-focused on, we believe this is an attractive business and did not want to execute a transaction that would be detrimental to stakeholders in the long run. Absent something we don't see today, we remain ready to execute on the IPO, subject to regulatory approvals and market conditions. And the next window will be in September. \n In the meantime, throughout the summer, we continue to make significant progress to position the business for long-term success. I'll highlight 3 areas of focus. One, expanding on our plan to achieve expense savings at Corebridge. Last quarter, we estimated these savings to be in the range of $200 million to $300 million, but we now expect to generate closer to $400 million of savings over the next 3 years with the majority of the run rate savings to be achieved in the next 24 months.\n Two, progressing the implementation of a new operating model for our investments unit. This includes our strategic partnership with Blackstone announced in July of 2021 and our partnership with BlackRock, where we began moving assets under management in the second quarter of this year pursuant to the arrangement we announced in late March.\n And three, planning our transition to BlackRock's Aladdin platform, which will replace aging and end-of-life technology infrastructure and provide enhanced risk analytics and reporting. We continue to expect that Corebridge will pay an annual dividend of $600 million post-IPO that will have a payout ratio of 60% to 65%, and that it will achieve a return on equity of 12% to 14% over the next 24 months.\n Now turning to Life and Retirement's performance in the second quarter. As I mentioned earlier, adjusted pretax income was $563 million, decreasing from the prior year period due to lower NII, which was driven by lower alternative investment income, accelerated DAC amortization and an increase in SOP reserves. Given the pending IPO, we remain somewhat limited in what we can say about the business, but let me provide some details from the second quarter. The core business produced strong sales in fixed annuities, which were up 48% to $1.4 billion and strong sales in indexed annuities, which were flat at $1.5 billion.\n In Group Retirement, contributions grew 1%, nonrecurring deposits grew 4% and enrollments were up 11%. Second quarter deposits of $1.8 billion were strong with base net investment spread growing 4 basis points sequentially due to the higher interest rate environment. The Life and Retirement balance sheet and capital position remains strong with an RBC ratio of 415% to 425%, still above our target ranges.\n Now let me provide more detail on our second quarter results in General Insurance, where we continue to drive improved financial performance. Gross premiums written increased 5% on an FX-adjusted basis to $9.6 billion, with Global Commercial growing 8% and Global Personal decreasing 3%. \n Net premiums written increased 5% on an FX-adjusted basis to $6.9 billion. This growth was led by our Global Commercial business, which grew 8% with Global Personal decreasing 4%. \n Global Commercial net premiums written increased 10%, excluding AIG Re, where we have significantly reduced property CAT writings and exposure, particularly in the Southeast region of the U.S. \n North America Commercial net premiums written increased 10% or 14% excluding AIG Re. And international net premiums written increased 5% or 8% excluding the impact of nonrenewal and cancellations related to Russia exposure in each case on an FX-adjusted basis.\n In North America Commercial, we saw very strong growth in net premiums written: In Lexington, which grew 31% led by wholesale property, which was up 46%; retail property, which grew 17%; and our Canadian commercial business, which grew 10%.\n In International Commercial, on an FX-adjusted basis, we also saw strong growth in net premiums written: In Global Specialty, which grew 16% led by energy, which was up 20%; and marine, which was up 10%; North America Specialty, which grew 17%; and International Specialty, which grew 15%.\n In Global Commercial, we also had very strong renewal retention of 85% in our in-force portfolio, with North America up 200 basis points to 85% and International holding steady at a very strong 86%. As a reminder, we calculate renewal retention prior to the impact of rate and exposure changes. And across Global Commercial, our new business continues to be very strong, coming in slightly over $1 billion for the fifth consecutive quarter.\n North America's new business grew to $542 million led by Lexington. International new business was $466 million, slightly down year-over-year due to intentional actions we took in Talbot and in our Specialty business related to Russia, Ukraine.\n Turning to rate. Momentum continued in Global Commercial with overall rate increases of 7%. And in the aggregate, rate continued to exceed loss cost trends. This is the fourth consecutive year in which we're achieving rate above loss cost trends and where we are successfully driving margin expansion.\n North America Commercial achieved 7% rate increases with some areas achieving double-digit increases led by Lexington, which increased 18% with 17% in Lexington wholesale property; Financial Lines, where professional increased 34% led by cyber, which increased 52%; and excess casualty, which increased 10%.\n International commercial rate increases were 7% driven by Financial Lines, which increased 11%, including more than 47% rate increases in cyber; property, which increased 10%; and EMEA, which also increased 10%.\n Last quarter, we indicated that our loss cost trend view in the aggregate for North America Commercial had migrated upwards from 4% to 5%, mostly driven by shorter tail lines. And as a result, we moved the upper end of the range to 5.5%.\n In the second quarter, trends in casualty and other liability lines continue to show no obvious impact in either internal or external data to support a large move on loss cost, whereas property businesses have been more clearly affected. As a result, based on a review of more recent information, we again modified our view on loss cost trend to 6%. Loss cost trend represents the composite of frequency and severity. However, there is an additional mitigant to inflation built into rate decisions. Exposure trend, which we view as a partial offset to loss cost trend, reflects the additional premiums an insurer receives driven by growth in underlying inflation sensitive exposure basis. When taking this exposure mitigant into account, our current North America Commercial loss cost trend net of these inflationary exposure benefits is approximately 4%.\n Additionally, our North America Commercial accident year loss ratio, ex CAT, is booked at 63% year-to-date, which is consistent with pure actuarial rate over loss cost and exposure trends but is a pure numerical approach and does not reflect our improved risk selection and continued improvement in terms of conditions. Those benefits will emerge over time.\n As we discussed on prior calls, since 2018, we have implemented a clear ventilation strategy in our casualty, financial lines and property portfolios that directs our capacity deployment towards higher average attachment points, which is a strong defensive measure towards rising inflation. And this strategy continues today. We also implemented the strategy in our AIG risk management loss-sensitive workers' compensation business. And over the last few years, average deductibles have increased 30% to $1.3 million.\n Turning to Personal Lines. In North America Personal, net premiums written declined nearly 4% driven by a reduction in warranty, which was partially offset by a rebound in travel. In International Personal, net premiums written declined 4% on FX-adjusted basis also due to a reduction in warranty and partially offset by growth in accident and health and travel.\n Now I'd like to spend a few minutes on our high net worth business. This is a business we will continue to invest in where there are attractive opportunities for profitability improvement. Over the last 2 years and through the second quarter, we've already invested $140 million to improve digital workflow, data, a customer interface that will provide enhanced insight and value to distribution partners and policyholders. The actions we are taking are designed to position this business to be more balanced with less density and lower volatility in order to provide more sustainable financial results.\n Let me review some of the market dynamics impacting this business that have created significant complexity and the resulting actions we are taking to reposition the portfolio. Currently, the level of reinsurance we purchased and the commensurate model ceded profit is a headwind to net premiums written growth and combined ratio improvement. This has been intentional as we are not willing to take volatility on frequency or tail risk on CAT in our high net worth business.\n Adding to this, the inability to pass on increased loss and reinsurance costs through rate increases or limit management largely due to regulatory constraints further deteriorates margin in the short run. But we have made a deliberate decision to continue writing this business as we believe the trade-off is appropriate in the near term given the opportunity we see over the long term.\n And while each of our CAT-exposed businesses has different attributes, I don't see reinsurance costs for the high net worth market generally becoming less expensive for the foreseeable future, but instead, seeing it putting pressure on the segment. In fact, for a business that is primarily underwritten in peak zones with high total insured values, reinsurance costs will likely increase and, in some cases, materially.\n To understand the complexity of reinsurance for peak zones, you need to look no further than in what has happened in the retrocessional market over the last few years. While overall small market, retrocession provides approximately $60 billion of available limit across various structures, of which roughly $20 billion is indemnity-based for reinsurers with this capacity primarily supported by alternative capital. \n The dynamics in the retrocessional market over the last few years are important to understand because they have materially changed even though overall retrocessional capacity has remained flat since 2017. First, the cost of retrocession has increased significantly more than in the reinsurance industry on a risk-adjusted basis. Second, available capacity has shifted from predominantly aggregate to predominantly occurrence. Third, first event aggregate and lower attaching occurrence retrocession have been put under significant stress. Fourth, the retrocessional market return period attachment points have increased 50%. And fifth, compounded risk-adjusted rate changes have also increased by over 50%, even though retrocessional exposure is reduced compared to prior year.\n When you couple these factors with the additional adjustments going forward for inflation, model changes, trapped capital, you have a very complicated and challenging market. Additionally, if you review global insured net cat retrocessional losses over the last decade, 9 out of 10 years have had larger contributions from secondary peril aggregate losses than peak peril losses, which highlights the complexity of modeling catastrophes.\n As a result of these dynamics and challenging circumstances, we concluded that to continue to provide high net worth clients with comprehensive solutions that meet their emerging risk issues, we needed to move property homeowners product to the non-admitted market, particularly in CAT-exposed states. In the second quarter, we exited the admitted personal property homeowners market in certain states as we could no longer maintain our level of aggregation especially given the inability to reflect the loss cost increases, inflation and increased reinsurance costs and rates as well as limitations on our ability to make coverage changes in this market.\n As part of our go-forward high net worth strategy, we're going to move homeowners and possibly other products in more states to the non-admitted market. And we plan to set up a structure that, over time, we expect to be supported by third-party capital providers in addition to AIG. This structure will provide more flexibility to manage aggregation, price, limit, terms and conditions and to innovate to solve evolving client needs. We will continue to provide coverage to our clients in the U.S. utilizing a hybrid model of non-admitted and admitted products in some states and admitted-only products in other states. \n We're already seeing the benefits of this strategy in our portfolio as the reduction in key catastrophe perils is apparent in these early stages. For example, since year-end 2021, gross wildfire PMLs are down approximately 35% to 40% across the entire PML return period curve.\n Now I want to review Russia, Ukraine. Last quarter, I addressed the many complexities and uncertainties that this situation presents, particularly those related to aviation policies issued to airline operators and leasing companies, including questions surrounding the occurrence of actual losses, loss mitigation efforts, whether any losses arise from war versus non-war apparels and the potential applicability of sanctions. These complexities and uncertainties very much continue. The claims we have received continue to be largely reported under political violence or political risk policies. And we continue to reserve our best estimate of ultimate losses, heavily comprised of IBNR despite the fact that the information we have received in connection with these claims remains very limited. Moreover, in the event of losses and the lines of business we have outlined that are subject to a potential loss, we have multiple reinsurance programs available.\n Turning to AIG 200. We started this 3-year journey in 2019. AIG 200 was designed to transform our core foundational capabilities across the company, and our financial objective was to deliver $1 billion of exit run rate savings with a cost to achieve of $1.3 billion. At the end of the second quarter, we achieved these goals 6 months earlier than expected. Delivering on these critical operational and financial objectives is a major accomplishment for our team.\n AIG 200 was successful because we maintained a tight governance structure and saw exceptional collaboration from colleagues across all major areas of the company. While the original objectives of AIG 200 have been completed, our team will remain focused on continuous improvement in operational excellence. \n AIG 200 has put the company in a significantly better place. Specifically, we modernized our IT platform, retiring over 50% of our identified applications and moving 80% of our infrastructure to the public cloud. We now have a global standard commercial underwriting platform that streamlines our processes and allows over 3,000 underwriters to make better risk management decisions in real time. This platform also includes a new global location management system that allows us to better understand and manage our PML exposure. We made significant investments in key capabilities, including building a consistent underlying data infrastructure, enhancing our digital capabilities through new distribution partner and client portals linked to a single common call center platform and fundamentally streamlined our finance reporting capabilities for faster decision-making. And we streamlined our global operations and shared services capabilities by moving over 10,000 roles to outsourcing partners.\n I want to thank all of our colleagues involved in AIG 200 for their outstanding performance. They should take great pride in knowing they established a new infrastructure and foundation for AIG that we will continue to build on and that will drive benefits for our stakeholders now and in the future.\n Turning to our capital management strategy. We will continue to be balanced and disciplined as we maintain appropriate levels of debt while returning capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends while also allowing for investment in growth opportunities across our global portfolio.\n As I said earlier, we had a very successful second quarter where we reduced net debt outstanding by $1.4 billion, repurchased $1.7 billion of common stock, paid $256 million in dividends and ended with $5.6 billion in parent liquidity. Looking ahead, with respect to debt repayment, AIG will receive the remaining $1.9 billion under the promissory note from Life and Retirement prior to the IPO. And we expect to use these proceeds to pay down additional AIG debt and for other purposes.\n With respect to share buybacks, we have $5.8 billion remaining on our current share repurchase authorization and expect to repurchase at least $1 billion of common stock in the third quarter. With respect to growth opportunities, our priorities continue to be focused on allocating capital in General Insurance where we see opportunities for profitable organic growth and further improvement in our risk-adjusted returns.\n As we discussed on our last call, we expect that post deconsolidation of the Life and Retirement business, AIG will achieve a return on common equity at or above 10%. Shane will provide more details on ROE and on capital management in his remarks.\n Shane, I'll turn the call over to you. Great. Thank you, Shane. And operator, we're prepared to take questions. Sure, Meyer. Thank you for the question. Like you said, we've provided a lot of information in our prepared remarks. But I think, Mark, why don't you go through what the effects are in exposure and also talk a little bit about sort of the loss ratio implications in the observations that we made? That's great, Mark. Thank you. Meyer, is there a follow-up? Yes. I think maybe I'd just add to that, and we'll take the next question, which is all the significant repositioning we've done in the excess and surplus lines, particularly with the Lexington. You hear a lot about in the prepared remarks because they've done such a great job between growth, rate, retention and pivoting that portfolio to be a significant contributor in terms of profitability improvement. I mean, we've gotten on property alone 16 consecutive quarters of double-digit rate increases. And as Mark alluded to, that just starts to drive margins. So we are repositioning the portfolio based on where we see the best risk-adjusted returns. Yes. Thanks, Erik. We provided a lot of sort of guidance in our prepared remarks, but let me try to add to it. Our plan has always been to do an IPO of Corebridge, and that has not changed. So now we are targeting September. I mean, we gave you some of the variables, but obviously there's more to consider like you outlined. We just felt that the market conditions in the second quarter were not conducive. We always intend to own greater than 50% following the IPO. And therefore, we'll continue to consolidate results for the foreseeable future.\n The base case is still to do secondary offerings, but those will likely take place in 2023. And so look, we're going to watch the market. We always have to be careful in terms of the conditions that exist in the regulatory approvals. But our base case has just shifted from May, June to September. And we'll watch it carefully, and we'd like to get it floating. Yes, Shane, you and Kevin want to provide some insight on that? Yes. Thanks, Brian. Yes. So as we said, we're really proud and pleased that we just finished AIG 200, and that will start to continue to earn in. The work that we did in the summer for Corebridge, we increased our expectations there over the 3-year period to be now at the upper end of the range of $400 million. So our primary focus is the underwriting excellence in terms of the improvement, the focus on continuing AIG 200 and making sure that operational excellence becomes a core part of the organization, which it already has, but we want to continue that, and then making sure that the separation of Corebridge is done flawlessly. \n At the same time, we are looking at our overall cost structure. There's a ton of work underway. And as we start executing on those other pieces, there will be -- Shane put in his prepared remarks, where we're going to get out a meaningful amount up to $500 million more of expenses. That's the remaining company within AIG. So that will start to get executed.\n As we start to deconsolidate, we'll have a path forward as we flow Corebridge and be able to give you more guidance. I don't have a percentage. I focus on the nominal in terms of -- when I look at even like General Insurance over the last 5 quarters where we've invested a lot in the business, the nominal GOE has not gone up. I mean, so the expense discipline is there. And we want to continue to benefit from the earned savings with AIG 200 and what we will take out in terms of the combined entity when we go forward. But we want to have an organization that is going to be world-class in terms of its overall expense ratios.\n And I think we've proven that we not only can take it out in a really constructive way because we're investing for the future, but we maintain that level going forward. We have growth opportunities in the top line, which will help the ratios. I mean, the commercial business is growing, excluding AIG Re, which the reason why I've excluded is that we're not trying to grow that business based on the CAT exposures today, but growing at 10%. We see opportunities to grow in the future when we look to the back half of this year. We have very strong retention. The new business that's been coming in is going to be more retained. It's the fifth quarter in a row where we produced more than $1 billion of new business, all very positive, all helpful to our ratios. And so we feel like we have a lot of momentum. I don't think so based on the makeup of the portfolio. But Mark, why don't we end where we started with you just to give a little bit of perspective and then you can turn it back to me. Thanks, Mark. Thanks a lot, Brian. Have a great day. And thanks, everybody, for joining us. Really appreciate the time, and have a great day."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to AIG's First Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. This conference is being recorded. Now at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead. \nQuentin McMillan: Thanks very much, Jake. Good morning. Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by the applicable securities laws, AIG is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statement if circumstances or management's estimates or opinion should change.  \n Additionally, today's remarks may refer to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at www.aig.com. \n With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino. \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review our first quarter financial results. I'm very pleased to report that AIG had an excellent start to 2022. We are successfully executing on several strategic, operational and financial priorities, and our team has significant momentum on many fronts, which we believe will continue throughout the year.  \n Following my remarks, Shane will provide more detail on our financial results, and then we will take questions. Mark Lyons, David McElroy and Kevin Hogan will join us for the Q&A portion of today's call.  \n Today, I will cover 4 topics. First, I will outline the tremendous progress we've made towards the separation of our Life and Retirement business, which will be renamed Corebridge Financial. Second, I will review the excellent first quarter performance of General Insurance, where we continue to drive top line growth, particularly in Global Commercial, and saw meaningful improvement in underwriting profitability. Third, I will cover Life and Retirement's financial performance. This business remains a meaningful contributor to our overall results. And fourth, I'll provide an update on our capital management strategy, particularly as to stock buybacks, which we plan to accelerate over the course of 2022, given our positive view of AIG's future over the near, medium and long term.  \n Before I turn to these topics, I'd like to discuss the situation in Russia and Ukraine. It goes without saying that what is happening is heartbreaking. Ukrainian people are experiencing unimaginable pain and suffering. And it's our hope that a peaceful resolution will be achieved.  \n With respect to the insurance industry, we've not seen a situation like this in modern times. It presents a unique set of circumstances that make any exposure or coverage analysis complex. Let me start by commenting on what we saw at AIG in the first quarter and what we did with a few claims that were submitted.  \n The claims we received were largely reported under political violence or political risk policies. While the amount of information included in the claims was limited, we did reserve our best estimate of ultimate losses, including IBNR. While we know it will take time for the full impact of the Russia-Ukraine situation to emerge, based on the work we did in the first quarter to analyze our exposures and review known claims, we do not believe the impact will be material to AIG. And in the event of losses, we have multiple reinsurance programs available.  \n With respect to the industry more broadly, there's not been much discussion so far in this earnings season regarding what the Russia-Ukraine situation means. So I thought I'd spend a few minutes on the complexity that it presents.  \n As a starting point, it's important to bear in mind that standard property and energy policies issued to the types of insureds most likely to have suffered losses due to the conflict typically contain broad exclusions for losses arising at a war and other hostile acts. In instances where affirmative coverage has been provided for losses that would typically fall within the scope of these exclusions, the most relevant coverages relate to policies such as political violence, political risk and trade credit, aviation and marine.  \n Now I'd like to spend a few minutes on aviation because it's the topic that has received the most attention over the last 30 to 45 days. Aviation is similarly complex and it will take time before all the relevant facts and resulting coverage implications fully emerge.  \n Let me start with what we know. We know that aviation policies can be issued to both airline operators and airline leasing companies and typically provide separate coverage for, on the one hand, losses caused by war perils, such as nationalization and confiscation; and on the other hand, losses caused by nonwar perils.  \n We also know that the invasion of Ukraine first occurred on February 24, and there were sanctions issued by the U.K. and the EU on February 26, which have since been updated. These sanctions generally required airline lessors to cancel leases with Russian airline operators and gave them a brief period in which to do so. Additionally, we know that there was an aircraft reregistration law passed in Russia on March 14, which permitted Russian airline operators to reregister aircraft leased from Western lessors on the Russian aircraft registry.  \n What we don't know is much more expansive. As an initial matter, we don't know whether or to what extent actual losses have occurred or when they occurred, given the uncertainty surrounding the location and condition of aircraft and other equipment as well as the timing of their potential return to lessors, nor do we know if efforts have been undertaken by lessors to mitigate any damages.  \n As to the question of losses caused by war perils versus nonwar perils, this is a critical question that will need to be answered as the outcome will determine which policy might apply and the amount of coverage that may be available.  \n With respect to war perils such as government confiscation, this type of loss would typically be included in a whole war policy, but it must be first be determined if there's an actual confiscation. Even where it is determined that a government confiscation took place, consideration will also have to be given to the timing of notices and the geographic scope of coverage. The answers to these questions will impact whether there is a covered loss and, if so, whether a given whole war policy response.  \n With respect to reinsurance, structures likely implicated in a war peril scenario include war, marine and energy and political violence, but it's also possible that other types of reinsurance contracts could be available for recoveries. If a loss is alleged to be due to a nonwar peril, it could be covered in an all-risk policy. As an initial matter, however, a determination would need to be made that a loss in fact has occurred and then, if it has, that is due to a nonwar peril.  \n Additionally, as with war perils, you would have to consider if reinsurance is available. The reinsurance that would be typically available in an all-risk scenario may be in different structures than in government confiscation or other war peril scenario.  \n As to all potentially covered perils, there are many issues requiring analysis, including the potential applicability of any sanctions. Assuming claim payments are made, insurers will also have to consider their recovery rights through salvage and subrogation and contribution from other available insurance. This is just a high-level summary of some of the issues the industry will grapple with, but I thought they were important to highlight, and you get the idea that it's a complex situation.  \n Now turning to the separation of Life and Retirement. We made significant progress to prepare this business to be a stand-alone public company. We continue to target an IPO in the second quarter, subject to market conditions and required regulatory approvals. We also continue to expect that we will retain a greater than 50% interest in this business post IPO. As you can appreciate, given where we are in the process, there are limitations on how much I can say about Life and Retirement, but let me give you some highlights of what we've accomplished since our last call. In March, we announced several important milestones: the public filing of the S-1; the new name for Life and Retirement which, as I mentioned, is Corebridge Financial; and the Independent Directors who currently serve on the Corebridge Board of Directors and those who will join and strengthen the Board as of the IPO.  \n At the same time, we launched a $6 billion Corebridge senior notes offering which was upsized to $6.5 billion based on significant demand. Shane will provide more detail on the maturities and coupons. We also made substantial progress on the operational separation of the Life and Retirement business from AIG, including identifying $200 million to $300 million of cost savings for this business, inclusive of $125 million in savings already in flight as part of our AIG 200 transformation program. And we continue to execute on establishing a hybrid investment management model that will allow Corebridge to benefit from strategic partnerships with world-class firms that offer excellent origination and investment capabilities and that complement our own capabilities in asset classes such as commercial mortgage loans, global real estate and private equity.  \n The first step in moving to this hybrid model was our strategic partnership with Blackstone, which we announced in 2021. In March of this year, we announced an arrangement with BlackRock, whereby BlackRock will manage up to $90 billion of Corebridge's liquid assets.  \n In addition, we developed a plan to modernize the mid- and back-office functionalities of the business and the transition to BlackRock's Aladdin technology platform with respect to Life and Retirement's entire investment portfolio. Aladdin enables us to replace aging and end-of-life technology infrastructure, provides risk analytics, establishes a single accounting book of record and a single investments book of record as well as reporting, stress testing and other services currently performed across multiple systems at AIG.  \n We expect that the cost for Corebridge to operate this hybrid model, taking into account both Blackstone and BlackRock, will be approximately the same as the fully loaded costs of our prior investment management operating model, where asset management was largely handled in-house.  \n Shifting to our first quarter financial results. As you saw in our press release, adjusted after-tax income was $1.30 per diluted share, representing an increase of 24% year-over-year. This result was driven by significant improvement in profitability in General Insurance, good results in Life and Retirement considering the current environment, continued expense discipline, savings from AIG 200 and strong execution of our capital management strategy.  \n In General Insurance, we reported an accident year combined ratio, excluding CAT, of 89.5%, a 290 basis point improvement year-over-year and the 15th consecutive quarter of improvement. We were especially pleased with the accident year combined ratio, excluding CAT and commercial, which was 86%, an improvement of 440 basis points year-over-year.  \n In Life and Retirement, first quarter results benefited from product diversity despite headwinds in the capital markets. Return on adjusted segment common equity was 10%. AIG ended the first quarter with $9.1 billion in parent liquidity after returning $1.7 billion to shareholders through $1.4 billion of common stock repurchases and $265 million of dividends.  \n Now let me provide more detail on our first quarter results in General Insurance, where we continue to drive improved financial performance, with core fundamentals being key contributors. Gross premiums written increased 10% on an FX-adjusted basis to $11.5 billion, with commercial growing 11% and personal growing 8%. Net premiums written increased 5% on an FX-adjusted basis to $6.5 billion. This growth was led by our commercial business, which grew 8% with personal contracting 1%. Growth in North America Commercial net premiums written was 6% and then International net premiums written growth was 10%, both on an FX-adjusted basis.  \n I'd like to unpack certain components of North America Commercial net premiums written as we had a very strong growth in our core business that may not be immediately obvious. While there are always movements each quarter in various aspects of our portfolio, both positive and negative, there were 3 items that impacted the first quarter that I'd like to provide more insight on. These items relate to assumed and ceded reinsurance and the timing of purchases, which is not something we have focused on previously but which I think is worth spending a few minutes on given the impact they had on North America Commercial net premiums written.  \n The first item relates to AIG Re, our assumed reinsurance business. Financial results for AIG Re are included in the financial results for North America Commercial and, in the first quarter, represented 40% of the segment's total net premiums written. For AIG Re, the first quarter is the largest quarter of the year with over 50% of its annual business written at 1/1. In the first quarter of 2022, AIG Re's net premiums written were flat year-over-year. This result was deliberate as we applied a disciplined approach to underwriting, and the market environment that persisted leading up to 1/1 led us to conclude that AIG Re could not achieve appropriate levels of risk-adjusted returns in property CAT, in particular, even with a comprehensive retrocessional program in place.  \n As a result, we reduced gross limits deployed in property CAT primarily in the U.S. by $500 million, which was the main reason for AIG Re's net premiums written being flat.  \n With respect to the second item, you may recall that in 2021, AIG Re made discrete retrocessional purchases throughout the year to further reduce frequency and volatility, whereas this year, retrocessional purchases were consolidated into the 1/1/2022 renewals as the retro market rebalanced. As a result of this decision, AIG Re ceded premiums were higher in the first quarter of 2022, which also reduced North America Commercial's net premiums written when compared to the first quarter 2021.  \n Third, a similar dynamic occurred with respect to our core property CAT reinsurance program for AIG. In 2021, we purchased reinsurance throughout the year to lower net retentions and reduce volatility, particularly with respect to North America property CAT. In 2022, however, those purchases were also consolidated into our core property CAT placement at 1/1.  \n We were able to consolidate these reinsurance purchases because our portfolio is much improved from last year with significantly reduced exposures. Like the actions we took in AIG Re, however, this reduced North America Commercial net premiums written in the first quarter.  To summarize, some of these headwinds in the first quarter of 2022 will largely reverse in the second quarter. \n Now turning back to growth. In North America Commercial, we saw a very strong growth in net premiums written, particularly in Retail Property, which grew more than 20%; Crop Risk Services, which also grew more than 20%; Lexington wholesale, which grew more than 15% led by property, which grew more than 50%; and our Canadian commercial business, which grew more than 15%.  \n In International Commercial, we also saw very strong growth, including in property, which grew 50%; specialty, which grew 34% driven by energy and marine; and Financial Lines, which grew 14%. In Global Commercial, we also had very strong renewal retention of 86% in our in-force portfolio in both North America and International, with North America improving retention by 300 basis points and International retention holding constant year-over-year. We calculate renewal retention prior to the impact of rate and exposure changes.  \n And across commercial on a global basis, our new business was very strong, coming in north of $1 billion for the fourth consecutive quarter. New business growth in North America and in International were both up 13%. North America new business growth was led by Lexington and Retail Property. International Commercial new business growth was led by Financial Lines and global specialty.  \n Turning to rate. Strong momentum continued in Global Commercial, with overall rate increases of 9% or 10% if you exclude workers' compensation. And in the aggregate, rate continued to exceed loss cost trends. This continues to be a market in which we are achieving rate on rate in many cases for the fourth consecutive year and where we're successfully driving margin expansion above loss cost trends.  \n North America Commercial achieved 8% rate increases overall, 10% excluding workers' compensation, with some areas achieving double-digit increases led by Retail Property, which increased 14%; Lexington, which increased 13%; Financial Lines, which increased 12%, including more than 85% rate increases in cyber; and Canada, where rate increased 13%, representing the 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit rate increases in this region.  \n International Commercial rate increases were 10% overall driven by Financial Lines, which increased 21%, including more than 60% rate increases in cyber; property, which increased 14%; EMEA, which also increased 14%; and Asia Pac, which increased 10%.  \n Last quarter, we indicated that our severity trend view in the aggregate in North America Commercial range from 4% to 5% and that we were migrating towards the upper end of that range. We now believe the upper end is moving towards 5.5% mostly driven by shorter-tail lines. Our property rate changes, where we continue to achieve mid-teen increases, equal or exceed loss cost trends in our own data and in government-published inflationary indices. Our liability trend assumptions continue to be in the 7% to 9% range, with International indications continuing to be less than those in North America.  \n Turning to Personal Lines. In North America, personal net premiums written grew nearly 40%, albeit off a smaller base, driven by a rebound in Travel and A&H, which was offset by a reduction in Warranty and increased reinsurance cessions supporting Private Client Group. International Personal saw a 5% reduction in net premiums written on an FX-adjusted basis, due to a reduction in Warranty and personal auto in Japan offset by a rebound in A&H and Travel. Overall, Personal Lines is an area where we continue to invest where there are attractive opportunities for profitable growth.  \n Now let me review Life and Retirement's results. This business had a good quarter considering the headwinds created by the capital markets. These market dynamics were offset by continued strong alternative investment income and strong growth in premiums and deposits, which increased 13% year-over-year to $7.3 billion. Adjusted pretax income in the first quarter was $724 million, with return on attributed segment equity of 10%. Adjusted pretax income decreased in the period due to lower call and tender income and continued elevated COVID-19 mortality, which is still within our previously established guidance.  \n Blackstone's capabilities in the early days of our partnership resulted in Life and Retirement seeing one of its strongest fixed annuity sales quarters in over a decade, with premiums and deposits up nearly 150% year-over-year to $1.6 billion, while surrenders and death benefits both improved slightly. Post separation, we continue to expect that Life and Retirement, meaning Corebridge, will achieve a return on equity of 12% to 14%, and that it will pay an annual dividend of $600 million.  \n Overall, I'm pleased with the momentum in Life and Retirement and, in particular, the early success of our partnership with Blackstone that was evident in the first quarter results.  \n With respect to capital management, we had a very active first quarter, which ended with $9.1 billion in parent liquidity. As a result of the actions I outlined earlier in my remarks, AIG received $6.5 billion of the $8.3 billion promissory note issued to AIG from Corebridge, and those funds were used to repay outstanding AIG debt, resulting in AIG's interest expense being reduced by 23% year-over-year.  In addition, AIG will receive the remaining $1.9 billion under the Corebridge promissory note during the second quarter.  \n Our capital management strategy will continue to be both balanced and disciplined as we maintain appropriate levels of debt while returning capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends while also allowing for investment in growth opportunities across our global portfolio. This will also be true over time as we continue to sell down our stake in Life and Retirement.  \n With respect to share buybacks, as I mentioned earlier, we repurchased $1.4 billion of common stock in the first quarter and are on track to buy back at least $1 billion more in the second quarter. This will leave us with approximately $1.5 billion remaining under our prior Board authorization. And as you saw in our press release, the AIG Board of Directors recently authorized an additional $5 billion in share repurchases.  \n With respect to growth opportunities, our priorities continue to be focused on allocating capital in General Insurance, where we see opportunities for profitable organic growth and further improvement in our risk-adjusted returns. As we move through 2022 and are further along with the separation of Life and Retirement, we will provide updates regarding our capital management strategy.  \n Before I turn the call over to Shane, I want to emphasize how pleased I am with how we started the year across AIG and how we are continuing to execute on multiple complex strategic priorities with high-quality results that are positioning AIG as a top-performing company. Our teams have overperformed across the board, and our deep bench continues to provide us with opportunities to leverage skill sets and further develop talent across the organization. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Shane. \nShane Fitzsimons: Thank you, Peter, and good morning to all. I am very pleased to be AIG's CFO, and I look forward to working with everyone moving forward. I will provide more detail on our first quarter financial results and unpack a number of our key performance metrics, specifically EPS, liquidity, leverage, net investment income and ROCE. \n I will begin by going through the financial results of the businesses in the quarter. I will then touch upon the balance sheet, leverage and liquidity, which benefited from excellent execution on a number of capital transactions. I will then supplement Peter's remarks on the separation of Corebridge, including the arrangement we announced with BlackRock and liability management actions we recently completed. I will then spend some time on investment income and will provide insight on the impact of rising interest rates. And finally, I will talk about the execution path towards our long-term 10% ROCE goal for AIG, including income drivers, AIG 200 and other areas of corporate GOE reduction. \n As Peter mentioned, adjusted EPS attributable to AIG common shareholders grew 24% year-over-year to $1.30 per diluted common share compared to $1.05 per diluted common share in 1 quarter '21. Compared to the first quarter '21, improvements in General Insurance contributed $0.33 year-over-year, reduction in share count contributed $0.07 and lower interest expense contributed $0.04, offset by Life and Retirement being $0.19 unfavorable primarily due to $0.20 unfavorable due to lower net investment income. \n General Insurance's adjusted pretax income contribution in the quarter was $1.2 billion, which reflects strong underwriting profit, growth in Global Commercial and continued improvement in both the GAAP combined ratio up 590 basis points to 92.9% and the accident year combined ratio ex CAT improving 290 basis points to 89.5%. The combined ratio improvement was due to improved underwriting, premium growth, expense discipline and lower CATs, which all contributed to pretax underwriting income being 6x higher than the first quarter of 2021, increasing to $446 million from $73 million. With net investment income down $7 million year-over-year, the $366 million improvement in adjusted pretax income was driven by underwriting income, of which $223 million was from improved accident year underwriting income, $146 million due to lower CAT and $4 million from improved net PYD. \n North America Commercial has shown a 580 basis points improvement in the accident year combined ratio ex CAT over the prior year quarter, coming in at 88.1%. International Commercial also continued to improve profitability with 330 basis points improvement in the accident year combined ratio ex CAT this quarter, coming in at 83.5% for the first quarter. \n Personal Insurance GAAP combined ratio of 97.2% improved by 160 basis points year-over-year. In the first quarter, CAT losses were $274 million or 4.5 loss ratio points compared to $422 million or 7.3 loss ratio points in the prior year quarter. The most significant loss events in the quarter came from flooding in Australia and a Japanese earthquake. The ongoing events with Russia and Ukraine, which Peter discussed, contributed approximately $85 million of the estimated loss. \n Prior year development, excluding related premium adjustments, was $93 million favorable this quarter compared to favorable development of $56 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter, the ADC amortization provided $42 million of favorable development, and the balance of $51 million favorable arose from old accident years in U.S. workers' compensation along with short-tail lines in North America and in Japan Personal Lines. \n Life and Retirement adjusted pretax income of $724 million compared to $941 million in 1Q '21, a reduction of $217 million mostly attributable to lower net investment income, which was $2.1 billion in the quarter compared to $2.4 billion in the prior year quarter, a decrease of $224 million, reflecting lower call and tender activity from rising interest rates; the absence of the affordable housing portfolio, which was sold in fourth quarter '21 as well as reduced fee income; and an increase in deferred acquisition cost and statement of position reserves due to lower separate account asset values. \n Within Individual Retirement, excluding the Retail Mutual Fund business, which was sold, net flows were positive $874 million this quarter compared to positive net flows of $50 million in the prior year quarter, benefiting from higher fixed annuity sales aided by origination activity through the Blackstone partnership. \n Group Retirement grew deposits by 3.9% in the quarter, driven by higher group acquisition and individual deposits driving a slight uptick in fee and advisory income due to higher assets under administration. Life Insurance adjusted pretax income was a loss of $44 million due to continued elevated COVID mortality, while premium and deposits grew 3.4% to $1.2 billion, benefiting from growth of international life sales. Institutional Markets grew premiums and deposits as well as reserves due to increased pension risk transfer activity in the period. \n Turning to Other Operations, which includes interest expense, corporate general operating expenses, institutional asset management expense, runoff portfolios and eliminations and was a positive contributor to adjusted pretax income year-over-year by $109 million. These results benefited from lower interest expense of $51 million as we reduced our general borrowings through the course of 2021 by $4 billion and lower eliminations of $43 million. Corporate general operating expenses, excluding increased functional costs to set up Corebridge as a stand-alone public company of $6 million, were largely flat year-over-year. \n Moving on to the balance sheet, leverage and liquidity. Our financial flexibility remains strong. We closed the quarter with $9.1 billion of parent liquidity. We saw a large AOCI movement as a result of increase in interest rates. Adjusted AOCI, which excludes the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude, moved from $3.9 billion positive to a $5.9 billion negative, or a reduction of $9.8 billion. Although this mark-to-market impact is a drag on capital, as long as we hold the assets to maturity, we will not realize this unrealized loss. \n Operating interest rate movements impact our metrics primarily in 2 places: one, we end up with a gain on the Fortitude Re embedded derivative, which impacted GAAP EPS by $3.21 in the quarter; and second, it impacts our GAAP leverage by a little over 300 basis points. And with interest rates up another 55 basis points in April, we expect to see further movement in Q2. \n We exited the quarter at a GAAP leverage of 27.8%, up from 24.6%, the increase of which is attributable to the AOCI movement. The impact is larger in Life and Retirement than General Insurance given the duration of their respective asset portfolios. \n Total adjusted return on common equity was 7.6%, up from 7.4% in the first quarter '21, and total company adjusted tangible return on common equity was 8.3%. General Insurance's adjusted attributable return on common equity was 12.3% in the first quarter, while Life and Retirement was 10%. Adjusted book value per share of $70.72 increased 2.7% sequentially and 20.5% year-over-year. Adjusted tangible book value per share of $64.65 increased 2.9% sequentially and 22.3% year-over-year. \n Our primary operating subsidiaries remain profitable and well capitalized, with General Insurance's U.S. pool fleet risk-based capital ratio for the first quarter estimated to be between 470% and 480%, and  the Life and Retirement U.S. fleet is estimated to be between 430% and 440%, both well above our target ranges. \n Finally, on EPS during the quarter. We repurchased 23 million shares at an average cost of $60.02 for $1.4 billion, bringing our ending share count to 800 million with a quarterly average of 826 million compared to 876 million in the prior year quarter, representing a 6% reduction in average share count, which contributed $0.07 of EPS growth in the quarter. \n Turning to Corebridge. Since the start of the year, we continue to make progress on numerous fronts with respect to the separation. As Peter mentioned, at the end of the first quarter, Corebridge entered into a strategic partnership with BlackRock to manage up to $90 billion of liquid assets. At the same time, AIG also entered into a separate arrangement with BlackRock, whereby BlackRock will manage liquid assets for AIG representing up to $60 billion. Having now signed IMAs, we expect to begin transferring assets to BlackRock over the course of the second quarter. \n In early April, Corebridge successfully raised $6.5 billion of senior notes which, along with the remaining $2.5 billion of delayed draw term loan facility and commitments for the $2.5 billion of revolving credit facility, this establishes the capital structure for Corebridge Financial. AIG proactively hedged treasury rates earlier in the year, and upon unwinding the hedge at quarter end, AIG realized a $223 million gain, which equates to approximately 50 basis points in yield on the notes issued. While the debt issuance closed early in Q2, the $223 million gain was realized as a gain in the first quarter. \n The senior notes offering, excluding the hedge, was well structured and laddered with a 3.91% weighted average coupon rate. Corebridge used the proceeds from that offering to repay $6.4 billion of the $8.3 billion promissory note payable to AIG. Following the success of Corebridge's senior notes issuance, AIG initiated a debt tender offer. Taking advantage of strong demand, the tender offer was upsized, and AIG parent debt was ultimately reduced by $6.8 billion. An additional EUR 750 million will be redeemed on May 10, bringing the total expected AIG parent debt reduction to $7.6 billion. The average coupon on the debt that we retired was 3.82%, and the annualized interest expense savings is approximately $290 million. \n We continue to target debt leverage in the high 20s, excluding AOCI for Corebridge; and in the low 20s, including AOCI for AIG going forward. Given the significant progress we have made and with $1.9 billion of proceeds from the $8.3 billion note yet to be received, we have the necessary cash to finalize our planned debt actions without utilizing any of the proceeds from the IPO. With these actions completed, we remain on track for an IPO in the second quarter subject to market conditions and regulatory approval. \n Net investment income on an adjusted pretax income basis for the quarter was $3 billion. Total cash and investments were $305 billion, excluding Fortitude. Net investment income in the first quarter decreased $193 million compared to prior year, primarily reflecting lower call and tender income. \n The first quarter saw significant increases in benchmark treasury yields, with an 80 basis point increase on the 10-year. With General Insurance and Life and Retirement's portfolio durations of 4 and 8.4 years, respectively, the overall rising interest rate environment will provide a tailwind to our investment portfolio returns. \n In April, our portfolio crossed the equilibrium point, where new money yield is now 50 basis points higher on average than the yield on the assets rolling off the portfolio. The new money yield is higher by 20 basis points in General Insurance versus assets rolling off and 70 basis points in Life and Retirement versus the yield on sales and maturities currently. \n Moving forward, the new money yield is roughly 60 basis points higher than the current portfolio in General Insurance and roughly 90 basis points higher in Life and Retirement. To illustrate the point, holding all other variables constant and assuming 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve, we would anticipate approximately $500 million of benefit to adjusted net investment income over a 1-year period with nearly $200 million in General Insurance and $300 million in Life and Retirement. \n Within General Insurance, we have $11 billion of floating rate securities, which will begin to see some benefits in the near term, most of which are not tied to longer-dated liabilities. Life and Retirement is $25 billion of floating rate assets, but most of this portfolio is tied to floating rate liabilities that will offset the benefits. \n Turning to investments that have Russian exposure. At December 31, AIG held $359 million of sovereign and other foreign debt of the Russian Federation, of which $79 million were within Fortitude. Through proactive sell-downs of $129 million, which generated a loss of $41 million as well as the establishment of a credit allowance of $127 million, the market value of these securities at the end of the first quarter was $86 million, of which $18 million is held by Fortitude. \n Looking ahead, we have 3 priorities beyond continued progress on underwriting optimization and completing AIG 200. They are the successful separation of the Life and Retirement business, continued execution on our capital management priorities and ROCE improvement towards 10%. Post deconsolidation of Corebridge, we expect that AIG will earn a 10% ROCE, although there are many moving pieces that will get to this result, including the size and timing of the Corebridge IPO, additional capital management actions and continued progress on reducing expenses. \n As we've improved expense ratios in General Insurance, one of the key drags on ROCE is corporate expenses, which we have been reducing through AIG 200 and work on the separation, but there remains more work to be done. As Peter noted, with respect to AIG 200, we continue to achieve significant milestones and, in the first quarter, reached $890 million of exit run rate savings with $590 million of that realized to date. We currently expect to have full line of sight into the $1 billion of exit run rate savings either contracted or identified by the end of the second quarter, 6 months earlier than originally planned. \n Of the $1 billion of parent expenses, we expect that approximately $300 million will move to Corebridge upon deconsolidation. We will continue to provide updates over time, but the components to get to a 10% ROCE, our continued growth in underwriting profit; improved net investment income as we benefit from higher interest rates; continued execution on expense management, particularly at parent; and optimizing capital allocation in terms of leverage and returns to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and dividends whilst making sure that we continue to grow the company. \n Peter, I will now hand it back to you. \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: Thank you, Shane. Operator, we're ready for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will begin with Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. \nElyse Greenspan: My first question is on the capital return that you guys laid out. So you guys have just over $9 billion at the holdco. Peter, I think you said a minimum buyback of $1 billion for the second quarter. But just given that you have above $9 billion at the holdco with additional capital coming later this year, I would think that there's some flexibility to perhaps go above that $1 billion. So can you just kind of walk us through a little bit more how you're thinking about uses of capital for growth relative to buyback at least in the short term? \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: Yes. Thanks, Elyse, for the question. Yes, we said we would do a minimum of $1 billion of share repurchases in the second quarter. I think Shane and I tried to do as much detail as we could in our prepared remarks in aligning what our priorities are for capital management. And certainly, the Board's authorization for an additional $5 billion says that we will continue to return capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. \n We think the positioning of the business, I mean, I think you see in the results, we see great opportunities for top line growth. We see it across the world. We see it in the commercial businesses, but also what you would have seen in some of the international that's probably [ amasses ] that. Accident & Health has started to rebound over the last 3 quarters, and we're starting to see top line growth there. So we want to make sure that we are allocating the appropriate capital for growth in driving margin and making the company look at its opportunities on risk-adjusted returns and make sure that we're capitalizing on the market and our discipline. \n I think really, when we get to the actual IPO and Corebridge as a public company, we'll be able to outline the capital management strategy in more detail. But we wanted to provide as much guidance as we could based on what we know today, and we would expect to continue to make the progress that we've demonstrated in the earnings call today. \nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then my follow-up, you guys pointed out that you raised some of your severity assumptions within General Insurance on the short-tail side. When you guys set out that target for the accident year combined ratio of sub-90 for this year, was that contemplated? And then should -- how about the cadence, can you give us a sense? Should we think about sequential improvement from the Q1 level as we move through the year? Or is there some seasonality that we should be considering within General Insurance? \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: Let me take the first part, and then I'll ask Mark to comment on the loss cost observations. We've seen -- when you think about the quality in the results that we produced this quarter, when we look at our business, what do we look at? We look at client retention, which continues to improve. We look at new business, so we're acquiring a lot of new clients across the world. And so that continues to progress and think that there's a lot of momentum there. We look at rate above loss cost trends. And so that was favorable, and we continue to get rate in areas where we believe it is required in terms of its risk-adjusted returns and, again, with our leadership in terms of deploying capital. \n Are all the inflation factors considered in the sub-90? Well, no. We obviously are adjusting them, but the outperformance that we have been driving wasn't contemplated either. I mean like we're making more progress on the business at a faster pace and think that we will continue to show that we can grow the business top line and generate the risk-adjusted returns and improvement in combined ratios. Mark, do you want to comment on the loss cost? \nMark Lyons;Executive VP & CFO: Yes. Thank you, Peter. So I think Peter answered it very well. But what I'll do is just reemphasize that, yes, I mean the context of your question, we gave that original guidance before there was any spike of inflation. But like I think any good company, you don't forecast just a point estimate. You're forecasting a range, and those ranges vary by line of business, and they all meld together. And even with the changing inflation assumptions, we'd still be inside that range. So we're comfortable with that. \nOperator: We'll go to Meyer Shields with KBW. \nMeyer Shields: I think this might also be a question for Mark [ as to tax query ]. We're clearly seeing a little bit less core loss ratio improvement than the simple mathematical application of earned rate increases and loss trend. And I was hoping you could talk about how that's manifesting itself in prior year reserve reviews. \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: Yes. Mark, please take that. I mean I think it's also important to give some context of the portfolio shift as well, Mark, when we look at loss ratios? \nMark Lyons;Executive VP & CFO: Yes, happy to. And thank you, Meyer, for the question. So I think on that side, first, on the reserve side, when you look at our view of inflation and severity trends and so forth, you really got to separate short-tailed lines from longer-tailed lines, right? And like in our view, the evidence within our own information as well as looking at external indices, whether it's from the perspective of the purchaser or the seller, it's clearer with -- in property-oriented lines. \n And it's probably worth noting, back to Peter's comment on mix, is that less than 10% of our pre-ADC reserves are property. So it can't move the needle too much anyway. So I don't really view that as an issue. \n And in terms of nonproperty, we've gone through looking at various basis point scenarios of lift and for various durations associated with it. And we still feel that all of that is pretty contained. And don't forget, especially on longer-tailed lines, there's still a high proportion of total reserves subject to the ADC on recoverables as well. \n So in terms of the -- your first part of your question with regard to the arithmetic versus what's there, I think we've addressed this before, Meyer, but I'm happy to give some comments again. which is the book has changed so dramatically from policy year '18, '19, '20 '21 and its accident year conversions that you need a margin of safety associated with it because nobody backs a thousand on these things. But there's been a radical change in the quality of the risk, the distribution strategy that Dave McElroy and his team have instituted getting much better risk portfolio churn purposely done to improve it, all the limit changes that Peter has talked about over time. And as a result, the arithmetic just doesn't pan out, let alone the change in mix that has been purposeful, let alone the change in net mix. So all of those changes simultaneously require, in our view, a reasonable range of margin of safety, and that's what you're seeing. \nMeyer Shields: Okay. That's very helpful. A quick follow-up, if I can. I know there are a lot of moving parts, but is there any way of quantifying the impact of the reinsurance purchasing timing on the expense ratio in the quarter? \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: Thanks, Meyer. I'll take that. As I said, it's going to be a headwind in the first quarter will be a tailwind in the second quarter. Once we -- there's a couple of moving pieces. We can't really provide the exact numbers, but you can look at like in the second quarter where we purchased down on the North America Commercial CAT to lower retentions as well as in AIG Re, where we reduced volatility by buying single shop per occurrence retrocessional at the second quarter, and both recovered by the way, last year. So we felt that reducing the net retentions was appropriate and carrying that forward into how we were going to structure the 1/1 treaty for AIG as well as the retrocessional covers for AIG Re. \n So we have lower nets than we would have at this time last year. It's not uncommon to purchase sometimes midterm if there's available capacity and you're still trying to evolve a program, but we felt very good about the consolidation of those programs at 1/1 and really like the reinsurance that we have in both instances. \nOperator: And now we'll hear from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. \nRyan Tunis: A couple of questions, just following up from the first 2 question askers. First one, we saw about 3.5 points of sequential loss ratio improvement this quarter in Commercial Lines in general. I noticed that, last year, we also saw like the biggest sequential move in the first quarter. So I'm curious if there's something about 1Q, if it's setting a loss pick assumption or something like that, that's leading to that level of sequential jump that's outsized. \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: Yes. Let me start. Thanks very much for the question. We have -- there's -- Mark touched on a little bit, and I'll ask if he has any additional comments after I make a few observations on the mix of business. But what we have in the first quarter, obviously, is a big AIG Re, which when you look at if you're changing the composition of the portfolio from reducing CAT to doing more proportional, you're going to have lower loss ratios, higher acquisition costs. And so that will have a sometimes impact in terms of how it earns into the first quarter. \n We also had, in terms of the overall General Insurance business, the mix changes because, on the one hand, we wanted to make sure that we were patient with A&H, which is a great business for us and Travel in terms of its rebound after COVID but not really reducing the overall overhead. But it does have an impact in terms of the mix and acquisition expense and loss ratio. \n The other thing you have to consider where we started, I mean, the incredible improvement that we've had in the portfolio has been disciplined. We've always talked about underwriting from a risk selection standpoint, terms and conditions, attachment, reducing volatility with supplementing reinsurance and then, of course, price above loss cost. And I think when you do that sequentially and maintain the same level of discipline, we start to see the outcome produced like we had in the first quarter. Mark, anything you want to add to that? \nMark Lyons;Executive VP & CFO: Yes. Thank you, Peter. Yes, I think your point about mix is right on point. And remember, there's 2 mixes. You've got the mix on the front end and then you got the mix changes that manifest by the reinsurance purchases and how they earn in over time. So you got both of those factors. \n I think, secondly, there's also the realization that, over time, the property and shorter-tailed businesses over the last couple of years are a -- you got to watch the mix of that over time. And therefore, with the mix of medium- and longer-term lines that have volatility associated with them that you got to watch kidding yourself that the quarter-by-quarter is super predictable. If you get the accident year right, I'm happy. Accident quarter by accident quarter is a little bit more of an academic exercise. So I think that may be some of what you're seeing. \nRyan Tunis: Got it. My follow-up just on the acquisition cost ratio. When you think about the reinsurance purchasing, the ceding commissions, the change in the mix, can you guys make a directional assessment at this point about should the acquisition cost in General Insurance, should that ratio be higher or lower in 2022 over 2021? \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: It's hard to predict. I think your first part of the question is do ceding commissions as they start an earn-in benefit, the overall expense ratio. The answer is yes. It wasn't always the case when we were starting the turnaround and -- but today, we have market terms or better on ceding commissions, and that starts to earn in. \n But I hate to go back to Travel and Accident & Health. I mean those really dipped during the pandemic. And the U.S. rebounded first. International is starting to rebound. And those businesses just by its nature of how they're set up have lower loss ratios and higher acquisition expenses. So it's hard to predict. I mean what's the recovery look like, what's our growth look like, what's the mix of business look like? So it's really hard, Ryan, to give a forecast in terms of what the impact is. \n What we will focus on all the time is improvement in accident combined ratio. So we're not going to be shifting from one category of loss ratio in [ DAC ] or back. I mean we're going to make sure we're focused on the portfolio optimization and mix of business to improve the overall results. \nOperator: And now we'll hear from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. \nTaylor Scott: First question I had is just on the Life and Retirement side. When I look at the 10% ROE, it held up well in a tough environment. But that said, I think the skeptic would kind of point to the alternative returns and how strong they were and whether that can continue. But at the same time, there were probably some other things in there. I think probably DAC true-ups and things like that related to the markets would have hurt you. \n Without maybe the details, it's a little hard from the outside to tell sort of what the ROE is running at on a run rate basis at the moment relative to that 12% to 14% that you all have highlighted. So could you talk about that a little bit and how we should think about sort of the level of ROE that you think you can earn right now? \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: Thanks, Alex. I mean as you can appreciate, preparing for the IPO of Life and Retirement, we do have constraints in terms of how much detail we can go into. I think if you look at the S-1 in terms of how we believe we can drive a 12% to 14% ROE over the long term is something we're very confident about. And if you look at the historical performance of Life and Retirement in terms of its ROE and attributed capital, they've done very well. I mean, Kevin, keeping in mind, we've got to be very careful. Do you want to provide maybe 1 or 2 items of your observations on the quarter? \nKevin Hogan: Yes. Thank you, Peter, and thanks, Alex. It really is about the combination of the lower equity markets, which do impact the DAC and SI due to the lower present value of the fee income. That's kind of a one-off item. It's not expected to be continuing. And then, of course, we have the increased SOP reserves, and these are things that will be much less of an impact under LDTI. So it's really the onetime impact of that. \n And then in terms of interest rates, right, with the increased rates, that does very much affect call tender income on a real basis, CML prepays and, with the direction of the markets, the fair value options. And I think we've provided that detail both in the deck for today on Page 11 and also in the fin sup. \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: Alex, is there another question? \nTaylor Scott: Yes. Maybe as a follow-up, just going back to the ROE improvement over time. some of those items certainly will take some time. And I don't know if you want to put a specific time frame around it. But I guess the piece of it that's related to corporate cost reductions, I mean for that piece specifically, over what time period do you think you'd be able to sort of take out, call it, stranded costs associated with the separation? \nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director: We provided a lot of detail in Shane's prepared remarks. And so I don't think it's really worth going back and going through point by point. But the most important thing for us at this stage is to sequence really the strategic initiatives we have in front of us, the most important being right now, the Corebridge IPO. So like that's a big project in itself and making sure that Corebridge is set up to be a separate stand-alone public company and getting the IPO away. \n Also making sure that all of the things that are done at AIG today that need to be transferred over or worked with Corebridge is the next highest priority. And we have a -- our parent expenses, you have to think of it as parent and what is General Insurance today coming together as one company. And coming together as one company, we want to be very thoughtful about the business we're in, in the future, what is a target operating model and how do we sequence that in a manner that we are not creating any risk with all the things that we have going on strategically and that we get to the right outcome in the end. \n And I think our track record has demonstrated, whether it's the underwriting turnaround, AIG 200, what we're doing in terms of Corebridge. You should be highly confident we'll do it at a pace that is certainly front of mind but, at the same time, making sure that we have all the very important pieces of what we're doing in the separation done very well. And so like that's kind of the time frame. But it's really not going to be what month, what quarter, it's going to be how do we execute things and then sequence the next priority, which will be how we bring parent and General Insurance together. \n If I may, let me just -- I just want to thank everybody for our clients, our distribution partners and our colleagues have been tremendous in terms of the work that they've done and the contribution that they've driven to get to these results. So everybody, have a great day. Thank you for your time. \nOperator: And once again, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference for today. We do thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Peter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review our first quarter financial results. I'm very pleased to report that AIG had an excellent start to 2022. We are successfully executing on several strategic, operational and financial priorities, and our team has significant momentum on many fronts, which we believe will continue throughout the year.  \n Following my remarks, Shane will provide more detail on our financial results, and then we will take questions. Mark Lyons, David McElroy and Kevin Hogan will join us for the Q&A portion of today's call.  \n Today, I will cover 4 topics. First, I will outline the tremendous progress we've made towards the separation of our Life and Retirement business, which will be renamed Corebridge Financial. Second, I will review the excellent first quarter performance of General Insurance, where we continue to drive top line growth, particularly in Global Commercial, and saw meaningful improvement in underwriting profitability. Third, I will cover Life and Retirement's financial performance. This business remains a meaningful contributor to our overall results. And fourth, I'll provide an update on our capital management strategy, particularly as to stock buybacks, which we plan to accelerate over the course of 2022, given our positive view of AIG's future over the near, medium and long term.  \n Before I turn to these topics, I'd like to discuss the situation in Russia and Ukraine. It goes without saying that what is happening is heartbreaking. Ukrainian people are experiencing unimaginable pain and suffering. And it's our hope that a peaceful resolution will be achieved.  \n With respect to the insurance industry, we've not seen a situation like this in modern times. It presents a unique set of circumstances that make any exposure or coverage analysis complex. Let me start by commenting on what we saw at AIG in the first quarter and what we did with a few claims that were submitted.  \n The claims we received were largely reported under political violence or political risk policies. While the amount of information included in the claims was limited, we did reserve our best estimate of ultimate losses, including IBNR. While we know it will take time for the full impact of the Russia-Ukraine situation to emerge, based on the work we did in the first quarter to analyze our exposures and review known claims, we do not believe the impact will be material to AIG. And in the event of losses, we have multiple reinsurance programs available.  \n With respect to the industry more broadly, there's not been much discussion so far in this earnings season regarding what the Russia-Ukraine situation means. So I thought I'd spend a few minutes on the complexity that it presents.  \n As a starting point, it's important to bear in mind that standard property and energy policies issued to the types of insureds most likely to have suffered losses due to the conflict typically contain broad exclusions for losses arising at a war and other hostile acts. In instances where affirmative coverage has been provided for losses that would typically fall within the scope of these exclusions, the most relevant coverages relate to policies such as political violence, political risk and trade credit, aviation and marine.  \n Now I'd like to spend a few minutes on aviation because it's the topic that has received the most attention over the last 30 to 45 days. Aviation is similarly complex and it will take time before all the relevant facts and resulting coverage implications fully emerge.  \n Let me start with what we know. We know that aviation policies can be issued to both airline operators and airline leasing companies and typically provide separate coverage for, on the one hand, losses caused by war perils, such as nationalization and confiscation; and on the other hand, losses caused by nonwar perils.  \n We also know that the invasion of Ukraine first occurred on February 24, and there were sanctions issued by the U.K. and the EU on February 26, which have since been updated. These sanctions generally required airline lessors to cancel leases with Russian airline operators and gave them a brief period in which to do so. Additionally, we know that there was an aircraft reregistration law passed in Russia on March 14, which permitted Russian airline operators to reregister aircraft leased from Western lessors on the Russian aircraft registry.  \n What we don't know is much more expansive. As an initial matter, we don't know whether or to what extent actual losses have occurred or when they occurred, given the uncertainty surrounding the location and condition of aircraft and other equipment as well as the timing of their potential return to lessors, nor do we know if efforts have been undertaken by lessors to mitigate any damages.  \n As to the question of losses caused by war perils versus nonwar perils, this is a critical question that will need to be answered as the outcome will determine which policy might apply and the amount of coverage that may be available.  \n With respect to war perils such as government confiscation, this type of loss would typically be included in a whole war policy, but it must be first be determined if there's an actual confiscation. Even where it is determined that a government confiscation took place, consideration will also have to be given to the timing of notices and the geographic scope of coverage. The answers to these questions will impact whether there is a covered loss and, if so, whether a given whole war policy response.  \n With respect to reinsurance, structures likely implicated in a war peril scenario include war, marine and energy and political violence, but it's also possible that other types of reinsurance contracts could be available for recoveries. If a loss is alleged to be due to a nonwar peril, it could be covered in an all-risk policy. As an initial matter, however, a determination would need to be made that a loss in fact has occurred and then, if it has, that is due to a nonwar peril.  \n Additionally, as with war perils, you would have to consider if reinsurance is available. The reinsurance that would be typically available in an all-risk scenario may be in different structures than in government confiscation or other war peril scenario.  \n As to all potentially covered perils, there are many issues requiring analysis, including the potential applicability of any sanctions. Assuming claim payments are made, insurers will also have to consider their recovery rights through salvage and subrogation and contribution from other available insurance. This is just a high-level summary of some of the issues the industry will grapple with, but I thought they were important to highlight, and you get the idea that it's a complex situation.  \n Now turning to the separation of Life and Retirement. We made significant progress to prepare this business to be a stand-alone public company. We continue to target an IPO in the second quarter, subject to market conditions and required regulatory approvals. We also continue to expect that we will retain a greater than 50% interest in this business post IPO. As you can appreciate, given where we are in the process, there are limitations on how much I can say about Life and Retirement, but let me give you some highlights of what we've accomplished since our last call. In March, we announced several important milestones: the public filing of the S-1; the new name for Life and Retirement which, as I mentioned, is Corebridge Financial; and the Independent Directors who currently serve on the Corebridge Board of Directors and those who will join and strengthen the Board as of the IPO.  \n At the same time, we launched a $6 billion Corebridge senior notes offering which was upsized to $6.5 billion based on significant demand. Shane will provide more detail on the maturities and coupons. We also made substantial progress on the operational separation of the Life and Retirement business from AIG, including identifying $200 million to $300 million of cost savings for this business, inclusive of $125 million in savings already in flight as part of our AIG 200 transformation program. And we continue to execute on establishing a hybrid investment management model that will allow Corebridge to benefit from strategic partnerships with world-class firms that offer excellent origination and investment capabilities and that complement our own capabilities in asset classes such as commercial mortgage loans, global real estate and private equity.  \n The first step in moving to this hybrid model was our strategic partnership with Blackstone, which we announced in 2021. In March of this year, we announced an arrangement with BlackRock, whereby BlackRock will manage up to $90 billion of Corebridge's liquid assets.  \n In addition, we developed a plan to modernize the mid- and back-office functionalities of the business and the transition to BlackRock's Aladdin technology platform with respect to Life and Retirement's entire investment portfolio. Aladdin enables us to replace aging and end-of-life technology infrastructure, provides risk analytics, establishes a single accounting book of record and a single investments book of record as well as reporting, stress testing and other services currently performed across multiple systems at AIG.  \n We expect that the cost for Corebridge to operate this hybrid model, taking into account both Blackstone and BlackRock, will be approximately the same as the fully loaded costs of our prior investment management operating model, where asset management was largely handled in-house.  \n Shifting to our first quarter financial results. As you saw in our press release, adjusted after-tax income was $1.30 per diluted share, representing an increase of 24% year-over-year. This result was driven by significant improvement in profitability in General Insurance, good results in Life and Retirement considering the current environment, continued expense discipline, savings from AIG 200 and strong execution of our capital management strategy.  \n In General Insurance, we reported an accident year combined ratio, excluding CAT, of 89.5%, a 290 basis point improvement year-over-year and the 15th consecutive quarter of improvement. We were especially pleased with the accident year combined ratio, excluding CAT and commercial, which was 86%, an improvement of 440 basis points year-over-year.  \n In Life and Retirement, first quarter results benefited from product diversity despite headwinds in the capital markets. Return on adjusted segment common equity was 10%. AIG ended the first quarter with $9.1 billion in parent liquidity after returning $1.7 billion to shareholders through $1.4 billion of common stock repurchases and $265 million of dividends.  \n Now let me provide more detail on our first quarter results in General Insurance, where we continue to drive improved financial performance, with core fundamentals being key contributors. Gross premiums written increased 10% on an FX-adjusted basis to $11.5 billion, with commercial growing 11% and personal growing 8%. Net premiums written increased 5% on an FX-adjusted basis to $6.5 billion. This growth was led by our commercial business, which grew 8% with personal contracting 1%. Growth in North America Commercial net premiums written was 6% and then International net premiums written growth was 10%, both on an FX-adjusted basis.  \n I'd like to unpack certain components of North America Commercial net premiums written as we had a very strong growth in our core business that may not be immediately obvious. While there are always movements each quarter in various aspects of our portfolio, both positive and negative, there were 3 items that impacted the first quarter that I'd like to provide more insight on. These items relate to assumed and ceded reinsurance and the timing of purchases, which is not something we have focused on previously but which I think is worth spending a few minutes on given the impact they had on North America Commercial net premiums written.  \n The first item relates to AIG Re, our assumed reinsurance business. Financial results for AIG Re are included in the financial results for North America Commercial and, in the first quarter, represented 40% of the segment's total net premiums written. For AIG Re, the first quarter is the largest quarter of the year with over 50% of its annual business written at 1/1. In the first quarter of 2022, AIG Re's net premiums written were flat year-over-year. This result was deliberate as we applied a disciplined approach to underwriting, and the market environment that persisted leading up to 1/1 led us to conclude that AIG Re could not achieve appropriate levels of risk-adjusted returns in property CAT, in particular, even with a comprehensive retrocessional program in place.  \n As a result, we reduced gross limits deployed in property CAT primarily in the U.S. by $500 million, which was the main reason for AIG Re's net premiums written being flat.  \n With respect to the second item, you may recall that in 2021, AIG Re made discrete retrocessional purchases throughout the year to further reduce frequency and volatility, whereas this year, retrocessional purchases were consolidated into the 1/1/2022 renewals as the retro market rebalanced. As a result of this decision, AIG Re ceded premiums were higher in the first quarter of 2022, which also reduced North America Commercial's net premiums written when compared to the first quarter 2021.  \n Third, a similar dynamic occurred with respect to our core property CAT reinsurance program for AIG. In 2021, we purchased reinsurance throughout the year to lower net retentions and reduce volatility, particularly with respect to North America property CAT. In 2022, however, those purchases were also consolidated into our core property CAT placement at 1/1.  \n We were able to consolidate these reinsurance purchases because our portfolio is much improved from last year with significantly reduced exposures. Like the actions we took in AIG Re, however, this reduced North America Commercial net premiums written in the first quarter.  To summarize, some of these headwinds in the first quarter of 2022 will largely reverse in the second quarter. \n Now turning back to growth. In North America Commercial, we saw a very strong growth in net premiums written, particularly in Retail Property, which grew more than 20%; Crop Risk Services, which also grew more than 20%; Lexington wholesale, which grew more than 15% led by property, which grew more than 50%; and our Canadian commercial business, which grew more than 15%.  \n In International Commercial, we also saw very strong growth, including in property, which grew 50%; specialty, which grew 34% driven by energy and marine; and Financial Lines, which grew 14%. In Global Commercial, we also had very strong renewal retention of 86% in our in-force portfolio in both North America and International, with North America improving retention by 300 basis points and International retention holding constant year-over-year. We calculate renewal retention prior to the impact of rate and exposure changes.  \n And across commercial on a global basis, our new business was very strong, coming in north of $1 billion for the fourth consecutive quarter. New business growth in North America and in International were both up 13%. North America new business growth was led by Lexington and Retail Property. International Commercial new business growth was led by Financial Lines and global specialty.  \n Turning to rate. Strong momentum continued in Global Commercial, with overall rate increases of 9% or 10% if you exclude workers' compensation. And in the aggregate, rate continued to exceed loss cost trends. This continues to be a market in which we are achieving rate on rate in many cases for the fourth consecutive year and where we're successfully driving margin expansion above loss cost trends.  \n North America Commercial achieved 8% rate increases overall, 10% excluding workers' compensation, with some areas achieving double-digit increases led by Retail Property, which increased 14%; Lexington, which increased 13%; Financial Lines, which increased 12%, including more than 85% rate increases in cyber; and Canada, where rate increased 13%, representing the 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit rate increases in this region.  \n International Commercial rate increases were 10% overall driven by Financial Lines, which increased 21%, including more than 60% rate increases in cyber; property, which increased 14%; EMEA, which also increased 14%; and Asia Pac, which increased 10%.  \n Last quarter, we indicated that our severity trend view in the aggregate in North America Commercial range from 4% to 5% and that we were migrating towards the upper end of that range. We now believe the upper end is moving towards 5.5% mostly driven by shorter-tail lines. Our property rate changes, where we continue to achieve mid-teen increases, equal or exceed loss cost trends in our own data and in government-published inflationary indices. Our liability trend assumptions continue to be in the 7% to 9% range, with International indications continuing to be less than those in North America.  \n Turning to Personal Lines. In North America, personal net premiums written grew nearly 40%, albeit off a smaller base, driven by a rebound in Travel and A&H, which was offset by a reduction in Warranty and increased reinsurance cessions supporting Private Client Group. International Personal saw a 5% reduction in net premiums written on an FX-adjusted basis, due to a reduction in Warranty and personal auto in Japan offset by a rebound in A&H and Travel. Overall, Personal Lines is an area where we continue to invest where there are attractive opportunities for profitable growth.  \n Now let me review Life and Retirement's results. This business had a good quarter considering the headwinds created by the capital markets. These market dynamics were offset by continued strong alternative investment income and strong growth in premiums and deposits, which increased 13% year-over-year to $7.3 billion. Adjusted pretax income in the first quarter was $724 million, with return on attributed segment equity of 10%. Adjusted pretax income decreased in the period due to lower call and tender income and continued elevated COVID-19 mortality, which is still within our previously established guidance.  \n Blackstone's capabilities in the early days of our partnership resulted in Life and Retirement seeing one of its strongest fixed annuity sales quarters in over a decade, with premiums and deposits up nearly 150% year-over-year to $1.6 billion, while surrenders and death benefits both improved slightly. Post separation, we continue to expect that Life and Retirement, meaning Corebridge, will achieve a return on equity of 12% to 14%, and that it will pay an annual dividend of $600 million.  \n Overall, I'm pleased with the momentum in Life and Retirement and, in particular, the early success of our partnership with Blackstone that was evident in the first quarter results.  \n With respect to capital management, we had a very active first quarter, which ended with $9.1 billion in parent liquidity. As a result of the actions I outlined earlier in my remarks, AIG received $6.5 billion of the $8.3 billion promissory note issued to AIG from Corebridge, and those funds were used to repay outstanding AIG debt, resulting in AIG's interest expense being reduced by 23% year-over-year.  In addition, AIG will receive the remaining $1.9 billion under the Corebridge promissory note during the second quarter.  \n Our capital management strategy will continue to be both balanced and disciplined as we maintain appropriate levels of debt while returning capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends while also allowing for investment in growth opportunities across our global portfolio. This will also be true over time as we continue to sell down our stake in Life and Retirement.  \n With respect to share buybacks, as I mentioned earlier, we repurchased $1.4 billion of common stock in the first quarter and are on track to buy back at least $1 billion more in the second quarter. This will leave us with approximately $1.5 billion remaining under our prior Board authorization. And as you saw in our press release, the AIG Board of Directors recently authorized an additional $5 billion in share repurchases.  \n With respect to growth opportunities, our priorities continue to be focused on allocating capital in General Insurance, where we see opportunities for profitable organic growth and further improvement in our risk-adjusted returns. As we move through 2022 and are further along with the separation of Life and Retirement, we will provide updates regarding our capital management strategy.  \n Before I turn the call over to Shane, I want to emphasize how pleased I am with how we started the year across AIG and how we are continuing to execute on multiple complex strategic priorities with high-quality results that are positioning AIG as a top-performing company. Our teams have overperformed across the board, and our deep bench continues to provide us with opportunities to leverage skill sets and further develop talent across the organization. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Shane. Thank you, Shane. Operator, we're ready for questions. Yes. Thanks, Elyse, for the question. Yes, we said we would do a minimum of $1 billion of share repurchases in the second quarter. I think Shane and I tried to do as much detail as we could in our prepared remarks in aligning what our priorities are for capital management. And certainly, the Board's authorization for an additional $5 billion says that we will continue to return capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. \n We think the positioning of the business, I mean, I think you see in the results, we see great opportunities for top line growth. We see it across the world. We see it in the commercial businesses, but also what you would have seen in some of the international that's probably [ amasses ] that. Accident & Health has started to rebound over the last 3 quarters, and we're starting to see top line growth there. So we want to make sure that we are allocating the appropriate capital for growth in driving margin and making the company look at its opportunities on risk-adjusted returns and make sure that we're capitalizing on the market and our discipline. \n I think really, when we get to the actual IPO and Corebridge as a public company, we'll be able to outline the capital management strategy in more detail. But we wanted to provide as much guidance as we could based on what we know today, and we would expect to continue to make the progress that we've demonstrated in the earnings call today. Let me take the first part, and then I'll ask Mark to comment on the loss cost observations. We've seen -- when you think about the quality in the results that we produced this quarter, when we look at our business, what do we look at? We look at client retention, which continues to improve. We look at new business, so we're acquiring a lot of new clients across the world. And so that continues to progress and think that there's a lot of momentum there. We look at rate above loss cost trends. And so that was favorable, and we continue to get rate in areas where we believe it is required in terms of its risk-adjusted returns and, again, with our leadership in terms of deploying capital. \n Are all the inflation factors considered in the sub-90? Well, no. We obviously are adjusting them, but the outperformance that we have been driving wasn't contemplated either. I mean like we're making more progress on the business at a faster pace and think that we will continue to show that we can grow the business top line and generate the risk-adjusted returns and improvement in combined ratios. Mark, do you want to comment on the loss cost? Yes. Mark, please take that. I mean I think it's also important to give some context of the portfolio shift as well, Mark, when we look at loss ratios? Thanks, Meyer. I'll take that. As I said, it's going to be a headwind in the first quarter will be a tailwind in the second quarter. Once we -- there's a couple of moving pieces. We can't really provide the exact numbers, but you can look at like in the second quarter where we purchased down on the North America Commercial CAT to lower retentions as well as in AIG Re, where we reduced volatility by buying single shop per occurrence retrocessional at the second quarter, and both recovered by the way, last year. So we felt that reducing the net retentions was appropriate and carrying that forward into how we were going to structure the 1/1 treaty for AIG as well as the retrocessional covers for AIG Re. \n So we have lower nets than we would have at this time last year. It's not uncommon to purchase sometimes midterm if there's available capacity and you're still trying to evolve a program, but we felt very good about the consolidation of those programs at 1/1 and really like the reinsurance that we have in both instances. Yes. Let me start. Thanks very much for the question. We have -- there's -- Mark touched on a little bit, and I'll ask if he has any additional comments after I make a few observations on the mix of business. But what we have in the first quarter, obviously, is a big AIG Re, which when you look at if you're changing the composition of the portfolio from reducing CAT to doing more proportional, you're going to have lower loss ratios, higher acquisition costs. And so that will have a sometimes impact in terms of how it earns into the first quarter. \n We also had, in terms of the overall General Insurance business, the mix changes because, on the one hand, we wanted to make sure that we were patient with A&H, which is a great business for us and Travel in terms of its rebound after COVID but not really reducing the overall overhead. But it does have an impact in terms of the mix and acquisition expense and loss ratio. \n The other thing you have to consider where we started, I mean, the incredible improvement that we've had in the portfolio has been disciplined. We've always talked about underwriting from a risk selection standpoint, terms and conditions, attachment, reducing volatility with supplementing reinsurance and then, of course, price above loss cost. And I think when you do that sequentially and maintain the same level of discipline, we start to see the outcome produced like we had in the first quarter. Mark, anything you want to add to that? It's hard to predict. I think your first part of the question is do ceding commissions as they start an earn-in benefit, the overall expense ratio. The answer is yes. It wasn't always the case when we were starting the turnaround and -- but today, we have market terms or better on ceding commissions, and that starts to earn in. \n But I hate to go back to Travel and Accident & Health. I mean those really dipped during the pandemic. And the U.S. rebounded first. International is starting to rebound. And those businesses just by its nature of how they're set up have lower loss ratios and higher acquisition expenses. So it's hard to predict. I mean what's the recovery look like, what's our growth look like, what's the mix of business look like? So it's really hard, Ryan, to give a forecast in terms of what the impact is. \n What we will focus on all the time is improvement in accident combined ratio. So we're not going to be shifting from one category of loss ratio in [ DAC ] or back. I mean we're going to make sure we're focused on the portfolio optimization and mix of business to improve the overall results. Thanks, Alex. I mean as you can appreciate, preparing for the IPO of Life and Retirement, we do have constraints in terms of how much detail we can go into. I think if you look at the S-1 in terms of how we believe we can drive a 12% to 14% ROE over the long term is something we're very confident about. And if you look at the historical performance of Life and Retirement in terms of its ROE and attributed capital, they've done very well. I mean, Kevin, keeping in mind, we've got to be very careful. Do you want to provide maybe 1 or 2 items of your observations on the quarter? Alex, is there another question? We provided a lot of detail in Shane's prepared remarks. And so I don't think it's really worth going back and going through point by point. But the most important thing for us at this stage is to sequence really the strategic initiatives we have in front of us, the most important being right now, the Corebridge IPO. So like that's a big project in itself and making sure that Corebridge is set up to be a separate stand-alone public company and getting the IPO away. \n Also making sure that all of the things that are done at AIG today that need to be transferred over or worked with Corebridge is the next highest priority. And we have a -- our parent expenses, you have to think of it as parent and what is General Insurance today coming together as one company. And coming together as one company, we want to be very thoughtful about the business we're in, in the future, what is a target operating model and how do we sequence that in a manner that we are not creating any risk with all the things that we have going on strategically and that we get to the right outcome in the end. \n And I think our track record has demonstrated, whether it's the underwriting turnaround, AIG 200, what we're doing in terms of Corebridge. You should be highly confident we'll do it at a pace that is certainly front of mind but, at the same time, making sure that we have all the very important pieces of what we're doing in the separation done very well. And so like that's kind of the time frame. But it's really not going to be what month, what quarter, it's going to be how do we execute things and then sequence the next priority, which will be how we bring parent and General Insurance together. \n If I may, let me just -- I just want to thank everybody for our clients, our distribution partners and our colleagues have been tremendous in terms of the work that they've done and the contribution that they've driven to get to these results. So everybody, have a great day. Thank you for your time."

            "content": "Yes. Thank you, Peter, and thanks, Alex. It really is about the combination of the lower equity markets, which do impact the DAC and SI due to the lower present value of the fee income. That's kind of a one-off item. It's not expected to be continuing. And then, of course, we have the increased SOP reserves, and these are things that will be much less of an impact under LDTI. So it's really the onetime impact of that. \n And then in terms of interest rates, right, with the increased rates, that does very much affect call tender income on a real basis, CML prepays and, with the direction of the markets, the fair value options. And I think we've provided that detail both in the deck for today on Page 11 and also in the fin sup."

            "name": "Mark Lyons;Executive VP & CFO",
            "content": "Yes. Thank you, Peter. So I think Peter answered it very well. But what I'll do is just reemphasize that, yes, I mean the context of your question, we gave that original guidance before there was any spike of inflation. But like I think any good company, you don't forecast just a point estimate. You're forecasting a range, and those ranges vary by line of business, and they all meld together. And even with the changing inflation assumptions, we'd still be inside that range. So we're comfortable with that. Yes, happy to. And thank you, Meyer, for the question. So I think on that side, first, on the reserve side, when you look at our view of inflation and severity trends and so forth, you really got to separate short-tailed lines from longer-tailed lines, right? And like in our view, the evidence within our own information as well as looking at external indices, whether it's from the perspective of the purchaser or the seller, it's clearer with -- in property-oriented lines. \n And it's probably worth noting, back to Peter's comment on mix, is that less than 10% of our pre-ADC reserves are property. So it can't move the needle too much anyway. So I don't really view that as an issue. \n And in terms of nonproperty, we've gone through looking at various basis point scenarios of lift and for various durations associated with it. And we still feel that all of that is pretty contained. And don't forget, especially on longer-tailed lines, there's still a high proportion of total reserves subject to the ADC on recoverables as well. \n So in terms of the -- your first part of your question with regard to the arithmetic versus what's there, I think we've addressed this before, Meyer, but I'm happy to give some comments again. which is the book has changed so dramatically from policy year '18, '19, '20 '21 and its accident year conversions that you need a margin of safety associated with it because nobody backs a thousand on these things. But there's been a radical change in the quality of the risk, the distribution strategy that Dave McElroy and his team have instituted getting much better risk portfolio churn purposely done to improve it, all the limit changes that Peter has talked about over time. And as a result, the arithmetic just doesn't pan out, let alone the change in mix that has been purposeful, let alone the change in net mix. So all of those changes simultaneously require, in our view, a reasonable range of margin of safety, and that's what you're seeing. Yes. Thank you, Peter. Yes, I think your point about mix is right on point. And remember, there's 2 mixes. You've got the mix on the front end and then you got the mix changes that manifest by the reinsurance purchases and how they earn in over time. So you got both of those factors. \n I think, secondly, there's also the realization that, over time, the property and shorter-tailed businesses over the last couple of years are a -- you got to watch the mix of that over time. And therefore, with the mix of medium- and longer-term lines that have volatility associated with them that you got to watch kidding yourself that the quarter-by-quarter is super predictable. If you get the accident year right, I'm happy. Accident quarter by accident quarter is a little bit more of an academic exercise. So I think that may be some of what you're seeing."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Shane Fitzsimons",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter, and good morning to all. I am very pleased to be AIG's CFO, and I look forward to working with everyone moving forward. I will provide more detail on our first quarter financial results and unpack a number of our key performance metrics, specifically EPS, liquidity, leverage, net investment income and ROCE. \n I will begin by going through the financial results of the businesses in the quarter. I will then touch upon the balance sheet, leverage and liquidity, which benefited from excellent execution on a number of capital transactions. I will then supplement Peter's remarks on the separation of Corebridge, including the arrangement we announced with BlackRock and liability management actions we recently completed. I will then spend some time on investment income and will provide insight on the impact of rising interest rates. And finally, I will talk about the execution path towards our long-term 10% ROCE goal for AIG, including income drivers, AIG 200 and other areas of corporate GOE reduction. \n As Peter mentioned, adjusted EPS attributable to AIG common shareholders grew 24% year-over-year to $1.30 per diluted common share compared to $1.05 per diluted common share in 1 quarter '21. Compared to the first quarter '21, improvements in General Insurance contributed $0.33 year-over-year, reduction in share count contributed $0.07 and lower interest expense contributed $0.04, offset by Life and Retirement being $0.19 unfavorable primarily due to $0.20 unfavorable due to lower net investment income. \n General Insurance's adjusted pretax income contribution in the quarter was $1.2 billion, which reflects strong underwriting profit, growth in Global Commercial and continued improvement in both the GAAP combined ratio up 590 basis points to 92.9% and the accident year combined ratio ex CAT improving 290 basis points to 89.5%. The combined ratio improvement was due to improved underwriting, premium growth, expense discipline and lower CATs, which all contributed to pretax underwriting income being 6x higher than the first quarter of 2021, increasing to $446 million from $73 million. With net investment income down $7 million year-over-year, the $366 million improvement in adjusted pretax income was driven by underwriting income, of which $223 million was from improved accident year underwriting income, $146 million due to lower CAT and $4 million from improved net PYD. \n North America Commercial has shown a 580 basis points improvement in the accident year combined ratio ex CAT over the prior year quarter, coming in at 88.1%. International Commercial also continued to improve profitability with 330 basis points improvement in the accident year combined ratio ex CAT this quarter, coming in at 83.5% for the first quarter. \n Personal Insurance GAAP combined ratio of 97.2% improved by 160 basis points year-over-year. In the first quarter, CAT losses were $274 million or 4.5 loss ratio points compared to $422 million or 7.3 loss ratio points in the prior year quarter. The most significant loss events in the quarter came from flooding in Australia and a Japanese earthquake. The ongoing events with Russia and Ukraine, which Peter discussed, contributed approximately $85 million of the estimated loss. \n Prior year development, excluding related premium adjustments, was $93 million favorable this quarter compared to favorable development of $56 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter, the ADC amortization provided $42 million of favorable development, and the balance of $51 million favorable arose from old accident years in U.S. workers' compensation along with short-tail lines in North America and in Japan Personal Lines. \n Life and Retirement adjusted pretax income of $724 million compared to $941 million in 1Q '21, a reduction of $217 million mostly attributable to lower net investment income, which was $2.1 billion in the quarter compared to $2.4 billion in the prior year quarter, a decrease of $224 million, reflecting lower call and tender activity from rising interest rates; the absence of the affordable housing portfolio, which was sold in fourth quarter '21 as well as reduced fee income; and an increase in deferred acquisition cost and statement of position reserves due to lower separate account asset values. \n Within Individual Retirement, excluding the Retail Mutual Fund business, which was sold, net flows were positive $874 million this quarter compared to positive net flows of $50 million in the prior year quarter, benefiting from higher fixed annuity sales aided by origination activity through the Blackstone partnership. \n Group Retirement grew deposits by 3.9% in the quarter, driven by higher group acquisition and individual deposits driving a slight uptick in fee and advisory income due to higher assets under administration. Life Insurance adjusted pretax income was a loss of $44 million due to continued elevated COVID mortality, while premium and deposits grew 3.4% to $1.2 billion, benefiting from growth of international life sales. Institutional Markets grew premiums and deposits as well as reserves due to increased pension risk transfer activity in the period. \n Turning to Other Operations, which includes interest expense, corporate general operating expenses, institutional asset management expense, runoff portfolios and eliminations and was a positive contributor to adjusted pretax income year-over-year by $109 million. These results benefited from lower interest expense of $51 million as we reduced our general borrowings through the course of 2021 by $4 billion and lower eliminations of $43 million. Corporate general operating expenses, excluding increased functional costs to set up Corebridge as a stand-alone public company of $6 million, were largely flat year-over-year. \n Moving on to the balance sheet, leverage and liquidity. Our financial flexibility remains strong. We closed the quarter with $9.1 billion of parent liquidity. We saw a large AOCI movement as a result of increase in interest rates. Adjusted AOCI, which excludes the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude, moved from $3.9 billion positive to a $5.9 billion negative, or a reduction of $9.8 billion. Although this mark-to-market impact is a drag on capital, as long as we hold the assets to maturity, we will not realize this unrealized loss. \n Operating interest rate movements impact our metrics primarily in 2 places: one, we end up with a gain on the Fortitude Re embedded derivative, which impacted GAAP EPS by $3.21 in the quarter; and second, it impacts our GAAP leverage by a little over 300 basis points. And with interest rates up another 55 basis points in April, we expect to see further movement in Q2. \n We exited the quarter at a GAAP leverage of 27.8%, up from 24.6%, the increase of which is attributable to the AOCI movement. The impact is larger in Life and Retirement than General Insurance given the duration of their respective asset portfolios. \n Total adjusted return on common equity was 7.6%, up from 7.4% in the first quarter '21, and total company adjusted tangible return on common equity was 8.3%. General Insurance's adjusted attributable return on common equity was 12.3% in the first quarter, while Life and Retirement was 10%. Adjusted book value per share of $70.72 increased 2.7% sequentially and 20.5% year-over-year. Adjusted tangible book value per share of $64.65 increased 2.9% sequentially and 22.3% year-over-year. \n Our primary operating subsidiaries remain profitable and well capitalized, with General Insurance's U.S. pool fleet risk-based capital ratio for the first quarter estimated to be between 470% and 480%, and  the Life and Retirement U.S. fleet is estimated to be between 430% and 440%, both well above our target ranges. \n Finally, on EPS during the quarter. We repurchased 23 million shares at an average cost of $60.02 for $1.4 billion, bringing our ending share count to 800 million with a quarterly average of 826 million compared to 876 million in the prior year quarter, representing a 6% reduction in average share count, which contributed $0.07 of EPS growth in the quarter. \n Turning to Corebridge. Since the start of the year, we continue to make progress on numerous fronts with respect to the separation. As Peter mentioned, at the end of the first quarter, Corebridge entered into a strategic partnership with BlackRock to manage up to $90 billion of liquid assets. At the same time, AIG also entered into a separate arrangement with BlackRock, whereby BlackRock will manage liquid assets for AIG representing up to $60 billion. Having now signed IMAs, we expect to begin transferring assets to BlackRock over the course of the second quarter. \n In early April, Corebridge successfully raised $6.5 billion of senior notes which, along with the remaining $2.5 billion of delayed draw term loan facility and commitments for the $2.5 billion of revolving credit facility, this establishes the capital structure for Corebridge Financial. AIG proactively hedged treasury rates earlier in the year, and upon unwinding the hedge at quarter end, AIG realized a $223 million gain, which equates to approximately 50 basis points in yield on the notes issued. While the debt issuance closed early in Q2, the $223 million gain was realized as a gain in the first quarter. \n The senior notes offering, excluding the hedge, was well structured and laddered with a 3.91% weighted average coupon rate. Corebridge used the proceeds from that offering to repay $6.4 billion of the $8.3 billion promissory note payable to AIG. Following the success of Corebridge's senior notes issuance, AIG initiated a debt tender offer. Taking advantage of strong demand, the tender offer was upsized, and AIG parent debt was ultimately reduced by $6.8 billion. An additional EUR 750 million will be redeemed on May 10, bringing the total expected AIG parent debt reduction to $7.6 billion. The average coupon on the debt that we retired was 3.82%, and the annualized interest expense savings is approximately $290 million. \n We continue to target debt leverage in the high 20s, excluding AOCI for Corebridge; and in the low 20s, including AOCI for AIG going forward. Given the significant progress we have made and with $1.9 billion of proceeds from the $8.3 billion note yet to be received, we have the necessary cash to finalize our planned debt actions without utilizing any of the proceeds from the IPO. With these actions completed, we remain on track for an IPO in the second quarter subject to market conditions and regulatory approval. \n Net investment income on an adjusted pretax income basis for the quarter was $3 billion. Total cash and investments were $305 billion, excluding Fortitude. Net investment income in the first quarter decreased $193 million compared to prior year, primarily reflecting lower call and tender income. \n The first quarter saw significant increases in benchmark treasury yields, with an 80 basis point increase on the 10-year. With General Insurance and Life and Retirement's portfolio durations of 4 and 8.4 years, respectively, the overall rising interest rate environment will provide a tailwind to our investment portfolio returns. \n In April, our portfolio crossed the equilibrium point, where new money yield is now 50 basis points higher on average than the yield on the assets rolling off the portfolio. The new money yield is higher by 20 basis points in General Insurance versus assets rolling off and 70 basis points in Life and Retirement versus the yield on sales and maturities currently. \n Moving forward, the new money yield is roughly 60 basis points higher than the current portfolio in General Insurance and roughly 90 basis points higher in Life and Retirement. To illustrate the point, holding all other variables constant and assuming 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve, we would anticipate approximately $500 million of benefit to adjusted net investment income over a 1-year period with nearly $200 million in General Insurance and $300 million in Life and Retirement. \n Within General Insurance, we have $11 billion of floating rate securities, which will begin to see some benefits in the near term, most of which are not tied to longer-dated liabilities. Life and Retirement is $25 billion of floating rate assets, but most of this portfolio is tied to floating rate liabilities that will offset the benefits. \n Turning to investments that have Russian exposure. At December 31, AIG held $359 million of sovereign and other foreign debt of the Russian Federation, of which $79 million were within Fortitude. Through proactive sell-downs of $129 million, which generated a loss of $41 million as well as the establishment of a credit allowance of $127 million, the market value of these securities at the end of the first quarter was $86 million, of which $18 million is held by Fortitude. \n Looking ahead, we have 3 priorities beyond continued progress on underwriting optimization and completing AIG 200. They are the successful separation of the Life and Retirement business, continued execution on our capital management priorities and ROCE improvement towards 10%. Post deconsolidation of Corebridge, we expect that AIG will earn a 10% ROCE, although there are many moving pieces that will get to this result, including the size and timing of the Corebridge IPO, additional capital management actions and continued progress on reducing expenses. \n As we've improved expense ratios in General Insurance, one of the key drags on ROCE is corporate expenses, which we have been reducing through AIG 200 and work on the separation, but there remains more work to be done. As Peter noted, with respect to AIG 200, we continue to achieve significant milestones and, in the first quarter, reached $890 million of exit run rate savings with $590 million of that realized to date. We currently expect to have full line of sight into the $1 billion of exit run rate savings either contracted or identified by the end of the second quarter, 6 months earlier than originally planned. \n Of the $1 billion of parent expenses, we expect that approximately $300 million will move to Corebridge upon deconsolidation. We will continue to provide updates over time, but the components to get to a 10% ROCE, our continued growth in underwriting profit; improved net investment income as we benefit from higher interest rates; continued execution on expense management, particularly at parent; and optimizing capital allocation in terms of leverage and returns to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and dividends whilst making sure that we continue to grow the company. \n Peter, I will now hand it back to you."

This conference is being recorded.\n Now at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead. \nQuentin McMillan: Thanks very much, and good morning. Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC provide details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by applicable securities laws, AIG is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change.  \n Today's remarks may also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at aig.com.  \n Additionally, note that today's remarks will include results of AIG's Life and Retirement segment and other operations on the same basis as prior quarters, which is how we expect to continue to report until the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial. AIG's segments and U.S. GAAP financial results as well as AIG's key financial metrics with respect thereto differ from those reported by Corebridge Financial. Corebridge Financial will host its earnings call on Thursday, February 15.  \n Finally, today's remarks, as they relate to net premiums written in General Insurance, are presented on a comparable basis, which reflects year-over-year comparison on a constant dollar basis adjusted for the international lag elimination, the sale of Crop Risk Services and the sale of Validus Re. Please refer to the footnote on Page 26 of the fourth quarter financial supplement for prior period results for the Crop business and Validus Re.  \n With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. Following my remarks, Sabra will provide more detail on the quarter and some perspective on the year, and then we'll take questions. Kevin Hogan and David McElroy will join us for the Q&A portion of the call.  \n We had a very strong fourth quarter, which highlighted a significant year of achievements at AIG. Throughout 2023, we continue to build on our underwriting excellence; repositioned the portfolio through several divestitures; made meaningful progress towards the deconsolidation of Corebridge, including 3 secondary sell-downs; delivered disciplined premium growth in businesses where we have scale and outstanding combined ratios; and continue to execute on our balanced capital management strategy. I'm very proud of the work our colleagues delivered for all of our stakeholders throughout the entire year.  \n In the fourth quarter, adjusted after-tax income per diluted common share was $1.79, an increase of 29% year-over-year driven by continued strong underwriting results, 17% growth in net investment income and excellent execution of our balanced capital management strategy that resulted in a 6% reduction in diluted common shares outstanding. For the full year 2023, adjusted after-tax income per diluted common share was $6.79, an increase of 33% over 2022. AIG overall produced an adjusted return on common equity of 9% for the year, up from 7% in 2022. As I will share with you today, 2023 was an extraordinary year for AIG. \n During my remarks this morning, I'll discuss the following topics. First, I will provide an overview of our fourth quarter financial results. Second, I will review AIG's significant accomplishments in 2023, including our strategic repositioning and our financial highlights. Sabra will comment on the Life Retirement business in her prepared remarks. Third, I will cover insights on the January 1 reinsurance market and specifically AIG's reinsurance renewals. And finally, I'll share some thoughts on how we're building on our momentum and positioning the company as we enter 2024, including some specifics on AIG Next, our initiative focused on creating the AIG of the future. I will also discuss our capital management strategy and growth expectations.  \n AIG's strong fourth quarter results demonstrated our continued execution across all aspects of our strategy. Within General Insurance, underwriting income was $642 million. Gross premiums written for the fourth quarter were $7.6 billion, an increase of 4% from the prior year quarter. Net premiums written for the quarter increased by 7% from the prior year quarter to $5.7 billion. Global Commercial grew 5%, and Global Personal grew 9% from the prior year quarter. If you exclude Financial Lines, Global Commercial would have grown 11%.  \n In North America Commercial, fourth quarter net premiums written grew 5% over the prior year quarter led by Retail Property, which grew 32%; Lexington, which grew 20%. These were offset by North America Financial Lines, which was lower by 13%. In International Commercial, fourth quarter net premiums written grew 6% over the prior year quarter as International Property grew 28% and Talbot grew 12%. These were offset by International Financial Lines, which was lower by 7%.  \n In the fourth quarter, Global Commercial had very strong renewal retention of 86% in its in-force portfolio as well as very strong new business performance. North America Commercial produced new business of $503 million in the quarter, an increase of 21% year-over-year. The growth was led by Retail Casualty, Lexington and Retail Property. International Commercial produced new business of $467 million for the quarter, representing an increase of 14% year-over-year. This growth was led by Global Specialty and Talbot.  \n Moving to rate. In North America Commercial, overall rate increased 4% in the fourth quarter with exposure adding 3 points, and the overall pricing was up 7%. In North America Commercial, if you exclude Financial Lines and workers' compensation, overall rate would have increased 11% in the quarter. And with exposure adding 4 points, overall pricing would have been 15%, meaningfully above the loss cost trend.  \n North America Commercial rate increases were driven by Lexington wholesale, which was up 17%; Retail Property, which was up 19%; and Excess Casualty, which was up 13%. In International Commercial, overall rate increased 3% in the fourth quarter with exposure adding 2 points, and the overall pricing was up 5%, which is slightly below loss cost trend. The rate increase was driven by Property, which was up 12% and marine, which was up 8%.  \n Turning to Personal Insurance. Fourth quarter net premiums written increased 9% from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by North America. In North America Personal, net premiums written increased 37% in the quarter. As we've seen in prior quarters in 2023, the significant premium growth for North America Personal was driven by our high net worth business. And as we discussed in prior quarters, the growth in North America earned premium continued to generate a lower expense ratio, and we expect the expense ratio will continue to improve in 2024.  \n Now let me turn to the full year financial results. 2023 was another year of meaningful strategic repositioning and was, in many ways, our best year yet. The repositioning included the disposition of Validus Re and Crop Risk Services, which generated a combined $3.5 billion of proceeds, including a pre-close dividend.  \n Additionally, we settled a $1 billion intercompany loan from Validus Re to AIG and received approximately $250 million of RenaissanceRe common stock. The changes to our portfolio further reduced volatility and allowed us to focus on businesses where we believe we have better opportunities for stronger risk-adjusted returns.  \n We reshaped the reinsurance structure of our high net worth business and launched a newly formed MGA called Private Client Select. We made significant progress towards Corebridge's separation, another major strategic milestone on our journey to becoming a less complex company.  \n We completed 3 secondary offerings in 2023 that generated approximately $2.9 billion in cash, we worked with Corebridge on the divestiture of Laya Healthcare and announced the sale of the U.K. Life business. In 2023, AIG received $1.4 billion of capital from Corebridge through $385 million of regular dividends, $688 million of special dividends and $315 million of share repurchases. At the end of 2023, our ownership stake in Corebridge was approximately 52%.  \n In 2023, we continue to execute on a thoughtful and balanced capital management strategy. During the year, AIG returned $4 billion of capital to shareholders through $3 billion of share repurchases and $1 billion of dividends. We reduced our common shares outstanding by 6% and increased quarterly dividends by 12.5%.  \n On August 1, the AIG Board of Directors increased our share buyback authorization of $7.5 billion. At the year-end 2023, we had $6.2 billion remaining on that authorization. We reduced AIG net debt by $1.4 billion in 2023 after successfully conducting a senior notes tender offer in November. We finished 2023 with very strong parent liquidity of $7.6 billion, which gives us ample capacity to continue executing on our capital management priorities.  \n Turning to the full year results for General Insurance. Throughout 2023, we delivered terrific financial performance. General Insurance full year underwriting income was $2.3 billion, a 15% increase year-over-year. For the full year, the General Insurance accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 87.7%, an improvement of 100 basis points year-over-year.  \n Global Commercial achieved an accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, of 83.3% for the full year, an improvement of 120 basis points year-over-year driven by loss ratio improvement. The calendar year combined ratio was 87.1%, a 250 basis point improvement year-over-year.  \n Excluding Validus Re and Crop Risk Services for the full year results, the Global Commercial accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, would have increased by 50 basis points to 83.8%, and the calendar year combined ratio would have increased by slightly over 20 basis points to 87.3%.  \n In Global Personal, the full year accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 99.3%, in line with the prior year. For the full year, General Insurance grew net premiums written by 7% year-over-year, driven by 5% growth in Global Commercial and 10% in Personal Insurance. North America Commercial grew 5% and International Commercial grew 6% year-over-year.  \n A couple of highlights. Lexington and Global Specialty had outstanding years. We remain very focused on these businesses and made investments to accelerate growth and continue to deliver strong underwriting profitability.  \n Lexington grew its net premiums written by 17% year-over-year. Growth was driven by historically high retention, which was 80%, $1 billion of new business and rate increases of approximately 18%.  \n Global Specialty, which includes businesses in marine, energy, trade credit and aviation, grew its net premiums written 10% year-over-year driven by 88% retention, almost $750 million of new business and rate increases of 7% for the year.  \n Also, there are 2 parts of our business that impacted growth in Global Commercial, which I would like to offer some perspective. First, if you exclude Financial Lines, our net premiums written growth would have been 10%.  \n Second, as we've outlined on prior calls, we decided to not renew 2 programs that had significant property catastrophe exposure that no longer met our underwriting guidelines. We do not believe that the premium increases on a risk-adjusted basis for these 2 programs delivered an acceptable return. The decision to nonrenew impacted the gross and net premiums written for Lexington specifically as well as the Global Commercial business throughout 2023. If you exclude Financial Lines and these 2 programs that I just mentioned, our year-over-year net premiums written growth would have been 13%, which gives you a sense as to why we have significant confidence in our core portfolio where we saw meaningful overall growth for the year.  \n It's worth providing a little bit more detail on Financial Lines. In Financial Lines, particularly in our public directors and officers book of business, we continue to exercise underwriting discipline by maintaining our primary position in our portfolio to being very prudent on large account excess layers, where there is significant exposure to vertical loss, and these layers are highly commoditized where typically the best price wins.  \n We've spoken about the cumulative rate change in Financial Lines before, but I want to provide a little bit more detail. The compound annual growth rate for Financial Lines achieved from 2019 through 2023 was 49%. If you exclude 2023, the compound annual growth rate was 63%. It's a business we're very focused on and our underwriters are continuing to carefully monitor market conditions and underwrite conservatively.  \n Now I'd like to provide you with some insight into the current reinsurance market generally and an overview of our January 1 reinsurance renewals. As I mentioned on previous calls, AIG's reinsurance purchasing is deliberately weighted to January 1, which enables us to strategically optimize the outcome across our reinsurance placements and provides us with clarity on our cost of reinsurance at the beginning of the year.  \n Before I go into detail on this year's outcomes, I want to speak about how we evaluate our reinsurance purchased. We've seen significant changes in the global property market over the last 2 years, and analyzing and quantifying changes and the portfolio's risk profile has become increasingly complex.  \n Currently, one of the most overused phrases that has been used with more frequency in the last year is risk-adjusted pricing or risk-adjusted rate changes, which have multiple interpretations, particularly when it comes to property treaty reinsurance. Calculating the risk-adjusted rate change can be complicated and is often inconsistent. I want to outline how AIG determines risk-adjusted pricing changes, which we believe is an industry-best practice.  \n To begin, you must determine the baseline structure and all the variables required to assess and quantify the risk-adjusted pricing change. To do that, the base analysis should be set at the identical structure and coverage with the exact terms and conditions of the prior year structure. The analysis needs to compare the cost of capital year-over-year and any model changes from vendor model output such as RMS to determine if the loss costs have increased or decreased at the attachment point and the vertical limits deployed.  \n Also, an analysis is needed for any changes to the coverage provided in the treaty placement. For instance, over the last few years, many programs have gone from an all-risk coverage basis to a named or peak peril basis.\n To correctly calculate the risk-adjusted rate change, perils no longer covered need to be analyzed and priced separately and the impact of any reduced coverage should be factored into the assessment of the price change. This can be particularly difficult when assessing perils that would not be economically viable to place on a standalone basis with significant limits, which could include wildfire, flood or terrorism. There needs to be consideration given to the volatility associated with the expected loss in calculating the risk-adjusted rate change.  \n Given the complexity of these calculations, the methodologies applied should be done with consistency and discipline. When applying the methodology I just described, AIG had a tremendous outcome with our reinsurance partners at the January 1 renewal season, building upon the very strong result achieved in a very challenging market in 2023.  \n Now let me turn to AIG's reinsurance renewals at January 1 of this year. To level set, the natural catastrophe insured loss activity remained at the forefront of the market with a record-setting 37 events in 2023 that exceed $1 billion of insured loss. These events contributed to a total annual insured loss currently estimated at over $100 billion, marking the sixth time in the past 7 years that insured loss from natural catastrophes has exceeded $100 billion. Over the last 7 years, there's been nearly $1 trillion of aggregate losses with over 60% driven by secondary perils.  \n The headline is that we were able to significantly improve our property cat structure and reinsurance coverage provided. When you review what we purchased last year, including for Validus Re, the overall spend has reduced by approximately $200 million and our core property treaties, excluding Validus Re, have slightly lower ceded premium year-over-year.  \n Let's start with our property catastrophe placements. Our core commercial North America retention of $500 million remained unchanged for the second straight year. The attachment on our dedicated Lexington occurrence tower was unchanged at $300 million. In both cases, the model [ detachment ] point is lower, and the exhaust limit is higher.  \n Our International Property cat per current structures renewed with a reduced retention in Japan to $150 million, a $50 million improvement from the prior year. The rest of the world attachment remains unchanged at $125 million.  \n We were very pleased to have achieved broader coverage across all of our core occurrence towers. With nominal attachment points unchanged, or in the case of Japan decreasing, the model probability of attaching our cat reinsurance improved with respect to key perils and across every major territory following the growth achieved in the property portfolio in 2023.  \n Our property cat aggregate cover was also successfully renewed with improved coverage, further reducing our volatility from frequency of loss. The aggregate now includes a standalone supplement dedicated to losses in North America arising from secondary perils. Importantly, it also now covers contributing losses from our high net worth portfolio. \n Our annual aggregate deductible for North America is $825 million. The North America other perils deductible is $350 million, which is a new deductible. And Japan and the rest of the world deductibles are $200 million and $175 million, respectively. These are subject to each and every loss deductibles of $20 million other than for North America wind and earthquake, which are at $50 million.  \n Our return period attachment point is lower year-over-year. For all of our major proportional treaties across a range of classes, we improved or maintained our ceding commission levels, reflecting our market-leading underwriting expertise and position in the market.  \n Turning to casualty. The challenges we've spoken about previously regarding the impact of inflation, both social and economic and litigation funding in the U.S. were a focal point for reinsurers at 1/1.  \n For casualty at AIG, we remain very focused on our underwriting standards and the positioning of the portfolio. Our team has done a terrific job of reunderwriting the entire business, particularly considering the amount of work that was needed to reposition it to where it is today.  \n Additionally, our pricing assumptions today have loss trends ranging from the high single digits to over 10%. These were increased over the past 2 years, given inflationary dynamics.  \n I do want to make a few comments about the last 10 years of casualty results for the industry. The industry as a whole has reported meaningful reserve releases in 4 of the past 10 calendar years, including in calendar year 2017. At the same time, there have been 6 years of significant reported industry strengthening in the last 10 calendar years, including in all of the most recent 5 calendar years.  \n Focusing on AIG, for accident years 2016 through 2019, our initial loss picks in our Casualty lines, excluding workers' compensation, averaged 78%. Looking specifically at accident years 2016 and '17, the initial loss picks were approximately 81% in both years. These loss picks exclude unallocated loss adjustment expense.  \n We significantly strengthened the reserves by over $1 billion for accident years 2016 through 2019, which revised our year-end ultimate loss picks to 91% in 2016 and 96% in 2017 at an average of 87% over accident years 2016 through 2019. To further analyze our casualty results compared to industry results for other liability and commercial auto using the most recent Schedule P data, they are well above the average industry loss picks on both measures.  \n Our initial and year-end ultimates for both lines are roughly 10 to 20 points higher than the overall industry average. In addition, we have reinsurance in place for 2016 and 2017 to mitigate our gross results. As we outlined last quarter, we put a comprehensive reinsurance treaty in place starting 2018 that provides us with substantial amount of vertical protection. \n Our renewal of the casualty reinsurance protections allowed us to maintain the same net retained lines with no impact on ceding commissions, which is an outstanding outcome. At January 1, our reinsurance partners maintained their significant support of AIG with consistent capacity and improved reinsurance terms that demonstrate a clear recognition of the quality of our portfolio and our underwriting teams.  \n I'll now turn to discuss our efforts to create a future state business structure for AIG post deconsolidation of Corebridge. As part of this effort, we've launched a new program, AIG Next, to create a company that's leaner, less complex and more effective with the appropriate infrastructure and capabilities for the size of business we will be post deconsolidation.  \n AIG Next will focus on the following key principles: driving global consistency and local relevancy across our end-to-end processes to improve operational efficiency and effectiveness, reducing organizational complexity to create a better and differentiated experience for our clients and colleagues, creating an agile and scalable organization to support business growth, optimizing our ecosystem to modernize our data analytics, digital and technology capabilities, clarifying roles' responsibilities while eliminating duplication and increasing our speed of execution.  \n As we've stated in the past, we expect the simplification and efficiencies created through this program to generate $500 million of sustained annual run rate savings and to incur approximately $500 million of onetime spend to achieve these savings. As part of AIG Next, we are creating a leaner parent company with a target cost structure of 1% to 1.5% of net premiums earned. Some of the current costs and other operations will be eliminated contributing to the $500 million savings, and others will be moved into the business where the service is utilized. \n In 2023, we began this work, as we've moved approximately $140 million of expenses from other operations into General Insurance for services that are more closely aligned to our business operations. Even with this shift, the full year combined ratio of 90.6% improved 130 basis points year-over-year, and the full year GOE ratio only increased 40 basis points due to offsetting savings within General Insurance.  \n Throughout the year, we've built efficiencies into our business, which have allowed general insurers to absorb these costs. We've already begun to make meaningful progress against our $500 million savings target and have established a team to drive and govern the AIG Next program with focus and discipline.  \n Sabra and I will provide more detail on next quarter's call regarding the specific cost to achieve by category and the expected timeline for the realized benefits in 2024 and 2025. As we are approaching the final steps of the Corebridge deconsolidation, we remain agile and continue to explore all options based on market conditions with respect to our remaining ownership of Corebridge, always focusing on what's aligned with the best interest of our stakeholders.  \n Sabra will take you through a pro forma capital structure based on assumptions about the deconsolidation. Throughout 2024, we expect to continue to execute the capital management strategy we've outlined before. Our insurance company subsidiaries continue to have excess capital to support the type of organic growth we have seen through 2023 and would expect to see in the future. We made enormous progress on our debt structure and maturities. Since year-end 2021, we've reduced over 50% of AIG's debt outstanding, which is over $11 billion of debt reduction.  \n The primary focus in 2024 will be on returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Since the start of 2024, we have repurchased an additional $760 million of common shares. We expect to continue at this pace for the first half of 2024, subject to market conditions, which should bring us near the high end of our target share count range.  \n Post Corebridge deconsolidation, we should achieve the low end of our range, which is approximately 600 million of common shares. The AIG Board increased the dividend in 2023, reflecting our confidence in the future earnings power of AIG, and we will continue to evaluate our dividend policy in 2024.  \n And lastly, as I enter my seventh year at AIG, I've never been more optimistic about our opportunities for growth and the momentum that AIG has entering 2024. We now have a terrific business. Global Commercial, which we've been working on for years to reposition, is now one of the most respected portfolios in the industry.  \n While there's always pruning to do in any business, the remediation is now behind us. We're well positioned to grow based on AIG's strong retention, strong opportunities for new business, excellent combined ratios and a company that has been able to distinguish itself amongst our clients and distribution partners.  \n In Personal Insurance, we will continue to make investments, particularly in our Japan business, our global A&H business and our high net worth business where we anticipate continued growth and more importantly, profitability improvement.  \n With that, I will turn the call over to Sabra. \nSabra Purtill: Thank you, Peter. This morning, I will provide more detail on AIG's fourth quarter results. But first, as we are getting closer to Corebridge deconsolidation, I would like to start with an illustrative pro forma.  \n With AIG's current ownership of Corebridge at 52%, the next transaction may likely result in deconsolidation. Today, Corebridge is consolidated in both AIG's balance sheet and income statement with offsets of noncontrolling interest for the portion that AIG does not own. You can see those adjustments in the financial supplement on Pages 8 and 11.  \n When we deconsolidate, we will report Corebridge as an investment with dividends reported in net investment income and Corebridge shares included in parent investments. Corebridge's balance sheet and income statement will no longer be in our financials.  \n If we were able to deconsolidate Corebridge now, accounting rules require us to fair value their assets and liabilities and recognize the net difference between that valuation and the current GAAP carrying value in AIG's equity. That process also includes some changes primarily driven by differences in basis and deconsolidation of variable investment entities.  \n The example I will provide is a hypothetical pro forma view. Please remember that there are many factors, and each one impacts the output. This view builds on the remarks I provided last quarter about pro forma adjusted shareholders' equity.  \n For simplicity, in this example, we used Corebridge's current stock price as a proxy for fair value. But the process is more complicated than that and is more dependent on interest rates than stock price as the investment portfolio has to be valued on the day of deconsolidation, which will change based on interest rates.  \n As a very high-level illustration, as of year-end, the fair value of Corebridge's net assets and liabilities was about $2 billion higher than the book value on AIG's balance sheet. As a result, deconsolidation would have increased AIG's book value per share by almost $3 a share.  \n However, for AIG's adjusted shareholders' equity, the fair value adjustment would have resulted in a reduction of about $4 billion or around $6 per AIG share, given Corebridge's stock price relative to its adjusted book value.  \n Now let me link these items to the AIG year-end pro forma estimates that I provided last quarter of adjusted shareholders' equity of approximately $33 billion, adjusted for the sale of Validus Re, to be used in evaluating the ROCE target.  \n At December 31, 2023, AIG's adjusted shareholders' equity was approximately $53 billion. With the pro forma fair value decrease of $4 billion at deconsolidation, adjusted shareholders' equity would be roughly $49 billion, including about $8 billion of value for our Corebridge shares.  \n To get to the E, we subtract the value of Corebridge shares. And for the purposes of this exercise today, we also subtract year-end parent liquidity of almost $8 billion, most of which is to be used for 2024 capital management, interest and other parent expenses as Peter described. That results in pro forma adjusted shareholders' equity of about $33 billion invested in our business plus whatever liquidity is at the parent as the focus of our 10%-plus target. This example is illustrative based on year-end financials and subject to change based on markets and the actual path to deconsolidation, but I hope it is helpful.  \n Now I will turn to fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter consolidated net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.5 billion, up 17% over the fourth quarter of 2022. General Insurance net investment income was 38%, while Life and Retirement was up 15%. Higher new money reinvestment rates in both businesses drove the improvement.  \n Fourth quarter new money rates on fixed maturities and loans averaged 6.5%, about 180 basis points higher than the yield on sales and maturities in the quarter. Fourth quarter new money rates were 160 basis points higher in GI and 190 basis points higher in L&R.  \n With higher reinvestment rates, the yield on General Insurance fixed maturities and loans, excluding calls and prepayments, rose to an annualized yield of 3.8% in the quarter, up from 3.0% in 4Q '22 and up 9 basis points sequentially. L&R's fourth quarter portfolio yield was 5.0% compared to 4.4% in 4Q '22 and up 10 basis points sequentially. In the first half of 2024, we currently expect continued yield pickup on fixed maturities over the prior year but less improvement sequentially, given the cessation of Fed interest rate hikes and the current shape of the yield curve. \n In contrast, alternative investment returns were weak this year, coming in slightly negative in the fourth quarter and at only 2.4% for the full year. GI alternative income was $41 million in the fourth quarter, down 11% from the prior year quarter for an annualized return of 3.9%. L&R's alternative portfolio generated a loss of $24 million in the quarter for an annualized yield of negative 1.8% compared to income of $16 million last year.  \n Turning to General Insurance. As Peter said, our underwriting results remain very strong. The 4Q '23 calendar year combined ratio was 89.1%, 80 basis points better than the fourth quarter of 2022. And the accident year combined ratio ex cats was 87.9%, 50 basis points better.  \n Global Commercial Lines delivered outstanding fourth quarter results with a calendar year combined ratio of 85.4%, a 90 basis point improvement over the prior year. The accident year combined ratio ex cats was 82.4%, a 170 basis point improvement reflecting exceptional underwriting profitability in both North America and International.  \n The fourth quarter included only 1 month of Validus Re due to the timing of the divestiture. Excluding Validus Re from fourth quarter results, the pro forma Global Commercial Lines calendar year combined ratio would have been 85.1%, 30 basis points lower than reported. The accident year combined ratio ex cats would have been 82.5%, only 10 basis points higher.  \n The fourth quarter calendar year combined ratio for Global Personal Insurance was 98.8%, 90 basis points better than 4Q '22. The accident year combined ratio ex cats was 101.8%, 140 basis points higher driven by the repositioning of the high net worth business, which made significant progress in 2023.  \n Fourth quarter underwriting income for GI was $642 million, up slightly from $635 million in 4Q '22 as improved accident year results, including catastrophe losses, were offset by lower favorable prior year development, net of reinsurance and prior year premiums. Catastrophe losses totaled $126 million in the quarter, down from $235 million last year. The largest event was Hurricane Otis in Mexico.  \n For the fourth quarter and the year, catastrophe losses, excluding Validus Re, would have been $111 million and $937 million, respectively. Favorable prior year development totaled $69 million in the fourth quarter compared to $151 million in 4Q '22. Including the impact of prior year premiums, the total impact of prior year loss reserve development was favorable by $37 million compared to favorable development of $150 million in 4Q '22.  \n Fourth quarter net favorable development this quarter includes $41 million of ADC gain amortization and $28 million of net favorable development from annual DVRs and other reserve reviews, particularly prior year catastrophes. The $28 million included $75 million in additional reserves for Russia-Ukraine related claims, offset by net favorable development on shorter tail lines and older catastrophes.  \n Turning to L&R. Fourth quarter results were solid, especially considering the continued headwinds from alternative investment returns. Fourth quarter APTI was $957 million, up 12% over the prior year driven by base spread expansion, strong sales and growth in assets under management and administration. Base net investment spreads in Individual and Group Retirement together widened 23 basis points in the quarter.  \n Fourth quarter premiums and deposits were $10.6 billion, up 20% from 4Q '22. For the fourth quarter, Corebridge's earnings included in AIG adjusted after-tax income decreased by about 25% due to the reduction in AIG ownership from 78% last year to 52% as of year-end. For the full year, Corebridge earnings in our adjusted after-tax income declined 20%.  \n Turning to other operations. Fourth quarter 2023 adjusted pretax loss improved by $52 million from 4Q '22 due to a $72 million reduction in AIG general operating expenses. Total other operations GOE was $242 million for the quarter, including $61 million for Corebridge.  \n On a consolidated basis, AIG's fourth quarter adjusted after-tax income rose 21% to $1.3 billion driven by 19% growth in General Insurance APTI. The annualized adjusted return on common equity was 9.4% for the quarter, almost 2 points higher than the fourth quarter of 2022.  \n Moving to the balance sheet. Book value per common share ended the year at $65.14, up 18% from year-end 2022 and up 16% from September 30, primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates. Adjusted book value per share was $76.65 at year-end, up 1% from year-end 2022 and down 2% for September 30, reflecting the net impact of income, dividends, share repurchases and Corebridge secondary sales.  \n At December 31, AIG's consolidated debt and preferred stock to total capital, excluding AOCI, was 24.3%, down 1.3 points from year-end 2022. With first quarter 2024 debt reduction, leverage is likely to be at the low end of our 20% to 25% range upon deconsolidation.  \n As Peter noted, we made substantial progress towards our 10%-plus ROCE goal this year. 2023 full year adjusted ROCE for AIG was 9.0% compared to 7.1% in 2022 and was 12.5% in General Insurance and 11.5% in L&R. The actions to reach 10% or greater will be driven by the 4 levers we have discussed before, including AIG Next. We are confident in our ability to achieve this goal, subject to market conditions and look forward to updating you on our progress.  \n With that, I will turn the call back over to Peter. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Thank you, Sabra. Michelle, we're ready for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets. \nMichael Zaremski: Maybe first on the expense ratio. I appreciate the color, Peter, you gave us on the continued improvement. Anything -- looks like this quarter, specifically, though, it took -- it was a bit higher than expected. Anything we should be thinking about? Or I don't know, if it's profit share, given the excellent loss ratio or just anything, any noise in there or seasonality? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Thanks, Mike. We outlined in my script that the business has been taking a lot of additional costs. Think about cyber and usage on the cloud. And so that might have been held centrally in the past. That has now been put into the business. And so you see that they're absorbing most of it, but there is some timing on that. \n Also in Personal Insurance, there is a lot of noise in the quarter. There's some onetime true-up adjustments. There's also some profit sharing, as you mentioned, in some of our Personal Insurance businesses. And so -- and there was also some catch-up on some of the reinsurance on earned premium. \n So I'm not concerned at all about the uptick in expenses. It was very nominal. When I look at what the business has actually absorbed in terms of increased costs year-over-year, they've really built capacity to be able to invest in the future. And the fourth quarter reflected that, but there was a little bit of noise as well, particularly on the Personal Insurance side. \nMichael Zaremski: Okay. Great. And then my final follow-up is on the -- specifically on the accident year loss ratio. You've -- the Validus is property-centric, and it's going to be kind of fully out of the numbers next quarter. You talked about nonrenewing some property throughout the year. \n And I understand Financial Lines has got a lot of pricing, but Financial Lines pricing isn't great trailing 12-month basis. So just on the underlying loss ratio, given just all the dynamics, should we be thinking about any material changes to the underlying loss ratio as the year progresses, given the moving parts? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: I don't think so. I think the accident year loss ratio that we finished the year is what I would expect in 2024. Like you said, there's always a mix of business changes. There's always a little bit of noise. There could be some shift in composition. As you mentioned, property, we think we have tremendous opportunities there based on having 5 or 6 entry points across the world in terms of getting the best risk-adjusted returns. \n When I look at what we've done in property over the last 5 years, we've gone from combined ratios in North America that are well north of 130 combined into the 70s and 80s now. So I think we have a really good platform. We're able to scale up businesses when we see opportunities. But I would think absent big mix of business changes, I would not expect any changes in the loss ratio. \n And I signaled on the call that the remediation is largely behind us. I mean, again, you're always going to be reunderwriting, but large programs or portions of the business in commercial, we really like what we have, and I think that there's real good opportunities for growth. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. \nMeyer Shields: Great. One quick question just to make sure I understand it. So you talked about pricing assumptions for casualty, assuming loss trends of either high single digits or low teens. Did that match the loss trends embedded in the reserves? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Sabra, do you want to talk about the reserves commensurate to the increase in premium and then -- sorry, an increase in rate change, particularly on excess? \nSabra Purtill: Yes. So when we've -- and we've talked about it in the past, we've taken a proactive approach to try and to react quickly to bad news that we see in trends. And as you know, even back in 2017, we moved to increase the reserves on casualty lines. \n Our underlying assumptions for casualty loss trend is in the 10% range. It does vary between primary and excess. Our book historically has been a little bit more balanced towards excess, and that's why you can see some of the changes in the loss ratios accident year by accident year. \n I would note that we do our deeper dive on the casualty lines largely in the third quarter. There are some that are in the second quarter, and we did complete those reserves this year without any meaningful changes in the reserves. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: So another observation, Meyer, on that is that the rates as we got to the back half of the year in Casualty, particularly in Excess Casualty, started to accelerate into double digits. And also not that this is a bellwether because there's different mix of business, but our casualty submissions in Lexington in the fourth quarter were up 100%, which just means it's getting harder to get casualty placements done in the admitted market. Pricing is going up driven by rate, terms of conditions are being tightened and there's more activity in E&S. \nMeyer Shields: Okay. Fantastic. That's very helpful. Second question, I guess, maybe jumping off from that. I guess I'm a little surprised that there's still, if I understand correctly, the same level of proportional sessions on North American casualty despite the fact that overall profitability has gotten so much better and higher interest rates. And I was hoping you could take us through your thinking on that. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Sure. Look, our casualty placements have evolved over time to reflect the portfolio, the gross limit deployment. And if I could take you back to even 2016 and '17 where we had quota shares before we arrived where we had a 50% quota share on Primary Casualty and then we had a 37.5% placement on Excess Casualty. That's just continued to evolve as we got into 2018, where we bought a large excess of loss placements for our worldwide Casualty portfolio for 75 ex of 25. \n And then at the end of 2018, we bought a 50% quota share for our casualty portfolio within the United States. And the reason why I just give you that as a baseline is we've changed, evolved. We've had reinsurance in place since 2016. But when you look at what we place on the quota share today, it's basically 20%. So we've taken that down while we've improved ceding commissions over 800 basis points from the original placement to 20% from north of 50. \n So I think we have been recognizing that we don't need to do as much proportional. But there's a balance in those placements between the excess and the quota share partnerships with reinsurers. They like a balance between the excess of loss and quota share in terms of our underwriting and feel very comfortable that, that's a good amount to cede off for looking at our overall casualty portfolio. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. \nElyse Greenspan: My first question was on the equity that you laid out, Sabra. So $33 billion pro forma adjusted equity. And then I believe you said parent liquidity would come on top of that. So can you just give us a sense of once you're through deconsolidation, what type of liquidity you would like to have in parent? Because I'm assuming it would be $33 billion plus the parent liquidity would be the equity that we should consider in reference to the double-digit plus ROCE target. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Thanks, Elyse. I'll turn it over to Sabra in 2 seconds. But I just want to caution us that we tried to outline what we expect shareholders' equity with a variety of different variables, but it was all pro forma. \n So I think Sabra can answer the question sort of technically as to how we should be looking about our capital relative to how we get to the 10% ROCE. But I just don't want to go into too many more variables because that was a pro forma that had a lot of assumptions. Sabra? \nSabra Purtill: Yes, certainly. Look, we have a framework around our liquidity position. And clearly, given the timing of the Corebridge secondaries and the Validus sale in the fourth quarter, parent liquidity was at very attractive and high levels at year-end. \n The way we think of it in a normal framework is we look at what our forward holding company needs are. So think about common dividend payments of roughly $1 billion a year. AIG-only interest expense, roughly $500 million a year. And then parent expenses, which as we've talked about, we're focused on getting those down to 1% to 1.5% of NPE range. So that's what we think about in terms of a normal liquidity position, which is lower, obviously, than where we ended the year. \nElyse Greenspan: And then my second question, appreciate all the color on the call on premium growth, right, I think it was around 9% in the quarter kind of ex Validus and Crop. And so as we think about the moving pieces and just your view of price, loss trend, et cetera, would you expect top line growth kind of on an adjusted basis to be within that range in '24? Are there other things that we should consider? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Well, when you take out -- again, there's a lot of moving pieces, but like you take out Validus, Crop Risk Services, and so we have a baseline. And then when we look at our commercial portfolio -- I look at the fundamentals, Elyse, in terms of how are we growing the business. And we gave you highlights in the fourth quarter about our new business, which was simply terrific, and that momentum continues. Our retentions have been fantastic. And so again, it's a portfolio that we have done such a great job to get to a place where we really like and find opportunities for stability and more growth. \n Agree on the rate. I mean, again, the fourth quarter was just a moment, but we would expect Financial Lines in 2024 not to keep up at the same pace on excess. We'll see as we get into the market, but really like the opportunities in our core businesses to drive growth. \n Lexington, I know there's been a lot of discussion in this quarter around is excess and surplus lines slowing down, things going back to the admitted. There's no evidence to suggest that's true. \n Again, submission count is significantly up. And it's not just property. Property, if I looked at the fourth quarter, was the lowest submission count growth, and that was up over 30%. As I said, property's around 30%, casualty was up over 100%, and health care was around 50%. So there's a lot more opportunity to continue to grow in excess and surplus lines. And you know what, the property market, you get to the second quarter and there is your opportunity. \n So like we have built a reinsurance structure. We've built a gross portfolio that we can flex depending on market conditions. I mentioned Global Specialty. We think there's growth opportunities there. We think there's growth opportunities in our Personal Insurance business. \n So we're cautious but optimistic that the growth rate that you outlined in the high single digits is going to be achieved. But again, we have to be in the year, and we'll give you updates every quarter, but we're optimistic. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Ward with Citi. \nMichael Ward: Maybe kind of a similar question, but specifically on International. I think rate is a little below loss cost. So I was just wondering if you have any commentary on how you see the top line growth there playing out. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Mike, thanks for the question. If I look at International on the rate side, just a reminder that we do rate on gross premium written, not net. And so like as you take that from the portfolio, there's a heavy weighting our Specialty business in the fourth quarter. And the Specialty business does have a lot of quota shares and has a terrific reinsurance partnership. But it's almost 50% of the business, roughly between 40 to 50 in the quarter. \n And so Specialty while had good rate increase in marine, political risk had a weighting on rate in the quarter as well as Financial Lines. Financial Line is about 20% of the gross premium written in the quarter and having a negative that just weights the overall rate environment. \n But we had very strong rate in property. We had very good rate, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, of 8% in marine. And so yes, the overall index was at or perhaps slightly below loss cost trend, but it's not something we're concerned about. \n The other thing too, in Specialty, you should realize is that December 1 is when all aviation renews. And so that was low single digits, again, weighting on it. \n But it's mix of business, it's gross, and why I say gross is that when you take the gross to net for our Specialty business, it's basically 50% net premium written to gross. And so like we put that in the math in terms of our ceding commissions and profitability of the portfolio. But overall, we were pleased and think that there's opportunities to improve that in 2024. \nMichael Ward: And then maybe just on the adverse PYD in Russia, Ukraine. Just is that related to aviation? And is that just accident year '22? Because I think there was some adverse in other -- '20 and '19. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Sabra, do you want to provide a little bit of update in terms of how we got to the adverse? \nSabra Purtill: Sure. And I'll just start by overall. As I mentioned, we did have some favorable prior year development from older catastrophe years. So those were basically in years 2018 through 2020. \n If you look at the more recent accident years, as we indicated, we did put up $75 million of additional reserves related to Russia- and Ukraine-related claims. We've been evaluating our exposure for some time. And based on the analysis where we are at the end of the year, we felt it was appropriate to increase our reserves for the quarter. \n But I would also note that in the 2022 accident year, we did have some adverse development on winter storm Elliott, which was at the very tail end of the fourth quarter of 2022. And then in the older accident years, as I said in General, we netted to a favorable reserve development. But we did have some adverse development in the 2018 and 2019 accident years on some mergers and acquisitions-related exposures. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. \nBrian Meredith: First question, I'm just curious, as we look at this, you're getting close to the 600 million kind of share count. As we think about that and the use of proceeds from Corebridge, are you willing to go kind of meaningfully below that? And if not, what is the other kind of potential uses of capital here that you're thinking about to mitigate dilution from selling down your remaining interest in Corebridge? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Thank you, Brian. It's a good question. It's a little leading, but we had outlined the capital management strategy for the first 6 months, and that gets us below the [ 650 million ] share count at a base assumption of a stock price around where we are now. And so there's a few variables that could accelerate that or slow it down depending on market conditions and share price. But we know we have the liquidity, and we just wanted to outline what we thought we would do within the first 6 months. \n The next is dependent upon when we do a secondary sell-down, which I would expect before the end of the second quarter another sell-down, which gives us more liquidity. And the primary focus is going to be on share repurchase and dividend payment and believe that we can then get by the end of the year down to the lower end of the range or the 600 million. \n Once we're closer to that, we feel like we've made enormous progress on all the elements of our capital management strategy. It has been very balanced and believe we would have to give guidance after that in terms of what we intend to do. But I kind of want to get to the range first, in the 600 million to 650 million, and then get to the lower end of the range with proceeds, and then we would provide additional guidance. \nBrian Meredith: Great. That's helpful. And then, Peter, I just want to chat briefly on the Financial Lines business. And it seems like everybody is cutting Financial Lines. I'm just kind of wondering like who is actually running the business? And do we think we're getting closer to a bottom here? And do you think that's still a significant headwind to 2024 premium growth? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Thank you, Brian, for the question. And I've been trying to find a way to bring in McElroy to close it out. So Dave, why don't you give Brian some insight, and then we'll send it back to me, and we'll finish up. \nDavid McElroy: Thank you, Brian, and thank you, Peter. The -- yes, honestly, Brian, you see the weighting of the Financial Lines in our portfolio. It's a bit of an outside influence. But we've also gone through the year, and I think we trade the market we're in, not the market we hope for. \n So the -- I think we've been prudent around letting excess underpriced business go. I think we've been good about holding on to our primary business. So I think that actually really has held up well. \n I'd also think that it's always worth understanding there's a lot of other products in the portfolio. And they've held up well, whether that's private company business or professional indemnity or the fidelity businesses. Those are strong, and we actually anticipate those will continue to hold up in '24, okay?\n The seminal event is 2023 showed up with different securities class action experience than the '20 to '22 cohort here. It actually looks more like '16 to '19. The question will be whether the industry reacts to that, okay? Much more severity flowing through that year. It obviously exposes the verticality of loss. \n I do think it's put a little bit of a floor on the market going into 2024. We're seeing that. We're seeing that now. There's definitely going to be more control in primary, but I'm not going to be -- we won't sit on the front cover of CNBC -- or sitting in the middle of CNBC, but we like the business. We like the pricing of the business. And we also think that it's tethered to the economy. As that shows up, that will also help with new business opportunities that we see both in M&A, both in IPOs and both in structured. So it is the first time in 3 years that I might give it a little bit of optimism. Peter? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Thanks, Dave. Thank you very much, and thanks, Brian. Thank you, everyone, for coming to the earnings call today and greatly appreciate the engagement. And I want to thank all of our colleagues around the world for all they've done to progress the strategic progress that we've made and just have delivered tremendous results. So everybody, have a great day, and thank you. \nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

            "name": "Sabra Purtill",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter. This morning, I will provide more detail on AIG's fourth quarter results. But first, as we are getting closer to Corebridge deconsolidation, I would like to start with an illustrative pro forma.  \n With AIG's current ownership of Corebridge at 52%, the next transaction may likely result in deconsolidation. Today, Corebridge is consolidated in both AIG's balance sheet and income statement with offsets of noncontrolling interest for the portion that AIG does not own. You can see those adjustments in the financial supplement on Pages 8 and 11.  \n When we deconsolidate, we will report Corebridge as an investment with dividends reported in net investment income and Corebridge shares included in parent investments. Corebridge's balance sheet and income statement will no longer be in our financials.  \n If we were able to deconsolidate Corebridge now, accounting rules require us to fair value their assets and liabilities and recognize the net difference between that valuation and the current GAAP carrying value in AIG's equity. That process also includes some changes primarily driven by differences in basis and deconsolidation of variable investment entities.  \n The example I will provide is a hypothetical pro forma view. Please remember that there are many factors, and each one impacts the output. This view builds on the remarks I provided last quarter about pro forma adjusted shareholders' equity.  \n For simplicity, in this example, we used Corebridge's current stock price as a proxy for fair value. But the process is more complicated than that and is more dependent on interest rates than stock price as the investment portfolio has to be valued on the day of deconsolidation, which will change based on interest rates.  \n As a very high-level illustration, as of year-end, the fair value of Corebridge's net assets and liabilities was about $2 billion higher than the book value on AIG's balance sheet. As a result, deconsolidation would have increased AIG's book value per share by almost $3 a share.  \n However, for AIG's adjusted shareholders' equity, the fair value adjustment would have resulted in a reduction of about $4 billion or around $6 per AIG share, given Corebridge's stock price relative to its adjusted book value.  \n Now let me link these items to the AIG year-end pro forma estimates that I provided last quarter of adjusted shareholders' equity of approximately $33 billion, adjusted for the sale of Validus Re, to be used in evaluating the ROCE target.  \n At December 31, 2023, AIG's adjusted shareholders' equity was approximately $53 billion. With the pro forma fair value decrease of $4 billion at deconsolidation, adjusted shareholders' equity would be roughly $49 billion, including about $8 billion of value for our Corebridge shares.  \n To get to the E, we subtract the value of Corebridge shares. And for the purposes of this exercise today, we also subtract year-end parent liquidity of almost $8 billion, most of which is to be used for 2024 capital management, interest and other parent expenses as Peter described. That results in pro forma adjusted shareholders' equity of about $33 billion invested in our business plus whatever liquidity is at the parent as the focus of our 10%-plus target. This example is illustrative based on year-end financials and subject to change based on markets and the actual path to deconsolidation, but I hope it is helpful.  \n Now I will turn to fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter consolidated net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.5 billion, up 17% over the fourth quarter of 2022. General Insurance net investment income was 38%, while Life and Retirement was up 15%. Higher new money reinvestment rates in both businesses drove the improvement.  \n Fourth quarter new money rates on fixed maturities and loans averaged 6.5%, about 180 basis points higher than the yield on sales and maturities in the quarter. Fourth quarter new money rates were 160 basis points higher in GI and 190 basis points higher in L&R.  \n With higher reinvestment rates, the yield on General Insurance fixed maturities and loans, excluding calls and prepayments, rose to an annualized yield of 3.8% in the quarter, up from 3.0% in 4Q '22 and up 9 basis points sequentially. L&R's fourth quarter portfolio yield was 5.0% compared to 4.4% in 4Q '22 and up 10 basis points sequentially. In the first half of 2024, we currently expect continued yield pickup on fixed maturities over the prior year but less improvement sequentially, given the cessation of Fed interest rate hikes and the current shape of the yield curve. \n In contrast, alternative investment returns were weak this year, coming in slightly negative in the fourth quarter and at only 2.4% for the full year. GI alternative income was $41 million in the fourth quarter, down 11% from the prior year quarter for an annualized return of 3.9%. L&R's alternative portfolio generated a loss of $24 million in the quarter for an annualized yield of negative 1.8% compared to income of $16 million last year.  \n Turning to General Insurance. As Peter said, our underwriting results remain very strong. The 4Q '23 calendar year combined ratio was 89.1%, 80 basis points better than the fourth quarter of 2022. And the accident year combined ratio ex cats was 87.9%, 50 basis points better.  \n Global Commercial Lines delivered outstanding fourth quarter results with a calendar year combined ratio of 85.4%, a 90 basis point improvement over the prior year. The accident year combined ratio ex cats was 82.4%, a 170 basis point improvement reflecting exceptional underwriting profitability in both North America and International.  \n The fourth quarter included only 1 month of Validus Re due to the timing of the divestiture. Excluding Validus Re from fourth quarter results, the pro forma Global Commercial Lines calendar year combined ratio would have been 85.1%, 30 basis points lower than reported. The accident year combined ratio ex cats would have been 82.5%, only 10 basis points higher.  \n The fourth quarter calendar year combined ratio for Global Personal Insurance was 98.8%, 90 basis points better than 4Q '22. The accident year combined ratio ex cats was 101.8%, 140 basis points higher driven by the repositioning of the high net worth business, which made significant progress in 2023.  \n Fourth quarter underwriting income for GI was $642 million, up slightly from $635 million in 4Q '22 as improved accident year results, including catastrophe losses, were offset by lower favorable prior year development, net of reinsurance and prior year premiums. Catastrophe losses totaled $126 million in the quarter, down from $235 million last year. The largest event was Hurricane Otis in Mexico.  \n For the fourth quarter and the year, catastrophe losses, excluding Validus Re, would have been $111 million and $937 million, respectively. Favorable prior year development totaled $69 million in the fourth quarter compared to $151 million in 4Q '22. Including the impact of prior year premiums, the total impact of prior year loss reserve development was favorable by $37 million compared to favorable development of $150 million in 4Q '22.  \n Fourth quarter net favorable development this quarter includes $41 million of ADC gain amortization and $28 million of net favorable development from annual DVRs and other reserve reviews, particularly prior year catastrophes. The $28 million included $75 million in additional reserves for Russia-Ukraine related claims, offset by net favorable development on shorter tail lines and older catastrophes.  \n Turning to L&R. Fourth quarter results were solid, especially considering the continued headwinds from alternative investment returns. Fourth quarter APTI was $957 million, up 12% over the prior year driven by base spread expansion, strong sales and growth in assets under management and administration. Base net investment spreads in Individual and Group Retirement together widened 23 basis points in the quarter.  \n Fourth quarter premiums and deposits were $10.6 billion, up 20% from 4Q '22. For the fourth quarter, Corebridge's earnings included in AIG adjusted after-tax income decreased by about 25% due to the reduction in AIG ownership from 78% last year to 52% as of year-end. For the full year, Corebridge earnings in our adjusted after-tax income declined 20%.  \n Turning to other operations. Fourth quarter 2023 adjusted pretax loss improved by $52 million from 4Q '22 due to a $72 million reduction in AIG general operating expenses. Total other operations GOE was $242 million for the quarter, including $61 million for Corebridge.  \n On a consolidated basis, AIG's fourth quarter adjusted after-tax income rose 21% to $1.3 billion driven by 19% growth in General Insurance APTI. The annualized adjusted return on common equity was 9.4% for the quarter, almost 2 points higher than the fourth quarter of 2022.  \n Moving to the balance sheet. Book value per common share ended the year at $65.14, up 18% from year-end 2022 and up 16% from September 30, primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates. Adjusted book value per share was $76.65 at year-end, up 1% from year-end 2022 and down 2% for September 30, reflecting the net impact of income, dividends, share repurchases and Corebridge secondary sales.  \n At December 31, AIG's consolidated debt and preferred stock to total capital, excluding AOCI, was 24.3%, down 1.3 points from year-end 2022. With first quarter 2024 debt reduction, leverage is likely to be at the low end of our 20% to 25% range upon deconsolidation.  \n As Peter noted, we made substantial progress towards our 10%-plus ROCE goal this year. 2023 full year adjusted ROCE for AIG was 9.0% compared to 7.1% in 2022 and was 12.5% in General Insurance and 11.5% in L&R. The actions to reach 10% or greater will be driven by the 4 levers we have discussed before, including AIG Next. We are confident in our ability to achieve this goal, subject to market conditions and look forward to updating you on our progress.  \n With that, I will turn the call back over to Peter. Yes. So when we've -- and we've talked about it in the past, we've taken a proactive approach to try and to react quickly to bad news that we see in trends. And as you know, even back in 2017, we moved to increase the reserves on casualty lines. \n Our underlying assumptions for casualty loss trend is in the 10% range. It does vary between primary and excess. Our book historically has been a little bit more balanced towards excess, and that's why you can see some of the changes in the loss ratios accident year by accident year. \n I would note that we do our deeper dive on the casualty lines largely in the third quarter. There are some that are in the second quarter, and we did complete those reserves this year without any meaningful changes in the reserves. Yes, certainly. Look, we have a framework around our liquidity position. And clearly, given the timing of the Corebridge secondaries and the Validus sale in the fourth quarter, parent liquidity was at very attractive and high levels at year-end. \n The way we think of it in a normal framework is we look at what our forward holding company needs are. So think about common dividend payments of roughly $1 billion a year. AIG-only interest expense, roughly $500 million a year. And then parent expenses, which as we've talked about, we're focused on getting those down to 1% to 1.5% of NPE range. So that's what we think about in terms of a normal liquidity position, which is lower, obviously, than where we ended the year. Sure. And I'll just start by overall. As I mentioned, we did have some favorable prior year development from older catastrophe years. So those were basically in years 2018 through 2020. \n If you look at the more recent accident years, as we indicated, we did put up $75 million of additional reserves related to Russia- and Ukraine-related claims. We've been evaluating our exposure for some time. And based on the analysis where we are at the end of the year, we felt it was appropriate to increase our reserves for the quarter. \n But I would also note that in the 2022 accident year, we did have some adverse development on winter storm Elliott, which was at the very tail end of the fourth quarter of 2022. And then in the older accident years, as I said in General, we netted to a favorable reserve development. But we did have some adverse development in the 2018 and 2019 accident years on some mergers and acquisitions-related exposures."

            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. Following my remarks, Sabra will provide more detail on the quarter and some perspective on the year, and then we'll take questions. Kevin Hogan and David McElroy will join us for the Q&A portion of the call.  \n We had a very strong fourth quarter, which highlighted a significant year of achievements at AIG. Throughout 2023, we continue to build on our underwriting excellence; repositioned the portfolio through several divestitures; made meaningful progress towards the deconsolidation of Corebridge, including 3 secondary sell-downs; delivered disciplined premium growth in businesses where we have scale and outstanding combined ratios; and continue to execute on our balanced capital management strategy. I'm very proud of the work our colleagues delivered for all of our stakeholders throughout the entire year.  \n In the fourth quarter, adjusted after-tax income per diluted common share was $1.79, an increase of 29% year-over-year driven by continued strong underwriting results, 17% growth in net investment income and excellent execution of our balanced capital management strategy that resulted in a 6% reduction in diluted common shares outstanding. For the full year 2023, adjusted after-tax income per diluted common share was $6.79, an increase of 33% over 2022. AIG overall produced an adjusted return on common equity of 9% for the year, up from 7% in 2022. As I will share with you today, 2023 was an extraordinary year for AIG. \n During my remarks this morning, I'll discuss the following topics. First, I will provide an overview of our fourth quarter financial results. Second, I will review AIG's significant accomplishments in 2023, including our strategic repositioning and our financial highlights. Sabra will comment on the Life Retirement business in her prepared remarks. Third, I will cover insights on the January 1 reinsurance market and specifically AIG's reinsurance renewals. And finally, I'll share some thoughts on how we're building on our momentum and positioning the company as we enter 2024, including some specifics on AIG Next, our initiative focused on creating the AIG of the future. I will also discuss our capital management strategy and growth expectations.  \n AIG's strong fourth quarter results demonstrated our continued execution across all aspects of our strategy. Within General Insurance, underwriting income was $642 million. Gross premiums written for the fourth quarter were $7.6 billion, an increase of 4% from the prior year quarter. Net premiums written for the quarter increased by 7% from the prior year quarter to $5.7 billion. Global Commercial grew 5%, and Global Personal grew 9% from the prior year quarter. If you exclude Financial Lines, Global Commercial would have grown 11%.  \n In North America Commercial, fourth quarter net premiums written grew 5% over the prior year quarter led by Retail Property, which grew 32%; Lexington, which grew 20%. These were offset by North America Financial Lines, which was lower by 13%. In International Commercial, fourth quarter net premiums written grew 6% over the prior year quarter as International Property grew 28% and Talbot grew 12%. These were offset by International Financial Lines, which was lower by 7%.  \n In the fourth quarter, Global Commercial had very strong renewal retention of 86% in its in-force portfolio as well as very strong new business performance. North America Commercial produced new business of $503 million in the quarter, an increase of 21% year-over-year. The growth was led by Retail Casualty, Lexington and Retail Property. International Commercial produced new business of $467 million for the quarter, representing an increase of 14% year-over-year. This growth was led by Global Specialty and Talbot.  \n Moving to rate. In North America Commercial, overall rate increased 4% in the fourth quarter with exposure adding 3 points, and the overall pricing was up 7%. In North America Commercial, if you exclude Financial Lines and workers' compensation, overall rate would have increased 11% in the quarter. And with exposure adding 4 points, overall pricing would have been 15%, meaningfully above the loss cost trend.  \n North America Commercial rate increases were driven by Lexington wholesale, which was up 17%; Retail Property, which was up 19%; and Excess Casualty, which was up 13%. In International Commercial, overall rate increased 3% in the fourth quarter with exposure adding 2 points, and the overall pricing was up 5%, which is slightly below loss cost trend. The rate increase was driven by Property, which was up 12% and marine, which was up 8%.  \n Turning to Personal Insurance. Fourth quarter net premiums written increased 9% from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by North America. In North America Personal, net premiums written increased 37% in the quarter. As we've seen in prior quarters in 2023, the significant premium growth for North America Personal was driven by our high net worth business. And as we discussed in prior quarters, the growth in North America earned premium continued to generate a lower expense ratio, and we expect the expense ratio will continue to improve in 2024.  \n Now let me turn to the full year financial results. 2023 was another year of meaningful strategic repositioning and was, in many ways, our best year yet. The repositioning included the disposition of Validus Re and Crop Risk Services, which generated a combined $3.5 billion of proceeds, including a pre-close dividend.  \n Additionally, we settled a $1 billion intercompany loan from Validus Re to AIG and received approximately $250 million of RenaissanceRe common stock. The changes to our portfolio further reduced volatility and allowed us to focus on businesses where we believe we have better opportunities for stronger risk-adjusted returns.  \n We reshaped the reinsurance structure of our high net worth business and launched a newly formed MGA called Private Client Select. We made significant progress towards Corebridge's separation, another major strategic milestone on our journey to becoming a less complex company.  \n We completed 3 secondary offerings in 2023 that generated approximately $2.9 billion in cash, we worked with Corebridge on the divestiture of Laya Healthcare and announced the sale of the U.K. Life business. In 2023, AIG received $1.4 billion of capital from Corebridge through $385 million of regular dividends, $688 million of special dividends and $315 million of share repurchases. At the end of 2023, our ownership stake in Corebridge was approximately 52%.  \n In 2023, we continue to execute on a thoughtful and balanced capital management strategy. During the year, AIG returned $4 billion of capital to shareholders through $3 billion of share repurchases and $1 billion of dividends. We reduced our common shares outstanding by 6% and increased quarterly dividends by 12.5%.  \n On August 1, the AIG Board of Directors increased our share buyback authorization of $7.5 billion. At the year-end 2023, we had $6.2 billion remaining on that authorization. We reduced AIG net debt by $1.4 billion in 2023 after successfully conducting a senior notes tender offer in November. We finished 2023 with very strong parent liquidity of $7.6 billion, which gives us ample capacity to continue executing on our capital management priorities.  \n Turning to the full year results for General Insurance. Throughout 2023, we delivered terrific financial performance. General Insurance full year underwriting income was $2.3 billion, a 15% increase year-over-year. For the full year, the General Insurance accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 87.7%, an improvement of 100 basis points year-over-year.  \n Global Commercial achieved an accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, of 83.3% for the full year, an improvement of 120 basis points year-over-year driven by loss ratio improvement. The calendar year combined ratio was 87.1%, a 250 basis point improvement year-over-year.  \n Excluding Validus Re and Crop Risk Services for the full year results, the Global Commercial accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, would have increased by 50 basis points to 83.8%, and the calendar year combined ratio would have increased by slightly over 20 basis points to 87.3%.  \n In Global Personal, the full year accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 99.3%, in line with the prior year. For the full year, General Insurance grew net premiums written by 7% year-over-year, driven by 5% growth in Global Commercial and 10% in Personal Insurance. North America Commercial grew 5% and International Commercial grew 6% year-over-year.  \n A couple of highlights. Lexington and Global Specialty had outstanding years. We remain very focused on these businesses and made investments to accelerate growth and continue to deliver strong underwriting profitability.  \n Lexington grew its net premiums written by 17% year-over-year. Growth was driven by historically high retention, which was 80%, $1 billion of new business and rate increases of approximately 18%.  \n Global Specialty, which includes businesses in marine, energy, trade credit and aviation, grew its net premiums written 10% year-over-year driven by 88% retention, almost $750 million of new business and rate increases of 7% for the year.  \n Also, there are 2 parts of our business that impacted growth in Global Commercial, which I would like to offer some perspective. First, if you exclude Financial Lines, our net premiums written growth would have been 10%.  \n Second, as we've outlined on prior calls, we decided to not renew 2 programs that had significant property catastrophe exposure that no longer met our underwriting guidelines. We do not believe that the premium increases on a risk-adjusted basis for these 2 programs delivered an acceptable return. The decision to nonrenew impacted the gross and net premiums written for Lexington specifically as well as the Global Commercial business throughout 2023. If you exclude Financial Lines and these 2 programs that I just mentioned, our year-over-year net premiums written growth would have been 13%, which gives you a sense as to why we have significant confidence in our core portfolio where we saw meaningful overall growth for the year.  \n It's worth providing a little bit more detail on Financial Lines. In Financial Lines, particularly in our public directors and officers book of business, we continue to exercise underwriting discipline by maintaining our primary position in our portfolio to being very prudent on large account excess layers, where there is significant exposure to vertical loss, and these layers are highly commoditized where typically the best price wins.  \n We've spoken about the cumulative rate change in Financial Lines before, but I want to provide a little bit more detail. The compound annual growth rate for Financial Lines achieved from 2019 through 2023 was 49%. If you exclude 2023, the compound annual growth rate was 63%. It's a business we're very focused on and our underwriters are continuing to carefully monitor market conditions and underwrite conservatively.  \n Now I'd like to provide you with some insight into the current reinsurance market generally and an overview of our January 1 reinsurance renewals. As I mentioned on previous calls, AIG's reinsurance purchasing is deliberately weighted to January 1, which enables us to strategically optimize the outcome across our reinsurance placements and provides us with clarity on our cost of reinsurance at the beginning of the year.  \n Before I go into detail on this year's outcomes, I want to speak about how we evaluate our reinsurance purchased. We've seen significant changes in the global property market over the last 2 years, and analyzing and quantifying changes and the portfolio's risk profile has become increasingly complex.  \n Currently, one of the most overused phrases that has been used with more frequency in the last year is risk-adjusted pricing or risk-adjusted rate changes, which have multiple interpretations, particularly when it comes to property treaty reinsurance. Calculating the risk-adjusted rate change can be complicated and is often inconsistent. I want to outline how AIG determines risk-adjusted pricing changes, which we believe is an industry-best practice.  \n To begin, you must determine the baseline structure and all the variables required to assess and quantify the risk-adjusted pricing change. To do that, the base analysis should be set at the identical structure and coverage with the exact terms and conditions of the prior year structure. The analysis needs to compare the cost of capital year-over-year and any model changes from vendor model output such as RMS to determine if the loss costs have increased or decreased at the attachment point and the vertical limits deployed.  \n Also, an analysis is needed for any changes to the coverage provided in the treaty placement. For instance, over the last few years, many programs have gone from an all-risk coverage basis to a named or peak peril basis.\n To correctly calculate the risk-adjusted rate change, perils no longer covered need to be analyzed and priced separately and the impact of any reduced coverage should be factored into the assessment of the price change. This can be particularly difficult when assessing perils that would not be economically viable to place on a standalone basis with significant limits, which could include wildfire, flood or terrorism. There needs to be consideration given to the volatility associated with the expected loss in calculating the risk-adjusted rate change.  \n Given the complexity of these calculations, the methodologies applied should be done with consistency and discipline. When applying the methodology I just described, AIG had a tremendous outcome with our reinsurance partners at the January 1 renewal season, building upon the very strong result achieved in a very challenging market in 2023.  \n Now let me turn to AIG's reinsurance renewals at January 1 of this year. To level set, the natural catastrophe insured loss activity remained at the forefront of the market with a record-setting 37 events in 2023 that exceed $1 billion of insured loss. These events contributed to a total annual insured loss currently estimated at over $100 billion, marking the sixth time in the past 7 years that insured loss from natural catastrophes has exceeded $100 billion. Over the last 7 years, there's been nearly $1 trillion of aggregate losses with over 60% driven by secondary perils.  \n The headline is that we were able to significantly improve our property cat structure and reinsurance coverage provided. When you review what we purchased last year, including for Validus Re, the overall spend has reduced by approximately $200 million and our core property treaties, excluding Validus Re, have slightly lower ceded premium year-over-year.  \n Let's start with our property catastrophe placements. Our core commercial North America retention of $500 million remained unchanged for the second straight year. The attachment on our dedicated Lexington occurrence tower was unchanged at $300 million. In both cases, the model [ detachment ] point is lower, and the exhaust limit is higher.  \n Our International Property cat per current structures renewed with a reduced retention in Japan to $150 million, a $50 million improvement from the prior year. The rest of the world attachment remains unchanged at $125 million.  \n We were very pleased to have achieved broader coverage across all of our core occurrence towers. With nominal attachment points unchanged, or in the case of Japan decreasing, the model probability of attaching our cat reinsurance improved with respect to key perils and across every major territory following the growth achieved in the property portfolio in 2023.  \n Our property cat aggregate cover was also successfully renewed with improved coverage, further reducing our volatility from frequency of loss. The aggregate now includes a standalone supplement dedicated to losses in North America arising from secondary perils. Importantly, it also now covers contributing losses from our high net worth portfolio. \n Our annual aggregate deductible for North America is $825 million. The North America other perils deductible is $350 million, which is a new deductible. And Japan and the rest of the world deductibles are $200 million and $175 million, respectively. These are subject to each and every loss deductibles of $20 million other than for North America wind and earthquake, which are at $50 million.  \n Our return period attachment point is lower year-over-year. For all of our major proportional treaties across a range of classes, we improved or maintained our ceding commission levels, reflecting our market-leading underwriting expertise and position in the market.  \n Turning to casualty. The challenges we've spoken about previously regarding the impact of inflation, both social and economic and litigation funding in the U.S. were a focal point for reinsurers at 1/1.  \n For casualty at AIG, we remain very focused on our underwriting standards and the positioning of the portfolio. Our team has done a terrific job of reunderwriting the entire business, particularly considering the amount of work that was needed to reposition it to where it is today.  \n Additionally, our pricing assumptions today have loss trends ranging from the high single digits to over 10%. These were increased over the past 2 years, given inflationary dynamics.  \n I do want to make a few comments about the last 10 years of casualty results for the industry. The industry as a whole has reported meaningful reserve releases in 4 of the past 10 calendar years, including in calendar year 2017. At the same time, there have been 6 years of significant reported industry strengthening in the last 10 calendar years, including in all of the most recent 5 calendar years.  \n Focusing on AIG, for accident years 2016 through 2019, our initial loss picks in our Casualty lines, excluding workers' compensation, averaged 78%. Looking specifically at accident years 2016 and '17, the initial loss picks were approximately 81% in both years. These loss picks exclude unallocated loss adjustment expense.  \n We significantly strengthened the reserves by over $1 billion for accident years 2016 through 2019, which revised our year-end ultimate loss picks to 91% in 2016 and 96% in 2017 at an average of 87% over accident years 2016 through 2019. To further analyze our casualty results compared to industry results for other liability and commercial auto using the most recent Schedule P data, they are well above the average industry loss picks on both measures.  \n Our initial and year-end ultimates for both lines are roughly 10 to 20 points higher than the overall industry average. In addition, we have reinsurance in place for 2016 and 2017 to mitigate our gross results. As we outlined last quarter, we put a comprehensive reinsurance treaty in place starting 2018 that provides us with substantial amount of vertical protection. \n Our renewal of the casualty reinsurance protections allowed us to maintain the same net retained lines with no impact on ceding commissions, which is an outstanding outcome. At January 1, our reinsurance partners maintained their significant support of AIG with consistent capacity and improved reinsurance terms that demonstrate a clear recognition of the quality of our portfolio and our underwriting teams.  \n I'll now turn to discuss our efforts to create a future state business structure for AIG post deconsolidation of Corebridge. As part of this effort, we've launched a new program, AIG Next, to create a company that's leaner, less complex and more effective with the appropriate infrastructure and capabilities for the size of business we will be post deconsolidation.  \n AIG Next will focus on the following key principles: driving global consistency and local relevancy across our end-to-end processes to improve operational efficiency and effectiveness, reducing organizational complexity to create a better and differentiated experience for our clients and colleagues, creating an agile and scalable organization to support business growth, optimizing our ecosystem to modernize our data analytics, digital and technology capabilities, clarifying roles' responsibilities while eliminating duplication and increasing our speed of execution.  \n As we've stated in the past, we expect the simplification and efficiencies created through this program to generate $500 million of sustained annual run rate savings and to incur approximately $500 million of onetime spend to achieve these savings. As part of AIG Next, we are creating a leaner parent company with a target cost structure of 1% to 1.5% of net premiums earned. Some of the current costs and other operations will be eliminated contributing to the $500 million savings, and others will be moved into the business where the service is utilized. \n In 2023, we began this work, as we've moved approximately $140 million of expenses from other operations into General Insurance for services that are more closely aligned to our business operations. Even with this shift, the full year combined ratio of 90.6% improved 130 basis points year-over-year, and the full year GOE ratio only increased 40 basis points due to offsetting savings within General Insurance.  \n Throughout the year, we've built efficiencies into our business, which have allowed general insurers to absorb these costs. We've already begun to make meaningful progress against our $500 million savings target and have established a team to drive and govern the AIG Next program with focus and discipline.  \n Sabra and I will provide more detail on next quarter's call regarding the specific cost to achieve by category and the expected timeline for the realized benefits in 2024 and 2025. As we are approaching the final steps of the Corebridge deconsolidation, we remain agile and continue to explore all options based on market conditions with respect to our remaining ownership of Corebridge, always focusing on what's aligned with the best interest of our stakeholders.  \n Sabra will take you through a pro forma capital structure based on assumptions about the deconsolidation. Throughout 2024, we expect to continue to execute the capital management strategy we've outlined before. Our insurance company subsidiaries continue to have excess capital to support the type of organic growth we have seen through 2023 and would expect to see in the future. We made enormous progress on our debt structure and maturities. Since year-end 2021, we've reduced over 50% of AIG's debt outstanding, which is over $11 billion of debt reduction.  \n The primary focus in 2024 will be on returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Since the start of 2024, we have repurchased an additional $760 million of common shares. We expect to continue at this pace for the first half of 2024, subject to market conditions, which should bring us near the high end of our target share count range.  \n Post Corebridge deconsolidation, we should achieve the low end of our range, which is approximately 600 million of common shares. The AIG Board increased the dividend in 2023, reflecting our confidence in the future earnings power of AIG, and we will continue to evaluate our dividend policy in 2024.  \n And lastly, as I enter my seventh year at AIG, I've never been more optimistic about our opportunities for growth and the momentum that AIG has entering 2024. We now have a terrific business. Global Commercial, which we've been working on for years to reposition, is now one of the most respected portfolios in the industry.  \n While there's always pruning to do in any business, the remediation is now behind us. We're well positioned to grow based on AIG's strong retention, strong opportunities for new business, excellent combined ratios and a company that has been able to distinguish itself amongst our clients and distribution partners.  \n In Personal Insurance, we will continue to make investments, particularly in our Japan business, our global A&H business and our high net worth business where we anticipate continued growth and more importantly, profitability improvement.  \n With that, I will turn the call over to Sabra. Thank you, Sabra. Michelle, we're ready for questions. Thanks, Mike. We outlined in my script that the business has been taking a lot of additional costs. Think about cyber and usage on the cloud. And so that might have been held centrally in the past. That has now been put into the business. And so you see that they're absorbing most of it, but there is some timing on that. \n Also in Personal Insurance, there is a lot of noise in the quarter. There's some onetime true-up adjustments. There's also some profit sharing, as you mentioned, in some of our Personal Insurance businesses. And so -- and there was also some catch-up on some of the reinsurance on earned premium. \n So I'm not concerned at all about the uptick in expenses. It was very nominal. When I look at what the business has actually absorbed in terms of increased costs year-over-year, they've really built capacity to be able to invest in the future. And the fourth quarter reflected that, but there was a little bit of noise as well, particularly on the Personal Insurance side. I don't think so. I think the accident year loss ratio that we finished the year is what I would expect in 2024. Like you said, there's always a mix of business changes. There's always a little bit of noise. There could be some shift in composition. As you mentioned, property, we think we have tremendous opportunities there based on having 5 or 6 entry points across the world in terms of getting the best risk-adjusted returns. \n When I look at what we've done in property over the last 5 years, we've gone from combined ratios in North America that are well north of 130 combined into the 70s and 80s now. So I think we have a really good platform. We're able to scale up businesses when we see opportunities. But I would think absent big mix of business changes, I would not expect any changes in the loss ratio. \n And I signaled on the call that the remediation is largely behind us. I mean, again, you're always going to be reunderwriting, but large programs or portions of the business in commercial, we really like what we have, and I think that there's real good opportunities for growth. Sabra, do you want to talk about the reserves commensurate to the increase in premium and then -- sorry, an increase in rate change, particularly on excess? So another observation, Meyer, on that is that the rates as we got to the back half of the year in Casualty, particularly in Excess Casualty, started to accelerate into double digits. And also not that this is a bellwether because there's different mix of business, but our casualty submissions in Lexington in the fourth quarter were up 100%, which just means it's getting harder to get casualty placements done in the admitted market. Pricing is going up driven by rate, terms of conditions are being tightened and there's more activity in E&S. Sure. Look, our casualty placements have evolved over time to reflect the portfolio, the gross limit deployment. And if I could take you back to even 2016 and '17 where we had quota shares before we arrived where we had a 50% quota share on Primary Casualty and then we had a 37.5% placement on Excess Casualty. That's just continued to evolve as we got into 2018, where we bought a large excess of loss placements for our worldwide Casualty portfolio for 75 ex of 25. \n And then at the end of 2018, we bought a 50% quota share for our casualty portfolio within the United States. And the reason why I just give you that as a baseline is we've changed, evolved. We've had reinsurance in place since 2016. But when you look at what we place on the quota share today, it's basically 20%. So we've taken that down while we've improved ceding commissions over 800 basis points from the original placement to 20% from north of 50. \n So I think we have been recognizing that we don't need to do as much proportional. But there's a balance in those placements between the excess and the quota share partnerships with reinsurers. They like a balance between the excess of loss and quota share in terms of our underwriting and feel very comfortable that, that's a good amount to cede off for looking at our overall casualty portfolio. Thanks, Elyse. I'll turn it over to Sabra in 2 seconds. But I just want to caution us that we tried to outline what we expect shareholders' equity with a variety of different variables, but it was all pro forma. \n So I think Sabra can answer the question sort of technically as to how we should be looking about our capital relative to how we get to the 10% ROCE. But I just don't want to go into too many more variables because that was a pro forma that had a lot of assumptions. Sabra? Well, when you take out -- again, there's a lot of moving pieces, but like you take out Validus, Crop Risk Services, and so we have a baseline. And then when we look at our commercial portfolio -- I look at the fundamentals, Elyse, in terms of how are we growing the business. And we gave you highlights in the fourth quarter about our new business, which was simply terrific, and that momentum continues. Our retentions have been fantastic. And so again, it's a portfolio that we have done such a great job to get to a place where we really like and find opportunities for stability and more growth. \n Agree on the rate. I mean, again, the fourth quarter was just a moment, but we would expect Financial Lines in 2024 not to keep up at the same pace on excess. We'll see as we get into the market, but really like the opportunities in our core businesses to drive growth. \n Lexington, I know there's been a lot of discussion in this quarter around is excess and surplus lines slowing down, things going back to the admitted. There's no evidence to suggest that's true. \n Again, submission count is significantly up. And it's not just property. Property, if I looked at the fourth quarter, was the lowest submission count growth, and that was up over 30%. As I said, property's around 30%, casualty was up over 100%, and health care was around 50%. So there's a lot more opportunity to continue to grow in excess and surplus lines. And you know what, the property market, you get to the second quarter and there is your opportunity. \n So like we have built a reinsurance structure. We've built a gross portfolio that we can flex depending on market conditions. I mentioned Global Specialty. We think there's growth opportunities there. We think there's growth opportunities in our Personal Insurance business. \n So we're cautious but optimistic that the growth rate that you outlined in the high single digits is going to be achieved. But again, we have to be in the year, and we'll give you updates every quarter, but we're optimistic. Mike, thanks for the question. If I look at International on the rate side, just a reminder that we do rate on gross premium written, not net. And so like as you take that from the portfolio, there's a heavy weighting our Specialty business in the fourth quarter. And the Specialty business does have a lot of quota shares and has a terrific reinsurance partnership. But it's almost 50% of the business, roughly between 40 to 50 in the quarter. \n And so Specialty while had good rate increase in marine, political risk had a weighting on rate in the quarter as well as Financial Lines. Financial Line is about 20% of the gross premium written in the quarter and having a negative that just weights the overall rate environment. \n But we had very strong rate in property. We had very good rate, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, of 8% in marine. And so yes, the overall index was at or perhaps slightly below loss cost trend, but it's not something we're concerned about. \n The other thing too, in Specialty, you should realize is that December 1 is when all aviation renews. And so that was low single digits, again, weighting on it. \n But it's mix of business, it's gross, and why I say gross is that when you take the gross to net for our Specialty business, it's basically 50% net premium written to gross. And so like we put that in the math in terms of our ceding commissions and profitability of the portfolio. But overall, we were pleased and think that there's opportunities to improve that in 2024. Sabra, do you want to provide a little bit of update in terms of how we got to the adverse? Thank you, Brian. It's a good question. It's a little leading, but we had outlined the capital management strategy for the first 6 months, and that gets us below the [ 650 million ] share count at a base assumption of a stock price around where we are now. And so there's a few variables that could accelerate that or slow it down depending on market conditions and share price. But we know we have the liquidity, and we just wanted to outline what we thought we would do within the first 6 months. \n The next is dependent upon when we do a secondary sell-down, which I would expect before the end of the second quarter another sell-down, which gives us more liquidity. And the primary focus is going to be on share repurchase and dividend payment and believe that we can then get by the end of the year down to the lower end of the range or the 600 million. \n Once we're closer to that, we feel like we've made enormous progress on all the elements of our capital management strategy. It has been very balanced and believe we would have to give guidance after that in terms of what we intend to do. But I kind of want to get to the range first, in the 600 million to 650 million, and then get to the lower end of the range with proceeds, and then we would provide additional guidance. Thank you, Brian, for the question. And I've been trying to find a way to bring in McElroy to close it out. So Dave, why don't you give Brian some insight, and then we'll send it back to me, and we'll finish up. Thanks, Dave. Thank you very much, and thanks, Brian. Thank you, everyone, for coming to the earnings call today and greatly appreciate the engagement. And I want to thank all of our colleagues around the world for all they've done to progress the strategic progress that we've made and just have delivered tremendous results. So everybody, have a great day, and thank you."

This conference is being recorded. \n Now at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead. \nQuentin McMillan: Thanks very much, and good morning. \n Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC provide details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by applicable securities laws, AIG is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements if circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change.  \n Today's remarks may also include non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at aig.com. \n Additionally, note that today's remarks will include results of AIG's Life and Retirement segment and Other Operations on the same basis as prior quarters, which is how we expect to continue to report until the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial. AIG's segments and U.S. GAAP financial results as well as AIG's key financial metrics with respect thereto differ from those reported by Corebridge Financial. Corebridge Financial will host its earnings call on Friday, November 3.  \n Finally, please note that today's remarks as they relate to net premiums written in General Insurance are presented on a comparable basis, which reflects year-over-year comparison on a constant dollar basis adjusted for the international lag elimination and the sale of Crop Risk Services and the sale of Validus Re. Please refer to the footnote on Page 26 of the third quarter financial supplement for prior period results for Crop Risk Services and Validus Re. \n With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review our third quarter financial results. Following my remarks, Sabra will provide more detail on the quarter and then we will take questions. Kevin Hogan and David McElroy will join us for the Q&A portion of the call.  \n In the third quarter, AIG continued to deliver exceptional results. We made significant progress in our strategic, operational and financial objectives, reflecting continued execution across our entire organization. \n During my remarks this morning, I will discuss the following topics: first, AIG's financial results, including Life and Retirement, and provide an update on recent divestitures; second, I will provide the results of AIG's General Insurance business; third, I will provide an update on the casualty insurance market more broadly and AIG's approach to our casualty portfolio; fourth, I will provide an update on our capital management strategy and the progress we have made this quarter. Sabra will provide more detail on AIG's balance sheet and capital position in her remarks. And lastly, I will reconfirm our guidance with respect to our path to a 10%-plus ROCE post deconsolidation of Corebridge.  \n Financial highlights from the third quarter included: adjusted after-tax income was $1.2 billion or $1.61 per diluted common share, representing a 92% increase year-over-year. Consolidated net investment income on an adjusted pretax income basis was $3.3 billion, a 29% increase year-over-year. In General Insurance, net investment income was $756 million, a 30% increase.  \n Net premiums written in General Insurance grew 9%. General Insurance underwriting income in the quarter was $611 million, which improved over 250% from the prior year quarter. The adjusted accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 86.3%, a 210 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter, which is an outstanding result.  \n Our CAT loss ratio was 6.9% with $462 million of total catastrophe losses, including reinstatement premiums, which included $70 million from Validus Re. We had favorable prior year reserve development of $139 million, reflecting favorable loss experience on our portfolio, resulting from our continued focus on underwriting discipline.  \n The Life and Retirement business also delivered strong results in the third quarter with continued sales momentum and spread expansion. Life and Retirement's adjusted pretax income was $971 million, up 24% year-over-year. Premiums and deposits grew 4% year-over-year to $9.2 billion, driven by strong Fixed Index Annuity sales, which exceeded $2 billion for the third consecutive quarter.  \n September marked the 1-year anniversary of Corebridge's initial public offering. And since the IPO, Corebridge has returned approximately $1.4 billion to shareholders and is well on track to its committed payout ratio. \n With respect to our remaining ownership of Corebridge, we continue to evaluate options that are aligned with the best interest of shareholders and our other stakeholders. We're very proud of the achievements that Corebridge has delivered towards its operational separation as a public company, and we remain committed to reducing our ownership and eventually a full separation. \n Turning to AIG's balance sheet. During the quarter, AIG returned over $1 billion to shareholders through $785 million of common stock repurchases and $261 million of dividends. In addition, we purchased $170 million of common stock in October. We deployed $289 million to retire Validus Re debt prior to the close of the transaction yesterday. And we ended the quarter with $3.6 billion of parent liquidity. \n During the quarter, we continued to make significant progress on our strategic repositioning as we have further simplified our portfolio, which we've talked about over the past several quarters. Yesterday, we announced the successful closing of the sale of Validus Re to RenaissanceRe for which we received a total consideration of $3.3 billion in cash, including a pre-close dividend and approximately $275 million at RenaissanceRe common stock. This divestiture streamlines our business model, simplifies our portfolio and further reduces our volatility.  \n Prior to closing the Validus Re transaction, we entered into an agreement with Enstar Group to provide AIG with protection against any adverse development on the 95% portion of Validus Re's loss reserves that AIG retains exposure to. The cost will be included in the gain on sale in the fourth quarter.  \n Enstar will provide $400 million of limit for an adverse development cover in excess of carried loss reserves on assumed reinsurance contracts underwritten by Validus Re with respect to accident year 2022 and prior. This ADC limit provides additional protection against downside exposure to reserves in excess of the expected redundancy to a modeled confidence level above the 90th percentile. Importantly, while we believe this ADC is prudent to mitigate the risk of any future adverse reserve development, we will benefit from any future favorable reserve development. \n In August, Corebridge entered into a definitive agreement to sell Laya Healthcare to AXA for EUR 650 million, which closed on October 31. Proceeds to Corebridge, net of purchase price adjustments and deal-related expenses, will be approximately $730 million. It was announced that the proceeds will be used for a special dividend to Corebridge shareholders as of November 13.  \n In September, Corebridge entered into a definitive agreement to sell the U.K. Life Insurance business to Aviva plc for GBP 460 million. We expect the transaction to close sometime in the second quarter of 2024, subject to regulatory approvals. We anticipate that the proceeds from this transaction will largely be used for share repurchases, subject to market conditions. Both transactions streamline the Corebridge portfolio and allow the company to focus on its Life and Retirement products and solutions in the United States.  \n Turning to General Insurance, gross premiums written were $8.9 billion, a decrease of 1% from prior year quarter. Net premiums written were $6.5 billion, an increase of 9% from the prior year quarter. Global Commercial grew 6%, and Global Personal grew 16% from the prior year quarter. North America Commercial net premiums written increased 5% in the third quarter.  \n There are many variables in this quarter, and I want to provide more detail. The key businesses that drove growth were Lexington's core business, excluding Lexington programs, grew over 25% in the quarter, led by wholesale casualty, which grew 33%; and wholesale property, which grew 27%. Glatfelter grew 12%, and Retail Property grew 11%. \n In terms of headwinds, in 2022, we made the underwriting decision to not renew 2 large Lexington programs. We took this action because we believe that these programs had meaningful CAT exposure in peak zones. And we do not believe the appropriate CAT loads were reflected in the pricing. These programs were not the best deployment of capital in order to achieve our targeted risk-adjusted returns. Those nonrenewals tempered overall growth in Lexington. \n Lexington program's net premiums written reduced by 57% in the quarter. We believe, over time, we will replace this business on an individual risk basis as stronger risk-adjusted returns. However, it is a headwind in the quarter. The impact of the net premiums written associated with these 2 programs was approximately $115 million in the third quarter. \n Also offsetting growth in North America was Financial Lines, which declined 11%, accounting for approximately 20% of North America Commercial Lines net premiums written in the quarter. In North America Financial Lines, large account public D&O remains competitive as a result of excess capacity driven by new entrants to the market. \n Our renewal retention in our primary business remains strong, but retentions in our excess business were more challenged. New business in our excess book was down year-over-year as we were very disciplined in the current environment.  \n Rate reductions remain most prevalent on excess layers, particularly the higher excess layer vertical towers where it's more commoditized and the most pressure exists on pricing. In primary, where we are one of the few market leaders, rates remained flat to slightly down. We remain confident in our approach to Financial Lines. We have a global business with scale, focused on underwriting profit over top line growth, which is reflected in the results this quarter.  \n In International Commercial, net premiums written grew 7%, primarily driven by property, which was up 13%; global specialty, which was up 12%, led by energy and marine; and Talbot, which was up 7%. \n Global Commercial had very strong renewal retention of 87% in its in-force portfolio. North America was up 200 basis points to 87%, and International was up 300 basis points to 88%. As a reminder, we calculate renewal retention prior to the impact of rate and exposure changes.  \n And across Global Commercial, we continue to see very strong new business, which was approximately $1 billion in the third quarter. North America Commercial produced new business of $516 million, an increase of 13% year-over-year or 27% if you exclude Financial Lines. This growth was driven by Lexington Casualty, which saw excellent new business growth of over 90%, as well as Western World, which grew over 50%.  \n Retail Property grew new business by 26%, and retail casualty grew new business by 25%. This was offset by Financial Lines where new business contracted by about 30% as a result of our underwriting discipline. \n International Commercial produced new business of $532 million or 12% growth year-over-year. This growth was led by Talbot new business, which increased almost 50% year-over-year, and Global Specialty, which grew new business by over 40%, and it was balanced across the portfolio.  \n Moving to rate. In North America Commercial, rate increased 5.4% in the third quarter or 6% excluding workers' compensation. Exposure in the quarter added 3 points, bringing the total pricing change, excluding workers' comp, to 9%. \n Rate increases were driven by Lexington wholesale, which was up 15%, marking the 18th consecutive quarter of double-digit rate increases, led by Lexington wholesale property, which was up 28%, Retail Property was up 27% and admitted excess casualty was up 12%. Financial Lines rate was down 8%.  \n In International Commercial, rate increased 4%, and the exposure increase was 2%. The rate increase was driven by property, which was up 13%; energy, which was up 10%; and Talbot, which was up 9%. \n Turning to Personal Insurance, net premiums written increased 16% year-over-year, primarily driven by North America. In North America, Personal net premiums written increased 59%. Similar to last quarter, the increase was driven by business underwritten on behalf of PCS, offset by decreases in Travel and Warranty.  \n In the third quarter, AIG's net premiums written from PCS increased by over 100%, benefiting from an increase in gross premiums written and a reduction in quota share sessions. And as expected, the lag in earned premium growth continued to dissipate, providing operating leverage and a reduced expense ratio, primarily in general operating expenses. \n The high and ultra high net worth business also had significant improvement in the accident year loss ratio, benefiting from improved pricing in our admitted business and transitioning more business to the non-admitted market. We expect PCS to continue to improve its financial performance and provide more operating leverage in the fourth quarter and into 2024. \n In International Personal, net premiums written increased by 3% year-over-year, driven by growth in personal auto, travel, and that reflects the rebound post-pandemic and Japan personal property. The accident year loss ratio, ex CAT, improved 560 basis points. Overall, we're pleased with the International Personal improvement year-over-year. \n Shifting to combined ratios. The General Insurance third quarter combined ratio was 90.5%, a 680 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter. Accident year combined ratio, ex CAT, was 86.3%, a 210 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter. \n Global Commercial had an outstanding performance with third quarter accident year combined ratio, ex CAT, of 81.7%, a 130 basis point improvement year-over-year. The accident year combined ratio, including CAT, was 89.7%, a 500 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter.  \n The North America Commercial accident year combined ratio, ex CAT, was 83%. And the International Commercial accident year combined ratio, ex CAT, was 79.7%, both of which were exceptional outcomes. \n We would like to provide a perspective both with and without Validus Re and Crop Risk Services. As I said, the third quarter Global Commercial accident year combined ratio, ex CAT, was 81.7%, and the calendar year combined ratio was 86.6%. Excluding Validus Re from the third quarter results, the Global Commercial accident year combined ratio would essentially have been flat, and the calendar year combined ratio would have improved by slightly over 100 basis points from the third quarter to 85.4%.  \n And for the first 9 months, the Global Commercial accident year combined ratio, ex CAT, was 83.6%, and the calendar year combined ratio was 87.6%. Excluding Crop and Validus Re from the 9-month period results, the Global Commercial accident year combined ratio, ex CAT, would have increased by 70 basis points to 84.3%, and the calendar year combined ratio would have increased by 50 basis points to 88.1%.  \n Global Personal reported a third quarter accident year combined ratio, ex CAT, of 99%, a 380 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter due in part to the North America PCS business. \n Related to casualty liability and the excess casualty market, in particular in the United States, the level of narrative has increased over the last several years, driven in part by multiple mass tort events as well as rising economic and social inflation. The latter has been fueled by an exponential increase in third-party litigation funding, average severity trend increases and a precipitous rise in jury awards following the lull during the pandemic. \n Over the past couple of years, I've spoken extensively about our portfolio remediation strategy, including where AIG has reduced gross limits since 2018 by $1.4 trillion. We have established strong underwriting guidelines and strong partnerships with reinsurers to manage both frequency and severity. \n We have filed a similar strategy with our casualty portfolio with more of a focus on severity. When we began the underwriting turnaround in AIG in 2017, we found that the prior strategy in casualty was similar to that in the property business, which was to write large limits with a gross and net risk appetite much greater than what we offer today.  \n As I've outlined before, it was not uncommon to put out significant limits on any individual risk in excess of $100 million net on an occurrence basis. As we developed an entirely new framework and approach to underwriting, it required a change to our underwriting strategy.  \n Today, our global casualty portfolio represents 12% of our total gross premiums written and 13% of our net premiums written. The North America segment represents 55%, and the International segment represents 45% of that number. And since North America has been the topic of discussion, I will focus on what we have done in that portfolio. \n In North America casualty, our gross limit for our excess casualty portfolio, including lead umbrella, has decreased by over 50% since 2018. Our average limit size has also reduced by over 50%. Average lead attachment points, which protect us from frequency and lower severity losses, have more than doubled since 2018. \n In terms of gross pricing, primary auto and primary general liability, rates have increased approximately 200% since 2018, and excess casualty rates have increased by over 250%, remaining well above loss cost trends.  \n In addition to the significant investment in underwriting excellence and talent, we built and executed on a strategic reinsurance program to further mitigate our net exposure and volatility. What once was $100 million net exposure for AIG, there's now a maximum net on any one claim of $15 million in International and $11.5 million in North America. \n And in our excess of loss treaties, we have reinstatement limits that exhaust based on extensive modeling done at the [ 1,000 ] return periods. This adequately protects AIG from vertical exposure with significant limit available in the event there are multiple losses. \n Notably, the period prior to 2016 is covered by an adverse development cover for U.S. long-tail commercial lines. We purchased 80% of a $25 billion -- excess of $25 billion on payments made on or after January 1, 2016, for business written prior to 2016. The $25 billion retention was exceeded during the fourth quarter of 2020. We currently have $9 billion of the total unused recoverable limit left or $7.2 billion at the 80% level. \n Conflicting views have emerged in the market on the combination of gross portfolio underwriting with the strategic use of reinsurance. There have been comments particularly recently that the use of reinsurance is not required if you're comfortable with the gross portfolio. We disagree and simply don't support that as a viable strategy for AIG.  \n We prefer to balance our approach and have developed a strong underwriting culture, which we have dramatically improved over the last 5 years, executing on the fundamentals of disciplined and consistent underwriting, being very focused on preempting the evolving changes in the market and using reinsurance strategically to mitigate unpredictable outcomes. \n Building long-term strategic relationships with our reinsurance partners for all of our reinsurance needs has been key to repositioning AIG. Insurers cannot reverse social and economic inflation. However, we are in control of how we predict and respond to the impact of these changes to the forward-looking landscape, including how we manage our underwriting through coverage provided, limits deployed, attachment points and pricing.  \n Our business is not immune from social inflation, but we anticipated it early, and we took action. The consequence is that we're very pleased with our existing portfolio, and we're well positioned to be able to prudently take advantage of opportunities that exist in the current marketplace.  \n Turning to capital management. We use a balanced framework that remains focused on having ample capital in our insurance company subsidiaries to support organic growth in our business, continuing share repurchases, debt reduction in line with the lower end of the targets we provided and dividend increases. Lastly, we will consider compelling inorganic growth opportunities to meet our strategic objectives should they emerge. \n We finished the third quarter with $3.6 billion of available liquidity prior to receiving the proceeds of the sale of Validus Re or the special dividend from the sale of Laya Healthcare. Together, they should contribute approximately another $3.7 billion in the fourth quarter. Our primary use of proceeds will be on share repurchases. We plan to accelerate our repurchase activity this quarter and as we enter 2024, and we expect to reduce debt outstanding to further strengthen the balance sheet. \n We remain mindful of our leverage as a key consideration with our accelerated share repurchases. We expect to execute on the current share repurchase authorization of $7.5 billion, which will reduce shares outstanding to close to 600 million shares subject to market conditions. \n Related to return on common equity, as we have outlined on our prior calls, we remain very focused on delivering a 10%-plus ROCE post deconsolidation of Corebridge. During the third quarter, we continue to make significant progress at all 4 components of our path to deliver on this commitment and how we are positioning AIG for the future. \n I want to provide a few observations. In the last 90 days, we've continued to improve our underwriting results on an accident year and calendar year basis. We made recent leadership changes in General Insurance, which have effectively eliminated a management layer from the business, and we will continue this process throughout the organization in 2024. \n We have strengthened the capital position of insurance company subsidiaries to enable continued profitable growth. We've moved into the final stages of the operational separation for Corebridge. We have announced and closed several divestitures and have repositioned the portfolio to support our strategy for the future. We have accelerated the progress we're making on our capital management strategy and have created a strong liquidity position. \n The catalyst to achieving our targets remains the deconsolidation of Corebridge. This will allow AIG to simplify its business, eliminate duplication by combining our General Insurance business and our corporate functions, and create a leaner operating model for the future. \n Before I turn it over to Sabra, I'd like to add a few more details on the closing of the sale of Validus Re to RenaissanceRe. In January of 2018, AIG announced it was acquiring Validus Holdings to position it for future growth and profitability improvement. Over the last several years, we reshaped Validus Re's portfolio by reducing the catastrophe exposure in certain U.S. peak zones while diversifying the business significantly to develop a more balanced portfolio in both property and casualty reinsurance in order to improve profitability. \n Validus Re posted its first accident year combined ratio below 100% in 2022. And as we look back, we are grateful for the hard work, determination and perseverance of the team to dramatically improve the quality of the portfolio, particularly year-to-date in 2023, and it's evident in its performance today. \n We are very proud of Validus Re's results and are pleased that the company acquiring Validus Re is RenaissanceRe. Through Kevin O'Donnell and his leadership team's terrific work, RenaissanceRe has become one of the world's most well-respected reinsurers. We are looking forward to continuing our strong partnership with RenaissanceRe, which will be further enhanced as we become an investor in RenRe's capital partner vehicles, allowing us to benefit from their future performance. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Sabra. \nSabra Purtill: Thank you, Peter. This morning, I will provide more detail on AIG's third quarter, including General Insurance reserves, net investment income, Life and Retirement results and balance sheet and capital management. \n Adjusted after-tax income attributable to common shareholders this quarter was $1.2 billion, up 80% from 3Q '22, for an annualized adjusted ROCE of 8.5%. AATI per diluted share was $1.61, up 92%, reflecting the accretive impact of share repurchases over the last year. The earnings growth resulted from the 82% increase in General Insurance adjusted pretax income to $1.4 billion, driven by top line growth, improved underwriting results and higher investment income. \n It's important to note that while Life and Retirement also had strong earnings, AIG's ownership of Corebridge decreased to 65.6% this quarter compared to 90.1% before the IPO. And therefore, our results include a lower percentage of their consolidated earnings than last year. In total, Corebridge contributed about $32 million to the $514 million increase in AIG's adjusted after-tax income. \n Turning to General Insurance. Peter summarized our underwriting results, but I want to cover prior year development and reserves in more detail. In the quarter, General Insurance prior year development, net of reinsurance, totaled $139 million favorable, including $41 million from the amortization of deferred gain on the adverse development cover. About $129 million, including the ADC gain, resulted from the detailed valuation reviews, or DVRs, with the balance from other items like catastrophes. \n The DVRs covered $34.1 billion of loss reserves on a pre-ADC basis, about 70% of the total. The DVRs of particular note this quarter were for International Casualty and Financial Lines, North America Financial Lines and North America workers' compensation, which last year was completed in the second quarter. In total, North America had $154 million of favorable development, including $39 million from the ADC. International was $15 million unfavorable. \n Consistent with our prior comments, casualty, bodily injury, securities class actions and medical workers' comp trends have been and continue to be more favorable than our reserving assumptions. We believe that our changes in underwriting standards reduced limits, higher attachment points on primary limits, tightened terms and conditions and better risk selection are driving the improved experience, particularly in financial lines and casualty. \n Nevertheless, our philosophy is to react to bad news quickly and to allow time for favorable trends in recent accident years to mature, particularly given the impact of COVID on recent years. Therefore, this quarter's favorable development is generally from older accident years or from short-tail lines like property where physical damage claims come in quickly. \n In Financial Lines, changes from the DVRs were immaterial. North America had modest adverse development on an older Lexington architect and engineers book, offset by favorability in Canada. U.K. Financial Lines had slight adverse development, reflecting emerged experience on older D&O and professional indemnity claims, partially offset by favorable experience in Europe and Japan. \n We also reviewed International casualty lines this quarter. Peter discussed our changes in underwriting limits and reinsurance on our global casualty book. I would add that we also evaluate economic and social inflation trends as well as our potential exposure to mass torts across the total book and hold reserves to address those items. \n This quarter, we had adverse development in U.K. and European casualty, principally from commercial auto in France and large loss experience on a few older claims in both the U.K. and Europe. Consistent with prior trends, the DVRs for workers' compensation were favorable both for years covered by the ADC and after. \n Finally, property lines and Personal Insurance had favorable development in both North America and International, while we had about $23 million of adverse development on prior year catastrophes. We will complete the balance of annual DVRs next quarter, which cover about $6 billion of reserves on a number of smaller lines. \n Net investment income also contributed to earnings growth in the quarter, driven principally by higher reinvestment rates on fixed maturities and loans. The average new money yield on fixed maturities and loans was 5.88% this quarter, about 145 basis points above the yield on sales and maturities, and it was about 130 and 150 basis points higher in General Insurance and Life and Retirement, respectively. Year-to-date, the total new money yield is about 202 basis points higher than sales and maturities. \n The portfolio yield in General Insurance increased 9 basis points sequentially and 88 basis points over the last year with net investment income growth of 30%. The L&R investment income rose 23%, and the portfolio yield improved 9 basis points and 63 basis points, respectively. Based on the current treasury yield curve, we expect continued pickup in portfolio yields, particularly in L&R, given the longer duration of its portfolio. \n Alternative investment income totaled $26 million for an annualized return of about 1%, better than the losses last year, but below our long-term experience and outlook and down sequentially. Private equity returns are the principal driver of sequential decline in alternative returns this year as we have reduced our exposure to hedge funds over the last year. Private equity is reported on a 1-quarter lag based on when we receive the fund's financial reports. So this quarter's financial results reflect second quarter margins. \n Our investment portfolios have strong credit performance and remain well diversified and highly rated. We continue to monitor commercial real estate closely. Debt service coverage ratios are strong, including in the office sector. The primary impact has been on loan-to-value ratios and real estate equity valuations rather than delinquencies or defaults. We continue to work on near-term maturities, and almost all 2023 scheduled maturities have been addressed. \n Life and Retirement once again delivered strong results in the third quarter. Adjusted pretax income was $971 million, up 24% year-over-year, driven by continued investment spread expansion and strong sales, particularly in Fixed Index Annuities. Underwriting margins overall remain attractive. And on a sequential quarter basis, fee income and investment spreads improved. \n During the quarter, the annual actuarial assumptions update was completed, resulting in a modest $22 million increase in APTI, mostly in the Life Insurance segment, compared to a $29 million increase last year. Individual Retirement APTI increased $195 million or 52% over the prior year quarter from base spread expansion and general account product growth. \n The fixed annuity surrender rate increased sequentially from 15.9% to 17.7% this quarter as operations caught up on a backlog of surrender requests from earlier in the year. On a monthly basis, surrenders peaked early in the quarter and declined sequentially each month with continued improvement in October. \n Group Retirement APTI was flat year-over-year as higher fee income and alternative investment income were offset by lower other yield enhancement income and higher general operating expenses or GOE. Net outflows included one large $1 billion plan, which was mostly in mutual funds and, therefore, was not material to earnings. \n Life Insurance APT was also flat year-over-year, primarily due to lower policy fees and a lower favorable impact from the annual assumptions update, partially offset by higher net investment income. \n Institutional Markets APTI decreased $8 million or 10% due to less favorable mortality experience. Sales increased 19%, supported by record production of $1.9 billion, partially offset by lower PRT sales, which are highly variable quarter-to-quarter. \n Turning to Other Operations. Third quarter adjusted pretax loss improved by $149 million, driven by lower corporate and other GOE and higher short-term investment income. In addition, third quarter 2022 had investment losses on a legacy portfolio that was sold in 4Q '22. \n Corporate GOE was $243 million and included $68 million for Corebridge. Excluding Corebridge, AIG corporate GOE decreased $56 million from the prior year. We remain on track to reduce 2023 corporate GOE by at least $100 million, including a higher allocation to General Insurance that has not had a material impact on the expense ratio due to expense discipline across the company. \n Moving to the balance sheet. Third quarter 2023 estimated risk-based capital ratios remain above our target ranges. The General Insurance U.S. pool RBC is in the high 400s, while Life and Retirement is above its 400% target. At September 30, consolidated debt and preferred stock to total capital, excluding AOCI, was 25.9%, including $9.4 billion of Corebridge debt. \n Our approach to capital management is unchanged. We will continue to balance share repurchases and debt reduction while also focusing on increasing common stock dividends. As Peter indicated, from the Validus and Laya sales, we expect about $3.7 billion of additional parent liquidity in the fourth quarter. We have significant financial flexibility, which we intend to use for both additional share repurchases and debt reduction. \n Based on current average daily trading volumes, we expect to be able to repurchase about $1.5 billion of common stock a quarter or $500 million a month, which we will begin when the market window opens after earnings. We expect to continue at this rate into 2024, depending on excess parent liquidity levels, including future Corebridge sales proceeds and General Insurance dividends. In the fourth quarter, we also plan to accelerate debt repayment to rightsize our debt stock for our target deconsolidated leverage ratio. \n Turning to our ROCE target. We remain laser-focused and are making progress on achieving a 10%-plus ROCE post deconsolidation. Year-to-date, annualized adjusted ROCE for AIG was 8.8% and 12.0% in General Insurance and 11.4% in Life and Retirement. \n Last quarter, I provided a pro forma AIG shareholders' equity ex AOCI, excluding Corebridge, of about $40 billion, including deferred tax assets from the financial crisis era net operating losses. That's the capital supporting our General Insurance business and parent operations today, excluding our stake in Corebridge. \n With the sale of Validus Re and the redeployment of proceeds into share repurchases and debt reduction, the current pro forma estimate of AIG equity, excluding Corebridge, is about $37 billion, including $4 billion of deferred tax assets, or $33 billion of adjusted shareholders' equity, which is the number we use for calculating adjusted ROCE. \n Considering this equity level and our plans to simplify AIG's business and operational structure and to drive more predictable and sustainable profitability, we are confident that we will achieve our 10%-plus adjusted ROCE goal. We look forward to continuing to update you on our progress. \n With that, I will turn the call back over to Peter. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Thanks, Sabra. And Michelle, we're ready for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. \nMeyer Shields: One question to start on reserves. I guess, what's the process for ensuring that the adverse development in International Commercial doesn't actually reflect social inflation problem and that it's individual cases? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Meyer, thanks for the question. Sabra, do you want to cover? That's just a quick overview of -- Meyer mentioned the International and some of the inflation impact from reserves. \nSabra Purtill: Yes, certainly. And let me first start by explaining what the DVR process is. So DVR is a once-a-year deep-dive into our reserves. But each quarter, we do an actual versus expected analysis. So we do make adjustments to reserves on lines of business during the ordinary part of the year, but the deep-dive is where we really drill down into the lines in great detail. \n This quarter, as I noted, we had International casualty. The development that you see is related to very specific books or -- and I'm sorry, I'm getting a little feedback on the line here. So I don't know, Meyer, maybe you need to mute. Anyway, the International Commercial Lines is very much related to specific cases and judgments around settlements. \n And as I said and would also note in Peter's comment, these are generally from older accident years where we are exposed to much larger limits. So therefore, when you have a particular claim that goes against you, they do -- they are lumpy and they tend to be large. So what I would just say again is that we look at our book consistently during the course of the year, do a deep-dive once a year and then make some assessments based on specific facts and circumstances. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Thanks, Sabra. Meyer, do you have another question? \nMeyer Shields: Yes, just a quick one. I know there's a lot of moving parts in North America Personal. I was hoping you could give us some sense of maybe true underlying underwriting results and the path to profitability in that segment. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Great. Thank you. As we've talked about before, it's a business in transition. We're not pleased with the overall printed results. But we had outlined in the past that it's complicated. 2023 would be a transition year, particularly with PCS, which we see a lot of net premium written coming in each quarter. The earned will follow, and so we should have some significant benefit on the ratios as we fully earn in the premium over the coming quarters. \n When we look at fourth quarter 2023 and into 2024, we will see the mix of business change. And so therefore, the overall GOE and acquisition expenses should come down. We would see the accident year loss ratio, ex CAT, slightly go up just because of the mix of what PCS is underwriting. \n We did have some onetime items that I won't go into in the quarter that were headwinds in the Travel and Warranty business. But those businesses are going to have to contribute more as we get into 2024, and we're looking at the entire business model in order to improve their financial results. \n So we recognize the overall segment needs to improve. We believe we have the sort of business strategic alternatives in place, and we're going to be executing them. And again, it's just a choppy year as we make that transition. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Gary Ransom with Dowling & Partners. \nGary Ransom: I wanted to ask about Financial Lines. On the one hand, you noted that rates are going down in that segment. And on the other hand, you were talking about social inflation. And I mean, just generally, it seems to be as worrisome as ever. I know your reserves held up this quarter, but it's like we're in a soft market for those financial lines. And I wondered if you could add some more color on how you're managing through that portion of the cycle in that business. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Sure. Yes, thanks, Gary, for the question. And I'll have Dave make some specific comments. When we talk about the headwinds in Financial Lines, and again, Dave will go into it, but it's primarily North America and it's primarily excess. We've done a tremendous job over the past couple of years to reposition the business and not only with the underwriting, but also with cumulative rate. And so we still think there's margins, still think our scale and balance across the world is a competitive advantage. And when we talk about some of the challenges in Financial Lines, it's really specific to North America. \n Dave, do you want to provide some context in a little bit more detail, please? \nDavid McElroy: Yes. Yes, thank you, Peter. And thank you, Gary. The -- this is obviously a business that I've got a lot of scar tissue in over a lot of 40 years of this. And I sometimes think of my career credibility tied into fixing this book, but I am very confident with where we have positioned the book, okay? \n The -- we've taken a cautious approach to the large account public company D&O business and particularly excess, Gary, that you've referred to. So we're aware of the consequences of chasing volume, okay? We've seen companies go close to the sun, they burn out, where that's our sophistication. \n So the -- what we're doing here, private -- public company, D&O, the market, the private, their primary market is, frankly, a stable market, okay? It's holding up well. Cumulative rate increases, even though they went up 120% from the '18 to '21 year, they're trending around 85% today, and they're holding, okay? This is going to be about a story about excess. \n And I do want to frame this that in that primary market, there are a couple of key points that are also holding and that's retentions are holding up very nicely, okay? There hasn't been an erosion in the self-insured retentions that clients are keeping. And we look at that as sort of an acting hedge against legal cost inflation. \n And then the other fact that I've always been worried about is the arms race back to limits. And this industry did a great job, and I believe there was respect for this volatility by taking 25 million limits down to 10s and 15s down to 5s. So even today, our portfolio is in the 80% to 90% range of those limits on a primary basis. And therefore, the arms race to increasing limits, which is often led by those who may not understand the volatility, that has not happened, okay? So that's a win for the primary. \n I'm going to be -- I'll call out the excess because the battles and the competition in this market are classic, okay? These are tranches above $50 million. It's a commodity. We're seeing more competition there. And we're -- what we're going to do is we're going to do what we've been doing, reducing our limits, reducing our policy count. Our renewal retention right now is actually running 11 points lower than what would be normal in a standard market. And we're going to continue that way, not only on a policy count basis, but an aggregate -- in an aggregate basis. \n The 2 things I just called out, everybody knows that I've lived in this business for a bit, I'd call out the claim environment in the market, okay? The market may be mistiming the pricing of excess layers, okay? The plaintiffs' bar has circled back to large account. Securities class actions, they're actually up this year and looking more like the '16 to '19 cohort years, which are problematic for the industry versus the 2022 years. So it's one to be concerned about because that verticality of loss will actually affect the excess towers that are not going to be making money at [ $8,000 a mill ]. \n So this environment is not conducive to be putting out limits excess at those layers. And maybe the more important thing is about our AIG global book, okay? It is a formidable asset. And we had the heightened scrutiny on the North American book. We're confident around what that looks like. But the International book is a franchise that you could not duplicate in generations. \n It's performed better than the U.S. It's got -- it's actually larger than the U.S. book. It actually represents 60% of our total volume in the world. It has more geographic spread, particularly in Europe and Asia Pac. And it actually catches more private company business, SME business and middle-market cyber business than you might think in North America. So -- and other than some of the London subscription pricing, the pricing pressure there has been de minimis. And in fact, our rates are holding up better than 2023. \n So I always feel like when I got here, I didn't understand the impact and the power, but the AIG global franchise is an incredible asset, and it also is one that we have coordinated better to make sure that any sort of U.S. exposures are controlled collectively by both of us. So in some special asset, it's been built over 2 generations. We like what it is. We like the portfolio today. And it's -- there's been 5 years of work to frame this book to where we all trust it. And we trust the recent years for their performance, okay? \n Kicking back to you, Peter. I know I went long. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Thank you, David. Very thorough. Appreciate it. Gary... \nGary Ransom: Yes, that's a very thorough answer. I'm good. I mean I'm good with that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. \nTaylor Scott: First one I had for you is on sort of capital management related to Corebridge separation. I appreciate there's volume constraints, and it's good to have some guidance around how much capacity you can do in terms of buybacks a quarter. I did want to probe you a bit on to what degree, if at all, that, that considers further kind sell-down at Corebridge and sort of further special dividends coming out of Corebridge and so forth. \n I mean I think the math would tell us that you could potentially do more than $1.5 billion a quarter, particularly for like next year over 4 quarters. And I'm just a little sensitive to it because it affects sort of accretion dilution and just the lag and what to expect. So I want to make sure we have appropriate expectations around the timing of that share count reduction and so forth. So any help is very appreciated. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Yes, thanks very much for the question. I mean we tried to provide between Sabra's script and in my prepared remarks a lot of detail on capital management and also the additional liquidity where we're going to have from the special dividend from the Validus Re disposition and overall how we intend to use those proceeds. And it remains the same is we want to make sure that we provide ample capital in our subsidiaries to continue to drive growth. We still think there's great opportunities for us in the businesses that we're in to drive top line growth and continue to drive profit growth and more margin, and that is our primary focus. \n We've also given guidance in terms of the share count. And clearly, with the 7.5 billion of share authorization and now with the liquidity that we've outlined, we have a path towards that lower end of the 600 million. And so when we think about the next several quarters, certainly that's going to be the priority. \n Sabra and I alluded to the fact that we still want to clean up a little bit of debt and make sure that we're at the lower end of the ratios, but also reflecting that buying back shares is going to have an impact on your leverage and making certain that we are being thoughtful, prudent in getting ahead of that. \n In terms of the Corebridge sell-down, I mean we've been very methodical. Certainly, we would like to do something in the fourth quarter. We continue to look at all the different alternatives in terms of size and how we can do it. And it will be a priority for us to focus on when we conclude this call and start to focus into next week. \n I mean Corebridge has done a terrific job of setting itself up as a public company. And they're ready for deconsolidation in terms of their operations, but we want to make certain that we are very thoughtful in the current environment. And again, we'll use those proceeds to continue to accelerate what we've outlined on the capital management. \n I would expect, as we do a secondary and we get on future calls, we'll update and refresh some of the capital structure and also our guidance to see if we need to revise it. But I think that's probably all I can give you at this point. \nTaylor Scott: Yes, that's helpful. Second question I had is on the, I guess, the operating company level on the RemainCo General Insurance side of things. Where do you see those metrics over time? I mean one of the things that I've looked at is just decomposing the ROE, and the underwriting leverage itself seems lower at AIG, which made all the sense in the world as you guys had more volatility. \n But as you sort of expressed in your opening comments and as you guys have sort of proven out, the volatility is significantly reduced. So where can that go to over time? What are the right metrics for us to look at? Is it RBC premium to surplus? Any help on thinking through how much more business you could write on the equity you have? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Yes. Well, we could write significantly more business based on the capital we have in the subsidiaries today. We have a lot of moving pieces. I mean, certainly, selling Validus Re gives us a lot more flexibility in terms of how we position the portfolio for next year. \n And so I'll give you a couple of examples of that is that we underwrite property business where we pick up CAT across the world, whether it's Japan, our International business through Lexington, through Talbot, through our retail in North America. But we always had to be very cautious in terms of the overall volatility in terms of how we're correlated with Validus Re, including our reinsurance purchasing where we had certain retentions that might be lower than what our risk tolerance would assume within North America and International. We bought ILWs that benefited the group. \n And so like as we think about how we reposition the portfolio, I believe we have a significant amount of aggregate. We have a significant amount of capital. We have businesses that are positioned to propel growth and want to focus on that. \n Now maybe the first part of your question is, what type of leverage or how can you improve it? We recognize we have an expense issue. I mean when we look at the overall combination of our corporate expenses plus the expenses that sit in the business, yes, there's a little bit of a mix issue that when you look at some of the Personal Insurance, which are great businesses, and International may have a little bit more acquisition and GOE, but by and large, we need to get expenses out. \n And that's the focus. That will be the leverage in terms of contributing to ROE and also getting a future-state business that is leaner and does not have duplication across the world. I mean so that's the work we've been doing this year. We will be positioned pre-deconsolidation to start implementing that operating model. \n But I think the leverage is we have enough capital to grow, and we'll continue to grow the top line where we like the risk-adjusted returns, less volatility because we don't have a reinsurance business anymore. So we can do things a little bit differently on the primary side. And we know we have expenses that need to get out, and we're going to get them out, and that's going to drive us north of the 10% ROCE. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Zaremski with BMO. \nMichael Zaremski: My question is kind of on some points that were touched on already on the portfolio transformation strategy, which has obviously been successful over the past 5 years. So Peter, you used the T word, trillion, you said $1.4 trillion limit reduction. So just curious, I think David gave us a flavor of this answer, but does that -- is there a way to frame what percentage limit reduction your average -- this average policy is? It sounded like David said it's over 50% in some of those Financial Lines?\n And just related, like how is that -- was AIG an outlier previously and you moved towards the market? Or just how has this changed your competitive position in the marketplace? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Yes. I think you recognize how we were able to reduce volatility. When you have -- I have to even pause when I have to write out trillion because it's a big number. And $1.4 trillion of limit, I don't think that's been done in our business before, and then reposition the portfolio to drive significant profitability improvement. \n It absolutely was an outlier. Its gross limit deployment and net limit deployment was significant relative to any of its competitors. And in order to have the type of predictable results we've been able to produce over the past couple of years, when you see the relative improvement as well as absolute improvement, we are really proud of that. You had to take out the volatility, which was the outsized limits, not only from a gross perspective, and we recognize that. \n While we talk about it is that, yes, we're a buyer of reinsurance, it's strategic, it matters, but it's not what's driving the results. The driver of the results is the gross underwriting and the overall reduction. Everywhere you look, property, casualty, financial lines, everything is 50% plus of reduction of gross limits. And then you add on reinsurance to temper volatility, that's how we've been able to position the portfolio to have not only significantly improved results, less volatility, it's also very sustainable. And we believe that there's opportunities for further improvement. \nMichael Zaremski: Okay. Great. And my last, if I may, is on -- there's a lot of leadership changes over the past, right, years and quarters. I think Sabra used the term simplify structure. I guess any color you can offer on are we -- is the structure simplified, we're on baseball inning 4 or 9? Or any comments would be helpful. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Sure. Look, we've had a lot of change over the last 5 years. When I look at our overall attrition, it's at all-time low. We've had a couple of senior executives that we brought in to position the organization for the future and believe that the underwriting structure that we put forward is going to be with us for a couple of years. It's going to drive the performance that we've become accustomed to. And we'll continue to bring in skill sets in the organization that supplement what we already have in order to position us for the future. \n So I'm like really very pleased. As I said, we have very low attrition, continue to upgrade talent across the organization. And people want to come work here, which is a really positive attribute of the organization and how we position it for the future. \n So thank you. I do have one closing remark. First of all, I'm very proud, and I'd like to thank all of our colleagues for their efforts and all that they've done to progress our strategic plans and deliver consistently strong financial results. Very proud of them. \n I would like to say a few words about our former Chief Financial Officer, Shane Fitzsimons, who passed away on Friday, October 27. Shane had a brilliant career. He was highly thought of in the global business community and quickly earned the trust and respect of the insurance industry, which is not easy to do. \n He was a cherished colleague here at AIG. Shane brought energy, integrity and a very positive attitude that was both contagious and inspiring. He's a big reason why AIG is where it is today. Shane was a great friend to many of us, and we're so grateful for all that he did for AIG, our stakeholders and our colleagues. \n Thank you, and have a great day. \nOperator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Sabra Purtill",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter. This morning, I will provide more detail on AIG's third quarter, including General Insurance reserves, net investment income, Life and Retirement results and balance sheet and capital management. \n Adjusted after-tax income attributable to common shareholders this quarter was $1.2 billion, up 80% from 3Q '22, for an annualized adjusted ROCE of 8.5%. AATI per diluted share was $1.61, up 92%, reflecting the accretive impact of share repurchases over the last year. The earnings growth resulted from the 82% increase in General Insurance adjusted pretax income to $1.4 billion, driven by top line growth, improved underwriting results and higher investment income. \n It's important to note that while Life and Retirement also had strong earnings, AIG's ownership of Corebridge decreased to 65.6% this quarter compared to 90.1% before the IPO. And therefore, our results include a lower percentage of their consolidated earnings than last year. In total, Corebridge contributed about $32 million to the $514 million increase in AIG's adjusted after-tax income. \n Turning to General Insurance. Peter summarized our underwriting results, but I want to cover prior year development and reserves in more detail. In the quarter, General Insurance prior year development, net of reinsurance, totaled $139 million favorable, including $41 million from the amortization of deferred gain on the adverse development cover. About $129 million, including the ADC gain, resulted from the detailed valuation reviews, or DVRs, with the balance from other items like catastrophes. \n The DVRs covered $34.1 billion of loss reserves on a pre-ADC basis, about 70% of the total. The DVRs of particular note this quarter were for International Casualty and Financial Lines, North America Financial Lines and North America workers' compensation, which last year was completed in the second quarter. In total, North America had $154 million of favorable development, including $39 million from the ADC. International was $15 million unfavorable. \n Consistent with our prior comments, casualty, bodily injury, securities class actions and medical workers' comp trends have been and continue to be more favorable than our reserving assumptions. We believe that our changes in underwriting standards reduced limits, higher attachment points on primary limits, tightened terms and conditions and better risk selection are driving the improved experience, particularly in financial lines and casualty. \n Nevertheless, our philosophy is to react to bad news quickly and to allow time for favorable trends in recent accident years to mature, particularly given the impact of COVID on recent years. Therefore, this quarter's favorable development is generally from older accident years or from short-tail lines like property where physical damage claims come in quickly. \n In Financial Lines, changes from the DVRs were immaterial. North America had modest adverse development on an older Lexington architect and engineers book, offset by favorability in Canada. U.K. Financial Lines had slight adverse development, reflecting emerged experience on older D&O and professional indemnity claims, partially offset by favorable experience in Europe and Japan. \n We also reviewed International casualty lines this quarter. Peter discussed our changes in underwriting limits and reinsurance on our global casualty book. I would add that we also evaluate economic and social inflation trends as well as our potential exposure to mass torts across the total book and hold reserves to address those items. \n This quarter, we had adverse development in U.K. and European casualty, principally from commercial auto in France and large loss experience on a few older claims in both the U.K. and Europe. Consistent with prior trends, the DVRs for workers' compensation were favorable both for years covered by the ADC and after. \n Finally, property lines and Personal Insurance had favorable development in both North America and International, while we had about $23 million of adverse development on prior year catastrophes. We will complete the balance of annual DVRs next quarter, which cover about $6 billion of reserves on a number of smaller lines. \n Net investment income also contributed to earnings growth in the quarter, driven principally by higher reinvestment rates on fixed maturities and loans. The average new money yield on fixed maturities and loans was 5.88% this quarter, about 145 basis points above the yield on sales and maturities, and it was about 130 and 150 basis points higher in General Insurance and Life and Retirement, respectively. Year-to-date, the total new money yield is about 202 basis points higher than sales and maturities. \n The portfolio yield in General Insurance increased 9 basis points sequentially and 88 basis points over the last year with net investment income growth of 30%. The L&R investment income rose 23%, and the portfolio yield improved 9 basis points and 63 basis points, respectively. Based on the current treasury yield curve, we expect continued pickup in portfolio yields, particularly in L&R, given the longer duration of its portfolio. \n Alternative investment income totaled $26 million for an annualized return of about 1%, better than the losses last year, but below our long-term experience and outlook and down sequentially. Private equity returns are the principal driver of sequential decline in alternative returns this year as we have reduced our exposure to hedge funds over the last year. Private equity is reported on a 1-quarter lag based on when we receive the fund's financial reports. So this quarter's financial results reflect second quarter margins. \n Our investment portfolios have strong credit performance and remain well diversified and highly rated. We continue to monitor commercial real estate closely. Debt service coverage ratios are strong, including in the office sector. The primary impact has been on loan-to-value ratios and real estate equity valuations rather than delinquencies or defaults. We continue to work on near-term maturities, and almost all 2023 scheduled maturities have been addressed. \n Life and Retirement once again delivered strong results in the third quarter. Adjusted pretax income was $971 million, up 24% year-over-year, driven by continued investment spread expansion and strong sales, particularly in Fixed Index Annuities. Underwriting margins overall remain attractive. And on a sequential quarter basis, fee income and investment spreads improved. \n During the quarter, the annual actuarial assumptions update was completed, resulting in a modest $22 million increase in APTI, mostly in the Life Insurance segment, compared to a $29 million increase last year. Individual Retirement APTI increased $195 million or 52% over the prior year quarter from base spread expansion and general account product growth. \n The fixed annuity surrender rate increased sequentially from 15.9% to 17.7% this quarter as operations caught up on a backlog of surrender requests from earlier in the year. On a monthly basis, surrenders peaked early in the quarter and declined sequentially each month with continued improvement in October. \n Group Retirement APTI was flat year-over-year as higher fee income and alternative investment income were offset by lower other yield enhancement income and higher general operating expenses or GOE. Net outflows included one large $1 billion plan, which was mostly in mutual funds and, therefore, was not material to earnings. \n Life Insurance APT was also flat year-over-year, primarily due to lower policy fees and a lower favorable impact from the annual assumptions update, partially offset by higher net investment income. \n Institutional Markets APTI decreased $8 million or 10% due to less favorable mortality experience. Sales increased 19%, supported by record production of $1.9 billion, partially offset by lower PRT sales, which are highly variable quarter-to-quarter. \n Turning to Other Operations. Third quarter adjusted pretax loss improved by $149 million, driven by lower corporate and other GOE and higher short-term investment income. In addition, third quarter 2022 had investment losses on a legacy portfolio that was sold in 4Q '22. \n Corporate GOE was $243 million and included $68 million for Corebridge. Excluding Corebridge, AIG corporate GOE decreased $56 million from the prior year. We remain on track to reduce 2023 corporate GOE by at least $100 million, including a higher allocation to General Insurance that has not had a material impact on the expense ratio due to expense discipline across the company. \n Moving to the balance sheet. Third quarter 2023 estimated risk-based capital ratios remain above our target ranges. The General Insurance U.S. pool RBC is in the high 400s, while Life and Retirement is above its 400% target. At September 30, consolidated debt and preferred stock to total capital, excluding AOCI, was 25.9%, including $9.4 billion of Corebridge debt. \n Our approach to capital management is unchanged. We will continue to balance share repurchases and debt reduction while also focusing on increasing common stock dividends. As Peter indicated, from the Validus and Laya sales, we expect about $3.7 billion of additional parent liquidity in the fourth quarter. We have significant financial flexibility, which we intend to use for both additional share repurchases and debt reduction. \n Based on current average daily trading volumes, we expect to be able to repurchase about $1.5 billion of common stock a quarter or $500 million a month, which we will begin when the market window opens after earnings. We expect to continue at this rate into 2024, depending on excess parent liquidity levels, including future Corebridge sales proceeds and General Insurance dividends. In the fourth quarter, we also plan to accelerate debt repayment to rightsize our debt stock for our target deconsolidated leverage ratio. \n Turning to our ROCE target. We remain laser-focused and are making progress on achieving a 10%-plus ROCE post deconsolidation. Year-to-date, annualized adjusted ROCE for AIG was 8.8% and 12.0% in General Insurance and 11.4% in Life and Retirement. \n Last quarter, I provided a pro forma AIG shareholders' equity ex AOCI, excluding Corebridge, of about $40 billion, including deferred tax assets from the financial crisis era net operating losses. That's the capital supporting our General Insurance business and parent operations today, excluding our stake in Corebridge. \n With the sale of Validus Re and the redeployment of proceeds into share repurchases and debt reduction, the current pro forma estimate of AIG equity, excluding Corebridge, is about $37 billion, including $4 billion of deferred tax assets, or $33 billion of adjusted shareholders' equity, which is the number we use for calculating adjusted ROCE. \n Considering this equity level and our plans to simplify AIG's business and operational structure and to drive more predictable and sustainable profitability, we are confident that we will achieve our 10%-plus adjusted ROCE goal. We look forward to continuing to update you on our progress. \n With that, I will turn the call back over to Peter. Yes, certainly. And let me first start by explaining what the DVR process is. So DVR is a once-a-year deep-dive into our reserves. But each quarter, we do an actual versus expected analysis. So we do make adjustments to reserves on lines of business during the ordinary part of the year, but the deep-dive is where we really drill down into the lines in great detail. \n This quarter, as I noted, we had International casualty. The development that you see is related to very specific books or -- and I'm sorry, I'm getting a little feedback on the line here. So I don't know, Meyer, maybe you need to mute. Anyway, the International Commercial Lines is very much related to specific cases and judgments around settlements. \n And as I said and would also note in Peter's comment, these are generally from older accident years where we are exposed to much larger limits. So therefore, when you have a particular claim that goes against you, they do -- they are lumpy and they tend to be large. So what I would just say again is that we look at our book consistently during the course of the year, do a deep-dive once a year and then make some assessments based on specific facts and circumstances."

            "name": "Peter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review our third quarter financial results. Following my remarks, Sabra will provide more detail on the quarter and then we will take questions. Kevin Hogan and David McElroy will join us for the Q&A portion of the call.  \n In the third quarter, AIG continued to deliver exceptional results. We made significant progress in our strategic, operational and financial objectives, reflecting continued execution across our entire organization. \n During my remarks this morning, I will discuss the following topics: first, AIG's financial results, including Life and Retirement, and provide an update on recent divestitures; second, I will provide the results of AIG's General Insurance business; third, I will provide an update on the casualty insurance market more broadly and AIG's approach to our casualty portfolio; fourth, I will provide an update on our capital management strategy and the progress we have made this quarter. Sabra will provide more detail on AIG's balance sheet and capital position in her remarks. And lastly, I will reconfirm our guidance with respect to our path to a 10%-plus ROCE post deconsolidation of Corebridge.  \n Financial highlights from the third quarter included: adjusted after-tax income was $1.2 billion or $1.61 per diluted common share, representing a 92% increase year-over-year. Consolidated net investment income on an adjusted pretax income basis was $3.3 billion, a 29% increase year-over-year. In General Insurance, net investment income was $756 million, a 30% increase.  \n Net premiums written in General Insurance grew 9%. General Insurance underwriting income in the quarter was $611 million, which improved over 250% from the prior year quarter. The adjusted accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 86.3%, a 210 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter, which is an outstanding result.  \n Our CAT loss ratio was 6.9% with $462 million of total catastrophe losses, including reinstatement premiums, which included $70 million from Validus Re. We had favorable prior year reserve development of $139 million, reflecting favorable loss experience on our portfolio, resulting from our continued focus on underwriting discipline.  \n The Life and Retirement business also delivered strong results in the third quarter with continued sales momentum and spread expansion. Life and Retirement's adjusted pretax income was $971 million, up 24% year-over-year. Premiums and deposits grew 4% year-over-year to $9.2 billion, driven by strong Fixed Index Annuity sales, which exceeded $2 billion for the third consecutive quarter.  \n September marked the 1-year anniversary of Corebridge's initial public offering. And since the IPO, Corebridge has returned approximately $1.4 billion to shareholders and is well on track to its committed payout ratio. \n With respect to our remaining ownership of Corebridge, we continue to evaluate options that are aligned with the best interest of shareholders and our other stakeholders. We're very proud of the achievements that Corebridge has delivered towards its operational separation as a public company, and we remain committed to reducing our ownership and eventually a full separation. \n Turning to AIG's balance sheet. During the quarter, AIG returned over $1 billion to shareholders through $785 million of common stock repurchases and $261 million of dividends. In addition, we purchased $170 million of common stock in October. We deployed $289 million to retire Validus Re debt prior to the close of the transaction yesterday. And we ended the quarter with $3.6 billion of parent liquidity. \n During the quarter, we continued to make significant progress on our strategic repositioning as we have further simplified our portfolio, which we've talked about over the past several quarters. Yesterday, we announced the successful closing of the sale of Validus Re to RenaissanceRe for which we received a total consideration of $3.3 billion in cash, including a pre-close dividend and approximately $275 million at RenaissanceRe common stock. This divestiture streamlines our business model, simplifies our portfolio and further reduces our volatility.  \n Prior to closing the Validus Re transaction, we entered into an agreement with Enstar Group to provide AIG with protection against any adverse development on the 95% portion of Validus Re's loss reserves that AIG retains exposure to. The cost will be included in the gain on sale in the fourth quarter.  \n Enstar will provide $400 million of limit for an adverse development cover in excess of carried loss reserves on assumed reinsurance contracts underwritten by Validus Re with respect to accident year 2022 and prior. This ADC limit provides additional protection against downside exposure to reserves in excess of the expected redundancy to a modeled confidence level above the 90th percentile. Importantly, while we believe this ADC is prudent to mitigate the risk of any future adverse reserve development, we will benefit from any future favorable reserve development. \n In August, Corebridge entered into a definitive agreement to sell Laya Healthcare to AXA for EUR 650 million, which closed on October 31. Proceeds to Corebridge, net of purchase price adjustments and deal-related expenses, will be approximately $730 million. It was announced that the proceeds will be used for a special dividend to Corebridge shareholders as of November 13.  \n In September, Corebridge entered into a definitive agreement to sell the U.K. Life Insurance business to Aviva plc for GBP 460 million. We expect the transaction to close sometime in the second quarter of 2024, subject to regulatory approvals. We anticipate that the proceeds from this transaction will largely be used for share repurchases, subject to market conditions. Both transactions streamline the Corebridge portfolio and allow the company to focus on its Life and Retirement products and solutions in the United States.  \n Turning to General Insurance, gross premiums written were $8.9 billion, a decrease of 1% from prior year quarter. Net premiums written were $6.5 billion, an increase of 9% from the prior year quarter. Global Commercial grew 6%, and Global Personal grew 16% from the prior year quarter. North America Commercial net premiums written increased 5% in the third quarter.  \n There are many variables in this quarter, and I want to provide more detail. The key businesses that drove growth were Lexington's core business, excluding Lexington programs, grew over 25% in the quarter, led by wholesale casualty, which grew 33%; and wholesale property, which grew 27%. Glatfelter grew 12%, and Retail Property grew 11%. \n In terms of headwinds, in 2022, we made the underwriting decision to not renew 2 large Lexington programs. We took this action because we believe that these programs had meaningful CAT exposure in peak zones. And we do not believe the appropriate CAT loads were reflected in the pricing. These programs were not the best deployment of capital in order to achieve our targeted risk-adjusted returns. Those nonrenewals tempered overall growth in Lexington. \n Lexington program's net premiums written reduced by 57% in the quarter. We believe, over time, we will replace this business on an individual risk basis as stronger risk-adjusted returns. However, it is a headwind in the quarter. The impact of the net premiums written associated with these 2 programs was approximately $115 million in the third quarter. \n Also offsetting growth in North America was Financial Lines, which declined 11%, accounting for approximately 20% of North America Commercial Lines net premiums written in the quarter. In North America Financial Lines, large account public D&O remains competitive as a result of excess capacity driven by new entrants to the market. \n Our renewal retention in our primary business remains strong, but retentions in our excess business were more challenged. New business in our excess book was down year-over-year as we were very disciplined in the current environment.  \n Rate reductions remain most prevalent on excess layers, particularly the higher excess layer vertical towers where it's more commoditized and the most pressure exists on pricing. In primary, where we are one of the few market leaders, rates remained flat to slightly down. We remain confident in our approach to Financial Lines. We have a global business with scale, focused on underwriting profit over top line growth, which is reflected in the results this quarter.  \n In International Commercial, net premiums written grew 7%, primarily driven by property, which was up 13%; global specialty, which was up 12%, led by energy and marine; and Talbot, which was up 7%. \n Global Commercial had very strong renewal retention of 87% in its in-force portfolio. North America was up 200 basis points to 87%, and International was up 300 basis points to 88%. As a reminder, we calculate renewal retention prior to the impact of rate and exposure changes.  \n And across Global Commercial, we continue to see very strong new business, which was approximately $1 billion in the third quarter. North America Commercial produced new business of $516 million, an increase of 13% year-over-year or 27% if you exclude Financial Lines. This growth was driven by Lexington Casualty, which saw excellent new business growth of over 90%, as well as Western World, which grew over 50%.  \n Retail Property grew new business by 26%, and retail casualty grew new business by 25%. This was offset by Financial Lines where new business contracted by about 30% as a result of our underwriting discipline. \n International Commercial produced new business of $532 million or 12% growth year-over-year. This growth was led by Talbot new business, which increased almost 50% year-over-year, and Global Specialty, which grew new business by over 40%, and it was balanced across the portfolio.  \n Moving to rate. In North America Commercial, rate increased 5.4% in the third quarter or 6% excluding workers' compensation. Exposure in the quarter added 3 points, bringing the total pricing change, excluding workers' comp, to 9%. \n Rate increases were driven by Lexington wholesale, which was up 15%, marking the 18th consecutive quarter of double-digit rate increases, led by Lexington wholesale property, which was up 28%, Retail Property was up 27% and admitted excess casualty was up 12%. Financial Lines rate was down 8%.  \n In International Commercial, rate increased 4%, and the exposure increase was 2%. The rate increase was driven by property, which was up 13%; energy, which was up 10%; and Talbot, which was up 9%. \n Turning to Personal Insurance, net premiums written increased 16% year-over-year, primarily driven by North America. In North America, Personal net premiums written increased 59%. Similar to last quarter, the increase was driven by business underwritten on behalf of PCS, offset by decreases in Travel and Warranty.  \n In the third quarter, AIG's net premiums written from PCS increased by over 100%, benefiting from an increase in gross premiums written and a reduction in quota share sessions. And as expected, the lag in earned premium growth continued to dissipate, providing operating leverage and a reduced expense ratio, primarily in general operating expenses. \n The high and ultra high net worth business also had significant improvement in the accident year loss ratio, benefiting from improved pricing in our admitted business and transitioning more business to the non-admitted market. We expect PCS to continue to improve its financial performance and provide more operating leverage in the fourth quarter and into 2024. \n In International Personal, net premiums written increased by 3% year-over-year, driven by growth in personal auto, travel, and that reflects the rebound post-pandemic and Japan personal property. The accident year loss ratio, ex CAT, improved 560 basis points. Overall, we're pleased with the International Personal improvement year-over-year. \n Shifting to combined ratios. The General Insurance third quarter combined ratio was 90.5%, a 680 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter. Accident year combined ratio, ex CAT, was 86.3%, a 210 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter. \n Global Commercial had an outstanding performance with third quarter accident year combined ratio, ex CAT, of 81.7%, a 130 basis point improvement year-over-year. The accident year combined ratio, including CAT, was 89.7%, a 500 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter.  \n The North America Commercial accident year combined ratio, ex CAT, was 83%. And the International Commercial accident year combined ratio, ex CAT, was 79.7%, both of which were exceptional outcomes. \n We would like to provide a perspective both with and without Validus Re and Crop Risk Services. As I said, the third quarter Global Commercial accident year combined ratio, ex CAT, was 81.7%, and the calendar year combined ratio was 86.6%. Excluding Validus Re from the third quarter results, the Global Commercial accident year combined ratio would essentially have been flat, and the calendar year combined ratio would have improved by slightly over 100 basis points from the third quarter to 85.4%.  \n And for the first 9 months, the Global Commercial accident year combined ratio, ex CAT, was 83.6%, and the calendar year combined ratio was 87.6%. Excluding Crop and Validus Re from the 9-month period results, the Global Commercial accident year combined ratio, ex CAT, would have increased by 70 basis points to 84.3%, and the calendar year combined ratio would have increased by 50 basis points to 88.1%.  \n Global Personal reported a third quarter accident year combined ratio, ex CAT, of 99%, a 380 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter due in part to the North America PCS business. \n Related to casualty liability and the excess casualty market, in particular in the United States, the level of narrative has increased over the last several years, driven in part by multiple mass tort events as well as rising economic and social inflation. The latter has been fueled by an exponential increase in third-party litigation funding, average severity trend increases and a precipitous rise in jury awards following the lull during the pandemic. \n Over the past couple of years, I've spoken extensively about our portfolio remediation strategy, including where AIG has reduced gross limits since 2018 by $1.4 trillion. We have established strong underwriting guidelines and strong partnerships with reinsurers to manage both frequency and severity. \n We have filed a similar strategy with our casualty portfolio with more of a focus on severity. When we began the underwriting turnaround in AIG in 2017, we found that the prior strategy in casualty was similar to that in the property business, which was to write large limits with a gross and net risk appetite much greater than what we offer today.  \n As I've outlined before, it was not uncommon to put out significant limits on any individual risk in excess of $100 million net on an occurrence basis. As we developed an entirely new framework and approach to underwriting, it required a change to our underwriting strategy.  \n Today, our global casualty portfolio represents 12% of our total gross premiums written and 13% of our net premiums written. The North America segment represents 55%, and the International segment represents 45% of that number. And since North America has been the topic of discussion, I will focus on what we have done in that portfolio. \n In North America casualty, our gross limit for our excess casualty portfolio, including lead umbrella, has decreased by over 50% since 2018. Our average limit size has also reduced by over 50%. Average lead attachment points, which protect us from frequency and lower severity losses, have more than doubled since 2018. \n In terms of gross pricing, primary auto and primary general liability, rates have increased approximately 200% since 2018, and excess casualty rates have increased by over 250%, remaining well above loss cost trends.  \n In addition to the significant investment in underwriting excellence and talent, we built and executed on a strategic reinsurance program to further mitigate our net exposure and volatility. What once was $100 million net exposure for AIG, there's now a maximum net on any one claim of $15 million in International and $11.5 million in North America. \n And in our excess of loss treaties, we have reinstatement limits that exhaust based on extensive modeling done at the [ 1,000 ] return periods. This adequately protects AIG from vertical exposure with significant limit available in the event there are multiple losses. \n Notably, the period prior to 2016 is covered by an adverse development cover for U.S. long-tail commercial lines. We purchased 80% of a $25 billion -- excess of $25 billion on payments made on or after January 1, 2016, for business written prior to 2016. The $25 billion retention was exceeded during the fourth quarter of 2020. We currently have $9 billion of the total unused recoverable limit left or $7.2 billion at the 80% level. \n Conflicting views have emerged in the market on the combination of gross portfolio underwriting with the strategic use of reinsurance. There have been comments particularly recently that the use of reinsurance is not required if you're comfortable with the gross portfolio. We disagree and simply don't support that as a viable strategy for AIG.  \n We prefer to balance our approach and have developed a strong underwriting culture, which we have dramatically improved over the last 5 years, executing on the fundamentals of disciplined and consistent underwriting, being very focused on preempting the evolving changes in the market and using reinsurance strategically to mitigate unpredictable outcomes. \n Building long-term strategic relationships with our reinsurance partners for all of our reinsurance needs has been key to repositioning AIG. Insurers cannot reverse social and economic inflation. However, we are in control of how we predict and respond to the impact of these changes to the forward-looking landscape, including how we manage our underwriting through coverage provided, limits deployed, attachment points and pricing.  \n Our business is not immune from social inflation, but we anticipated it early, and we took action. The consequence is that we're very pleased with our existing portfolio, and we're well positioned to be able to prudently take advantage of opportunities that exist in the current marketplace.  \n Turning to capital management. We use a balanced framework that remains focused on having ample capital in our insurance company subsidiaries to support organic growth in our business, continuing share repurchases, debt reduction in line with the lower end of the targets we provided and dividend increases. Lastly, we will consider compelling inorganic growth opportunities to meet our strategic objectives should they emerge. \n We finished the third quarter with $3.6 billion of available liquidity prior to receiving the proceeds of the sale of Validus Re or the special dividend from the sale of Laya Healthcare. Together, they should contribute approximately another $3.7 billion in the fourth quarter. Our primary use of proceeds will be on share repurchases. We plan to accelerate our repurchase activity this quarter and as we enter 2024, and we expect to reduce debt outstanding to further strengthen the balance sheet. \n We remain mindful of our leverage as a key consideration with our accelerated share repurchases. We expect to execute on the current share repurchase authorization of $7.5 billion, which will reduce shares outstanding to close to 600 million shares subject to market conditions. \n Related to return on common equity, as we have outlined on our prior calls, we remain very focused on delivering a 10%-plus ROCE post deconsolidation of Corebridge. During the third quarter, we continue to make significant progress at all 4 components of our path to deliver on this commitment and how we are positioning AIG for the future. \n I want to provide a few observations. In the last 90 days, we've continued to improve our underwriting results on an accident year and calendar year basis. We made recent leadership changes in General Insurance, which have effectively eliminated a management layer from the business, and we will continue this process throughout the organization in 2024. \n We have strengthened the capital position of insurance company subsidiaries to enable continued profitable growth. We've moved into the final stages of the operational separation for Corebridge. We have announced and closed several divestitures and have repositioned the portfolio to support our strategy for the future. We have accelerated the progress we're making on our capital management strategy and have created a strong liquidity position. \n The catalyst to achieving our targets remains the deconsolidation of Corebridge. This will allow AIG to simplify its business, eliminate duplication by combining our General Insurance business and our corporate functions, and create a leaner operating model for the future. \n Before I turn it over to Sabra, I'd like to add a few more details on the closing of the sale of Validus Re to RenaissanceRe. In January of 2018, AIG announced it was acquiring Validus Holdings to position it for future growth and profitability improvement. Over the last several years, we reshaped Validus Re's portfolio by reducing the catastrophe exposure in certain U.S. peak zones while diversifying the business significantly to develop a more balanced portfolio in both property and casualty reinsurance in order to improve profitability. \n Validus Re posted its first accident year combined ratio below 100% in 2022. And as we look back, we are grateful for the hard work, determination and perseverance of the team to dramatically improve the quality of the portfolio, particularly year-to-date in 2023, and it's evident in its performance today. \n We are very proud of Validus Re's results and are pleased that the company acquiring Validus Re is RenaissanceRe. Through Kevin O'Donnell and his leadership team's terrific work, RenaissanceRe has become one of the world's most well-respected reinsurers. We are looking forward to continuing our strong partnership with RenaissanceRe, which will be further enhanced as we become an investor in RenRe's capital partner vehicles, allowing us to benefit from their future performance. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Sabra. Thanks, Sabra. And Michelle, we're ready for questions. Meyer, thanks for the question. Sabra, do you want to cover? That's just a quick overview of -- Meyer mentioned the International and some of the inflation impact from reserves. Thanks, Sabra. Meyer, do you have another question? Great. Thank you. As we've talked about before, it's a business in transition. We're not pleased with the overall printed results. But we had outlined in the past that it's complicated. 2023 would be a transition year, particularly with PCS, which we see a lot of net premium written coming in each quarter. The earned will follow, and so we should have some significant benefit on the ratios as we fully earn in the premium over the coming quarters. \n When we look at fourth quarter 2023 and into 2024, we will see the mix of business change. And so therefore, the overall GOE and acquisition expenses should come down. We would see the accident year loss ratio, ex CAT, slightly go up just because of the mix of what PCS is underwriting. \n We did have some onetime items that I won't go into in the quarter that were headwinds in the Travel and Warranty business. But those businesses are going to have to contribute more as we get into 2024, and we're looking at the entire business model in order to improve their financial results. \n So we recognize the overall segment needs to improve. We believe we have the sort of business strategic alternatives in place, and we're going to be executing them. And again, it's just a choppy year as we make that transition. Sure. Yes, thanks, Gary, for the question. And I'll have Dave make some specific comments. When we talk about the headwinds in Financial Lines, and again, Dave will go into it, but it's primarily North America and it's primarily excess. We've done a tremendous job over the past couple of years to reposition the business and not only with the underwriting, but also with cumulative rate. And so we still think there's margins, still think our scale and balance across the world is a competitive advantage. And when we talk about some of the challenges in Financial Lines, it's really specific to North America. \n Dave, do you want to provide some context in a little bit more detail, please? Thank you, David. Very thorough. Appreciate it. Gary... Yes, thanks very much for the question. I mean we tried to provide between Sabra's script and in my prepared remarks a lot of detail on capital management and also the additional liquidity where we're going to have from the special dividend from the Validus Re disposition and overall how we intend to use those proceeds. And it remains the same is we want to make sure that we provide ample capital in our subsidiaries to continue to drive growth. We still think there's great opportunities for us in the businesses that we're in to drive top line growth and continue to drive profit growth and more margin, and that is our primary focus. \n We've also given guidance in terms of the share count. And clearly, with the 7.5 billion of share authorization and now with the liquidity that we've outlined, we have a path towards that lower end of the 600 million. And so when we think about the next several quarters, certainly that's going to be the priority. \n Sabra and I alluded to the fact that we still want to clean up a little bit of debt and make sure that we're at the lower end of the ratios, but also reflecting that buying back shares is going to have an impact on your leverage and making certain that we are being thoughtful, prudent in getting ahead of that. \n In terms of the Corebridge sell-down, I mean we've been very methodical. Certainly, we would like to do something in the fourth quarter. We continue to look at all the different alternatives in terms of size and how we can do it. And it will be a priority for us to focus on when we conclude this call and start to focus into next week. \n I mean Corebridge has done a terrific job of setting itself up as a public company. And they're ready for deconsolidation in terms of their operations, but we want to make certain that we are very thoughtful in the current environment. And again, we'll use those proceeds to continue to accelerate what we've outlined on the capital management. \n I would expect, as we do a secondary and we get on future calls, we'll update and refresh some of the capital structure and also our guidance to see if we need to revise it. But I think that's probably all I can give you at this point. Yes. Well, we could write significantly more business based on the capital we have in the subsidiaries today. We have a lot of moving pieces. I mean, certainly, selling Validus Re gives us a lot more flexibility in terms of how we position the portfolio for next year. \n And so I'll give you a couple of examples of that is that we underwrite property business where we pick up CAT across the world, whether it's Japan, our International business through Lexington, through Talbot, through our retail in North America. But we always had to be very cautious in terms of the overall volatility in terms of how we're correlated with Validus Re, including our reinsurance purchasing where we had certain retentions that might be lower than what our risk tolerance would assume within North America and International. We bought ILWs that benefited the group. \n And so like as we think about how we reposition the portfolio, I believe we have a significant amount of aggregate. We have a significant amount of capital. We have businesses that are positioned to propel growth and want to focus on that. \n Now maybe the first part of your question is, what type of leverage or how can you improve it? We recognize we have an expense issue. I mean when we look at the overall combination of our corporate expenses plus the expenses that sit in the business, yes, there's a little bit of a mix issue that when you look at some of the Personal Insurance, which are great businesses, and International may have a little bit more acquisition and GOE, but by and large, we need to get expenses out. \n And that's the focus. That will be the leverage in terms of contributing to ROE and also getting a future-state business that is leaner and does not have duplication across the world. I mean so that's the work we've been doing this year. We will be positioned pre-deconsolidation to start implementing that operating model. \n But I think the leverage is we have enough capital to grow, and we'll continue to grow the top line where we like the risk-adjusted returns, less volatility because we don't have a reinsurance business anymore. So we can do things a little bit differently on the primary side. And we know we have expenses that need to get out, and we're going to get them out, and that's going to drive us north of the 10% ROCE. Yes. I think you recognize how we were able to reduce volatility. When you have -- I have to even pause when I have to write out trillion because it's a big number. And $1.4 trillion of limit, I don't think that's been done in our business before, and then reposition the portfolio to drive significant profitability improvement. \n It absolutely was an outlier. Its gross limit deployment and net limit deployment was significant relative to any of its competitors. And in order to have the type of predictable results we've been able to produce over the past couple of years, when you see the relative improvement as well as absolute improvement, we are really proud of that. You had to take out the volatility, which was the outsized limits, not only from a gross perspective, and we recognize that. \n While we talk about it is that, yes, we're a buyer of reinsurance, it's strategic, it matters, but it's not what's driving the results. The driver of the results is the gross underwriting and the overall reduction. Everywhere you look, property, casualty, financial lines, everything is 50% plus of reduction of gross limits. And then you add on reinsurance to temper volatility, that's how we've been able to position the portfolio to have not only significantly improved results, less volatility, it's also very sustainable. And we believe that there's opportunities for further improvement. Sure. Look, we've had a lot of change over the last 5 years. When I look at our overall attrition, it's at all-time low. We've had a couple of senior executives that we brought in to position the organization for the future and believe that the underwriting structure that we put forward is going to be with us for a couple of years. It's going to drive the performance that we've become accustomed to. And we'll continue to bring in skill sets in the organization that supplement what we already have in order to position us for the future. \n So I'm like really very pleased. As I said, we have very low attrition, continue to upgrade talent across the organization. And people want to come work here, which is a really positive attribute of the organization and how we position it for the future. \n So thank you. I do have one closing remark. First of all, I'm very proud, and I'd like to thank all of our colleagues for their efforts and all that they've done to progress our strategic plans and deliver consistently strong financial results. Very proud of them. \n I would like to say a few words about our former Chief Financial Officer, Shane Fitzsimons, who passed away on Friday, October 27. Shane had a brilliant career. He was highly thought of in the global business community and quickly earned the trust and respect of the insurance industry, which is not easy to do. \n He was a cherished colleague here at AIG. Shane brought energy, integrity and a very positive attitude that was both contagious and inspiring. He's a big reason why AIG is where it is today. Shane was a great friend to many of us, and we're so grateful for all that he did for AIG, our stakeholders and our colleagues. \n Thank you, and have a great day."

Additionally, today's remarks will include results of AIG's Life and Retirement segment and Other Operations on the same basis as prior quarters, which is how we expect to continue to report until the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial. \n AIG segments and U.S. GAAP financial results as well as AIG's key financial metrics with respect thereto differ from those reported by Corebridge Financial. Corebridge Financial will host its earnings call on Friday, August 4. \n With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino. \nPeter Zaffino: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review our second quarter financial results. Following my remarks, Sabra will provide more detail on the quarter, and then we will take questions. Kevin Hogan and David McElroy will join us for the Q&A portion of the call. \n I am very pleased to report that AIG delivered another exceptional quarter with strong financial performance. In addition, we made significant progress on our strategic priorities that are strengthening AIG for the future. We again demonstrated our ability to deliver high-quality outcomes while executing on multiple complex initiatives during very difficult market conditions. \n I would like to start with financial highlights from the second quarter. Adjusted after-tax income was $1.3 billion or $1.75 per diluted common share, representing a 26% increase year-over-year and the best quarterly adjusted EPS result for AIG since 2007. \n Net premiums written in General Insurance grew 11%, led by our Commercial business, which grew 13%. Underwriting income in the quarter was approximately $600 million. The adjusted accident year combined ratio ex cats was 88%, a 50 basis point improvement year-over-year and the best result for AIG since 2007. Our cat loss ratio was 3.9% or $250 million of catastrophe losses, a terrific result against the backdrop of a very challenging cat quarter for the industry. \n The Life and Retirement business reported very good results in the second quarter. Adjusted pretax income was $991 million, up 33% year-over-year. And premiums and deposits were over $10 billion, a 42% increase year-over-year, supported by record sales of Fixed Index Annuity products. \n Consolidated net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.3 billion in the second quarter, a 31% increase year-over-year. In General Insurance, net investment income was $725 million, a 58% increase. \n AIG returned $822 million to shareholders in the second quarter through $554 million of common stock repurchases and a $268 million of dividends, which reflects a 12.5% increase in our quarterly common stock dividend that we announced on our last call. As you saw in our press release, the AIG Board of Directors approved an increase to our share buyback authorization to $7.5 billion, which reflects our commitment to returning capital to shareholders, consistent with the capital management strategy we have previously outlined. \n Lastly, our balance sheet remains very strong. And we ended the quarter with $4.3 billion in parent liquidity. During the remainder of my remarks this morning, I will provide more information on the following 5 topics. First, the significant strategic actions we took in the second quarter to reposition AIG. During that review, I will provide additional details on the divestitures of Validus Re and Crop Risk Services, the launch of Private Client Select as an MGA serving the high and ultra-high net worth markets and the actions we took with respect to Corebridge. \n Second, I will discuss financial results for General Insurance. Third, I will give an overview of the results for Life and Retirement. Fourth, I will provide an update on capital management. And lastly, I will reconfirm our guidance with respect to our path to a 10%-plus ROCE post deconsolidation of Corebridge. \n Turning to the strategic actions we executed on. I will start with Validus Re. In May, we announced the divestiture of Validus Re and AlphaCat to RenaissanceRe for approximately $2.75 billion in cash and $250 million in RenRe common stock. We expect to close this transaction in the fourth quarter, subject to regulatory approval. \n We're very pleased to have RenRe as the acquirer. RenRe is a very important partner to us, a company with a terrific reputation. And we value the strong relationship we have with Kevin and his management team. We believe RenRe will be an excellent owner of Validus Re. \n Now let me provide some highlights on our rationale for the divestiture. We acquired Validus in 2018, which at the time provided AIG with business diversification not limited just to reinsurance but also attractive specialty businesses, including Talbot and Western World, which were not part of the sale to RenRe and will remain with AIG. \n Since 2018, we transformed Validus Re by reunderwriting the portfolio, leading to significant premium growth and improved profitability. In addition, we dramatically changed the business mix of the portfolio to achieve a more attractive balance among property, casualty and specialty businesses, improved geographic diversity and decreased peak zone exposures. \n For AIG, this divestiture represents a key milestone on our journey as it further streamlines our business model, simplifies the structure of our global portfolio, substantially reduces volatility, which I will explain in a moment, generate additional liquidity and capital efficiencies and accelerates our capital management strategy. Due to the nature of assumed reinsurance and the portfolio mix of Validus Re, this business is capital-intensive and disproportionately contributes to AIG's overall volatility and PMLs. \n As we have discussed over the past few years, the core objectives of the property and casualty turnaround were: to substantially improve the overall quality of AIG's global portfolio and underwriting results; reduce volatility through a massive reduction in growth limits written; better manage peak zone exposures and geographic balance; and strategically use reinsurance across our overall business. A turnaround of this magnitude is made harder when you have a treaty reinsurance business, which, by its very nature, has volatility. \n We have completed a rigorous enterprise-wide modeling exercise using RMS version 21 to approximate the PMLs for AIG post closing, and all categories will significantly reduce. This analysis took into account AIG's exposure, Validus Re's exposure as of February 1, 2023, and combined output for both companies on an occurrence and aggregate basis. \n Let me provide a few examples of the model output for AIG post closing of the Validus Re sale on an occurrence basis. For worldwide, all perils, net PMLs were reduced by 45% at the 1-in-250 return period. Worldwide hurricane PMLs will reduce by 60% at the 1-in-250 return period and by 70% at the 1-in-100 return period. \n North America hurricane PMLs will reduce by 70% at the 1-100 return period. North America earthquake PMLs will reduce by 55% at the 1-250 return period. Japan typhoon PMLs will reduce by 50% at the 1-100 return period. Japan earthquake PMLs will reduce by 50% at the 1-250 return period. And for EMEA, all PMLs will decrease by 85% at the 1-250 return period and 75% at the 1-100 return period. \n In addition to the strategic repositioning of our portfolio, there were several additional components that made the sale of Validus Re appealing for AIG. The required tangible equity that AIG will deliver to RenRe upon closing, which is $2.1 billion, is substantially below what Validus Re would have required if the business remained at AIG. \n We will receive $900 million above the book value of Validus Re, which reflects the improved quality of the portfolio since AIG's purchase of the business in 2018. We also expect to receive, through a pre-closing dividend, excess capital in the legal entities being transferred to RenRe, which we estimate will be approximately $200 million. \n In addition, a $1 billion intercompany loan from Validus Re to AIG will be settled through internal dividends, and we expect AIG to benefit from a $400 million reduction in risk-based capital requirements following the closing. As part of the transaction, AIG will retain 95% of future reserve changes in the portfolio delivered at closing. We will receive the benefit of future reserve releases as the portfolio matures, and we will likely purchase an adverse development cover prior to the closing to minimize potential future reserve exposure. \n In the second quarter, we also announced and closed the sale of Crop Risk Services to American Financial Group for $240 million in cash. Crop Risk Services was part of the Validus acquisition in 2018. Over the remainder of the 2023 crop season, AIG will continue to benefit from earned premium for crop business booked since the start of the year. But as we enter 2024, this business will no longer have an impact on AIG's financial results. \n Next, I want to provide more detail on the formation of Private Client Select as an MGA, which is now referred to as PCS. The MGA has officially launched, and we expect to add new capital providers in the coming quarters. We believe the MGA structure is ideal for PCS as it creates flexibility and alternatives for clients, agents and brokers in an environment that's becoming more complex. \n The high and ultra-high net worth markets PCS is focused on have significant foundational challenges include loss cost pressure, inflation, increased cat exposure through increased total insured values and more concentration in peak zones, and primary and secondary peril modeling has been [indiscernible]. AIG will continue to support the MGA. And because we will be assuming risk on our balance sheet, we've established the MGA's risk framework, which is designed to improve its financial performance in 2023 and as we enter 2024. \n Overall, we are pleased with the progress we've made with Stone Point Capital on this MGA structure. And we're well positioned to accelerate the business plan through the remainder of the year. \n Moving to Corebridge. In June, we completed a secondary offering of Corebridge common stock with gross proceeds to AIG of $1.2 billion. The offering was well received by the market. And the new owners included a strong mix of long-term holders, which we believe results in a more stable and well-diversified shareholder base for Corebridge. \n Also in June, Corebridge announced and paid a $400 million special dividend in addition to its $150 million ordinary quarterly dividend and completed the repurchase of $200 million of common stock from AIG and Blackstone. AIG's net proceeds from these actions were approximately $540 million. \n At the end of the second quarter, our ownership stake in Corebridge was approximately 65%. These actions demonstrate our commitment to deconsolidation and eventually full separation. As we noted on our last call, we continue to explore all options with respect to our remaining ownership of Corebridge that are aligned with the best interest of shareholders. \n Turning to other strategic actions we are taking in Corebridge. The previously announced sale process for Laya Healthcare, the private medical insurance business in Ireland that is part of Corebridge, is proceeding very well. We expect to announce a positive outcome from this process in the near term and expect that the proceeds from this divestiture will largely be used for a special dividend to Corebridge shareholders. \n Additionally, we recently retained advisers to analyze strategic alternatives for the disposition of the U.K. Life business that is part of Corebridge. The dispositions of Laya and U.K. Life will streamline the Corebridge portfolio and allow its management team to focus on core Life and Retirement products and solutions in the United States. \n Turning to General Insurance. We had another quarter of strong growth in both gross and net premiums written. Gross premiums written were $10.4 billion, an increase of 11%. Global Commercial, which represents 80% of gross premiums written, grew 15%. And Global Personal decreased 1%. \n Net premiums written were $7.5 billion, an increase of 11%. This growth was driven by Global Commercial, which grew 13% while Global Personal grew 5%. In North America Commercial, we saw a very strong growth of 18% in net premiums written. Excluding Validus Re, net premiums written growth in North America Commercial was 13%. The major drivers were as follows: Retail Property, which grew over 50%; Validus Re, which grew 32%; and Lexington, which grew 18%, led by wholesale property and casualty. \n I would like to provide a few additional details about Lexington's growth, given it continues to be an important part of AIG's strategy. Property grew 38% year-over-year driven by very strong retention in new business as well as strong rate increases. Submission activity was up over 30% year-over-year. Casualty grew 41%, supported by strong retention in new business, and its submission count was up over 90%. \n In International Commercial, net premiums written grew 6% primarily driven by property, which was up 34%; Talbot, which was up 17%; and Global Specialty, which was up mid-single digits, which reflected the impact of additional reinsurance purchasing in the second quarter. \n Global Commercial had very strong renewal retention of 88% in its in-force portfolio. International was up 200 basis points to 88%, and North America was up 200 basis points to 87%. As a reminder, we calculate renewal retention prior to the impact of rate and exposure changes. \n And across Global Commercial, we continue to see strong new business, which was approximately $1.1 billion in the second quarter. North America Commercial, excluding Validus Re, produced new business of approximately $600 million, an increase of 10% year-over-year. \n This growth was driven by Lexington property, which saw excellent new business growth of over 40%. Retail Property had over 50% new business growth, offset by Financial Lines, where new business contracted by over 35%. \n International Commercial new business was $485 million, which grew 5%. This growth was led by Talbot new business, which increased over 100% year-over-year and property, which grew new business by 40%, offset by Financial Lines where new business contracted by over 20%. \n As I noted on our last call, we continue to see headwinds in certain aspects of Financial Lines due to increased competition putting pressure on pricing. Despite these continuing dynamics, we remain disciplined on risk selection, terms and conditions and price while taking a long-term view on this line of business by not following the market down. \n Moving to rate. In North America Commercial, excluding Validus Re, rate increased 8% in the second quarter or 9% if you exclude workers' compensation, and the exposure increase was 2%. Rate increases were driven by Lexington wholesale, which was up 23% with wholesale property up over 35% and Retail Property, which was up 30%. \n In International Commercial, rate increased 9%, and the exposure increase was 1%. The rate increase was driven by property, which was up 21%; Talbot, which was up 14%; and Global Specialty, which was up 11% driven by global energy, which was up 21%. Rate plus exposure was 10% in North America, 11% if you exclude workers' compensation and 10% in International, which in each case remains above loss cost trend. \n Turning to Personal Insurance. Note that second quarter results in North America Personal reflected the fact that PCG was transitioning to become Private Client Select. North America Personal net premiums written increased 17% primarily driven by lower quota share sessions in PCG, offset by decreases in travel and warranty. Overall, we had strong growth in net premiums written of 17% with PCG net premiums written growing over 60%. \n With PCS now officially launched as an MGA, there are several components of AIG's business in the high and ultra-high net worth markets that will result in improved financial performance for AIG over the balance of 2023. First, as we outlined in prior calls, over the last few years, we evolved the model for our high and ultra-high net worth business such that we expect net premiums written to grow significantly over the remainder of the year with our current expectations showing net premiums written increasing over 75% in the third and fourth quarters. \n Second, the lag and earned premium growth that we saw in the first quarter of 2023 dissipated. And we saw a 36% growth in earned premium in the second quarter. And we expect that earned premium growth will continue to accelerate in the third and fourth quarter. The additional earned premium will provide operating leverage, which will reduce our GOE ratio in the third and fourth quarter. \n Third, AIG has [indiscernible] costs from the transition of PCG to an MGA. And we expect to eliminate these costs over the next 18 months. \n Fourth, we expect the accident year loss ratio for our high and ultra-high net worth business will improve with the combination of improved pricing in our admitted business and more business migrating to the non-admitted market, which already had a very positive impact on PCG's accident and policy year loss ratios in prior quarters. This should earn in for our high and ultra-high net worth business through the second half of 2023 and into 2024. \n In International Personal, net premiums written increased 1% year-over-year. The modest growth was driven by travel and personal property in Japan. Overall, our key focus continues to be growing Accident & Health and our business in Japan. \n Shifting to combined ratios. As I noted earlier, the second quarter accident year combined ratio ex-CATs was 88%, a 50 basis point improvement year-over-year. In Global Commercial, the second quarter accident year combined ratio ex-CATs was 84.4%, a 90 basis point improvement year-over-year. \n The North America Commercial accident year combined ratio ex-CATs was 85.1%, a 310 basis point improvement year-over-year. And the International Commercial accident year combined ratio ex-CATs was 83.1%, which continues to be an outstanding level of profitability. Global Personal reported a second quarter accident year combined ratio ex-CATs of 98.1%, a 170 basis point increase from the prior year quarter, largely due to a decrease in earned premium. \n Now I'd like to provide some context around midyear reinsurance renewals and recent conditions in the reinsurance market before moving to Life and Retirement. We purchased our major reinsurance treaties at January 1. However, approximately 20% of our overall core reinsurance purchasing occurs in the second quarter as we have a number of core midyear renewals, predominantly in specialty classes, and they were all successfully placed. \n In addition, we decided to purchase additional retrocessional protection for Validus Re and a low excess of loss reinsurance placement for Private Client Group ahead of the wind season. Overall, the market exhibited more orderly behavior during midyear renewals amidst more stable trading conditions compared to January 1. Reinsure appetite for more discrete purchases increased somewhat, enabling a number of buyers to make up for shortfalls in coverage experienced at January 1. \n Overall, midyear property cat pricing increased 25% to 35% year-over-year in the U.S. driven by Florida. This was the second year in a row of substantial rate increases. International renewals, driven by Australia and New Zealand, saw price increase 20% to 50% with higher increases resulting from loss activity in the region. \n In previous calls, I touched on the increase in catastrophe losses from secondary perils. Through the first half of 2023, the industry has already experienced over $50 billion of insured losses, the majority of which were due to secondary perils, making 2023 already the fourth highest year on an inflation-adjusted basis. \n A majority of insured losses continue to occur in the United States, highlighting the difficulty of managing volatility in the largest insurance market in the world. Against this challenging backdrop and a strengthened reinsurance rating environment, we maintained our conservative risk appetite and continue to have one of the lowest peak peril net positions in the market while managing our overall reinsurance spend. \n Additionally, through each of our renewals, we maintain all of our principal relationships with our key reinsurance partners. While we are exiting the assumed reinsurance business through the sale of Validus Re, our ownership of RenRe common stock that we will receive as part of the purchase price consideration, coupled with our ability to invest up to $500 million in RenRe's capital partner vehicles, will allow us to continue to participate and benefit from partnering with a world-class reinsurer with less risk and capital requirements. \n Turning to Life Retirement. As I noted earlier, the business produced very good results in the second quarter. Adjusted pretax income was $991 million. And adjusted return on segment equity was 12.2%, representing a 250 basis point improvement year-over-year. \n Premiums and deposits grew 42% year-over-year to $10 billion driven by record Fixed Index Annuity sales. Corebridge ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet with parent liquidity of $1.6 billion and a financial leverage ratio of 28%. Over the second quarter, we continue to make good progress against the Corebridge operational separation so that it can eventually be a fully standalone company. \n A key focus has been executing against IT separation, which we believe will be substantially complete by the end of this year. To date, approximately 55% of the transition service agreements put in place at the time of the IPO have already been exited. \n Now turning to capital management. As I noted earlier, in the second quarter, we returned approximately $822 million to shareholders through common stock repurchases and dividends. And the additional $400 million of common stock we repurchased in July brings a total amount of capital we've returned to shareholders since the beginning of the second quarter to over $1.2 billion. \n In addition, we continue to focus on maintaining well-capitalized subsidiaries to enable profitable growth across our global portfolio. And we remain committed to having a leverage ratio in the low 20s and a share count between 600 million to 650 million post deconsolidation of Corebridge. \n The additional liquidity we will have following the closing of the sale of Validus Re will largely be used for share repurchases, which we expect to accelerate beginning in the fourth quarter and as we enter 2024. We also plan to use some of the proceeds from the sale of Validus Re to reduce outstanding debt. \n Lastly with respect to ROCE. We remain highly committed to delivering a 10%-plus ROCE post deconsolidation of Corebridge. During the second quarter, we continued to make meaningful progress on all 4 components of our path to deliver on this commitment. As a reminder, these are sustain and improve underwriting profitability; executing on a simpler, leaner business model across AIG with lower expenses across the organization; operational separation and deconsolidation of Corebridge; and continued balanced capital management. The sequencing of each component has been very important. \n We are now able to accelerate this work with the GI underwriting turnaround, AIG 200 and the investment group restructuring largely behind us and the operational separation of Corebridge further along, in addition to divestitures, which I've already outlined. As I stated on our last call, we're moving away from AIG's historical conglomerate structure to being a leading global insurance company with a leaner and better defined parent company. \n We continue to expect approximately $500 million in cost reductions across AIG with a cost to achieve of approximately $400 million with substantially faster earn-in of savings than we saw with AIG 200. Sabra will provide more details on our path to a 10%-plus ROCE in her remarks. \n Overall, I could not be more pleased with our progress and what we've accomplished in the first half of the year. Our strong momentum continues, and we have a very solid foundation to build on for the future. \n Now I'll turn the call over to Sabra. \nSabra Purtill: Thank you, Peter. This morning, I will provide more detail on second quarter results, including net investment income and underwriting performance, provide a balance sheet update and review the drivers of our path to a 10%-plus adjusted ROCE. \n Starting with second quarter results. As Peter noted, adjusted after-tax income was $1.3 billion, up 15% from last year or an annualized adjusted ROCE of 9.4%. Adjusted after-tax income per diluted share was $1.75, up 26% from last year, reflecting the impact of share repurchases on EPS. \n Second quarter results were consistent with recent trends: strong underwriting margins and higher net investment income in General Insurance; increased base investment yields; and spreads and strong sales in Life and Retirement and continued expense reduction in balanced capital management and Corporate and Other. \n Turning to net investment income. On an APTI basis, investment income improved significantly, up 31% from last year and up 7% sequentially on a consolidated basis and also rose in each segment. Reinvestment rates are driving higher yields. The average new money yield was 5.46%, about 210 basis points above the yield on sales and maturities. \n In General Insurance, this increased the yield on the fixed maturities and loan portfolios 93 basis points over last year and 23 basis points sequentially. In Life and Retirement, the yield improved 75 basis points and 15 basis points, respectively. \n Alternative investment returns also improved this quarter, although they remain below our long-term outlook totaling $147 million for an annualized return of 6.0%. Credit performance has been strong with more upgrades than downgrades in the fixed maturity portfolios and continued derisking of lower-rated assets. \n Commercial property valuations continue to face downward pressure from higher cap rates, which impacts loan to values on commercial mortgage loans and investment returns on real estate equity funds. However, debt service coverage ratios are holding up well and are generally strong across the portfolio, including office. \n Turning to General Insurance. APTI was $1.3 billion, up $62 million from the prior year. Net investment income rose by $267 million. And underwriting income for the current accident year, excluding catastrophe losses, were $73 million. \n Total catastrophe losses were $250 million, up $129 million and included $56 million of first quarter CAT mostly from U.S. events, including a tornado that occurred at quarter end. This was a very solid result, as Peter noted, given the high level of industry catastrophe losses, particularly in North America. \n North America cat losses were $159 million, while International totaled $91 million, largely from Typhoon Mawar. During the second quarter, we conducted North America casualty DVRs, or detailed valuation reviews, which reviewed about 20% of reserves compared to 15% last year. \n In our DVRs, we focus on changes in frequency and severity trends, including social and other types of inflation as well as changes in claims trends and settlements such as occurred during COVID. As we noted previously, casualty bodily injury and medical workers' comp trends in our book have been and continue to be more favorable than our reserving assumptions. \n Our approach in these situations is to react quickly to adverse development, but to be conservative and wait to recognize favorable trends until accident years are more mature. We maintain the same approach for the COVID accident years where claims development patterns in many casualty lines slowed. \n For those years, we have lagged our development factors to allow more time for claims patterns to mature as we are taking the conservative position that industry claims experience will revert to pre-COVID patterns. In addition to the results of the DVRs, prior year development also includes amortization of the ADC gain, changes in prior year catastrophe losses and impacts from loss-sensitive lines that are not related to DVRs. \n In this quarter, prior year development net of reinsurance and prior year premiums was $25 million favorable. This was made up of $115 million of favorable loss reserve development, partially offset by $90 million of prior year return premium. The lower favorable development compared to last year is mainly attributable to the excess workers' compensation DVR, which was favorable by about $75 million in second quarter last year but is being completed in the third quarter of this year. \n Our favorable loss reserve development included $167 million from North American Commercial Lines, including $41 million of ADC amortization, $50 million of favorable development from our Agrium loss-sensitive portfolio and $74 million of favorable development resulting from North America DVRs. This was partially offset by $62 million of unfavorable development in International Commercial Lines, principally from a multiyear legacy casualty policy that was written with much higher limits than we do today. \n In the third quarter, DVRs will cover nearly 70% of reserves, including Financial Lines. Financial Lines claims have not returned to the levels we experienced pre-COVID, which we believe reflects improved underwriting, better loss selection, continued ventilation of risk, our reinsurance strategy and achieving appropriate levels of rate. \n With respect to underwriting. AIG's share of U.S. public company D&O securities class actions where we are the primary insurer is down from 42% in 2017 to about 20% at the end of the second quarter of this year. \n With respect to rate. Since 2018, the compounded increases in the Financial Lines portfolio for corporate and national accounts are greater than 60% and 50%, respectively. However, consistent with our conservative approach, in addition to the lag development factors, we are placing more weight on longer-term experience and balancing out more favorable recent trends. \n Turning to Life and Retirement. As Peter noted, second quarter results were strong with APTI up 30% over 2Q '22, driven by higher spread in underwriting margins and strong sales in Fixed Index Annuities. Both spreads and underwriting margins remain attractive, and fee margins improved with more favorable capital market levels compared to last year. \n Base net investment spreads in Individual and Group Retirement continued to widen with 64 basis points improvement year-over-year and 9 basis points sequentially driven by reinvestment rates. Individual Retirement APTI increased $215 million or 58% from 2Q '22 driven by base spread expansion and growth in general account products. Positive net flows to the general account were about $400 million. \n Group Retirement APTI grew by $21 million or 12% driven by continued base spread expansion despite negative flows in the general account. Life Insurance APTI decreased $42 million, or 35%, primarily due to lower other yield enhancement income, partially offset by improved base portfolio returns and marginally favorable mortality experience. Institutional markets delivered very strong results with APTI up $50 million or 65% driven by investment income and reserve growth. Second quarter premiums and deposits reached $2.9 billion with $1.9 billion of pension risk transfer activity and $970 million of GIC transactions. \n Turning to AIG's Other Operations. Second quarter adjusted pretax loss improved by $41 million over last year driven by an $80 million improvement in corporate and other due to the 4Q '22 sale of legacy investment portfolios that had losses of $119 million in 2Q '22. Corporate general operating expenses of $242 million included $67 million of Corebridge expenses, including separation expenses. Excluding Corebridge and separation-related expenses, corporate GOE decreased $19 million from the prior year. \n Moving to the balance sheet. We continue to execute on our balanced capital management strategy with share repurchases, an increase in our common stock dividend and repayment of maturing debt. We ended the quarter with AIG parent liquidity of $4.3 billion. \n We remain committed to maintaining strong capitalization in our insurance subsidiaries to support risk and growth. The General Insurance U.S. pool risk-based capital ratio is estimated in the 470% to the 480% range, and Life and Retirement is projected to be above its 400% target. \n We repaid a $388 million debt maturity in the second quarter and continue to target debt leverage in the low 20s post deconsolidation of Corebridge. At June 30, consolidated debt and preferred stock to total capital, excluding AOCI, was 26.0%, including about $9.4 billion of Corebridge debt. Book value per common share was $58.49 on June 30, 2023, up 6% from year-end. Adjusted book value per common share was $75.76 per share, flat from year-end. \n Turning to ROCE. We remain intently focused and are making progress on achieving a 10%-plus adjusted ROCE post deconsolidation. Year-to-date, annualized adjusted ROCE for AIG was 9.1% on a consolidated basis and 11.8% in General Insurance and 11.4% in Life and Retirement. \n Capital management and rightsizing our equity base for AIG post deconsolidation are material levers for achieving our adjusted ROCE goal. In the near term, we will accelerate share repurchases in the fourth quarter and into 2024 with the additional liquidity from Validus proceeds, in addition to ordinary course liquidity generated by our business operations through subsidiary dividends and ongoing profitability. \n We will balance these share repurchases with additional debt reduction consistent with our leverage target. We are committed to achieving a share count between 600 million and 650 million shares post deconsolidation, which we will be able to achieve with the increase in our share repurchase program to $7.5 billion. \n Based on the size, risk profile and profitability of our General Insurance business and holding company needs today, we estimate a pro forma GAAP equity base, excluding AOCI, of approximately $40 billion for AIG ex-Corebridge. This is inclusive of about $4 billion in deferred tax asset NOLs that we exclude for adjusted common shareholders' equity calculation. \n Considering this equity level and our plans to simplify AIG's business and operational structure, reduce volatility and drive more predictable and sustainable profitability, we are confident that we will achieve our adjusted ROCE goal. We look forward to continuing to update you on our progress. \n With that, I will turn the call back over to Peter. \nPeter Zaffino: Thank you, Sabra. And operator, we're ready for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler. \nJon Paul Newsome: Congrats on the quarter. I was hoping we could focus in on the general -- the North American Commercial business a little bit. I'm getting some questions about the growth. If you sort of assume a certain amount of growth is related to the price increases sort of ex-Validus and whether or not we saw a fair amount of growth -- just sort of if you normalize [indiscernible] Validus. Sorry, I know you gave a lot of detail there, but maybe if you could kind of simplify it for -- that'd be fantastic. \nPeter Zaffino: Sure. Thanks, Paul. As we talked about in our prepared remarks, we are very pleased with our overall growth across the world. And retention is up, new business was terrific and balanced. And rate, well above loss cost, was evident in so many parts of our business. \n If I unpack it as you asked, I mean, look at North America, we discussed Validus Re, was up 32%, but it's not cyclically its largest quarter. It was basically 25% of North America. But other businesses had tremendous quarters. \n Lexington had 18% growth. But that was also part of us discontinuing a big program that we didn't like the risk-adjusted returns that had an impact on top line premium growth. And so I would look at Lexington in terms of casualty, which was 40% growth. Lexington property, which was 35% growth. Retail property was up over 50% in the quarter, and I outlined the rate increases were north of 30% for 2 quarters in a row. \n Our actual retail casualty business was up in the high single digits. So it was a very good outcome for net premium written in North America. The headwind was Financial Lines, which was down a little bit over 10%, but that is something that is specific to North America. But we have a really good balance in growth. \n If I look at -- I'll just expand a little bit in terms of International. We had really strong growth in property. Our syndicate Talbot was up 17%. International Specialty, I drew it out as a mid-single-digit growth net premium written in the quarter. We had some discretionary spends on treaty reinsurance. On a gross basis, it grew over 40%. And I want to call out, Financial Lines is not experiencing the same headwinds as North America, and International was flat. And that's our largest business in the second quarter in International. So had a little bit more of the weight in terms of the overall growth. But I thought it was really balanced, really well done and all the fundamentals we're executing on. \nJon Paul Newsome: And my second question, I wanted to ask about the cat load in particular in North America as we think of it going forward. I mean, clearly, from the data you showed us, you talked about on the call the volatility piece or the tail is going to be reduced a lot on Validus Re. On an ongoing basis, do you also see kind of a reduction in the cat load from the efforts that you're making with Validus Re and other pieces and changes that you [indiscernible]? \nPeter Zaffino: Yes, thanks, Paul. I gave probably a little bit more PML information than people may have liked, but it's really the story is 3 components. One is what we did in the reunderwriting to reduce gross exposure across AIG. By the way, including Validus Re over the last several years. And we shed over $1 trillion of limit most of it property. And so that had an effect on exposure and PMLs at all return periods. \n I think the reinsurance programs that we bought are world-class. We keep calling that out, but in a very challenging and difficult environment at 1/1, we did not compromise by taking a lot more net because of reinsurance pricing. It reflected our book. We got great partners. And as a result, we didn't really have more net in terms of overall low-return peered PMLs. \n And so what I drew out in the Validus Re example, again, is on occurrence. It was the RMS model. We'll work through it. We got plenty of aggregate as to drive businesses that exists within AIG. But yes, I mean, like it's a different company. I mean, we're not going to have the tail exposure. But also at all return periods, we're going to have less cat. We've managed aggregates across the world and look at Validus Re as a very good business. But as I said, when we want to continue to reduce volatility, we do that through reinsurance. But when you have a treaty reinsurance business that is -- got a portfolio that has a lot of cat, that's harder to do. So I think the volatility, the cat loads will go down. By the very nature, we're going to lose a big part of our cat exposure. But we've been conservative on that and increased them this year and are very comfortable with our estimates and our actual results. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW. \nMeyer Shields: Peter, you gave us a lot of detail about rate and exposure changes. And we saw a little bit of sequential improvement. But I was wondering if you could talk about changes in the gap between rate increases and loss trends from the first quarter to the second quarter of this year. \nPeter Zaffino: Sure, Meyer. We have given guidance. So let me start with the loss cost inflation, which is still at 6.5. And you can imagine in a company like ours, I mean, it's an index. And so we look at each line of business each quarter, make minor modifications or as we did in the back half of last year just based on inflation, more meaningful adjustments. \n I'm really pleased with the discipline the company is showing on driving rate above loss cost, and we've done that across the world. So the rate environment in the second quarter was very strong. I gave you the guidance on the prepared remarks of North America excluding work comp, 9%; International at 9%. The drivers for this Retail Property, excess and surplus lines and our specialty businesses, the headwind for rate in North America was Financial Lines. And it's worth noting again that we have a very big footprint. \n And I mentioned in the prior question that International is not experiencing the same rate issues. And again, when I look back over the last 14 quarters, each quarter has been a positive rate increase in Financial Lines. So it's different for our International portfolio versus our domestic. And we continue to look at businesses like properties getting a lot of attention, but you can't look at that as a single quarter. \n I mentioned before, cost increases on the loss cost side, inflation, cost of capital, but also the cost of reinsurance for the industry, ours was a high single-digit risk-adjusted increase at 1/1. But those reinsurance costs in the industry are going to need to play in over the course of a year or maybe even like in Europe's case, into the first quarter, absent anything happening through cat season. So I think this is the market that we're in. It's a disciplined market. The cost of capital is more expensive, and we're going to be very prudent in where we deploy capital. But I'm very comfortable that we are driving margin on a written basis, and that will continue as we get to the back half of the year. \nMeyer Shields: Okay. That's very helpful. One thing that you said in your prepared remarks also that surprised me was that you're seeing a huge uptick in casualty submissions in Lexington. I think we expected the property side. I was hoping if you can dig a little bit deeper into what's going on in specialty casualty. \nPeter Zaffino: Yes. Well, Lexington is just a great story. When we look at -- we had record submission count across Lexington. We drove very strong growth at the top line, but it's one of our most profitable businesses. And Dave McElroy, Lou Levinson, who leads Lexington, this has all been about driving value for our distribution partners and wholesale brokers. And we've been asking for submission activity on all lines of business. \n And so when we're going to deploy property, yes, we have aggregate. Yes, the performance has been very good. Yes, the growth opportunity is there on its own. But we have been very focused on driving opportunities across the portfolio, and we're asking for the business. \n And so like the submission activity is substantial. And then I think being one of the largest wholesale underwriters and respected as one of the top in terms of underwriting excellence, we're getting looks at multiple lines of business. And we have staffed up in order to take on that additional volume on the property and casualty side. So I was very pleased that the team executed as well as it did, and I expect that to continue. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. \nYaron Kinar: First question, I guess, going back to Paul's question on Validus. Could you offer us like a pro forma margin profile for North America Commercial ex the Validus sale, maybe even ex the crop business? \nPeter Zaffino: It's a very good question, but I have to follow up with a question back to you. Do you want it over a longer period of time? Because I mean, looking at a cat business in the second quarter and again, I'm happy to provide some detail. It was accretive by a little over 100 basis points in the quarter to a combined ratio. \n But don't forget, its acquisition ratio is higher than our normal business. The loss ratio was slightly below based on dynamics going on in the market today. When I look at our overall business and ones that I continue to highlight, Lexington specialty, our property, a little more accretive than Validus Re. \n So I wouldn't have the impression that it's going to be highly dilutive. Obviously, it's done really well in the first half of the year. But if I go back the last 3 to 4 years, last year is the first year we were able to publish a combined ratio below 100. And so looking at the combined ratios of the business overall, it's been a positive contributor in the first half of this year. But in terms of the business, we have a lot of business to perform better. And we have -- in terms of the index, I don't think it will materially impact us. \nYaron Kinar: Got it. And maybe just as a clarification. Your commentary, is that on a reported basis or underlying? \nPeter Zaffino: Both. But we don't break it out. But I mean, in terms of looking at it from 2018 through 2022, 2022 was the first year on a fully low to combined ratio is below 100. \nYaron Kinar: Got it. And then my second question, given the secondary and Corebridge and we're starting to see a line of sight to below 50%, can you maybe offer us a precise threshold for deconsolidation? \nPeter Zaffino: No. I can't offer you precise, but I can give you some guidance in terms of what we're thinking if that's okay. \nYaron Kinar: Sure. \nPeter Zaffino: Yes. So the secondary is our base case. And we would expect to do something hopefully before year-end, subject to market conditions. I think what we have proven over time is that we want to be prepared. And so we prepared for the IPO, ended up delaying it just based on market conditions, prepared on the secondary. And so we will be prepared to go before year-end. \n I think Corebridge is doing very well in its business performance, its operation as a public company. And then we have made enormous progress of getting it ready to be a standalone public company once we deconsolidate. They're executing very well on the management plan. \n Again, Kevin will outline it in detail on Friday, but they're able to execute on capital management now with share repurchases as well as ordinary dividend. And so we certainly want to continue to sell down at a reasonable pace, but it's just going to be subject to market conditions and where the business is. \nYaron Kinar: Peter, I apologize. I was not really focused on the timing. I was more interested on what the precise percentage would be to see deconsolidation. Is it the second we drop below 50%? \nPeter Zaffino: Depending on Board structure. But if we modify the Board structure, it would be below 50%. But on the current Board structure, we'd have to go below 45%. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. \nTaylor Scott: First one I had is on the capital deployment. I mean, I think one of the most challenging things to sort of model and forecast from the outside right now is just how you'll go about deploying the proceeds from a lot of the actions you're taking, including the separation of Corebridge. So I was just interested if there's any updated thoughts. I know in the past, you guys have kind of given the share count range. Any thoughts you'd provide or guidance as it relates to where the share count could go from here? \nPeter Zaffino: I think what we've outlined is still the base case. We ended up in the low 700s in terms of our share count. Sabra did a very good job of outlining the liquidity that we have and liquidity that will be coming in. \n We have focused on the 4 components in a very rigorous way of making sure that we have capital and subsidiaries to drive the growth in a market that we think is very favorable. We increased our dividend this year, and so we want to continue to focus on that. \n Our leverage in the low 20s, and Sabra and I both indicated, we'll do some cleanup on debt because the impact of share repurchases, you need to continue to still retire debt. And the main focus from liquidity is going to be on share repurchase, and that will be highly correlated to when we close on RenRe. \n We'll be active in the market in the third quarter. And I really couldn't give you much more guidance on that other than we're really focused on the share repurchase and getting to that 600 million to 650 million shares. \nTaylor Scott: Got it. That makes sense. I guess a follow-up sort of in the same vein. In terms of organic deployment, I listen to the PML comments you're making and think about the volatility and how much better it is and then the fact that you guys, I think, still have below-average underwriting leverage, at least when we sort of look at like premiums to surplus, those kind of metrics. Do you have the capacity to be able to fund this greater growth, whether it's in Lexington and some other businesses in General Insurance, without using so much of the proceeds from the strategic actions? \nPeter Zaffino: We do, and it's been a big focus for us. Sabra, do you want to expand on that a little bit? \nSabra Purtill: Yes. Thanks. I would just note, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, that the risk-based capital ratios in our U.S. pool are in the range of 470% to 480%, which is well above our target range of 400% to 420%. So we have ample capacity within the General Insurance businesses today to support growth. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Zaremski with BMO. \nMichael Zaremski: My question is about the exist -- remaining portfolio post the sale of Validus pending in the crop business. Are there other and what you did on the -- what you're doing on the personal line side. Are there other pieces of the portfolio that still need additional optimization? Or are we kind of mostly through the major actions? \nPeter Zaffino: I think we're through most of the major actions. We have to focus more on Personal Insurance, and then we have been certainly, the -- we spent a lot of time on the ultra and high net worth business and the actions that we're taking there in terms of improving it. And we'll see that as we go to the back half of '23 and into '24. \n Japan is a big focus for us, and it's a terrific business, one that has terrific scale, performs very well, needs more digital investment. And we have such a wide distribution of agents that we can scale more products. So we'll see some investment in Japan on digital workflow and digital interfacing with customers. And we've been working through that over the past 12 to 18 months. So I would expect to see improved performance there. \n And then also our Global Accident & Health business, which performs very well mostly overseas in International, but that's going to have investment. And we would expect to see more growth and more profitability improvement there. \n But I don't -- it's not major. It's more of just making strategic investments in order to position the portfolio to be more advantageous. So those will be the areas of focus. But after Validus Re, we had a very active quarter and certainly would not expect another one of those, but we are going to continue to try to drive improvement throughout the portfolio. \nMichael Zaremski: Okay. Great. And my follow-up is switching gears, thinking about AIG's long-term kind of combined ratio inclusive of other expenses. If we're thinking longer term, you've done a great job improving the loss ratio. We're clear that there's still -- you have guidance on expenses coming down. \n But when you say longer term, most of the wood's been chopped in the loss ratio, and we should be thinking about overall expenses is kind of getting you to the double-digit ROE land sustainably? Or is there still loss ratio components such as maybe reserves and whatnot that could continue to improve over time? \nPeter Zaffino: No, I think you're thinking of it the right way. I mean, we've done an incredible job in terms of getting the portfolio that was in existence in '17 and '18 to where it is today. We know that we're an outlier on the expense ratio. That's a big part of what we're doing in the future operating model. And we'll start to show more and more evidence of that in the coming quarters and as we go into 2024. \n I did mention not to repeat the first part of the answer, but I do think that there's loss ratio and combined ratio opportunity for improvement in Personal Insurance. And we're heavily focused on that in terms of its balance across all of AIG. But when we look at the improvement in ROCE, expenses is going to be a big part of it. And as we focus on getting to our future operating model, that scale and discipline around having an expense ratio that's more favorable will be a huge focus of this management team. \n Okay. Thanks. I want to thank everybody for joining us today. I hope you have a great day. \nOperator: Thank you for participating at today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Peter Zaffino",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review our second quarter financial results. Following my remarks, Sabra will provide more detail on the quarter, and then we will take questions. Kevin Hogan and David McElroy will join us for the Q&A portion of the call. \n I am very pleased to report that AIG delivered another exceptional quarter with strong financial performance. In addition, we made significant progress on our strategic priorities that are strengthening AIG for the future. We again demonstrated our ability to deliver high-quality outcomes while executing on multiple complex initiatives during very difficult market conditions. \n I would like to start with financial highlights from the second quarter. Adjusted after-tax income was $1.3 billion or $1.75 per diluted common share, representing a 26% increase year-over-year and the best quarterly adjusted EPS result for AIG since 2007. \n Net premiums written in General Insurance grew 11%, led by our Commercial business, which grew 13%. Underwriting income in the quarter was approximately $600 million. The adjusted accident year combined ratio ex cats was 88%, a 50 basis point improvement year-over-year and the best result for AIG since 2007. Our cat loss ratio was 3.9% or $250 million of catastrophe losses, a terrific result against the backdrop of a very challenging cat quarter for the industry. \n The Life and Retirement business reported very good results in the second quarter. Adjusted pretax income was $991 million, up 33% year-over-year. And premiums and deposits were over $10 billion, a 42% increase year-over-year, supported by record sales of Fixed Index Annuity products. \n Consolidated net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.3 billion in the second quarter, a 31% increase year-over-year. In General Insurance, net investment income was $725 million, a 58% increase. \n AIG returned $822 million to shareholders in the second quarter through $554 million of common stock repurchases and a $268 million of dividends, which reflects a 12.5% increase in our quarterly common stock dividend that we announced on our last call. As you saw in our press release, the AIG Board of Directors approved an increase to our share buyback authorization to $7.5 billion, which reflects our commitment to returning capital to shareholders, consistent with the capital management strategy we have previously outlined. \n Lastly, our balance sheet remains very strong. And we ended the quarter with $4.3 billion in parent liquidity. During the remainder of my remarks this morning, I will provide more information on the following 5 topics. First, the significant strategic actions we took in the second quarter to reposition AIG. During that review, I will provide additional details on the divestitures of Validus Re and Crop Risk Services, the launch of Private Client Select as an MGA serving the high and ultra-high net worth markets and the actions we took with respect to Corebridge. \n Second, I will discuss financial results for General Insurance. Third, I will give an overview of the results for Life and Retirement. Fourth, I will provide an update on capital management. And lastly, I will reconfirm our guidance with respect to our path to a 10%-plus ROCE post deconsolidation of Corebridge. \n Turning to the strategic actions we executed on. I will start with Validus Re. In May, we announced the divestiture of Validus Re and AlphaCat to RenaissanceRe for approximately $2.75 billion in cash and $250 million in RenRe common stock. We expect to close this transaction in the fourth quarter, subject to regulatory approval. \n We're very pleased to have RenRe as the acquirer. RenRe is a very important partner to us, a company with a terrific reputation. And we value the strong relationship we have with Kevin and his management team. We believe RenRe will be an excellent owner of Validus Re. \n Now let me provide some highlights on our rationale for the divestiture. We acquired Validus in 2018, which at the time provided AIG with business diversification not limited just to reinsurance but also attractive specialty businesses, including Talbot and Western World, which were not part of the sale to RenRe and will remain with AIG. \n Since 2018, we transformed Validus Re by reunderwriting the portfolio, leading to significant premium growth and improved profitability. In addition, we dramatically changed the business mix of the portfolio to achieve a more attractive balance among property, casualty and specialty businesses, improved geographic diversity and decreased peak zone exposures. \n For AIG, this divestiture represents a key milestone on our journey as it further streamlines our business model, simplifies the structure of our global portfolio, substantially reduces volatility, which I will explain in a moment, generate additional liquidity and capital efficiencies and accelerates our capital management strategy. Due to the nature of assumed reinsurance and the portfolio mix of Validus Re, this business is capital-intensive and disproportionately contributes to AIG's overall volatility and PMLs. \n As we have discussed over the past few years, the core objectives of the property and casualty turnaround were: to substantially improve the overall quality of AIG's global portfolio and underwriting results; reduce volatility through a massive reduction in growth limits written; better manage peak zone exposures and geographic balance; and strategically use reinsurance across our overall business. A turnaround of this magnitude is made harder when you have a treaty reinsurance business, which, by its very nature, has volatility. \n We have completed a rigorous enterprise-wide modeling exercise using RMS version 21 to approximate the PMLs for AIG post closing, and all categories will significantly reduce. This analysis took into account AIG's exposure, Validus Re's exposure as of February 1, 2023, and combined output for both companies on an occurrence and aggregate basis. \n Let me provide a few examples of the model output for AIG post closing of the Validus Re sale on an occurrence basis. For worldwide, all perils, net PMLs were reduced by 45% at the 1-in-250 return period. Worldwide hurricane PMLs will reduce by 60% at the 1-in-250 return period and by 70% at the 1-in-100 return period. \n North America hurricane PMLs will reduce by 70% at the 1-100 return period. North America earthquake PMLs will reduce by 55% at the 1-250 return period. Japan typhoon PMLs will reduce by 50% at the 1-100 return period. Japan earthquake PMLs will reduce by 50% at the 1-250 return period. And for EMEA, all PMLs will decrease by 85% at the 1-250 return period and 75% at the 1-100 return period. \n In addition to the strategic repositioning of our portfolio, there were several additional components that made the sale of Validus Re appealing for AIG. The required tangible equity that AIG will deliver to RenRe upon closing, which is $2.1 billion, is substantially below what Validus Re would have required if the business remained at AIG. \n We will receive $900 million above the book value of Validus Re, which reflects the improved quality of the portfolio since AIG's purchase of the business in 2018. We also expect to receive, through a pre-closing dividend, excess capital in the legal entities being transferred to RenRe, which we estimate will be approximately $200 million. \n In addition, a $1 billion intercompany loan from Validus Re to AIG will be settled through internal dividends, and we expect AIG to benefit from a $400 million reduction in risk-based capital requirements following the closing. As part of the transaction, AIG will retain 95% of future reserve changes in the portfolio delivered at closing. We will receive the benefit of future reserve releases as the portfolio matures, and we will likely purchase an adverse development cover prior to the closing to minimize potential future reserve exposure. \n In the second quarter, we also announced and closed the sale of Crop Risk Services to American Financial Group for $240 million in cash. Crop Risk Services was part of the Validus acquisition in 2018. Over the remainder of the 2023 crop season, AIG will continue to benefit from earned premium for crop business booked since the start of the year. But as we enter 2024, this business will no longer have an impact on AIG's financial results. \n Next, I want to provide more detail on the formation of Private Client Select as an MGA, which is now referred to as PCS. The MGA has officially launched, and we expect to add new capital providers in the coming quarters. We believe the MGA structure is ideal for PCS as it creates flexibility and alternatives for clients, agents and brokers in an environment that's becoming more complex. \n The high and ultra-high net worth markets PCS is focused on have significant foundational challenges include loss cost pressure, inflation, increased cat exposure through increased total insured values and more concentration in peak zones, and primary and secondary peril modeling has been [indiscernible]. AIG will continue to support the MGA. And because we will be assuming risk on our balance sheet, we've established the MGA's risk framework, which is designed to improve its financial performance in 2023 and as we enter 2024. \n Overall, we are pleased with the progress we've made with Stone Point Capital on this MGA structure. And we're well positioned to accelerate the business plan through the remainder of the year. \n Moving to Corebridge. In June, we completed a secondary offering of Corebridge common stock with gross proceeds to AIG of $1.2 billion. The offering was well received by the market. And the new owners included a strong mix of long-term holders, which we believe results in a more stable and well-diversified shareholder base for Corebridge. \n Also in June, Corebridge announced and paid a $400 million special dividend in addition to its $150 million ordinary quarterly dividend and completed the repurchase of $200 million of common stock from AIG and Blackstone. AIG's net proceeds from these actions were approximately $540 million. \n At the end of the second quarter, our ownership stake in Corebridge was approximately 65%. These actions demonstrate our commitment to deconsolidation and eventually full separation. As we noted on our last call, we continue to explore all options with respect to our remaining ownership of Corebridge that are aligned with the best interest of shareholders. \n Turning to other strategic actions we are taking in Corebridge. The previously announced sale process for Laya Healthcare, the private medical insurance business in Ireland that is part of Corebridge, is proceeding very well. We expect to announce a positive outcome from this process in the near term and expect that the proceeds from this divestiture will largely be used for a special dividend to Corebridge shareholders. \n Additionally, we recently retained advisers to analyze strategic alternatives for the disposition of the U.K. Life business that is part of Corebridge. The dispositions of Laya and U.K. Life will streamline the Corebridge portfolio and allow its management team to focus on core Life and Retirement products and solutions in the United States. \n Turning to General Insurance. We had another quarter of strong growth in both gross and net premiums written. Gross premiums written were $10.4 billion, an increase of 11%. Global Commercial, which represents 80% of gross premiums written, grew 15%. And Global Personal decreased 1%. \n Net premiums written were $7.5 billion, an increase of 11%. This growth was driven by Global Commercial, which grew 13% while Global Personal grew 5%. In North America Commercial, we saw a very strong growth of 18% in net premiums written. Excluding Validus Re, net premiums written growth in North America Commercial was 13%. The major drivers were as follows: Retail Property, which grew over 50%; Validus Re, which grew 32%; and Lexington, which grew 18%, led by wholesale property and casualty. \n I would like to provide a few additional details about Lexington's growth, given it continues to be an important part of AIG's strategy. Property grew 38% year-over-year driven by very strong retention in new business as well as strong rate increases. Submission activity was up over 30% year-over-year. Casualty grew 41%, supported by strong retention in new business, and its submission count was up over 90%. \n In International Commercial, net premiums written grew 6% primarily driven by property, which was up 34%; Talbot, which was up 17%; and Global Specialty, which was up mid-single digits, which reflected the impact of additional reinsurance purchasing in the second quarter. \n Global Commercial had very strong renewal retention of 88% in its in-force portfolio. International was up 200 basis points to 88%, and North America was up 200 basis points to 87%. As a reminder, we calculate renewal retention prior to the impact of rate and exposure changes. \n And across Global Commercial, we continue to see strong new business, which was approximately $1.1 billion in the second quarter. North America Commercial, excluding Validus Re, produced new business of approximately $600 million, an increase of 10% year-over-year. \n This growth was driven by Lexington property, which saw excellent new business growth of over 40%. Retail Property had over 50% new business growth, offset by Financial Lines, where new business contracted by over 35%. \n International Commercial new business was $485 million, which grew 5%. This growth was led by Talbot new business, which increased over 100% year-over-year and property, which grew new business by 40%, offset by Financial Lines where new business contracted by over 20%. \n As I noted on our last call, we continue to see headwinds in certain aspects of Financial Lines due to increased competition putting pressure on pricing. Despite these continuing dynamics, we remain disciplined on risk selection, terms and conditions and price while taking a long-term view on this line of business by not following the market down. \n Moving to rate. In North America Commercial, excluding Validus Re, rate increased 8% in the second quarter or 9% if you exclude workers' compensation, and the exposure increase was 2%. Rate increases were driven by Lexington wholesale, which was up 23% with wholesale property up over 35% and Retail Property, which was up 30%. \n In International Commercial, rate increased 9%, and the exposure increase was 1%. The rate increase was driven by property, which was up 21%; Talbot, which was up 14%; and Global Specialty, which was up 11% driven by global energy, which was up 21%. Rate plus exposure was 10% in North America, 11% if you exclude workers' compensation and 10% in International, which in each case remains above loss cost trend. \n Turning to Personal Insurance. Note that second quarter results in North America Personal reflected the fact that PCG was transitioning to become Private Client Select. North America Personal net premiums written increased 17% primarily driven by lower quota share sessions in PCG, offset by decreases in travel and warranty. Overall, we had strong growth in net premiums written of 17% with PCG net premiums written growing over 60%. \n With PCS now officially launched as an MGA, there are several components of AIG's business in the high and ultra-high net worth markets that will result in improved financial performance for AIG over the balance of 2023. First, as we outlined in prior calls, over the last few years, we evolved the model for our high and ultra-high net worth business such that we expect net premiums written to grow significantly over the remainder of the year with our current expectations showing net premiums written increasing over 75% in the third and fourth quarters. \n Second, the lag and earned premium growth that we saw in the first quarter of 2023 dissipated. And we saw a 36% growth in earned premium in the second quarter. And we expect that earned premium growth will continue to accelerate in the third and fourth quarter. The additional earned premium will provide operating leverage, which will reduce our GOE ratio in the third and fourth quarter. \n Third, AIG has [indiscernible] costs from the transition of PCG to an MGA. And we expect to eliminate these costs over the next 18 months. \n Fourth, we expect the accident year loss ratio for our high and ultra-high net worth business will improve with the combination of improved pricing in our admitted business and more business migrating to the non-admitted market, which already had a very positive impact on PCG's accident and policy year loss ratios in prior quarters. This should earn in for our high and ultra-high net worth business through the second half of 2023 and into 2024. \n In International Personal, net premiums written increased 1% year-over-year. The modest growth was driven by travel and personal property in Japan. Overall, our key focus continues to be growing Accident & Health and our business in Japan. \n Shifting to combined ratios. As I noted earlier, the second quarter accident year combined ratio ex-CATs was 88%, a 50 basis point improvement year-over-year. In Global Commercial, the second quarter accident year combined ratio ex-CATs was 84.4%, a 90 basis point improvement year-over-year. \n The North America Commercial accident year combined ratio ex-CATs was 85.1%, a 310 basis point improvement year-over-year. And the International Commercial accident year combined ratio ex-CATs was 83.1%, which continues to be an outstanding level of profitability. Global Personal reported a second quarter accident year combined ratio ex-CATs of 98.1%, a 170 basis point increase from the prior year quarter, largely due to a decrease in earned premium. \n Now I'd like to provide some context around midyear reinsurance renewals and recent conditions in the reinsurance market before moving to Life and Retirement. We purchased our major reinsurance treaties at January 1. However, approximately 20% of our overall core reinsurance purchasing occurs in the second quarter as we have a number of core midyear renewals, predominantly in specialty classes, and they were all successfully placed. \n In addition, we decided to purchase additional retrocessional protection for Validus Re and a low excess of loss reinsurance placement for Private Client Group ahead of the wind season. Overall, the market exhibited more orderly behavior during midyear renewals amidst more stable trading conditions compared to January 1. Reinsure appetite for more discrete purchases increased somewhat, enabling a number of buyers to make up for shortfalls in coverage experienced at January 1. \n Overall, midyear property cat pricing increased 25% to 35% year-over-year in the U.S. driven by Florida. This was the second year in a row of substantial rate increases. International renewals, driven by Australia and New Zealand, saw price increase 20% to 50% with higher increases resulting from loss activity in the region. \n In previous calls, I touched on the increase in catastrophe losses from secondary perils. Through the first half of 2023, the industry has already experienced over $50 billion of insured losses, the majority of which were due to secondary perils, making 2023 already the fourth highest year on an inflation-adjusted basis. \n A majority of insured losses continue to occur in the United States, highlighting the difficulty of managing volatility in the largest insurance market in the world. Against this challenging backdrop and a strengthened reinsurance rating environment, we maintained our conservative risk appetite and continue to have one of the lowest peak peril net positions in the market while managing our overall reinsurance spend. \n Additionally, through each of our renewals, we maintain all of our principal relationships with our key reinsurance partners. While we are exiting the assumed reinsurance business through the sale of Validus Re, our ownership of RenRe common stock that we will receive as part of the purchase price consideration, coupled with our ability to invest up to $500 million in RenRe's capital partner vehicles, will allow us to continue to participate and benefit from partnering with a world-class reinsurer with less risk and capital requirements. \n Turning to Life Retirement. As I noted earlier, the business produced very good results in the second quarter. Adjusted pretax income was $991 million. And adjusted return on segment equity was 12.2%, representing a 250 basis point improvement year-over-year. \n Premiums and deposits grew 42% year-over-year to $10 billion driven by record Fixed Index Annuity sales. Corebridge ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet with parent liquidity of $1.6 billion and a financial leverage ratio of 28%. Over the second quarter, we continue to make good progress against the Corebridge operational separation so that it can eventually be a fully standalone company. \n A key focus has been executing against IT separation, which we believe will be substantially complete by the end of this year. To date, approximately 55% of the transition service agreements put in place at the time of the IPO have already been exited. \n Now turning to capital management. As I noted earlier, in the second quarter, we returned approximately $822 million to shareholders through common stock repurchases and dividends. And the additional $400 million of common stock we repurchased in July brings a total amount of capital we've returned to shareholders since the beginning of the second quarter to over $1.2 billion. \n In addition, we continue to focus on maintaining well-capitalized subsidiaries to enable profitable growth across our global portfolio. And we remain committed to having a leverage ratio in the low 20s and a share count between 600 million to 650 million post deconsolidation of Corebridge. \n The additional liquidity we will have following the closing of the sale of Validus Re will largely be used for share repurchases, which we expect to accelerate beginning in the fourth quarter and as we enter 2024. We also plan to use some of the proceeds from the sale of Validus Re to reduce outstanding debt. \n Lastly with respect to ROCE. We remain highly committed to delivering a 10%-plus ROCE post deconsolidation of Corebridge. During the second quarter, we continued to make meaningful progress on all 4 components of our path to deliver on this commitment. As a reminder, these are sustain and improve underwriting profitability; executing on a simpler, leaner business model across AIG with lower expenses across the organization; operational separation and deconsolidation of Corebridge; and continued balanced capital management. The sequencing of each component has been very important. \n We are now able to accelerate this work with the GI underwriting turnaround, AIG 200 and the investment group restructuring largely behind us and the operational separation of Corebridge further along, in addition to divestitures, which I've already outlined. As I stated on our last call, we're moving away from AIG's historical conglomerate structure to being a leading global insurance company with a leaner and better defined parent company. \n We continue to expect approximately $500 million in cost reductions across AIG with a cost to achieve of approximately $400 million with substantially faster earn-in of savings than we saw with AIG 200. Sabra will provide more details on our path to a 10%-plus ROCE in her remarks. \n Overall, I could not be more pleased with our progress and what we've accomplished in the first half of the year. Our strong momentum continues, and we have a very solid foundation to build on for the future. \n Now I'll turn the call over to Sabra. Thank you, Sabra. And operator, we're ready for questions. Sure. Thanks, Paul. As we talked about in our prepared remarks, we are very pleased with our overall growth across the world. And retention is up, new business was terrific and balanced. And rate, well above loss cost, was evident in so many parts of our business. \n If I unpack it as you asked, I mean, look at North America, we discussed Validus Re, was up 32%, but it's not cyclically its largest quarter. It was basically 25% of North America. But other businesses had tremendous quarters. \n Lexington had 18% growth. But that was also part of us discontinuing a big program that we didn't like the risk-adjusted returns that had an impact on top line premium growth. And so I would look at Lexington in terms of casualty, which was 40% growth. Lexington property, which was 35% growth. Retail property was up over 50% in the quarter, and I outlined the rate increases were north of 30% for 2 quarters in a row. \n Our actual retail casualty business was up in the high single digits. So it was a very good outcome for net premium written in North America. The headwind was Financial Lines, which was down a little bit over 10%, but that is something that is specific to North America. But we have a really good balance in growth. \n If I look at -- I'll just expand a little bit in terms of International. We had really strong growth in property. Our syndicate Talbot was up 17%. International Specialty, I drew it out as a mid-single-digit growth net premium written in the quarter. We had some discretionary spends on treaty reinsurance. On a gross basis, it grew over 40%. And I want to call out, Financial Lines is not experiencing the same headwinds as North America, and International was flat. And that's our largest business in the second quarter in International. So had a little bit more of the weight in terms of the overall growth. But I thought it was really balanced, really well done and all the fundamentals we're executing on. Yes, thanks, Paul. I gave probably a little bit more PML information than people may have liked, but it's really the story is 3 components. One is what we did in the reunderwriting to reduce gross exposure across AIG. By the way, including Validus Re over the last several years. And we shed over $1 trillion of limit most of it property. And so that had an effect on exposure and PMLs at all return periods. \n I think the reinsurance programs that we bought are world-class. We keep calling that out, but in a very challenging and difficult environment at 1/1, we did not compromise by taking a lot more net because of reinsurance pricing. It reflected our book. We got great partners. And as a result, we didn't really have more net in terms of overall low-return peered PMLs. \n And so what I drew out in the Validus Re example, again, is on occurrence. It was the RMS model. We'll work through it. We got plenty of aggregate as to drive businesses that exists within AIG. But yes, I mean, like it's a different company. I mean, we're not going to have the tail exposure. But also at all return periods, we're going to have less cat. We've managed aggregates across the world and look at Validus Re as a very good business. But as I said, when we want to continue to reduce volatility, we do that through reinsurance. But when you have a treaty reinsurance business that is -- got a portfolio that has a lot of cat, that's harder to do. So I think the volatility, the cat loads will go down. By the very nature, we're going to lose a big part of our cat exposure. But we've been conservative on that and increased them this year and are very comfortable with our estimates and our actual results. Sure, Meyer. We have given guidance. So let me start with the loss cost inflation, which is still at 6.5. And you can imagine in a company like ours, I mean, it's an index. And so we look at each line of business each quarter, make minor modifications or as we did in the back half of last year just based on inflation, more meaningful adjustments. \n I'm really pleased with the discipline the company is showing on driving rate above loss cost, and we've done that across the world. So the rate environment in the second quarter was very strong. I gave you the guidance on the prepared remarks of North America excluding work comp, 9%; International at 9%. The drivers for this Retail Property, excess and surplus lines and our specialty businesses, the headwind for rate in North America was Financial Lines. And it's worth noting again that we have a very big footprint. \n And I mentioned in the prior question that International is not experiencing the same rate issues. And again, when I look back over the last 14 quarters, each quarter has been a positive rate increase in Financial Lines. So it's different for our International portfolio versus our domestic. And we continue to look at businesses like properties getting a lot of attention, but you can't look at that as a single quarter. \n I mentioned before, cost increases on the loss cost side, inflation, cost of capital, but also the cost of reinsurance for the industry, ours was a high single-digit risk-adjusted increase at 1/1. But those reinsurance costs in the industry are going to need to play in over the course of a year or maybe even like in Europe's case, into the first quarter, absent anything happening through cat season. So I think this is the market that we're in. It's a disciplined market. The cost of capital is more expensive, and we're going to be very prudent in where we deploy capital. But I'm very comfortable that we are driving margin on a written basis, and that will continue as we get to the back half of the year. Yes. Well, Lexington is just a great story. When we look at -- we had record submission count across Lexington. We drove very strong growth at the top line, but it's one of our most profitable businesses. And Dave McElroy, Lou Levinson, who leads Lexington, this has all been about driving value for our distribution partners and wholesale brokers. And we've been asking for submission activity on all lines of business. \n And so when we're going to deploy property, yes, we have aggregate. Yes, the performance has been very good. Yes, the growth opportunity is there on its own. But we have been very focused on driving opportunities across the portfolio, and we're asking for the business. \n And so like the submission activity is substantial. And then I think being one of the largest wholesale underwriters and respected as one of the top in terms of underwriting excellence, we're getting looks at multiple lines of business. And we have staffed up in order to take on that additional volume on the property and casualty side. So I was very pleased that the team executed as well as it did, and I expect that to continue. It's a very good question, but I have to follow up with a question back to you. Do you want it over a longer period of time? Because I mean, looking at a cat business in the second quarter and again, I'm happy to provide some detail. It was accretive by a little over 100 basis points in the quarter to a combined ratio. \n But don't forget, its acquisition ratio is higher than our normal business. The loss ratio was slightly below based on dynamics going on in the market today. When I look at our overall business and ones that I continue to highlight, Lexington specialty, our property, a little more accretive than Validus Re. \n So I wouldn't have the impression that it's going to be highly dilutive. Obviously, it's done really well in the first half of the year. But if I go back the last 3 to 4 years, last year is the first year we were able to publish a combined ratio below 100. And so looking at the combined ratios of the business overall, it's been a positive contributor in the first half of this year. But in terms of the business, we have a lot of business to perform better. And we have -- in terms of the index, I don't think it will materially impact us. Both. But we don't break it out. But I mean, in terms of looking at it from 2018 through 2022, 2022 was the first year on a fully low to combined ratio is below 100. No. I can't offer you precise, but I can give you some guidance in terms of what we're thinking if that's okay. Yes. So the secondary is our base case. And we would expect to do something hopefully before year-end, subject to market conditions. I think what we have proven over time is that we want to be prepared. And so we prepared for the IPO, ended up delaying it just based on market conditions, prepared on the secondary. And so we will be prepared to go before year-end. \n I think Corebridge is doing very well in its business performance, its operation as a public company. And then we have made enormous progress of getting it ready to be a standalone public company once we deconsolidate. They're executing very well on the management plan. \n Again, Kevin will outline it in detail on Friday, but they're able to execute on capital management now with share repurchases as well as ordinary dividend. And so we certainly want to continue to sell down at a reasonable pace, but it's just going to be subject to market conditions and where the business is. Depending on Board structure. But if we modify the Board structure, it would be below 50%. But on the current Board structure, we'd have to go below 45%. I think what we've outlined is still the base case. We ended up in the low 700s in terms of our share count. Sabra did a very good job of outlining the liquidity that we have and liquidity that will be coming in. \n We have focused on the 4 components in a very rigorous way of making sure that we have capital and subsidiaries to drive the growth in a market that we think is very favorable. We increased our dividend this year, and so we want to continue to focus on that. \n Our leverage in the low 20s, and Sabra and I both indicated, we'll do some cleanup on debt because the impact of share repurchases, you need to continue to still retire debt. And the main focus from liquidity is going to be on share repurchase, and that will be highly correlated to when we close on RenRe. \n We'll be active in the market in the third quarter. And I really couldn't give you much more guidance on that other than we're really focused on the share repurchase and getting to that 600 million to 650 million shares. We do, and it's been a big focus for us. Sabra, do you want to expand on that a little bit? I think we're through most of the major actions. We have to focus more on Personal Insurance, and then we have been certainly, the -- we spent a lot of time on the ultra and high net worth business and the actions that we're taking there in terms of improving it. And we'll see that as we go to the back half of '23 and into '24. \n Japan is a big focus for us, and it's a terrific business, one that has terrific scale, performs very well, needs more digital investment. And we have such a wide distribution of agents that we can scale more products. So we'll see some investment in Japan on digital workflow and digital interfacing with customers. And we've been working through that over the past 12 to 18 months. So I would expect to see improved performance there. \n And then also our Global Accident & Health business, which performs very well mostly overseas in International, but that's going to have investment. And we would expect to see more growth and more profitability improvement there. \n But I don't -- it's not major. It's more of just making strategic investments in order to position the portfolio to be more advantageous. So those will be the areas of focus. But after Validus Re, we had a very active quarter and certainly would not expect another one of those, but we are going to continue to try to drive improvement throughout the portfolio. No, I think you're thinking of it the right way. I mean, we've done an incredible job in terms of getting the portfolio that was in existence in '17 and '18 to where it is today. We know that we're an outlier on the expense ratio. That's a big part of what we're doing in the future operating model. And we'll start to show more and more evidence of that in the coming quarters and as we go into 2024. \n I did mention not to repeat the first part of the answer, but I do think that there's loss ratio and combined ratio opportunity for improvement in Personal Insurance. And we're heavily focused on that in terms of its balance across all of AIG. But when we look at the improvement in ROCE, expenses is going to be a big part of it. And as we focus on getting to our future operating model, that scale and discipline around having an expense ratio that's more favorable will be a huge focus of this management team. \n Okay. Thanks. I want to thank everybody for joining us today. I hope you have a great day."

            "name": "Sabra Purtill",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter. This morning, I will provide more detail on second quarter results, including net investment income and underwriting performance, provide a balance sheet update and review the drivers of our path to a 10%-plus adjusted ROCE. \n Starting with second quarter results. As Peter noted, adjusted after-tax income was $1.3 billion, up 15% from last year or an annualized adjusted ROCE of 9.4%. Adjusted after-tax income per diluted share was $1.75, up 26% from last year, reflecting the impact of share repurchases on EPS. \n Second quarter results were consistent with recent trends: strong underwriting margins and higher net investment income in General Insurance; increased base investment yields; and spreads and strong sales in Life and Retirement and continued expense reduction in balanced capital management and Corporate and Other. \n Turning to net investment income. On an APTI basis, investment income improved significantly, up 31% from last year and up 7% sequentially on a consolidated basis and also rose in each segment. Reinvestment rates are driving higher yields. The average new money yield was 5.46%, about 210 basis points above the yield on sales and maturities. \n In General Insurance, this increased the yield on the fixed maturities and loan portfolios 93 basis points over last year and 23 basis points sequentially. In Life and Retirement, the yield improved 75 basis points and 15 basis points, respectively. \n Alternative investment returns also improved this quarter, although they remain below our long-term outlook totaling $147 million for an annualized return of 6.0%. Credit performance has been strong with more upgrades than downgrades in the fixed maturity portfolios and continued derisking of lower-rated assets. \n Commercial property valuations continue to face downward pressure from higher cap rates, which impacts loan to values on commercial mortgage loans and investment returns on real estate equity funds. However, debt service coverage ratios are holding up well and are generally strong across the portfolio, including office. \n Turning to General Insurance. APTI was $1.3 billion, up $62 million from the prior year. Net investment income rose by $267 million. And underwriting income for the current accident year, excluding catastrophe losses, were $73 million. \n Total catastrophe losses were $250 million, up $129 million and included $56 million of first quarter CAT mostly from U.S. events, including a tornado that occurred at quarter end. This was a very solid result, as Peter noted, given the high level of industry catastrophe losses, particularly in North America. \n North America cat losses were $159 million, while International totaled $91 million, largely from Typhoon Mawar. During the second quarter, we conducted North America casualty DVRs, or detailed valuation reviews, which reviewed about 20% of reserves compared to 15% last year. \n In our DVRs, we focus on changes in frequency and severity trends, including social and other types of inflation as well as changes in claims trends and settlements such as occurred during COVID. As we noted previously, casualty bodily injury and medical workers' comp trends in our book have been and continue to be more favorable than our reserving assumptions. \n Our approach in these situations is to react quickly to adverse development, but to be conservative and wait to recognize favorable trends until accident years are more mature. We maintain the same approach for the COVID accident years where claims development patterns in many casualty lines slowed. \n For those years, we have lagged our development factors to allow more time for claims patterns to mature as we are taking the conservative position that industry claims experience will revert to pre-COVID patterns. In addition to the results of the DVRs, prior year development also includes amortization of the ADC gain, changes in prior year catastrophe losses and impacts from loss-sensitive lines that are not related to DVRs. \n In this quarter, prior year development net of reinsurance and prior year premiums was $25 million favorable. This was made up of $115 million of favorable loss reserve development, partially offset by $90 million of prior year return premium. The lower favorable development compared to last year is mainly attributable to the excess workers' compensation DVR, which was favorable by about $75 million in second quarter last year but is being completed in the third quarter of this year. \n Our favorable loss reserve development included $167 million from North American Commercial Lines, including $41 million of ADC amortization, $50 million of favorable development from our Agrium loss-sensitive portfolio and $74 million of favorable development resulting from North America DVRs. This was partially offset by $62 million of unfavorable development in International Commercial Lines, principally from a multiyear legacy casualty policy that was written with much higher limits than we do today. \n In the third quarter, DVRs will cover nearly 70% of reserves, including Financial Lines. Financial Lines claims have not returned to the levels we experienced pre-COVID, which we believe reflects improved underwriting, better loss selection, continued ventilation of risk, our reinsurance strategy and achieving appropriate levels of rate. \n With respect to underwriting. AIG's share of U.S. public company D&O securities class actions where we are the primary insurer is down from 42% in 2017 to about 20% at the end of the second quarter of this year. \n With respect to rate. Since 2018, the compounded increases in the Financial Lines portfolio for corporate and national accounts are greater than 60% and 50%, respectively. However, consistent with our conservative approach, in addition to the lag development factors, we are placing more weight on longer-term experience and balancing out more favorable recent trends. \n Turning to Life and Retirement. As Peter noted, second quarter results were strong with APTI up 30% over 2Q '22, driven by higher spread in underwriting margins and strong sales in Fixed Index Annuities. Both spreads and underwriting margins remain attractive, and fee margins improved with more favorable capital market levels compared to last year. \n Base net investment spreads in Individual and Group Retirement continued to widen with 64 basis points improvement year-over-year and 9 basis points sequentially driven by reinvestment rates. Individual Retirement APTI increased $215 million or 58% from 2Q '22 driven by base spread expansion and growth in general account products. Positive net flows to the general account were about $400 million. \n Group Retirement APTI grew by $21 million or 12% driven by continued base spread expansion despite negative flows in the general account. Life Insurance APTI decreased $42 million, or 35%, primarily due to lower other yield enhancement income, partially offset by improved base portfolio returns and marginally favorable mortality experience. Institutional markets delivered very strong results with APTI up $50 million or 65% driven by investment income and reserve growth. Second quarter premiums and deposits reached $2.9 billion with $1.9 billion of pension risk transfer activity and $970 million of GIC transactions. \n Turning to AIG's Other Operations. Second quarter adjusted pretax loss improved by $41 million over last year driven by an $80 million improvement in corporate and other due to the 4Q '22 sale of legacy investment portfolios that had losses of $119 million in 2Q '22. Corporate general operating expenses of $242 million included $67 million of Corebridge expenses, including separation expenses. Excluding Corebridge and separation-related expenses, corporate GOE decreased $19 million from the prior year. \n Moving to the balance sheet. We continue to execute on our balanced capital management strategy with share repurchases, an increase in our common stock dividend and repayment of maturing debt. We ended the quarter with AIG parent liquidity of $4.3 billion. \n We remain committed to maintaining strong capitalization in our insurance subsidiaries to support risk and growth. The General Insurance U.S. pool risk-based capital ratio is estimated in the 470% to the 480% range, and Life and Retirement is projected to be above its 400% target. \n We repaid a $388 million debt maturity in the second quarter and continue to target debt leverage in the low 20s post deconsolidation of Corebridge. At June 30, consolidated debt and preferred stock to total capital, excluding AOCI, was 26.0%, including about $9.4 billion of Corebridge debt. Book value per common share was $58.49 on June 30, 2023, up 6% from year-end. Adjusted book value per common share was $75.76 per share, flat from year-end. \n Turning to ROCE. We remain intently focused and are making progress on achieving a 10%-plus adjusted ROCE post deconsolidation. Year-to-date, annualized adjusted ROCE for AIG was 9.1% on a consolidated basis and 11.8% in General Insurance and 11.4% in Life and Retirement. \n Capital management and rightsizing our equity base for AIG post deconsolidation are material levers for achieving our adjusted ROCE goal. In the near term, we will accelerate share repurchases in the fourth quarter and into 2024 with the additional liquidity from Validus proceeds, in addition to ordinary course liquidity generated by our business operations through subsidiary dividends and ongoing profitability. \n We will balance these share repurchases with additional debt reduction consistent with our leverage target. We are committed to achieving a share count between 600 million and 650 million shares post deconsolidation, which we will be able to achieve with the increase in our share repurchase program to $7.5 billion. \n Based on the size, risk profile and profitability of our General Insurance business and holding company needs today, we estimate a pro forma GAAP equity base, excluding AOCI, of approximately $40 billion for AIG ex-Corebridge. This is inclusive of about $4 billion in deferred tax asset NOLs that we exclude for adjusted common shareholders' equity calculation. \n Considering this equity level and our plans to simplify AIG's business and operational structure, reduce volatility and drive more predictable and sustainable profitability, we are confident that we will achieve our adjusted ROCE goal. We look forward to continuing to update you on our progress. \n With that, I will turn the call back over to Peter. Yes. Thanks. I would just note, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, that the risk-based capital ratios in our U.S. pool are in the range of 470% to 480%, which is well above our target range of 400% to 420%. So we have ample capacity within the General Insurance businesses today to support growth."

This conference is being recorded.\n Now at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead. \nQuentin McMillan: Thanks very much, Michelle, and good morning. Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC provided details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by applicable securities laws, AIG is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements if circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change.\n Additionally, today's remarks may refer to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at aig.com.\n Finally, today's remarks will include results of AIG's Life and Retirement segment and Other Operations on the same basis as prior quarters, which is how we expect to continue to report until the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial. AIG's segments and U.S. GAAP financial results as well as AIG's key financial metrics, with respect thereto, differ from those reported by Corebridge Financial. Corebridge Financial will host its earnings call on Tuesday, May 9. \n With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review our first quarter financial results. Following my remarks, Sabra will provide more financial detail in the quarter, and then we will take questions. Kevin Hogan and David McElroy will be available for the Q&A portion of the call.\n As you saw in our press release, we reported an excellent start to the year. We continue to make meaningful progress across AIG and achieve important milestones, even in the face of ongoing complexity in the insurance industry, volatile market conditions and general economic uncertainty. We continue to diligently execute on our strategic and operational priorities, which drove very strong financial results in the first quarter and are positioning AIG for long-term value creation. Here are some highlights from the first quarter.\n Adjusted after-tax income was $1.2 billion or $1.63 per diluted common share, representing a 9% increase year-over-year. Net investment income on a consolidated basis was $3.1 billion. In 2022, we began to take proactive steps to improve the credit quality, construction and return characteristics of our investment portfolio as well as to reduce volatility. We saw the benefits of these actions in the first quarter and expect that to continue throughout the year. Sabra will provide additional detail on net investment income in her remarks.\n Net premiums written in General Insurance grew 10% on a constant dollar basis and adjusted for the International lag elimination that we discussed on our last call. This growth was driven by our Commercial business. Underwriting income was approximately $500 million, a 13% increase year-over-year, which is AIG's strongest first quarter underwriting result.\n The accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 88.7%, an 80 basis point improvement from prior year.\n Life and Retirement reported very good results, with premiums and deposits of $10.4 billion in the first quarter, a 44% increase year-over-year, supported by record sales in fixed annuity and fixed index annuity products.\n Net flows into the General Account from Individual Retirement were approximately $1.3 billion.\n Corebridge and Blackstone have made substantial progress advancing their strategic partnership, which began in late 2021. Since that time, Blackstone has invested approximately $11 billion on behalf of Corebridge, with an average gross yield of 6.5% and an average credit rating of A. This partnership has allowed Corebridge to expand in certain asset classes where we had limited to no access in the past, which has been very beneficial for the business and is helping to support growth, particularly in fixed annuity products.\n We returned approximately $840 million to shareholders in the first quarter through $600 million of common stock repurchases and $240 million of dividends. And we ended the first quarter with strong parent liquidity of $3.9 billion. Overall, I'm very pleased with what we accomplished in the first quarter. The strong momentum we had coming into 2023 continues.\n As we announced last night, the AIG Board approved the first meaningful increase to AIG's common stock quarterly dividend in many years. Starting in the second quarter, this dividend will be $0.36 per share, an increase of 12.5%. This is another significant milestone for AIG and reflects our commitment to a disciplined, balanced capital management strategy and our confidence in the future earnings power of AIG.\n Corebridge is also achieving important milestones. Since its IPO in September of last year, Corebridge has paid 3 dividends to public shareholders, totaling approximately $450 million. And yesterday, the Corebridge Board authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program. During the first quarter, we were prepared to launch a secondary offering of Corebridge common stock, but chose not to proceed when equity markets became volatile due to issues in the financial sector.\n We continue to be prepared and disciplined in terms of executing a secondary offering, which remains our base case for selling down our ownership in Corebridge, subject to market conditions and regulatory approvals. We remain committed to reducing our ownership interest in Corebridge and will explore other options that are aligned with the best interest of shareholders.\n During the remainder of my remarks this morning, I'll provide more information on the following 5 topics: first, I will review the first quarter results for General Insurance; second, I will give a high-level overview of the results for Life and Retirement, and Sabra will provide more detail in her remarks; third, I will provide an update on a few strategic initiatives, including the announcement last week relating to Private Client Services, our MGA partnership with Stone Point Capital, our announcement on Tuesday of the sale of Crop Risk Services and our intent to sell Laya Healthcare, which is a part of Corebridge and Ireland's second largest health insurance provider; fourth, I will provide more information on capital management actions; lastly, I will review progress on our path to a 10%-plus ROCE, including an update on the work we are doing on the future state business model of AIG.\n Turning to General Insurance. Let me provide more detail on first quarter results, starting with our strong growth in gross and net premiums written. When we refer to gross and net premiums written, all numbers have been adjusted for both foreign exchange and the impact of the lag elimination.\n Gross premiums written were $12 billion, an increase of 9%, with Global Commercial growing 13% and Global Personal decreasing 4%. Net premiums written were $7 billion, an increase of 10%. This growth was primarily driven by Global Commercial, which grew 11%, while Global Personal grew 6%.\n In North America Commercial, we saw a very strong growth of 15% in net premiums written due to Validus Re, which had over 40% growth year-over-year due to the exceptional results we achieved with our January 1 treaty placements, which I discussed in detail on our last call. Lexington, which grew over 25%, led by Wholesale Property and Casualty, double-digit growth in Captive Solutions and Glatfelter.\n Focusing on Lexington for a moment, I would like to highlight a few achievements from the first quarter. The business continues to drive excellent performance, impressive growth and has consistently improved its portfolio quarter after quarter over the last couple of years. Lexington's tremendous growth has been achieved through its relevance in the marketplace and increasing its market share, not from increasing limits deployed. Strong retention, new business and rate have been the key drivers of Lexington's financial performance. Lexington has now seen double-digit rate increases for 16 consecutive quarters, and cumulative compounded rate increases totaled over 100% since the first quarter of 2018.\n Additionally, over the last few years, the average size of a Lexington Property primary policy went from $100 million in limits deployed to $5 million. This has substantially reduced volatility in Lexington's portfolio. Our thoughtful and prudent growth strategy, together with our shift in focus to wholesale distribution, continues to serve us well, particularly in the E&S market.\n I also want to provide more color on Validus Re. We've provided significant detail on the 1/1 renewal season on our last call, and I think it's worth expanding on a few items from the first quarter. Net premiums written were very strong and balanced in Validus Re, and we continue to meaningfully improve the quality of the portfolio. Rate improvements were particularly strong in U.S. Property, International Property, Marine and Energy, Casualty and Specialty Lines.\n With respect to April 1 renewals across the portfolio, gross and net premiums written increased. And within International Property, limits deployed were reduced slightly, and Japan property cat risk-adjusted rates were up approximately 20%.\n As we consider our deployment strategy at the June 1 renewal cycle, which focuses on U.S. wind exposure, we will continue to maintain a prudent approach on limits deployed. We do not expect to deploy additional limits beyond our current aggregate allocated to Florida, although we do anticipate significant rate increases and improved terms and conditions. Like General Insurance, the Validus Re portfolio has been completely re-underwritten with a focus on risk-adjusted returns. The business had a terrific first quarter and is well positioned for profitable growth through the rest of the year.\n Shifting back to our 15% net premiums written growth in the first quarter, this result was impressive despite the headwinds we continue to see in Financial Lines, where overall net premiums written contracted 9% due to increased competition putting pressure on pricing as well as continued slowdown in M&A and other transactional business.\n We are one of the very few lead markets in large account public D&O where primary rates have remained relatively flat year-over-year. In contrast, high excess public company D&O saw rate declines greater than 20%. To put this in perspective, this represents a little over 5% of our overall North America Financial Lines business, and we will continue to manage this book very prudently. We have deep domain knowledge and experience, data, best-in-class underwriting capabilities and leading claims expertise that allow us to differentiate ourselves in the D&O marketplace.\n During the past year, we continued to see new competitors with limited experience into the high excess public D&O market. This is driving down pricing in what is traditionally the most commoditized portion of a placement. Despite these dynamics, we remain disciplined on price and are taking a long-term view of this line of business. We have significant scale and geographic balance on our portfolio, and we will not follow the market down.\n Turning to International Commercial. Net premiums written grew 6%, primarily due to Property, which was up over 40%; Global Specialty, which was up over 15%; and Casualty, which was up over 15%. Global Commercial had very strong renewal retention of 88% in its in-force portfolio, International was up 200 basis points to 88%, and North America was up 100 basis points to 87%. As a reminder, we calculate renewal retention prior to the impact of rate and exposure changes. And across Global Commercial, we continue to see strong new business, which was over $1 billion in the first quarter.\n International Commercial new business was over $590 million, led by Specialty, which increased its new business by over 50%, driven by Energy and Marine. North America Commercial, excluding Validus Re, achieved new business of over $480 million, driven by Lexington, which saw excellent new business growth of over 50%. With respect to rate in North America Commercial, excluding Validus Re, rates increased 7% in the first quarter or 8% if you exclude workers' compensation, and the exposure increase was 2%.\n In North America Commercial, rate was driven by Lexington wholesale, which was up 26% with Wholesale Property up 35%. For Lexington Property Wholesale, this was its strongest quarterly rate increase. Rate in Retail Property was also up significantly at 32%; International Commercial rate increases were 8%, driven by Talbot at 16%, International Property at 11% and Specialty at 9%. The exposure increase in the International portfolio was 2%. Rate plus exposure remains above loss cost trend at 9% in North America, 10% if you exclude workers' compensation and 10% in International. \n Turning to Personal Insurance. First quarter results reflect our continued repositioning of this business, especially PCG, given our announcement of the creation of a managing general agency in partnership with Stone Point Capital. I will provide more information on the MGA later in my remarks.\n North America Personal net premiums written increased 57%, driven by lower quota share cessions in PCG at January 1, as we transition to writing the business as an MGA, along with the recognition of an improved portfolio. The combination of improved pricing in our admitted business and more business migrating to the non-admitting market has a very positive impact on PCG's accident and policy or loss ratios. This will earn in through the second half of 2023 and into 2024.\n Entering 2023, we required less excess of loss reinsurance on the upper end of our reinsurance program due to realized reduction in PCG's PMLs at all return periods as a result of ongoing improvements in risk selection and reductions in aggregate in peak zones. More specifically, all peril and all return periods from 1 in 20 to 1 in 1,000 reduced on average by 40%, while those same return periods with respect to wildfire reduced on average by 60%. These dynamics further impacted net premiums written in the first quarter. \n Syndicate 2019 continues to act as a mechanism to enable third-party capital providers to support PCG's high and ultra-high net worth business for the 2023 accident year.\n In terms of expectations for PCG for the full year, we expect net premiums written growth to be at or higher than we saw in the first quarter, the loss ratio to meaningfully improve and the acquisition ratio and general operating expense to also improve.\n Turning to International Personal. Net premiums written were largely flat in the first quarter, Travel and Warranty grew while Personal Property declined, all driven by a further refinement of our cat reinsurance cost allocation methodology, making year-over-year comparisons difficult. Accident & Health had some timing issues that impacted net premiums written in the first quarter. We expect to see growth in International Personal for the remainder of 2023 and believe results will continue to strengthen as we move through the year.\n Shifting to combined ratios. As I noted earlier, the first quarter accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 88.7%, an 80 basis point improvement year-over-year. In Global Commercial, the first quarter accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 84.9%, a 110 basis point improvement year-over-year and we reported a 24% increase in underwriting income.\n The North America Commercial accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 85.7%, a 240 basis point improvement year-over-year. The International Commercial accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was essentially flat at 83.7%, which is an outstanding result. Global Personal reported a first quarter accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, of 98.6%, a 120 basis point increase from the prior year quarter, largely due to a decrease in earned premium from our deliberate reduction in gross exposure in PCG in North America.\n Now let me comment on catastrophes. The cat loss ratio in the quarter was 4.2% or $264 million of catastrophe losses. Our largest loss in the period was from 2 storms in New Zealand, which accounted for $126 million of catastrophe losses.\n Looking at North America, total losses from catastrophe-related activities in the first quarter were $116 million, which includes Validus Re. In International, excluding Japan, we have eroded approximately $75 million of our aggregate retention and have approximately $75 million net remaining, plus the annual aggregate deductible for each cat loss for the rest of the year. As we described in our last call, the reinsurance program we structured at this year's January 1 renewal provides us with the ability to manage volatility and severity. Looking ahead to the rest of 2023, we expect to see very strong top line growth in General Insurance.\n Turning to Life and Retirement. The business delivered strong performance in the first quarter. Adjusted pretax income was $886 million for the first quarter, and adjusted return on segment equity was 10.7%. First quarter results benefited from continued growth in spread-based products and related spread income. As I mentioned earlier, premiums and deposits grew significantly in the first quarter, driven by strong new individual retirement business, which, despite increasing surrenders related to interest rates, contributed to growth in the General Account. The balance sheet and capital position of Corebridge remains strong with $1.8 billion of parent liquidity.\n Turning to our strategic initiatives. Last week, we executed a definitive documentation with Stone Point Capital for the launch of Private Client Services, an MGA that will serve the high and ultra-high net worth market. We are excited about the prospects for PCS and are confident of the value this new operating structure will deliver for clients, brokers and other stakeholders. We look forward to continuing this journey with the PCS management team and the ongoing support of Stone Point Capital.\n Subject to regulatory approvals, the MGA is expected to formally launch in the third quarter of this year, and we expect to bring on additional capital providers through the second half of 2023. As part of our ongoing review process, we regularly assess the composition of our portfolio of businesses to ensure it is aligned with our long-term strategy and best positioned to create value for our shareholders and other stakeholders.\n As part of this review, as you saw in our announcement on Tuesday, we executed a definitive documentation to sell Crop Risk Services, or CRS, to American Financial Group for $240 million. We acquired CRS as part of our broader acquisition of Validus Holdings in 2018. AIG will continue to write business for the 2023 spring crop season, which ends June 30. We expect approximately $700 million to $800 million of net premiums written for 2023, 75% of which booked in the first quarter. Starting in the third quarter, AIG will act as a fronting partner for American Financial Group during a transitional period.\n For full year 2023, we expect to retain about $800 million to $900 million of earned premiums, $750 million of which we'll earn in over the remainder of the year. CRS is a well-run and attractive business, led by a high-quality management team. In American Financial Group, we have found a high-quality partner for CRS and its employees and believe the business will benefit from being part of a larger combined platform. We also continually review the product portfolio and geographic footprint of Corebridge as we position this business for the future as a fully stand-alone company.\n After a comprehensive review of the health product offering, we decided to evaluate strategic alternatives and a potential sale of Laya Healthcare, the private medical insurance business in Ireland. We believe this will help to streamline the Corebridge portfolio and allow it to focus on Life and Retirement products and solutions.\n Turning to capital management. The first quarter marked another quarter of continued progress and execution of our balanced strategy. In addition to the first quarter share repurchases and dividends that I mentioned earlier, against the backdrop of an unstable macroeconomic environment, we thought it was prudent to raise $750 million of debt at the end of March. This provided us with financial flexibility to pay down a near-term debt maturity and complete additional share repurchases at what we viewed as attractive share prices.\n Turning to return on common equity. We remain highly committed and laser-focused on delivering a 10%-plus ROCE. Through the first quarter, we continued to make meaningful progress on the 4 components of our path to deliver on this commitment. As a reminder, these components include sustained and improved underwriting profitability; executing on a simpler, leaner business model across AIG; operational separation and deconsolidation of Corebridge; and continued balanced capital management. Given the number of strategic initiatives we are executing at once, we are taking a long-term view while measuring progress in 90-day increments. We advanced each component during the first quarter and expect this to continue throughout 2023.\n As I discussed earlier, our first quarter financial results were excellent, with continued top line growth and improvement in underwriting profitability in General Insurance. Over the last few months, we accelerated our work to establish AIG's future state business model. Sequencing has been very important on our journey and the work that's been accomplished over the last few years on the General Insurance turnaround, AIG 200, the separation and IPO of Corebridge and restructuring of our investment management group. This has positioned us to move forward as a more focused and simplified AIG.\n Evolving our future state business model will result in us moving away from the conglomerate structure AIG operated in for decades. We will eliminate overlap and significantly reduce decentralized infrastructure across the company, which will lead to a leaner business model, particularly in our operations. In future state, we expect a redefined AIG parent expense structure to be approximately 1% to 1.5% of premiums, which today is roughly $250 million to $350 million.\n AIG parent will have 5 primary roles and objectives: public company matters, including finance, legal, compliance and regulatory oversight as well as corporate governance; communications with key stakeholders, including the investment community, rating agencies, regulators, policymakers and AIG colleagues; risk management, culture, performance and human capital management; and strategy, including business development, M&A and design and execution of key initiatives. As we progress our future state business model, we anticipate achieving approximately $500 million in cost reductions at AIG parent and a cost to achieve of around $400 million with substantially quicker earn-in of savings that we achieved with AIG 200.\n As expense savings begin to earn through, the reductions will largely be seen in other operations, which is where general operating expenses are currently accounted for.\n With respect to Corebridge, I took you through our current thinking on separation and timing of the secondary offerings.\n Lastly, on capital management. We continue to maintain appropriate levels of capital in our subsidiaries to support profitable growth. We remain on track to reduce AIG common stock outstanding to be between 600 million and 650 million shares and achieve a debt-to-capital leverage at the lower end of our 20% to 25% range post deconsolidation of Corebridge.\n As I noted earlier, we increased our common stock dividend by 12.5%, starting in the second quarter of this year. And in addition to our stock repurchases in the first quarter, to date, we have repurchased $240 million of AIG common stock in the second quarter. Apart from the progress we're making on these components of our path to a 10%-plus ROCE, we also expect tailwinds from higher reinvestment yields. We are confident that our continued progress on strategic initiatives and our capital management strategy will allow us to achieve our ROCE targets and deliver long-term profitable growth that benefits all of our stakeholders.\n I will now turn the call over to Sabra. \nSabra Purtill: Thank you, Peter. This morning, I will cover 2 accounting changes, provide more details on first quarter results and give an overview of Commercial Mortgage Loans. First, the 1-month lag in financial reporting for the General Insurance International segment was eliminated last quarter. The lag elimination did not impact earnings significantly, but it did affect premiums written comparisons to 2022. Details on the premium impacts are in the financial supplement on Page 26.\n Second, we adopted the change in accounting standard for certain long-duration products, commonly called LDTI. Yesterday, 8-Ks were filed that provide restated prior year financial results for AIG and Corebridge. The cumulative effect at year-end 2022 was an increase of $1.5 billion to adjusted equity and an increase of $1.0 billion to total shareholders' equity. This impact is consistent with our previous guidance. As a reminder, this is a GAAP accounting change only and does not impact statutory results, insurance company cash flows or economic returns. Going forward, we expect a modest run rate increase in L&R APTI and less market and mortality-driven volatility from the change in accounting standards.\n Turning to the quarter, as Peter mentioned, AIG's first quarter adjusted after-tax income was $1.2 billion or $1.63 per diluted share, up 9% from last year on a restated basis and up 25% from originally reported. Key trends in the quarter and similar to the last 3 quarters were higher GI underwriting results and higher income from fixed maturities and loans and lower alternative investment income. Compared to the prior year quarter, there was a higher impact from noncontrolling interest from the Corebridge IPO in 3Q '22.\n Consolidated net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.1 billion. Similar to the fourth quarter, income from fixed maturities and loans in both GI and L&R rose sequentially and over the prior year, while returns on alternative investments were down $593 million compared to very strong annualized returns of 28% last year.\n Income on fixed maturities and loans rose by $573 million over the prior year, with average new money reinvestment rates of 5.35%, about 220 basis points above sales and maturities. The yield rose to 4.29%, up 78 basis points from 1Q '22 and 23 basis points over 4Q '22. Part of the increase in fixed maturity yields resulted from our proactive repositioning over the last 2 quarters in the U.S. GI portfolio. We sold and reinvested about $6 billion in fixed maturities, resulting in a realized loss of $224 million, but added 9 basis points of GI yield improvement for the quarter. We expect incremental yield pickup from this repositioning in 2Q '23 and also from higher reinvestment rates throughout 2023 based on the current rate and spread environment.\n Turning to the segments. GI adjusted pretax income, or APTI, was $1.2 billion, $37 million higher than 1Q '22, principally due to a $56 million increase in underwriting income from both higher-earned premiums and a 1 point improvement in the calendar year combined ratio, which was 91.9%. Peter covered underwriting results in detail, but I want to add that GI reserves had favorable prior year development, net of reinsurance at prior year premiums of $54 million.\n Turning to L&R results for the first quarter. APTI was $886 million, down $48 million compared to $934 million in 1Q '22 as restated. Consistent with GI, L&R had a strong increase in base portfolio investment income, but lower alternative investment income. Mortality experience improved, but fee income was down due to lower capital market levels compared to a year ago. As Peter noted, L&R premiums and deposits were very strong at $10.4 billion. Notably, Individual Retirement sales were $4.9 billion, a 26% increase over the prior year quarter with record levels of fixed and fixed index annuity sales because of higher crediting rates.\n Group Retirement deposits grew 19%, with higher out-of-plan fixed annuity sales and new plan acquisitions. Strong fixed and fixed index annuity sales, net of surrenders, resulted in $1.3 billion of positive flows to the General Account in Individual Retirement, up from $0.7 billion last year. While surrenders are up, they remain below projections. Variable annuity net flows, which impact the separate account, were negative.\n To conclude on earnings for the quarter, other operations adjusted pretax loss, or APTL, was $491 million, a $70 million increase due to lower APTI from consolidated investment entities in Asset Management, which had strong private equity results in 1Q '22. Corporate GOE decreased $27 million from the prior year and $77 million from 4Q '22 despite $29 million of additional expense related to the corporate separation.\n Turning to AIG's balance sheet. Book value per common share was $58.87 at quarter end, up 7% from year-end, principally due to higher valuations on available-for-sale securities due to lower long-term interest rates. Adjusted book value was $75.87 per share, roughly flat with year-end. At the end of March, we issued $750 million of senior notes, a portion of which was used to pay down an April bond maturity.\n Our leverage ratio declined to 32.8%, down about 1 point from year-end even with the new issuance due to the change in AOCI in the quarter. Excluding AOCI and the Fortitude-embedded derivative, debt leverage was 26.3%.\n For the first quarter of 2023, AIG's consolidated adjusted ROCE was 8.7%, comprised of 11.6% in GI and 10.7% in L&R. As Peter discussed, we are laser-focused on achieving a 10%-plus ROCE post deconsolidation.\n Peter provided a lot of detail on the quarter. So I'll use my remaining time to cover investments, particularly Commercial Mortgage Loans, given the recent focus on this asset class. First, I want to emphasize that our investment portfolio is grounded in the liability profile of our 2 insurance businesses. We strive to achieve strong risk-adjusted returns while matching the duration, cash flow and liquidity needs of the liabilities.\n Over the last several years, we have improved the risk profile of the investment portfolio by reducing capital-intensive, less liquid or more volatile assets such as hedge funds. With the onset of COVID and, again, with rising interest rates last year, we further tightened investment guidelines and moved up in quality, including the GI repositioning mentioned earlier and also sales of L&R non-investment-grade assets.\n Turning to our Commercial Mortgage Loan exposures. I'll start by noting that our mortgages are senior secured loans on high-quality properties that are well diversified by type and geography with strong loan to values, or LTVs, averaging 59% and debt service coverage ratios averaging 1.9x. We are the lead lender on more than 80% of our loans, which gives us important control rights.\n Excluding Fortitude funds withheld assets, we had $33.8 billion of Commercial Mortgage Loans at the end of March, of which $30.3 billion were at Corebridge and $3.5 billion at General Insurance. The largest property type is multifamily housing or apartments, about 40% of our Commercial Mortgage Loans. Industrial Property loans are about 16% of the portfolio. Both multifamily and industrial are performing well. We are, however, focused on traditional U.S. office, which is $5.4 billion or 2% of AIG's invested assets. Our U.S. office allocation has been shrinking for several years, particularly when we tightened underwriting standards further for office, retail and hotels with the onset of COVID. Currently, 94% of the office loans are high-quality rated CM1 or CM2 with debt service coverage averaging about 2.1x and weighted average LTVs of 64%. Valuations are updated annually by a third party, and we continue to monitor valuations given rising cap rates.\n We also have a credit or CECL allowance against the portfolio of about $330 million or 3.7% against the office loan portfolio and $584 million for the total commercial mortgage portfolio or 1.7%, which is higher than many peers as we use CMBS default data in our methodology.\n Roughly 3/4 of the building securing the loans are Class A or newer buildings with better amenities. The majority are in the top 5 U.S. metropolitan areas and concentrated in central business districts, including in New York City, which historically has been one of the strongest office markets in the country.\n Today, we are intensely focused on office loan maturities in the next 2 years, about $2 billion or 28 loans. We are already in discussions with many borrowers about their plans and our requirements for refinancing or extension, including additional equity revised terms or other commitments. While valuations are under pressure, cash flows are the primary source of debt service for our loans, and we will continue to monitor the loans carefully. We look forward to updating you on our investment performance in the quarters ahead.\n To wrap up, our first quarter 2023 results demonstrate continued sustained and strong financial results, rising investment portfolio yields, significant progress against strategic initiatives, robust capital and liquidity and continued progress on our path to a 10%-plus ROCE.\n With that, I will turn the call back over to Peter. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. \nMeyer Shields: Peter, I wanted to address one aspect of growth. And you covered, I think, a ton of detail, which is helpful. But the net-to-gross ratio didn't change. And I would have thought that based on the current dynamics in the property cat market and much improved performance on a lot of casualty lines that have been heavily reinsured, that we would see AIG retaining more of its gross premium. I was hoping you could talk through that. \nQuentin McMillan: Meyer, this is Quentin. I think we're having a little audio technical difficulties. So if you can bear with us for just one moment, we'll be back in just 1 second.\n [Technical Difficulty] \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Can you hear me now? \nQuentin McMillan: Yes. You're coming through loud and clear, Peter. Meyer, do you want to just repeat your question? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: I heard the questions, Quentin. Sorry, I actually had a good answer too. I just was on -- not a microphone that worked. So Meyer, back to your question is that we had -- you have to look at the portfolio composition to be able to answer the question. And Validus Re obviously had meaningful growth on gross and net during the quarter. And so, therefore, it's hard to look at the cessions year-over-year when you're having a retro program that fits the portfolio that you're underwriting.\n We've never had a strategy that we're going to time the market with our reinsurance partners. They've always been strategic. They've always been supportive. They've always deployed the capital in support of AIG. And so we were not going to do anything, other than to try to get the appropriate terms and conditions with them and have not really changed much of our risk appetite in terms of taking that. And I think that has generated a terrific result for us on net premium written, but also on the combined ratios.\n So I think I wouldn't look into just one quarter in terms of discussions. And as I said, we have a lot in terms of the guidance I've given on PCG, which we will still assume a lot of risk. And I guess -- let's just play it out for the full year. We're not looking to do anything materially different. \nMeyer Shields: Okay. Perfect. That's helpful. And I don't know if this is even a good question. But does the changing approach to North American Personal Lines have any implications for the International Personal segment? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: It really doesn't, Meyer. I mean they're really distinct businesses. I mean, certainly, our Travel and Warranty have platforms that are global and that give us capabilities across the world. But as you know, Private Client Group, in particular in the U.S., is a unique asset. Again, the guidance I gave in the prepared remarks, it's one that we believe we will grow the net premium written because we don't believe we need the quota shares anymore after the excellent job the team has done in repositioning and re-underwriting that portfolio. We have substantially less cat in aggregates that we once did. So I think that's something that will be a little different in terms of -- if you look at International.\n While International, we have a terrific Personal Insurance business. Some of it was affected by COVID. It's growing back, between Japan's Personal Insurance, our Global Accident & Health, which is predominantly International as well as our Travel and Warranty, which are rebounding in terms of growth. So I don't think that there's a lot of correlation between International and North America. But both we believe in and we're investing in, and you'll continue to see improvement. It will just be at a different pace because of the anomaly of the high net worth business. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler. \nJon Paul Newsome: I also had a couple of questions on the Personal Lines business, sort of micro and macro. My understanding, and tell me if I'm wrong, is that much of the change to the MGA is scale related. And does that mean that we should expect the expense ratio to fall over time as the MGA gain speed? And maybe just correct me if I'm wrong, does that shift around how we think about sort of the relationship between expenses and losses in that business over time, not necessarily next quarter, but over time? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Paul, let me make sure I understand the question. I mean are you asking in terms of what's going to happen to the expense ratios over time as we start to reposition and grow the business? \nJon Paul Newsome: Yes, I am. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Okay, thank you. This year, as I said in my prepared remarks, we are going to see a lot more net premium written. The reason for that is as we were repositioning the business over the last 2 years, we bought very low excess of loss catastrophe reinsurance. We bought a substantial quota share. We ceded a significant amount of Syndicate 2019, which also had retrocession behind that in a variety of forms. And so the net premium written was not that large as you've seen. And so part of the repositioning with Stone Point and having an MGA, one is that we think there's tremendous growth opportunities that exist in the business with other capital providers and believe that how we have repositioned the business through rate increases and disciplined underwriting on the admitted side, and then also the non-admitted became an option for us to have flexibility in form and rate. And so that was very positive for us in terms of repositioning the business.\n As we look to 2023 and beyond, we believe that the business is going to perform much better, much more profitable. And we don't need to cede off as much on the quota share. So as a result, in this particular calendar year, what you'll see is a lot of net premium written growth, improved loss ratios and both the expense ratio on an acquisition basis as well as the general operating expenses will improve. And so the overall combined ratio will improve dramatically. We're not going to be where we want to be in 2023, but believe by the time we hit 2024, those results will continue to improve. \nJon Paul Newsome: That's great. And maybe a big picture talking about a little bit more of the big picture cat exposures. I mean it looks like -- I'm just looking at the General Insurance overall, the cat load has pretty much stabilized, but that's been a huge part of the improvement over time. Do you think we're pretty much done? And again, I'm not talking about next quarter. I'm talking about years to come, from making this portfolio of businesses have the cat load that you want. I mean is this sort of the run rate we should be thinking about in the long term? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: The team has done an incredible job of underwriting the Property line of business across all of AIG over multiple years. Our ability to reposition that portfolio, we talk a lot about aggregates, we talk a lot about reductions and we talked a lot about where we want to grow. I think we were in a terrific place as we enter 2023 from that hard work. And when I look at where we decided to grow, we constantly talk about where the best risk-adjusted returns available in the marketplace, where is our capacity most valued and where we value for clients.\n So when I look at where we've grown, Validus Re certainly was a big part of that. Lexington has been hitting it out of the park on just about every aspect, whether it's top line growth, retention, new business, rate, like how they actually are more relevant in the marketplace. Working with Dave McElroy and the team, we've taken back some of the Retail Property. But then in other parts of the world, we've taken it back up. So like we've repositioned the portfolio and then have coupled that with the reinsurance to reflect the portfolio it is today.\n So if I summarize what happened at 1/1 is that we saw terrific opportunities for Validus Re to grow. So we took the PMLs up there a little bit. We dramatically took the PMLs down in the Private Client Group substantially. Again, I gave the return period, that every return period from 1 in 20 to 1 in 1,000 was substantially reduced on all peril and, in particular, on wildfire. And we actually took the commercial book. Despite our growth in Lexington and Global Specialty, we took those PMLs down as well. So overall, when you look at the increased PMLs in the first quarter of Validus Re and the reductions that we had in the Commercial business and the Personal business, our overall PMLs are down year-over-year.\n I think that's a tremendous outcome when you look at where we're growing, how we're driving risk-adjusted returns, how we couple that with reinsurance and our overall net PMLs are down at all the critical return periods. So I think all of that's been purposeful. The team has done an unbelievable job executing. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Ward with Citi. \nMichael Ward: I was hoping you could discuss how you think about your excess capital just given the macro volatility. You raised some debt, it sounds like, for some prudent liquidity and for buybacks. I guess given the share price, I guess, the buyback could have been a little bit higher. So just wondering from here, should we expect that you'll sort of hold a bit more capital against uncertainty? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Thank you. We were very disciplined in terms of the $750 million debt raise. Again, I'm going to let Sabra comment a little bit more on liquidity and capital. But when I look at all the different components of our capital strategy, I think we executed incredibly well in the first quarter. I mean our primary focus is to make sure that we have the appropriate capital levels in the insurance company subsidiaries for growth, and so it gave us tremendous opportunities at 1/1 as it will give us for the entire year.\n Very focused on our leverage ratios and being at the lower end just to give us financial flexibility. And of course, I've been leading everybody every quarter saying, we're looking at the dividend and to have a 12.5% dividend increase not only helps complete some of the capital management strategy we've been talking about, but also shows the confidence that we have on our earnings and how we're managing liquidity. But I'll have Sabra comment a little bit on the parent liquidity and our approach to capital. And it is proven to be conservative at this time. Sabra? \nSabra Purtill: Thank you, Peter. Yes. And I would just comment that, first of all, we look at our capitalization, both in base and stress scenarios. I mean this is just what I would call basic risk management procedures that we do. And we're very comfortable with our balance sheet even in the current environment where, obviously, there's a lot of stress on the system with the debt ceiling and the rest.\n From where we sit today, we have very strong robust capital and liquidity. And as Peter noted, the Board was comfortable raising the dividend for the first time in many, many years because of the significant turnaround of GI underwriting results over the past 5 years. So as we sit here today, yes, we'll continue to evaluate our financial flexibility for additional share repurchases, keeping in mind that our first goal is to maintain a strong balance sheet that can withstand turbulent times. \nMichael Ward: Very helpful. I guess maybe on the Crop deal, I guess, I was just wondering are there -- if you could maybe point to any other sort of targeted units where you could do sort of similar value unlocking deals there as you sort of work towards margin improvement and simplification. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Great. Thank you. We're always looking at the portfolio and looking at areas where we can add, where we can improve the overall structure of AIG and looking at the different parts of the world that we compete in. I think Crop is a little bit anomalous just because we really do believe it's a very good business, but you know how it works, which is driven by commodity prices and yields. And I think that having scale is really important. While the top line that we publish on a gross and net basis is significant, that's gone up 40%, 50%, if not more, over the past several years based on those components.\n And we believe that Crop Risk Services, in order for it to achieve its ultimate potential that being part of a bigger enterprise and one that valued it like Great American, was the prudent approach for us at this time. And so that was something that was specific to that business. It was specific to how we look to strategically position AIG for the future and also making certain that with Crop Risk Services, it had a great opportunity to scale and realize this potential. So I feel like we really found a very good partner and that's really what drove the outcome for CRS. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. \nTaylor Scott: First one I had for you is on the separation at Corebridge. I know you mentioned the base case is still secondaries, but I think you also mentioned that you were considering some alternatives. So I just wanted to see if you could extrapolate on that a bit at all. What kind of alternatives could you look towards? And how could some of those things potentially improve things for shareholders? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Yes. Thanks, Alex. I'll try to expand a bit on it. Because as you can imagine, there's not a lot of more detail that I can really share beyond my prepared remarks. We do believe the secondary is the preferred path. But obviously, it's subject to market conditions as we saw in the first quarter, but we're prepared to go in the second quarter.\n Our objective has not changed, which is for AIG to reduce its ownership stake in Corebridge over time. And so I think it's prudent, looking at a variety of different options to make sure that we're driving value for shareholders and provide a path that will recognize the value of Corebridge. Corebridge has done a terrific job since we've announced that we were going to commence upon doing an IPO, getting themselves positioned to be an independent public company and the stock was trading at a deep discount in the first quarter.\n I mean one of the alternatives, I don't think we're going to go much beyond this, was what we announced on Laya Healthcare. And so making sure we're sticking to the core business of Corebridge. And we'll just give you updates as the weeks and over the next month progresses. But we're prepared and are very excited about hopefully getting the secondary done in the second quarter. \nTaylor Scott: Got it. Follow-up I had is on corporate expenses. I think it was the first time you guys gave a bit more explicit guidance around where corporate expenses for RemainCo could shake out at that 1% to 1.5% premiums. And I just wanted to make sure I understood some of the mechanics. I mean when I think about that level, I mean, is that what I should expect in sort of Corporate GOE, overall Corporate costs? I mean how do I think about that? And then just a technical kind of question. The investment that I think you mentioned leading up to that, will that go through operating and also be reflected in Corporate? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Yes. So we try to provide as much detail as we could on the expense savings. Certainly, let me start with AIG 200 because we still have more to earn through on AIG 200 savings in 2023 and 2024. So over 50% of that will be earned in mostly through the second and through fourth quarter of 2023. We have begun to separate Corebridge. And -- but upon deconsolidation, approximately $300 million of the AIG Corporate expenses will move to Life and Retirement. So that's another variable that you need to consider.\n We also gave guidance as we're working through our future state business model, $250 million to $350 million of parent expenses. And then the remaining will be worked through to fit the business model in terms of what we're designing for the future of AIG. We want to make sure that we have a lean model that's not synonymous with expense cutting, but it is how we're going to be in each market, how we face off with our clients and our distribution partners to maximize growth and all the opportunities that present them themselves to AIG and making sure that we have a structure that supports that.\n Sequencing is important. We've been working on a variety of different initiatives that are substantial, and we're performing out all of them, making certain that General Insurance has the capital and support it needs to grow in this market; repositioning some of our businesses, which we covered in my prepared remarks; making sure we complete AIG 200, the operational separation; preparing to do the secondary; advancing Corebridge capital structure; and then making sure that we're working to get this future state business model implemented, but it has to be in that order. And we've given you the guidance. We've done the work. We know that's the savings that we'll achieve.\n Some of that's going to go into the business. And so the business has to get rationalized and leaner in order to be able to absorb more expenses. But our commitment is the $500 million in addition to the guidance that we've given in the other components. And we're highly confident we'll execute on that at the right time, meaning we've got to get these other things further along. And then when we have clear line of sight in terms of separation, we'll be able to execute on the target operating model. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. \nBrian Meredith: Peter, you gave us a lot of detail on the growth in the Commercial Lines. There's, obviously, very strong growth. I'm trying to just dumb it down a little bit here. If we look at what the growth is X, let's call it, Validus Re crop, what would have looked like? And what was the tailwind from Validus Re crop just from the Commercial Lines growth on a year-over-year basis? And the reason I'm asking is, those are obviously very big first quarter premium numbers. So I just want to make sure I'm not extrapolating that for the remainder of the year. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Thanks, Brian. Certainly, Validus contributed a meaningful amount to the growth. But look, we bought a lot of retro. It's the first quarter. It's not all property. So each quarter is a bit different in terms of not being able to straight line it.\n Crop Risk Services had low single-digit growth. So that was not a contributor at all in terms of net premium written. We had very strong, as I said, growth in our Specialty business, in Lexington, in our Property, offset a little bit by Financial Lines. But I put the guidance in there because I feel very confident that we're going to have strong growth throughout the year. Even though the quarters are a little bit different, businesses like Europe is heavy 1/1. And we start to have sort of different mix of business over the second, third and fourth. But I feel seeing the pipeline, looking at how you grow, I mean, the first thing I would look at is what's the client retention and how is the new business, what's happening with rate and are we growing in the businesses that we want to. And I think we are checking all the boxes here and see that those businesses have more opportunity in the future, not less. And so I think the growth that you saw in the first quarter, obviously, there's a mix of business, but I would expect to see similar growth throughout the rest of the year. \nBrian Meredith: Okay. Very helpful. And then second question, just curious, some other companies are talking about how the Commercial Property markets are even further firming up in the second quarter. There's more business available. Are you seeing the same kind of dynamics or things actually continuing to improve here in the Commercial Property markets? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Yes. Thanks, Brian. Yes, we are seeing that. I mean, again, it's early in the second quarter, but views on April. And as we look to the rest of the second quarter, we're seeing Property continue to firm up and getting stronger than it was in the first quarter. So that's something that we're trying to be focused on clients, making sure we're driving value and we have a lot of capital to deploy. So we expect to be trading actively in the second quarter.\n Okay. Well, thank you, everybody. Sorry for the 1-minute hiccup on the microphone, but greatly appreciate you dialing in, and I wish everybody a great day. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

            "name": "Sabra Purtill",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter. This morning, I will cover 2 accounting changes, provide more details on first quarter results and give an overview of Commercial Mortgage Loans. First, the 1-month lag in financial reporting for the General Insurance International segment was eliminated last quarter. The lag elimination did not impact earnings significantly, but it did affect premiums written comparisons to 2022. Details on the premium impacts are in the financial supplement on Page 26.\n Second, we adopted the change in accounting standard for certain long-duration products, commonly called LDTI. Yesterday, 8-Ks were filed that provide restated prior year financial results for AIG and Corebridge. The cumulative effect at year-end 2022 was an increase of $1.5 billion to adjusted equity and an increase of $1.0 billion to total shareholders' equity. This impact is consistent with our previous guidance. As a reminder, this is a GAAP accounting change only and does not impact statutory results, insurance company cash flows or economic returns. Going forward, we expect a modest run rate increase in L&R APTI and less market and mortality-driven volatility from the change in accounting standards.\n Turning to the quarter, as Peter mentioned, AIG's first quarter adjusted after-tax income was $1.2 billion or $1.63 per diluted share, up 9% from last year on a restated basis and up 25% from originally reported. Key trends in the quarter and similar to the last 3 quarters were higher GI underwriting results and higher income from fixed maturities and loans and lower alternative investment income. Compared to the prior year quarter, there was a higher impact from noncontrolling interest from the Corebridge IPO in 3Q '22.\n Consolidated net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.1 billion. Similar to the fourth quarter, income from fixed maturities and loans in both GI and L&R rose sequentially and over the prior year, while returns on alternative investments were down $593 million compared to very strong annualized returns of 28% last year.\n Income on fixed maturities and loans rose by $573 million over the prior year, with average new money reinvestment rates of 5.35%, about 220 basis points above sales and maturities. The yield rose to 4.29%, up 78 basis points from 1Q '22 and 23 basis points over 4Q '22. Part of the increase in fixed maturity yields resulted from our proactive repositioning over the last 2 quarters in the U.S. GI portfolio. We sold and reinvested about $6 billion in fixed maturities, resulting in a realized loss of $224 million, but added 9 basis points of GI yield improvement for the quarter. We expect incremental yield pickup from this repositioning in 2Q '23 and also from higher reinvestment rates throughout 2023 based on the current rate and spread environment.\n Turning to the segments. GI adjusted pretax income, or APTI, was $1.2 billion, $37 million higher than 1Q '22, principally due to a $56 million increase in underwriting income from both higher-earned premiums and a 1 point improvement in the calendar year combined ratio, which was 91.9%. Peter covered underwriting results in detail, but I want to add that GI reserves had favorable prior year development, net of reinsurance at prior year premiums of $54 million.\n Turning to L&R results for the first quarter. APTI was $886 million, down $48 million compared to $934 million in 1Q '22 as restated. Consistent with GI, L&R had a strong increase in base portfolio investment income, but lower alternative investment income. Mortality experience improved, but fee income was down due to lower capital market levels compared to a year ago. As Peter noted, L&R premiums and deposits were very strong at $10.4 billion. Notably, Individual Retirement sales were $4.9 billion, a 26% increase over the prior year quarter with record levels of fixed and fixed index annuity sales because of higher crediting rates.\n Group Retirement deposits grew 19%, with higher out-of-plan fixed annuity sales and new plan acquisitions. Strong fixed and fixed index annuity sales, net of surrenders, resulted in $1.3 billion of positive flows to the General Account in Individual Retirement, up from $0.7 billion last year. While surrenders are up, they remain below projections. Variable annuity net flows, which impact the separate account, were negative.\n To conclude on earnings for the quarter, other operations adjusted pretax loss, or APTL, was $491 million, a $70 million increase due to lower APTI from consolidated investment entities in Asset Management, which had strong private equity results in 1Q '22. Corporate GOE decreased $27 million from the prior year and $77 million from 4Q '22 despite $29 million of additional expense related to the corporate separation.\n Turning to AIG's balance sheet. Book value per common share was $58.87 at quarter end, up 7% from year-end, principally due to higher valuations on available-for-sale securities due to lower long-term interest rates. Adjusted book value was $75.87 per share, roughly flat with year-end. At the end of March, we issued $750 million of senior notes, a portion of which was used to pay down an April bond maturity.\n Our leverage ratio declined to 32.8%, down about 1 point from year-end even with the new issuance due to the change in AOCI in the quarter. Excluding AOCI and the Fortitude-embedded derivative, debt leverage was 26.3%.\n For the first quarter of 2023, AIG's consolidated adjusted ROCE was 8.7%, comprised of 11.6% in GI and 10.7% in L&R. As Peter discussed, we are laser-focused on achieving a 10%-plus ROCE post deconsolidation.\n Peter provided a lot of detail on the quarter. So I'll use my remaining time to cover investments, particularly Commercial Mortgage Loans, given the recent focus on this asset class. First, I want to emphasize that our investment portfolio is grounded in the liability profile of our 2 insurance businesses. We strive to achieve strong risk-adjusted returns while matching the duration, cash flow and liquidity needs of the liabilities.\n Over the last several years, we have improved the risk profile of the investment portfolio by reducing capital-intensive, less liquid or more volatile assets such as hedge funds. With the onset of COVID and, again, with rising interest rates last year, we further tightened investment guidelines and moved up in quality, including the GI repositioning mentioned earlier and also sales of L&R non-investment-grade assets.\n Turning to our Commercial Mortgage Loan exposures. I'll start by noting that our mortgages are senior secured loans on high-quality properties that are well diversified by type and geography with strong loan to values, or LTVs, averaging 59% and debt service coverage ratios averaging 1.9x. We are the lead lender on more than 80% of our loans, which gives us important control rights.\n Excluding Fortitude funds withheld assets, we had $33.8 billion of Commercial Mortgage Loans at the end of March, of which $30.3 billion were at Corebridge and $3.5 billion at General Insurance. The largest property type is multifamily housing or apartments, about 40% of our Commercial Mortgage Loans. Industrial Property loans are about 16% of the portfolio. Both multifamily and industrial are performing well. We are, however, focused on traditional U.S. office, which is $5.4 billion or 2% of AIG's invested assets. Our U.S. office allocation has been shrinking for several years, particularly when we tightened underwriting standards further for office, retail and hotels with the onset of COVID. Currently, 94% of the office loans are high-quality rated CM1 or CM2 with debt service coverage averaging about 2.1x and weighted average LTVs of 64%. Valuations are updated annually by a third party, and we continue to monitor valuations given rising cap rates.\n We also have a credit or CECL allowance against the portfolio of about $330 million or 3.7% against the office loan portfolio and $584 million for the total commercial mortgage portfolio or 1.7%, which is higher than many peers as we use CMBS default data in our methodology.\n Roughly 3/4 of the building securing the loans are Class A or newer buildings with better amenities. The majority are in the top 5 U.S. metropolitan areas and concentrated in central business districts, including in New York City, which historically has been one of the strongest office markets in the country.\n Today, we are intensely focused on office loan maturities in the next 2 years, about $2 billion or 28 loans. We are already in discussions with many borrowers about their plans and our requirements for refinancing or extension, including additional equity revised terms or other commitments. While valuations are under pressure, cash flows are the primary source of debt service for our loans, and we will continue to monitor the loans carefully. We look forward to updating you on our investment performance in the quarters ahead.\n To wrap up, our first quarter 2023 results demonstrate continued sustained and strong financial results, rising investment portfolio yields, significant progress against strategic initiatives, robust capital and liquidity and continued progress on our path to a 10%-plus ROCE.\n With that, I will turn the call back over to Peter. Thank you, Peter. Yes. And I would just comment that, first of all, we look at our capitalization, both in base and stress scenarios. I mean this is just what I would call basic risk management procedures that we do. And we're very comfortable with our balance sheet even in the current environment where, obviously, there's a lot of stress on the system with the debt ceiling and the rest.\n From where we sit today, we have very strong robust capital and liquidity. And as Peter noted, the Board was comfortable raising the dividend for the first time in many, many years because of the significant turnaround of GI underwriting results over the past 5 years. So as we sit here today, yes, we'll continue to evaluate our financial flexibility for additional share repurchases, keeping in mind that our first goal is to maintain a strong balance sheet that can withstand turbulent times."

            "name": "Peter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review our first quarter financial results. Following my remarks, Sabra will provide more financial detail in the quarter, and then we will take questions. Kevin Hogan and David McElroy will be available for the Q&A portion of the call.\n As you saw in our press release, we reported an excellent start to the year. We continue to make meaningful progress across AIG and achieve important milestones, even in the face of ongoing complexity in the insurance industry, volatile market conditions and general economic uncertainty. We continue to diligently execute on our strategic and operational priorities, which drove very strong financial results in the first quarter and are positioning AIG for long-term value creation. Here are some highlights from the first quarter.\n Adjusted after-tax income was $1.2 billion or $1.63 per diluted common share, representing a 9% increase year-over-year. Net investment income on a consolidated basis was $3.1 billion. In 2022, we began to take proactive steps to improve the credit quality, construction and return characteristics of our investment portfolio as well as to reduce volatility. We saw the benefits of these actions in the first quarter and expect that to continue throughout the year. Sabra will provide additional detail on net investment income in her remarks.\n Net premiums written in General Insurance grew 10% on a constant dollar basis and adjusted for the International lag elimination that we discussed on our last call. This growth was driven by our Commercial business. Underwriting income was approximately $500 million, a 13% increase year-over-year, which is AIG's strongest first quarter underwriting result.\n The accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 88.7%, an 80 basis point improvement from prior year.\n Life and Retirement reported very good results, with premiums and deposits of $10.4 billion in the first quarter, a 44% increase year-over-year, supported by record sales in fixed annuity and fixed index annuity products.\n Net flows into the General Account from Individual Retirement were approximately $1.3 billion.\n Corebridge and Blackstone have made substantial progress advancing their strategic partnership, which began in late 2021. Since that time, Blackstone has invested approximately $11 billion on behalf of Corebridge, with an average gross yield of 6.5% and an average credit rating of A. This partnership has allowed Corebridge to expand in certain asset classes where we had limited to no access in the past, which has been very beneficial for the business and is helping to support growth, particularly in fixed annuity products.\n We returned approximately $840 million to shareholders in the first quarter through $600 million of common stock repurchases and $240 million of dividends. And we ended the first quarter with strong parent liquidity of $3.9 billion. Overall, I'm very pleased with what we accomplished in the first quarter. The strong momentum we had coming into 2023 continues.\n As we announced last night, the AIG Board approved the first meaningful increase to AIG's common stock quarterly dividend in many years. Starting in the second quarter, this dividend will be $0.36 per share, an increase of 12.5%. This is another significant milestone for AIG and reflects our commitment to a disciplined, balanced capital management strategy and our confidence in the future earnings power of AIG.\n Corebridge is also achieving important milestones. Since its IPO in September of last year, Corebridge has paid 3 dividends to public shareholders, totaling approximately $450 million. And yesterday, the Corebridge Board authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program. During the first quarter, we were prepared to launch a secondary offering of Corebridge common stock, but chose not to proceed when equity markets became volatile due to issues in the financial sector.\n We continue to be prepared and disciplined in terms of executing a secondary offering, which remains our base case for selling down our ownership in Corebridge, subject to market conditions and regulatory approvals. We remain committed to reducing our ownership interest in Corebridge and will explore other options that are aligned with the best interest of shareholders.\n During the remainder of my remarks this morning, I'll provide more information on the following 5 topics: first, I will review the first quarter results for General Insurance; second, I will give a high-level overview of the results for Life and Retirement, and Sabra will provide more detail in her remarks; third, I will provide an update on a few strategic initiatives, including the announcement last week relating to Private Client Services, our MGA partnership with Stone Point Capital, our announcement on Tuesday of the sale of Crop Risk Services and our intent to sell Laya Healthcare, which is a part of Corebridge and Ireland's second largest health insurance provider; fourth, I will provide more information on capital management actions; lastly, I will review progress on our path to a 10%-plus ROCE, including an update on the work we are doing on the future state business model of AIG.\n Turning to General Insurance. Let me provide more detail on first quarter results, starting with our strong growth in gross and net premiums written. When we refer to gross and net premiums written, all numbers have been adjusted for both foreign exchange and the impact of the lag elimination.\n Gross premiums written were $12 billion, an increase of 9%, with Global Commercial growing 13% and Global Personal decreasing 4%. Net premiums written were $7 billion, an increase of 10%. This growth was primarily driven by Global Commercial, which grew 11%, while Global Personal grew 6%.\n In North America Commercial, we saw a very strong growth of 15% in net premiums written due to Validus Re, which had over 40% growth year-over-year due to the exceptional results we achieved with our January 1 treaty placements, which I discussed in detail on our last call. Lexington, which grew over 25%, led by Wholesale Property and Casualty, double-digit growth in Captive Solutions and Glatfelter.\n Focusing on Lexington for a moment, I would like to highlight a few achievements from the first quarter. The business continues to drive excellent performance, impressive growth and has consistently improved its portfolio quarter after quarter over the last couple of years. Lexington's tremendous growth has been achieved through its relevance in the marketplace and increasing its market share, not from increasing limits deployed. Strong retention, new business and rate have been the key drivers of Lexington's financial performance. Lexington has now seen double-digit rate increases for 16 consecutive quarters, and cumulative compounded rate increases totaled over 100% since the first quarter of 2018.\n Additionally, over the last few years, the average size of a Lexington Property primary policy went from $100 million in limits deployed to $5 million. This has substantially reduced volatility in Lexington's portfolio. Our thoughtful and prudent growth strategy, together with our shift in focus to wholesale distribution, continues to serve us well, particularly in the E&S market.\n I also want to provide more color on Validus Re. We've provided significant detail on the 1/1 renewal season on our last call, and I think it's worth expanding on a few items from the first quarter. Net premiums written were very strong and balanced in Validus Re, and we continue to meaningfully improve the quality of the portfolio. Rate improvements were particularly strong in U.S. Property, International Property, Marine and Energy, Casualty and Specialty Lines.\n With respect to April 1 renewals across the portfolio, gross and net premiums written increased. And within International Property, limits deployed were reduced slightly, and Japan property cat risk-adjusted rates were up approximately 20%.\n As we consider our deployment strategy at the June 1 renewal cycle, which focuses on U.S. wind exposure, we will continue to maintain a prudent approach on limits deployed. We do not expect to deploy additional limits beyond our current aggregate allocated to Florida, although we do anticipate significant rate increases and improved terms and conditions. Like General Insurance, the Validus Re portfolio has been completely re-underwritten with a focus on risk-adjusted returns. The business had a terrific first quarter and is well positioned for profitable growth through the rest of the year.\n Shifting back to our 15% net premiums written growth in the first quarter, this result was impressive despite the headwinds we continue to see in Financial Lines, where overall net premiums written contracted 9% due to increased competition putting pressure on pricing as well as continued slowdown in M&A and other transactional business.\n We are one of the very few lead markets in large account public D&O where primary rates have remained relatively flat year-over-year. In contrast, high excess public company D&O saw rate declines greater than 20%. To put this in perspective, this represents a little over 5% of our overall North America Financial Lines business, and we will continue to manage this book very prudently. We have deep domain knowledge and experience, data, best-in-class underwriting capabilities and leading claims expertise that allow us to differentiate ourselves in the D&O marketplace.\n During the past year, we continued to see new competitors with limited experience into the high excess public D&O market. This is driving down pricing in what is traditionally the most commoditized portion of a placement. Despite these dynamics, we remain disciplined on price and are taking a long-term view of this line of business. We have significant scale and geographic balance on our portfolio, and we will not follow the market down.\n Turning to International Commercial. Net premiums written grew 6%, primarily due to Property, which was up over 40%; Global Specialty, which was up over 15%; and Casualty, which was up over 15%. Global Commercial had very strong renewal retention of 88% in its in-force portfolio, International was up 200 basis points to 88%, and North America was up 100 basis points to 87%. As a reminder, we calculate renewal retention prior to the impact of rate and exposure changes. And across Global Commercial, we continue to see strong new business, which was over $1 billion in the first quarter.\n International Commercial new business was over $590 million, led by Specialty, which increased its new business by over 50%, driven by Energy and Marine. North America Commercial, excluding Validus Re, achieved new business of over $480 million, driven by Lexington, which saw excellent new business growth of over 50%. With respect to rate in North America Commercial, excluding Validus Re, rates increased 7% in the first quarter or 8% if you exclude workers' compensation, and the exposure increase was 2%.\n In North America Commercial, rate was driven by Lexington wholesale, which was up 26% with Wholesale Property up 35%. For Lexington Property Wholesale, this was its strongest quarterly rate increase. Rate in Retail Property was also up significantly at 32%; International Commercial rate increases were 8%, driven by Talbot at 16%, International Property at 11% and Specialty at 9%. The exposure increase in the International portfolio was 2%. Rate plus exposure remains above loss cost trend at 9% in North America, 10% if you exclude workers' compensation and 10% in International. \n Turning to Personal Insurance. First quarter results reflect our continued repositioning of this business, especially PCG, given our announcement of the creation of a managing general agency in partnership with Stone Point Capital. I will provide more information on the MGA later in my remarks.\n North America Personal net premiums written increased 57%, driven by lower quota share cessions in PCG at January 1, as we transition to writing the business as an MGA, along with the recognition of an improved portfolio. The combination of improved pricing in our admitted business and more business migrating to the non-admitting market has a very positive impact on PCG's accident and policy or loss ratios. This will earn in through the second half of 2023 and into 2024.\n Entering 2023, we required less excess of loss reinsurance on the upper end of our reinsurance program due to realized reduction in PCG's PMLs at all return periods as a result of ongoing improvements in risk selection and reductions in aggregate in peak zones. More specifically, all peril and all return periods from 1 in 20 to 1 in 1,000 reduced on average by 40%, while those same return periods with respect to wildfire reduced on average by 60%. These dynamics further impacted net premiums written in the first quarter. \n Syndicate 2019 continues to act as a mechanism to enable third-party capital providers to support PCG's high and ultra-high net worth business for the 2023 accident year.\n In terms of expectations for PCG for the full year, we expect net premiums written growth to be at or higher than we saw in the first quarter, the loss ratio to meaningfully improve and the acquisition ratio and general operating expense to also improve.\n Turning to International Personal. Net premiums written were largely flat in the first quarter, Travel and Warranty grew while Personal Property declined, all driven by a further refinement of our cat reinsurance cost allocation methodology, making year-over-year comparisons difficult. Accident & Health had some timing issues that impacted net premiums written in the first quarter. We expect to see growth in International Personal for the remainder of 2023 and believe results will continue to strengthen as we move through the year.\n Shifting to combined ratios. As I noted earlier, the first quarter accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 88.7%, an 80 basis point improvement year-over-year. In Global Commercial, the first quarter accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 84.9%, a 110 basis point improvement year-over-year and we reported a 24% increase in underwriting income.\n The North America Commercial accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 85.7%, a 240 basis point improvement year-over-year. The International Commercial accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was essentially flat at 83.7%, which is an outstanding result. Global Personal reported a first quarter accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, of 98.6%, a 120 basis point increase from the prior year quarter, largely due to a decrease in earned premium from our deliberate reduction in gross exposure in PCG in North America.\n Now let me comment on catastrophes. The cat loss ratio in the quarter was 4.2% or $264 million of catastrophe losses. Our largest loss in the period was from 2 storms in New Zealand, which accounted for $126 million of catastrophe losses.\n Looking at North America, total losses from catastrophe-related activities in the first quarter were $116 million, which includes Validus Re. In International, excluding Japan, we have eroded approximately $75 million of our aggregate retention and have approximately $75 million net remaining, plus the annual aggregate deductible for each cat loss for the rest of the year. As we described in our last call, the reinsurance program we structured at this year's January 1 renewal provides us with the ability to manage volatility and severity. Looking ahead to the rest of 2023, we expect to see very strong top line growth in General Insurance.\n Turning to Life and Retirement. The business delivered strong performance in the first quarter. Adjusted pretax income was $886 million for the first quarter, and adjusted return on segment equity was 10.7%. First quarter results benefited from continued growth in spread-based products and related spread income. As I mentioned earlier, premiums and deposits grew significantly in the first quarter, driven by strong new individual retirement business, which, despite increasing surrenders related to interest rates, contributed to growth in the General Account. The balance sheet and capital position of Corebridge remains strong with $1.8 billion of parent liquidity.\n Turning to our strategic initiatives. Last week, we executed a definitive documentation with Stone Point Capital for the launch of Private Client Services, an MGA that will serve the high and ultra-high net worth market. We are excited about the prospects for PCS and are confident of the value this new operating structure will deliver for clients, brokers and other stakeholders. We look forward to continuing this journey with the PCS management team and the ongoing support of Stone Point Capital.\n Subject to regulatory approvals, the MGA is expected to formally launch in the third quarter of this year, and we expect to bring on additional capital providers through the second half of 2023. As part of our ongoing review process, we regularly assess the composition of our portfolio of businesses to ensure it is aligned with our long-term strategy and best positioned to create value for our shareholders and other stakeholders.\n As part of this review, as you saw in our announcement on Tuesday, we executed a definitive documentation to sell Crop Risk Services, or CRS, to American Financial Group for $240 million. We acquired CRS as part of our broader acquisition of Validus Holdings in 2018. AIG will continue to write business for the 2023 spring crop season, which ends June 30. We expect approximately $700 million to $800 million of net premiums written for 2023, 75% of which booked in the first quarter. Starting in the third quarter, AIG will act as a fronting partner for American Financial Group during a transitional period.\n For full year 2023, we expect to retain about $800 million to $900 million of earned premiums, $750 million of which we'll earn in over the remainder of the year. CRS is a well-run and attractive business, led by a high-quality management team. In American Financial Group, we have found a high-quality partner for CRS and its employees and believe the business will benefit from being part of a larger combined platform. We also continually review the product portfolio and geographic footprint of Corebridge as we position this business for the future as a fully stand-alone company.\n After a comprehensive review of the health product offering, we decided to evaluate strategic alternatives and a potential sale of Laya Healthcare, the private medical insurance business in Ireland. We believe this will help to streamline the Corebridge portfolio and allow it to focus on Life and Retirement products and solutions.\n Turning to capital management. The first quarter marked another quarter of continued progress and execution of our balanced strategy. In addition to the first quarter share repurchases and dividends that I mentioned earlier, against the backdrop of an unstable macroeconomic environment, we thought it was prudent to raise $750 million of debt at the end of March. This provided us with financial flexibility to pay down a near-term debt maturity and complete additional share repurchases at what we viewed as attractive share prices.\n Turning to return on common equity. We remain highly committed and laser-focused on delivering a 10%-plus ROCE. Through the first quarter, we continued to make meaningful progress on the 4 components of our path to deliver on this commitment. As a reminder, these components include sustained and improved underwriting profitability; executing on a simpler, leaner business model across AIG; operational separation and deconsolidation of Corebridge; and continued balanced capital management. Given the number of strategic initiatives we are executing at once, we are taking a long-term view while measuring progress in 90-day increments. We advanced each component during the first quarter and expect this to continue throughout 2023.\n As I discussed earlier, our first quarter financial results were excellent, with continued top line growth and improvement in underwriting profitability in General Insurance. Over the last few months, we accelerated our work to establish AIG's future state business model. Sequencing has been very important on our journey and the work that's been accomplished over the last few years on the General Insurance turnaround, AIG 200, the separation and IPO of Corebridge and restructuring of our investment management group. This has positioned us to move forward as a more focused and simplified AIG.\n Evolving our future state business model will result in us moving away from the conglomerate structure AIG operated in for decades. We will eliminate overlap and significantly reduce decentralized infrastructure across the company, which will lead to a leaner business model, particularly in our operations. In future state, we expect a redefined AIG parent expense structure to be approximately 1% to 1.5% of premiums, which today is roughly $250 million to $350 million.\n AIG parent will have 5 primary roles and objectives: public company matters, including finance, legal, compliance and regulatory oversight as well as corporate governance; communications with key stakeholders, including the investment community, rating agencies, regulators, policymakers and AIG colleagues; risk management, culture, performance and human capital management; and strategy, including business development, M&A and design and execution of key initiatives. As we progress our future state business model, we anticipate achieving approximately $500 million in cost reductions at AIG parent and a cost to achieve of around $400 million with substantially quicker earn-in of savings that we achieved with AIG 200.\n As expense savings begin to earn through, the reductions will largely be seen in other operations, which is where general operating expenses are currently accounted for.\n With respect to Corebridge, I took you through our current thinking on separation and timing of the secondary offerings.\n Lastly, on capital management. We continue to maintain appropriate levels of capital in our subsidiaries to support profitable growth. We remain on track to reduce AIG common stock outstanding to be between 600 million and 650 million shares and achieve a debt-to-capital leverage at the lower end of our 20% to 25% range post deconsolidation of Corebridge.\n As I noted earlier, we increased our common stock dividend by 12.5%, starting in the second quarter of this year. And in addition to our stock repurchases in the first quarter, to date, we have repurchased $240 million of AIG common stock in the second quarter. Apart from the progress we're making on these components of our path to a 10%-plus ROCE, we also expect tailwinds from higher reinvestment yields. We are confident that our continued progress on strategic initiatives and our capital management strategy will allow us to achieve our ROCE targets and deliver long-term profitable growth that benefits all of our stakeholders.\n I will now turn the call over to Sabra. Can you hear me now? I heard the questions, Quentin. Sorry, I actually had a good answer too. I just was on -- not a microphone that worked. So Meyer, back to your question is that we had -- you have to look at the portfolio composition to be able to answer the question. And Validus Re obviously had meaningful growth on gross and net during the quarter. And so, therefore, it's hard to look at the cessions year-over-year when you're having a retro program that fits the portfolio that you're underwriting.\n We've never had a strategy that we're going to time the market with our reinsurance partners. They've always been strategic. They've always been supportive. They've always deployed the capital in support of AIG. And so we were not going to do anything, other than to try to get the appropriate terms and conditions with them and have not really changed much of our risk appetite in terms of taking that. And I think that has generated a terrific result for us on net premium written, but also on the combined ratios.\n So I think I wouldn't look into just one quarter in terms of discussions. And as I said, we have a lot in terms of the guidance I've given on PCG, which we will still assume a lot of risk. And I guess -- let's just play it out for the full year. We're not looking to do anything materially different. It really doesn't, Meyer. I mean they're really distinct businesses. I mean, certainly, our Travel and Warranty have platforms that are global and that give us capabilities across the world. But as you know, Private Client Group, in particular in the U.S., is a unique asset. Again, the guidance I gave in the prepared remarks, it's one that we believe we will grow the net premium written because we don't believe we need the quota shares anymore after the excellent job the team has done in repositioning and re-underwriting that portfolio. We have substantially less cat in aggregates that we once did. So I think that's something that will be a little different in terms of -- if you look at International.\n While International, we have a terrific Personal Insurance business. Some of it was affected by COVID. It's growing back, between Japan's Personal Insurance, our Global Accident & Health, which is predominantly International as well as our Travel and Warranty, which are rebounding in terms of growth. So I don't think that there's a lot of correlation between International and North America. But both we believe in and we're investing in, and you'll continue to see improvement. It will just be at a different pace because of the anomaly of the high net worth business. Paul, let me make sure I understand the question. I mean are you asking in terms of what's going to happen to the expense ratios over time as we start to reposition and grow the business? Okay, thank you. This year, as I said in my prepared remarks, we are going to see a lot more net premium written. The reason for that is as we were repositioning the business over the last 2 years, we bought very low excess of loss catastrophe reinsurance. We bought a substantial quota share. We ceded a significant amount of Syndicate 2019, which also had retrocession behind that in a variety of forms. And so the net premium written was not that large as you've seen. And so part of the repositioning with Stone Point and having an MGA, one is that we think there's tremendous growth opportunities that exist in the business with other capital providers and believe that how we have repositioned the business through rate increases and disciplined underwriting on the admitted side, and then also the non-admitted became an option for us to have flexibility in form and rate. And so that was very positive for us in terms of repositioning the business.\n As we look to 2023 and beyond, we believe that the business is going to perform much better, much more profitable. And we don't need to cede off as much on the quota share. So as a result, in this particular calendar year, what you'll see is a lot of net premium written growth, improved loss ratios and both the expense ratio on an acquisition basis as well as the general operating expenses will improve. And so the overall combined ratio will improve dramatically. We're not going to be where we want to be in 2023, but believe by the time we hit 2024, those results will continue to improve. The team has done an incredible job of underwriting the Property line of business across all of AIG over multiple years. Our ability to reposition that portfolio, we talk a lot about aggregates, we talk a lot about reductions and we talked a lot about where we want to grow. I think we were in a terrific place as we enter 2023 from that hard work. And when I look at where we decided to grow, we constantly talk about where the best risk-adjusted returns available in the marketplace, where is our capacity most valued and where we value for clients.\n So when I look at where we've grown, Validus Re certainly was a big part of that. Lexington has been hitting it out of the park on just about every aspect, whether it's top line growth, retention, new business, rate, like how they actually are more relevant in the marketplace. Working with Dave McElroy and the team, we've taken back some of the Retail Property. But then in other parts of the world, we've taken it back up. So like we've repositioned the portfolio and then have coupled that with the reinsurance to reflect the portfolio it is today.\n So if I summarize what happened at 1/1 is that we saw terrific opportunities for Validus Re to grow. So we took the PMLs up there a little bit. We dramatically took the PMLs down in the Private Client Group substantially. Again, I gave the return period, that every return period from 1 in 20 to 1 in 1,000 was substantially reduced on all peril and, in particular, on wildfire. And we actually took the commercial book. Despite our growth in Lexington and Global Specialty, we took those PMLs down as well. So overall, when you look at the increased PMLs in the first quarter of Validus Re and the reductions that we had in the Commercial business and the Personal business, our overall PMLs are down year-over-year.\n I think that's a tremendous outcome when you look at where we're growing, how we're driving risk-adjusted returns, how we couple that with reinsurance and our overall net PMLs are down at all the critical return periods. So I think all of that's been purposeful. The team has done an unbelievable job executing. Thank you. We were very disciplined in terms of the $750 million debt raise. Again, I'm going to let Sabra comment a little bit more on liquidity and capital. But when I look at all the different components of our capital strategy, I think we executed incredibly well in the first quarter. I mean our primary focus is to make sure that we have the appropriate capital levels in the insurance company subsidiaries for growth, and so it gave us tremendous opportunities at 1/1 as it will give us for the entire year.\n Very focused on our leverage ratios and being at the lower end just to give us financial flexibility. And of course, I've been leading everybody every quarter saying, we're looking at the dividend and to have a 12.5% dividend increase not only helps complete some of the capital management strategy we've been talking about, but also shows the confidence that we have on our earnings and how we're managing liquidity. But I'll have Sabra comment a little bit on the parent liquidity and our approach to capital. And it is proven to be conservative at this time. Sabra? Great. Thank you. We're always looking at the portfolio and looking at areas where we can add, where we can improve the overall structure of AIG and looking at the different parts of the world that we compete in. I think Crop is a little bit anomalous just because we really do believe it's a very good business, but you know how it works, which is driven by commodity prices and yields. And I think that having scale is really important. While the top line that we publish on a gross and net basis is significant, that's gone up 40%, 50%, if not more, over the past several years based on those components.\n And we believe that Crop Risk Services, in order for it to achieve its ultimate potential that being part of a bigger enterprise and one that valued it like Great American, was the prudent approach for us at this time. And so that was something that was specific to that business. It was specific to how we look to strategically position AIG for the future and also making certain that with Crop Risk Services, it had a great opportunity to scale and realize this potential. So I feel like we really found a very good partner and that's really what drove the outcome for CRS. Yes. Thanks, Alex. I'll try to expand a bit on it. Because as you can imagine, there's not a lot of more detail that I can really share beyond my prepared remarks. We do believe the secondary is the preferred path. But obviously, it's subject to market conditions as we saw in the first quarter, but we're prepared to go in the second quarter.\n Our objective has not changed, which is for AIG to reduce its ownership stake in Corebridge over time. And so I think it's prudent, looking at a variety of different options to make sure that we're driving value for shareholders and provide a path that will recognize the value of Corebridge. Corebridge has done a terrific job since we've announced that we were going to commence upon doing an IPO, getting themselves positioned to be an independent public company and the stock was trading at a deep discount in the first quarter.\n I mean one of the alternatives, I don't think we're going to go much beyond this, was what we announced on Laya Healthcare. And so making sure we're sticking to the core business of Corebridge. And we'll just give you updates as the weeks and over the next month progresses. But we're prepared and are very excited about hopefully getting the secondary done in the second quarter. Yes. So we try to provide as much detail as we could on the expense savings. Certainly, let me start with AIG 200 because we still have more to earn through on AIG 200 savings in 2023 and 2024. So over 50% of that will be earned in mostly through the second and through fourth quarter of 2023. We have begun to separate Corebridge. And -- but upon deconsolidation, approximately $300 million of the AIG Corporate expenses will move to Life and Retirement. So that's another variable that you need to consider.\n We also gave guidance as we're working through our future state business model, $250 million to $350 million of parent expenses. And then the remaining will be worked through to fit the business model in terms of what we're designing for the future of AIG. We want to make sure that we have a lean model that's not synonymous with expense cutting, but it is how we're going to be in each market, how we face off with our clients and our distribution partners to maximize growth and all the opportunities that present them themselves to AIG and making sure that we have a structure that supports that.\n Sequencing is important. We've been working on a variety of different initiatives that are substantial, and we're performing out all of them, making certain that General Insurance has the capital and support it needs to grow in this market; repositioning some of our businesses, which we covered in my prepared remarks; making sure we complete AIG 200, the operational separation; preparing to do the secondary; advancing Corebridge capital structure; and then making sure that we're working to get this future state business model implemented, but it has to be in that order. And we've given you the guidance. We've done the work. We know that's the savings that we'll achieve.\n Some of that's going to go into the business. And so the business has to get rationalized and leaner in order to be able to absorb more expenses. But our commitment is the $500 million in addition to the guidance that we've given in the other components. And we're highly confident we'll execute on that at the right time, meaning we've got to get these other things further along. And then when we have clear line of sight in terms of separation, we'll be able to execute on the target operating model. Thanks, Brian. Certainly, Validus contributed a meaningful amount to the growth. But look, we bought a lot of retro. It's the first quarter. It's not all property. So each quarter is a bit different in terms of not being able to straight line it.\n Crop Risk Services had low single-digit growth. So that was not a contributor at all in terms of net premium written. We had very strong, as I said, growth in our Specialty business, in Lexington, in our Property, offset a little bit by Financial Lines. But I put the guidance in there because I feel very confident that we're going to have strong growth throughout the year. Even though the quarters are a little bit different, businesses like Europe is heavy 1/1. And we start to have sort of different mix of business over the second, third and fourth. But I feel seeing the pipeline, looking at how you grow, I mean, the first thing I would look at is what's the client retention and how is the new business, what's happening with rate and are we growing in the businesses that we want to. And I think we are checking all the boxes here and see that those businesses have more opportunity in the future, not less. And so I think the growth that you saw in the first quarter, obviously, there's a mix of business, but I would expect to see similar growth throughout the rest of the year. Yes. Thanks, Brian. Yes, we are seeing that. I mean, again, it's early in the second quarter, but views on April. And as we look to the rest of the second quarter, we're seeing Property continue to firm up and getting stronger than it was in the first quarter. So that's something that we're trying to be focused on clients, making sure we're driving value and we have a lot of capital to deploy. So we expect to be trading actively in the second quarter.\n Okay. Well, thank you, everybody. Sorry for the 1-minute hiccup on the microphone, but greatly appreciate you dialing in, and I wish everybody a great day. Thank you."

Now at this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead.\nQuentin McMillan: Thanks very much, Michelle, and good morning. Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC provide details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by applicable securities laws, AIG is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change. Today's remarks may also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at aig.com. Additionally, note that following the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial on June 9, 2024, the historical results of Corebridge for all periods presented are reflected in AIG's condensed consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Finally, today's remarks related to General Insurance results, including key metrics such as net premiums written, underwriting income, margin and net investment income are presented on a comparable basis, which reflects year-over-year comparisons on a constant dollar basis as applicable and adjusted to the sale of Crop Risk Services and the sale of Validus Re. We believe this presentation provides the most useful view of General Insurance results and the go-forward business in light of the substantial changes to the portfolio since 2023. Please refer to Pages 26 through 28 of the earnings presentation for reconciliations of such metrics reported on a comparable basis. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino.\nPeter Zaffino: Good morning and thank you for joining us today to review our third quarter 2024 financial results. Following my remarks, Sabra will provide more detail on the quarter. Then our North America and international leaders, Don Bailey and Jon Hancock will join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge the devastating impact the recent weather events had on our communities, which underscores the difficult reality of changing weather patterns and the frequency and severity of these events. At AIG, our claims teams have been working hard to ensure that we respond quickly. I'm grateful to our colleagues for their commitment to our clients and distribution partners. This is our purpose and it's when our company is needed most. Now let me move to the highlights of our outstanding third quarter performance. We continue to deliver exceptional underwriting results, maintain rigorous expense discipline, execute on our capital management plan and make excellent progress on our strategic priorities. Adjusted after-tax income was $798 million or $1.23 per diluted share, representing a 31% increase in earnings per share year-over-year, driven by strong core earnings growth and disciplined execution of our capital management strategy. Underwriting income for the quarter was $437 million, which included total catastrophe related charges of $417 million. The calendar year combined ratio was 92.6%. Consolidated net investment income on an adjusted pre-tax income basis was $897 million, a 19% increase year-over-year. Other operations, adjusted pre-tax loss was $143 million, an improvement of $135 million or nearly 50% year-over-year. Core operating ROE was 9.2% with core operating equity of $34.5 billion as of September 30, 2024. In the third quarter, we returned approximately $1.8 billion to shareholders through $1.5 billion of stock repurchases and $254 million of dividends. In addition, we repurchased $520 million of common stock in October. We ended the third quarter with a debt-to-total-capital ratio of 17.9%, including AOCI and parent liquidity of $4.2 billion. During my remarks this morning, I will provide information on the following five topics. First, I will review the financial results for our General Insurance business. Second, I will provide observations on the catastrophe market and specifically AIG year-to-date. Third, I will update you on our progress with AIG Next and its impact on other operations. Fourth, I will provide an update on our significant progress in AI and related objectives moving forward. And finally, I'll give more detail on our capital management plan and the path to achieving 10% core ROE. Turning to General Insurance. We had another excellent quarter with strong profitability and growth across our businesses. Gross premiums written for the quarter were $8.6 billion, an increase of 3% from the prior year. Net premiums written for the quarter were $6.4 billion, a 6% increase. Net premiums earned for the quarter were $5.9 billion, a 7% increase with $4.2 billion coming from Global Commercial. The accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 88.3%. We had favorable prior year reserve development of $153 million, a benefit of 2.6 points to the loss ratio. Sabra will provide more detail in her prepared remarks. In Global Commercial, we had 7% net premiums written growth over the prior year quarter, driven by over $1.1 billion of new business, which grew 9% year-over-year. Retention remained at 88%, which is an outstanding outcome. The accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 84.2% and the calendar year combined ratio was 89.9%. The GOE ratio was flat year-over-year, while absorbing over $50 million of expenses that shifted from other operations. In Global Personal, we had 3% net premiums written growth over the prior year quarter, led by 9% new business growth across our Global portfolio. The accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 97.8% and the calendar year combined ratio was 98.8%, both were improvements year-over-year, and we expect this segment to continue to improve its financial performance in 2025. North America Commercial grew net premiums written by 11% year-over-year. We had a closeout transaction in the quarter in our casualty portfolio that benefited overall growth, but negatively impacted the accident year loss ratio. Absent this transaction, our net premiums written growth would have been in the high-single-digits. The businesses that drove growth were casualty at 9%, excluding the closeout transaction, 8% in Glatfelter and 7% in Lexington. Retention in North America was 90% in admitted lines and 78% in Lexington, which is an exceptional outcome for an excess and surplus lines business. New business growth in the quarter was simply outstanding. On a year-over-year basis, we had 22% growth in new business led by Lexington with 24% growth. And the story for Lexington just keeps ongoing. We had over 95,000 new business submissions in the quarter, up 35% year-over-year. Casualty submissions were up over 70%, Western World was up over 30% and property was up over 20%. Also, our financial lines new business was up double-digits. This was due almost exclusively to a rebound in M&A following a slow new business quarter for financial lines in the same period last year. North America Commercial accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 85.1% and the calendar year combined ratio was 95.5%, an exceptional outcome given the significant CAT activity in the quarter. The accident year loss ratio was 61.8% for the quarter, which was an increase of 250 basis points year-over-year and reflected two main variables. First, the closeout transaction in AIGRM that I mentioned earlier, while profitable and incrementally beneficial to the overall combined ratio, it carried a higher loss ratio, which resulted in a 70-basis point headwind. And second, the actual versus expected in the prior year quarter comparison was very favorable as a result of our admitted and wholesale property portfolios experiencing close to 30% rate increases last year that earned in over 2023 and the early part of 2024, creating a 180-basis point headwind. The combined ratio also benefited from a lower expense ratio, reflecting improvement in the GOE ratio. In International Commercial, net premiums written grew 3% year-over-year. Commercial property grew 6% as did Global Specialty, where international specialty grew 10% driven by Energy. Our Talbot business at Lloyd's also grew 6%, driven by 18% growth in the specialty lines, specifically political risk, energy and marine. International retention remained strong at 89%, which was very balanced across the portfolio, led by energy and property, both at 92% and casualty at 91%. International also had very good new business of over $500 million, led by global specialty with 25% new business growth in marine and 40% new business growth in Talbot year-over-year. The International Commercial accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 83.4%, another excellent result. The calendar year combined ratio was 84.3%. Given that the third quarter is usually the most active quarter for natural catastrophes, I want to provide some thoughts on the activity year-to-date and how the evolution of our underwriting and reinsurance strategy has significantly enhanced AIG's performance over time, even in light of this historical increased activity. For the first nine months of the year, preliminary industry estimates of insured losses from natural catastrophes are in excess of $100 billion, which appears to be the new normal. When considering the impact of Hurricane Milton on the industry and the remainder of the fourth quarter, Aon recently published a report that estimated that the 2024 total insured losses for the industry from natural catastrophes will likely exceed $125 billion. When analyzing large single catastrophes, the complexity of determining the initial and ultimate loss is complicated. Modeling firms produce industry loss estimates post event and there are many factors that go into estimating the ultimate losses. It is important to note that no two catastrophes are the same. Property claim services or PCS is a widely used source for independent property loss estimates in the United States. The loss figures that they provide are derived from claims activity and other factors at the time of loss rather than a judgment of the ultimate size of the loss. As a result, the actual scale of total loss is often subject to misinterpretation. Historically, if you look back at major events including Katrina, Superstorm Sandy and Ian, the final report of PCS figures were substantially higher than their original estimates, illustrating the uncertainty around determining ultimates or best estimates for catastrophe losses. At AIG, we've mitigated the impact that weather events have had on our business as reflected in our improved financial performance even as the world has seen more CAT activity. Over the last five years, our losses have dropped dramatically, both in nominal terms and also in terms of the overall market share of the losses. This is a testament to the work we've undertaken to change and evolve our underwriting strategy, reduce volatility and increase the quality of our earnings. If we use 2012 as a reference point, which was a year with meaningful activity, the total insured catastrophe losses on a nominal basis were $65 billion for the industry. That is roughly equivalent to the 20-year average and serves as a useful benchmark. Since 2012, expectations for annual industry catastrophe losses have grown substantially. The average annual industry loss from natural catastrophes from 2017 through 2023 has increased approximately 90% when compared to the average from 2000 to 2016. Since 2017, seven of the last eight years, including the 2024 forecast have had over $100 billion of annual insured losses. It's important to note, against this heightened level of natural catastrophe losses, based on published reports, we estimate approximately 50% of the insured natural catastrophe losses were absorbed in the reinsurance market from 2017 to 2022. However, following the major market reset in 2023, approximately 90% of the losses were retained by the primary insurance companies. And this is a significant change. As I have discussed several times, the work we've done to change AIG's approach to underwriting and reinsurance has resulted in dramatic improvements in our financial performance and balance sheet. Let me give you some specific points to contextualize the magnitude of this impact. Based on AIG's legacy underwriting strategy and reinsurance choices in 2012, AIG posted an initial pre-tax loss of $2 billion from Superstorm Sandy, which represented almost 7% of the estimated $30 billion market loss for that single event. And for the full year 2012, AIG recognized approximately $2.7 billion of losses or approximately 4% of the market losses. Today, AIG is forecasted to be within our catastrophe loss expectations for the full-year or more importantly, less than 1% market share of the forecasted total industry loss for 2024 of over $125 billion. Additionally, it's worth noting that our property portfolio net premiums written are approximately the same amount in 2024 as they were in 2012. However, today, we have 80% lower CAT losses and volatility. And importantly, our year-to-date 2024 commercial property combined ratio is in the low 80s compared to a combined ratio of nearly 120% in 2012. We've completely transformed our business over the past five years, and this is the new AIG. AIG's strategy to manage volatility through our gross underwriting actions and our approach to reinsurance, including our decision to maintain the lowest net retention amongst our Global competitors, has delivered significant benefits for the company and positions us well for the future in an environment with significantly elevated insured loss activity and modeling uncertainty. Let me take a minute to comment on high level expectations for the upcoming January 1 renewal season for property. The significant reset in the property CAT reinsurance market in 2023 means that reinsurers generally have higher attachment points, provide name perils and have significant retro protection and therefore are likely to make an underwriting profit on their global catastrophe portfolios in 2024, given the current loss levels and the benefit of reinstatement premiums. With this expectation of underwriting profit, the overall reinsurance market should remain healthy. Despite the strong capital position of the market, generally speaking, I would expect the market to remain disciplined at January 1, not reducing attachment points and focusing on deploying capital to the insurance companies with higher quality portfolios like AIG. Given that this has become the industry norm, as I mentioned earlier, industry losses from increased frequency and severity will continue to be realized by primary insurers and will not be solved by the reinsurance market in 2025. Let me move on to provide an update on AIG Next, which we launched in early 2024 to further position AIG for the future. Over the past several years, we've been on a journey to simplify the company by weaving the organization together to operate seamlessly across underwriting, actuarial, claims and all of our functional areas with the necessary skills and capabilities to effectively differentiate AIG for the future. In 2025, we expect to fully realize the $500 million in savings from AIG Next. These savings will impact multiple areas across other operations and General Insurance. As part of the AIG Next program, we've established a new definition of parent expense to exclusively reflect costs related to being a global regulated public company and expect those costs to be around $350 million going forward. In the future, costs currently attributed to other operations will either be eliminated or included within the General Insurance results. You can see the impact of this effort already flowing through our income statement as other operations expenses are down nearly $30 million year-over-year or $40 million sequentially. This reduction reflects the expense benefits from AIG Next and the transfer of a portion of these costs to General Insurance GOE. The ability of the businesses to absorb these additional costs with minimal impact to the expense ratio is due in large part to our significant focus on managing expenses. AIG Next has also enabled us to invest in core capabilities and the implementation of strategic innovation initiatives, notably in underwriting, claims and our data, digital and AI strategy. Let me provide you with more detail. Many companies are discussing their data, digital and AI strategies, but what is actually being done varies greatly from company to company. At AIG, we're utilizing GenAI in large language models as digital accelerators and applications that support the innovation journey, but they are not the innovation alone. This is what makes our recently announced collaborative space in Atlanta so unique. It will be the first location in our global footprint where an end-to-end underwriting process will exist from distribution, sales to data insights, underwriting, claims payments and client servicing. This location will allow us to innovate and evolve the end-to-end process, further develop our Agentic GenAI ecosystem, drive role clarity and digitize and modernize our processes. GenAI can produce meaningful gains from reducing manual inputs and driving process efficiencies. However, our GenAI ecosystem is doing much more than that. It integrates proprietary data from multiple sources with data ingestion capabilities to give us better data quality in a fraction of the time. In our early pilots, we've seen data collection and accuracy rates within our underwriting processes improve from levels near 75% to upwards of 90%, while reducing processing time significantly. We're also using our GenAI ecosystem to increase our submission response rate while enabling our underwriters to prioritize the highest value business within our risk appetite. These improvements will help drive growth and operating leverage as we deliver GenAI to our businesses at scale. It will allow our underwriters to spend more time quoting and winning business and less time manually collecting data. Our culture at AIG is one that is deeply rooted in underwriting expertise and excellence. We help clients solve complex risk issues that require judgment and a nuanced understanding of clients' needs, maintaining the underwriter at the center of decision making will continue to be paramount and a key differentiator for us. Our AI initiatives are designed to do just that, deliver better outcomes and drive operating leverage while keeping highly experienced underwriters at the core of the process. I'm now going to turn to capital management, where we continue to execute our balanced disciplined strategy. Our objectives are to preserve strong insurance company capital levels to support organic and potentially inorganic growth, maintain conservative debt leverage ratios, return excess capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends and maintain parent liquidity. We made substantial progress over the last several years to improve the financial strength of AIG. General Insurance is well positioned for sustained profitable growth. This has been a multi-year process that's centered on executing on our underwriting strategy, while increasing profitability and reducing volatility in our portfolio through a better mix of business along with the strategic use of reinsurance. An important result of our improved profitability is our ability to receive ordinary dividends from our operating subsidiaries, which provides consistent and increasing liquidity to the parent company. Year-to-date, we received ordinary dividends or their equivalents of approximately $3 billion from our businesses. Our financial strength is also evidenced by the lower levels of debt on our balance sheet, historically, AIG had one of the highest debt-to-total capital leverage ratios in the industry at over 30%. In 2024, we have reduced debt levels by $1 billion, bringing our debt-to-total capital leverage ratio to 17.9%, including AOCI, amongst the lowest in our peer group, an achievement that requires significant discipline. Through the first nine months of 2024, we returned over $5.5 billion to shareholders through $4.8 billion of common stock repurchases and $765 million of dividends. As we've stated previously, we will continue to execute on our $10 billion share repurchase authorization over the course of 2024 and 2025, subject to market conditions and timing of the closing of pending transactions. The current authorization will bring us within our target share count range of 550 million to 600 million shares. Importantly, our anticipated parent liquidity provides the flexibility to support additional share repurchases, which we will review in 2025. Earlier this year, we increased the cash dividend to shareholders on AIG common stock by 11%. We will continue to review our dividend annually, considering additional increases as appropriate, supported by our increased earnings power. This will be an important focus for us in 2025 and beyond. We ended the third quarter with parent liquidity of $4.2 billion. With the combination of our disciplined capital management, sustained continued underwriting performance and focus on expense management, we expect to deliver a 10% core operating ROE for the full-year 2025. We recognize that with core operating equity of $34.5 billion at the end of the third quarter, parent liquidity, our capital in the insurance company subsidiaries and future proceeds from corporate sell-downs, we have excess capital for the size of the business we are today. We will proactively manage our capital over time to support growth in our business and we will maintain a capital management strategy centered on balance and patience while remaining nimble to execute, should attractive opportunities arise. In summary, I'm very pleased with our outstanding third quarter performance, as we approach year end and plan for 2025, our path forward is clear. We will continue to solidify AIG's position as a global market leader and remain focused on value creation for our customers and shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Sabra.\nSabra Purtill: Thank you, Peter. This morning, I will provide details on third quarter results for General Insurance, net investment income, other operations and capital. Turning to General Insurance. Adjusted pre-tax income or APTI was $1.2 billion. Underwriting income was $437 million, including $411 million of catastrophe losses. Hurricanes Beryl and Helene were the two largest losses in the quarter. Hurricane Milton made landfall on October 9 and therefore, its financial impact will be recognized in the fourth quarter. Peter commented on the complexity of determining ultimates for natural catastrophes. And at this point, we have a very wide range of estimates for modeling firms. Claims activity to date for Milton has been relatively light compared to storms of similar strength and intensity. Our current preliminary loss estimate for Milton is between $175 million and $275 million. The third quarter 2024 accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 88.3%, about 140 basis points higher than last year, principally due to changes in premium mix and reinsurance structure and favorable actual versus expected experience in the third quarter of 2023. We also had one large closeout transaction, which Peter mentioned that increased the consolidated loss ratio by about 40 basis points. Year-to-date, the accident year combined ratio is 88.1%, down 60 basis points from 2023. The accident year loss ratio was 56.4% for the quarter, including the impact of the closeout transaction and 56.4% year-to-date, flat with the first nine months of 2023. We expect the fourth quarter accident year loss ratio as adjusted, will be in line with the first nine months of this year. Turning to prior year development. This quarter, we had $153 million of favorable prior year development, including $34 million from the ADC amortization. During the quarter, we completed detailed valuation reviews or DVRs on almost $22 billion or 47% of our total loss reserves. We reviewed most of the reserves for international in addition to North America property and financial lines. Overall, we had favorable prior year development on short tail lines in global specialty and global commercial property and a modest amount in North America financial lines. This was partially offset by $181 million of adverse development in U.K. and Europe casualty and financial lines on about $8 billion of reserves. This reflects refinements in loss estimates due to recent claims emergence and settlement activity on specific exposures in accident years 2019 and prior, consistent with our reserving philosophy of addressing bad news quickly. In addition, we increased U.S. excess casualty reserves by $72 million due to a large settlement of a legacy mass tort claim also related to accident years 2019 and prior with most of the gross loss and accident years that were ceded to the ADC. We remain very comfortable with the adequacy of our loss reserves, having completed DVRs covering more than 90% of reserves year-to-date and considering the results of our monthly actual versus expected process and other claims diagnostics. While North America Financial Lines had a slight amount of favorable development from accident years 2021 and prior, we did not adjust loss reserves for more recent accident years, which have continued to show favorable indications relative to our books loss assumptions, consistent with our reserving philosophy of giving favorable experience time to mature. Turning to pricing and loss trends. Third quarter experience in Global Commercial Lines was consistent with second quarter 2024 trends. Excluding financial lines and workers' compensation, AIG's Global Commercial pricing, which includes rate and exposure increased 6%, largely in line with loss cost trends. In North America Commercial, which is about half of our global commercial book, pricing excluding financial lines and workers' compensation was up 7% with rate up more than 5%. North America casualty rate increases were strong with Lexington averaging 16% and retail casualty averaging 13%. These are well above our casualty loss cost trends, which as we've previously disclosed are at 10% or higher depending on the line, risk and attachment point. Property rates in North America Retail and Lexington were consistent with second quarter and the underwriting margin remained strong, supported by cumulative rate increases over the past several years and our disciplined underwriting approach, particularly to CAT exposed property. Pricing in International commercial, excluding financial lines was up 4%, in line with loss trend and underwriting profitability remains very strong. International property continued to achieve overall pricing in excess of loss trend. Our global footprint and diverse portfolio enable us to remain agile, focusing on lines of business with attractive risk adjusted returns while maintaining underwriting discipline. We are confident that the overall strength of our portfolio positions us to deliver sustainable underwriting profitability. Turning to investments. Our investment portfolio is of high credit quality, well diversified by asset class and match to our liability duration. The increase in interest rates since 2021 has driven higher portfolio yields even as credit spreads have tightened. Third quarter 2024 net investment income on an APTI basis was $897 million, up 19% from the third quarter of 2023, driven by increased reinvestment rates on fixed maturities, higher short-term investment income, Corebridge dividends and other operations, slightly better private equity returns and lower investment expense. Reinvestment yields on fixed maturities and loans remains above runoff yields, providing positive yield pickup in the quarter. The average new money yield on General Insurance fixed maturities and loans was 60 basis points higher than sales and maturities adjusted for one large sale in the quarter. General Insurance investment income was $773 million, including income on fixed maturities, loans and short-term investments of $718 million and alternative investment income of $43 million. Considering the current interest rate curve, we project fourth quarter General Insurance investment income on fixed maturities, loans and short-term investments to be approximately $710 million due to the impact of floating rate security resets, partially offset by higher reinvestment yields. About 11% of our fixed maturities have monthly or quarterly floating rate resets to SOFR or other short-term market indices, which began to decline in the third quarter. Alternative income is principally from traditional private equity and now includes real estate investment funds that were previously consolidated. These assets are reported on a one quarter lagged basis and based on third quarter market performance, we expect fourth quarter private equity results may be similar to the year-to-date annualized return of 3.5%. Turning to other operations. Adjusted pre-tax loss in the quarter was $143 million, a nearly 50% year-over-year improvement driven by lower GOE and interest expense and higher net investment income, which totaled $125 million in the quarter. Considering both lower short-term rates and projected parent liquidity balances before proceeds from any strategic transactions, short-term investment income could decline in the fourth quarter by about $25 million sequentially. To wrap up the quarter, the balance sheet remains very strong. Book value per share was $71.46 at quarter end, up 4% from June 30, 2024, due to the favorable impact of lower interest rates on AOCI. Book value per share increased 10% from year end 2023. Adjusted book value per share was $73.90, up 2% from June 30 due to reduced shares outstanding and was down 6% from year end 2023 due to different accounting treatment of Corebridge between the two periods. As Peter noted, our debt leverage ratios are very strong. We recently called a $400 million par zero coupon bond, which will close November 22. Core operating ROE, which measures the annualized return on AIG shareholders' equity, excluding the value of Corebridge shares and deferred tax assets, was 9.2% in the quarter and 9.3% year-to-date, reflecting strong General Insurance profitability and capital levels. To conclude, AIG delivered another excellent quarter with significant financial and operational accomplishments. We are confident in our ability to deliver sustained underwriting results and a 10% core operating ROE in 2025, and we look forward to updating you on our progress. With that, I will turn the call back over to Peter.\nPeter Zaffino: Thank you, Sabra. And Michelle, we're ready for our first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is open.\nMeyer Shields: Great. Thanks, and good morning. I want to start with a question about reserves, if I can. You talked about how recent accident years financial lines are emerging better than expected, but you're not booking that yet. Can you talk a little bit about what's happening in the older accident years for, I guess financial lines or casualty, we saw the one-off issues, but I'm wondering more broadly, is there the same sort of theme in the older accident years that could be getting closer to acknowledgment.\nPeter Zaffino: Thanks, Meyer. Good morning. I think Sabra provided quite a bit of detail in her prepared remarks, but Sabra, do you have anything to perhaps give a little bit of context on financial lines?\nSabra Purtill: Yes. And let me just make a few comments. I mean, obviously, we had very strong favorable development in the DVRs this quarter. Consistent with our approach, we have allowed favorable development to -- our favorable experience to mature. And this quarter, particularly on shorter tail lines, we had about $300 million of favorable development. I would just note that this quarter did not include workers' compensation that was done in the third quarter of last year and this year it was done in the second quarter and we'll do it in the second quarter for next year as well. What I would just comment on in terms of the -- I'll talk to the excess casualty first because I know that's been in some focus. The trigger for the action in North America casualty, excess casualty was for a particularly large settlement, growth of reinsurance, which was from very old accident years that were covered by the ADC. Absent this settlement, we would not have made any adjustments in that line because the DVRs for that line are done in the second quarter normally. Turning to financial lines. Let me just note that for the quarter in total, we had post-ADC, the adverse development on financial lines was about $28 million in total. That was driven by the adverse development on U.K. financial lines, which again was an older book with -- related to some specific exposures. We did actually recognize favorable development on the U.S. and international portfolios. And I would note that was for older accident years. The favorable development that we recognized is generally in older years where the experience has matured as the policy form is claims made, but we continue to hold reserves, obviously for those older accident years based on the existing claims or other activity within that book. And we will evaluate again in the third quarter of next year is when we'll do our deep dive on the Global Financial lines portfolio.\nPeter Zaffino: Great. Thanks, Sabra. Meyer, is there a follow-up?\nMeyer Shields: Yes, just a quick one. Peter, you talked a lot about your expectations for a property reinsurance in 2025. And I was hoping for an update on your thought of the appropriate reinsurance program, property reinsurance program for AIG, whether you're thinking of other -- of changing your net exposure?\nPeter Zaffino: I covered a lot in my prepared remarks. Again, I think the industry has become experts on reinsurance pricing. And I expect that the market will be orderly, but I don't expect attachment points are going to come down for the industry. What I was trying to outline in my comments was that most of it is retained by insurance companies today. And so therefore, how we're going to price business going forward, how we're going to understand the frequency of CAT is going to be really important to do as an insurance company and not rely on reinsurance. I don't think we're going to have a material change in our structures. Of course, we have low attachment points. It's very complex and I won't spend a lot of time on it. But we certainly have the balance sheet. We certainly have the risk appetite to take a little bit more net in the event that we want to, but we like having low attachment points on severity and we like having our aggregate that protects us from frequency. And so we manage our net according to our risk appetite. It's within expectations and I would expect us to continue the same strategic philosophy.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, perfect. Thank you so much.\nPeter Zaffino: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open.\nBrian Meredith: Yes. Thank you. Peter, I think we're hearing a little bit from other companies about some improvement in your casualty, particularly E&S, casualty lines and maybe properties' moderating. Wonder if you could give us some color on your view of market conditions and kind of organic growth opportunities here in the fourth quarter and heading into 2025.\nPeter Zaffino: Thanks, Brian. And I'm going to make a comment. I'm going to have Don talk specifically about Lexington. But you're absolutely right. We see opportunities. Our clients, we have such strong retention and they're looking for us to solve risk issues. New business opportunities are very good. The rating environment is very good. So we're cautious, but we think there's opportunities to grow. In the retail casualty space, in multiple segments that we have as well as in E&S, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that our casualty submissions in E&S have been dramatic and we see great growth opportunities there. But Don, maybe you could expand a little bit on the Lexington.\nDon Bailey: Great. And if I could, Peter, just maybe a couple of high-level comments on North America overall and then dig deeper into the Lex growth because they are kind of balanced. So the double-digit growth in North America is balanced growth. We're growing the lines where we see attractive opportunities. And to the point of your question, we're growing in all three channels where we operate, retail, wholesale, alternative. Peter covered some of the North American growth drivers, positive rate of 3% across the portfolio, strong retention of 87%, 90% in the admitted lines and then overall strong new business growth of 22%. On Lexington, we do continue to invest in Lex across all lines. So you'll see Lex continue to show up with more resources, more products, enhanced capabilities going forward. On the third quarter performance, as Peter mentioned, 78% per retention, which is really strong, a 24% increase in new business. And to the point of your question, casualty showed up very well in the E&S space in terms of new business for the quarter. We also saw a 35% increase in submission. So the submission activity continues to be very robust in the E&S space for us. It's generated probably by two things. One is just increasing demand for E&S solutions in general and a flight to quality within E&S. For me personally, when I think about the nature of a wholesale broker today versus when I started in this industry, it's a completely different game. The brokers in the wholesale space operate at a different level today, incredibly well resourced, data driven, effectively deployed technology to drive efficiency, which is critical in wholesale. They're also increasingly being embraced by thousands of independent agents for market access and placement capabilities. So Lex will continue to benefit from that trend in terms of the growth of our book and new business. And Peter, just a couple of data points to close out on E&S, which might be helpful. Today, E&S represents 12% of the $115 billion U.S. P&C industry. In 2018, E&S was 7% of a $50 billion industry. So the pie has gotten considerably larger. And the last data point I'd give you just on distribution. The top five wholesale brokers control over 65% of the growing $115 billion U.S. E&S market. Lex is very well positioned in E&S and very well positioned with these top brokers.\nPeter Zaffino: Great. Thanks, Don. Brian, do you have a follow-up?\nBrian Meredith: Yes, absolutely. A bigger picture question here, Peter. So I think you said that you're expecting a 10% core ROE for 2025. If I look at peer companies, they're kind of trending in the mid to even higher-teens. Yes, what's your kind of longer-term view of kind of ROE aspirations you think you can get to peer ROEs and what do you think it's going to take to get there? Is it more margin improvement, you need to kind of grow acquisitions? Just curious bigger picture, your thoughts there.\nPeter Zaffino: Yes, thanks, Brian. I mean, obviously, we've been talking a lot about the 10% and gave guidance in my prepared remarks about getting to that in 2025. There's a variety of ways in which we can get there. We talked about our combined ratio and the opportunities to improve that. We have such a great underwriting culture and believe that there's lots of opportunities, of course, is market dependent, but our leadership position in the market allows us to remain disciplined and focused on clients. There's -- the other variables, I mean, certainly it's our equity base. We talked about that a little bit and that we believe we can grow into it and that's of course going to generate more earnings opportunity, our net investment income, net premiums written both from a peer growth in terms of strong retention, more new business, but also reinsurance structures, how we look at proportional versus excess of loss and there's ways in which we could have some tailwinds there. Quality of our reserves, which we continue to emphasize, Sabra gave a lot of detail in her prepared remarks and on the answer just now. So we have a lot of confidence there. Capital management actions. We have lots of flexibility subject to when we close Nippon and do other capital market transactions, but there's lots of ways in which from a capital management standpoint allow us to improve. Our ability and track record to successfully manage volatility is very important. And then the last one is our expense management is very disciplined. We are executing on AIG Next. That showed itself in the third quarter. We're not looking to hit the ball out of the park every quarter leading in 2025. We pulled guidance forward that we will be able to get other operations, which was substantially higher to a $350 million lean parent, but also get the expenses either eliminated or into the business without increasing the combined ratio. We're well underway. You can see evidence of that in the third quarter. You'll see more evidence of that in the fourth quarter. So there's a bunch of ways in which I think that we can deliver it. And once we get north of the 10%, we'll provide guidance after that. But thank you.\nBrian Meredith: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Cox with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nRob Cox: Hi, thanks. So I think you guys had previously noted M&A potentially becoming a more meaningful consideration for capital deployment, but you also mentioned revisiting share repurchase guidance as you expect some further liquidity coming in next year. Can you give us an update on your appetite for M&A and how that might help you reach premium leverage objectives quicker than organically?\nPeter Zaffino: Sure, Rob. Thanks. I'll start with the second part. The guidance we gave was that we would do $10 billion of share repurchases in '24 and '25. And so like you can see through the third quarter, we are well underway executing every quarter. We'll have more liquidity coming in. And so that's the priority with the proceeds coming in from Nippon and as I said, other marketed deals and liquidity that we currently have at the parent company. In terms of M&A, we have given ourselves lots of options. We have the financial strength, the financial flexibility to explore inorganic opportunities. We're always looking at ways in which we can add strategic relevance and something that's compelling to AIG. We already have sizable very high-quality businesses in major markets. I mean, you know about the U.S., U.K., Japan, Singapore, Europe. We believe we can grow those businesses organically, but there may be more opportunities to expand inorganically as well. We're going to remain very disciplined, but we are going to look at businesses and opportunities in inorganic that may complement our geographical footprint or product capabilities. There's opportunities maybe to go into spaces that we're not in today, maybe some of the SME or looking at ones that enhance scale of businesses that we already have market leadership that just will accelerate our ability to execute our risk-adjusted returns. So I want to remain very disciplined, very patient, but we have the financial flexibility and the strategic intent of growing.\nRob Cox: Okay, great. Thank you. And as a follow-up, on GOE and General Insurance, it didn't necessarily appear like it decreased as much as the run rate in the first half of the year. So I was just hoping you could discuss kind of the puts and takes in the General Insurance GOE ratio and if this level of improvement is sort of in line with expectations.\nPeter Zaffino: Yes. I was actually quite pleased with the third quarter in GOE because we looked at other operations and the significant improvement that we made there on the GOE line year-over-year and then sequentially, but also we are absorbing a lot of the expenses as they get pushed into the business. And so while the personal insurance year-over-year, the nominal was down and then on commercial, it was slightly up. When you look at putting $50 million more of cost in, the run rate is actually quite attractive. And so we have two major initiatives that have begun to earn in the third quarter, but you'll start to see a lot more of that in the fourth quarter. And as we get to 2025, one was our voluntary early retirement plan that we had announced in the United States. And then we did a restructuring international that just really happened in September. And so you'll start to see more run rate as we get into the fourth quarter and next year. But I'm really pleased with what we did in the third quarter and believe we are showing a lot of sequential improvement in executing to this future state operating model that's going to be much leaner, much simpler and much easier to follow.\nRob Cox: Awesome. Thanks for the color.\nPeter Zaffino: Thanks, Rob.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Scott with Barclays. Your line is open.\nAlex Scott: Hi, good morning. I got a follow-up on just sort of the leverage. And I guess thinking through both leverage down at the operating companies as well as financial leverage. But when I look at the ROE, that seems to be the place where you're under index versus some of the peers, not so much like the actual combined ratio and so forth. So I was interested in, I guess on the debt leverage side, are we at a place where leverage can actually begin to come up as you see opportunities, particularly if you do engage in M&A? And then on the core operations, I mean can you frame at all like how much dry powder you see in terms of being able to lean into some of these opportunities if they get better at casualty?\nPeter Zaffino: So thanks, Alex, for the question on leverage, yes, we have a lot of -- I think it goes into what I said about potential M&A where we've given ourselves a lot of financial flexibility if we find something compelling and attractive. I think the high teens of a leverage to total capital, including AOCI, we're very comfortable with, but absolutely what you were asking is a truth, which is if we find opportunities, can we increase our leverage to be able to execute on that? The answer is yes, we can. And we're going to be very mindful. Obviously, the primary use for proceeds from the Corebridge sell-down will go to share repurchase, but we could continue to work on leverage a little bit to give us even more financial flexibility over time. In terms -- I just want to make sure I understand the second part which is having -- we have a lot of capital. I don't think it's a moment in time and to quantify what we think is excess today, I don't think is something that is overly constructive just because we intend to grow into that. We have shown real opportunities in our business to acquire new business. We had a terrific new business quarter. That momentum continues. And I think look at them, property was probably the one that was sort of slowing down in terms of pricing, but Milton and Helene have changed a lot. And I think that there'll be more flight to quality and there'll be more flexibility for AIG in terms of our ability to drive property growth and on a risk-adjusted basis throughout the world. And so like I think the balanced portfolio opportunities to grow, being able to take more net and being able to hit that 10% ROE is our near-term objective.\nAlex Scott: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe a quick follow-up on personal lines in North America. Can you just give us an update on sort of where we stand with that MGA structure that was put in place and over what period of time you'd expect that combined ratio to come down below 100%?\nPeter Zaffino: Yes. Thank you for the question. I mean, North America personal is in transition as we as we've spoke about. It's hard in the primary high net worth business to affect change fast, but we're making great progress. In the quarter alone, the attritional loss ratio has improved on a meaningful basis, GOEs down. What you're seeing is the acquisition ratio increased quite a bit as we transition to the MGU. Now there's a few things happening that will reverse that in 2025. One is we're at scale, everything is fully put into the MGU and we expect the ceding commission that we paid to go down, I think in a meaningful way. And so the acquisition expense ratio will improve accordingly. I want to talk a little bit about like the strategy that we talked about, which is going into more non-admitted and how that's going to accelerate progress. And we announced it last quarter, but just a couple of statistics that will frame why it's early days, but it's working. The rate environment that we're in on an emitted basis in high net worth, we increased 10% in E&S. It went up 20% on our held book. Our partnership with Ryan Specialty, they're building infrastructure, building sales capacity. We're appointing a lot of retail agents that had no access to AIG or capital for high net worth before our signing up. We expect that to accelerate and continue to grow. In the third quarter, our new business, 50% of it was E&S. Again, we had good growth. I mean, the nominal is not going to move the needle, but we have momentum there. And I would expect in 2025, E&S alone in our strategy will grow the top line 10%. The demand is going to be significant. Our ability to be able to respond to that demand is there with plenty of capacity and an appetite that is going to allow us to improve the risk-adjusted returns and the overall combined ratio.\nAlex Scott: Thank you.\nPeter Zaffino: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question was just on the North America commercial. If I adjust out the one-off -- the one-off in the quarter, right, the -- it came in at 61.1% on an ex-CAT accident year loss ratio basis. You guys are at 61.9% in the first half of the year. So I was just hoping to get more colors on what drove the improvement in the quarter and if that's sustainable into the fourth quarter and 2025.\nPeter Zaffino: This is not going to be like the 91.6% question, is it Elyse? Don, do you want to just give a little bit of insight in terms of what's happening with the loss ratio?\nDon Bailey: So in the North American portfolio this year, we've seen some different movements, Peter. And in some of it, if you look at, we have some one-off movements that certainly moved the loss ratio on this one, which you talked about in your prepared remarks. We talked a little bit about the one-time closeout deal that we did that moved it up. So adverse implications.\nPeter Zaffino: I think, look, and in the commentary, Elyse, we sort of backed out the two -- they weren't headwinds, they were just anomalies relative to what the prior year was. And then the mix of business will continue to change. We see real opportunities to grow in -- in casualty and so those may have a different loss ratio relative to the overall portfolio. We think there's going to be growth opportunities in property based on the market dynamics that are shifting in 2025 and we see that the headwinds on pricing in financial lines are slowing down. We are not going to continue to ride that way down. And on lead, first excess and leading in D&O, I think Don highlighted this is that we've seen a slowdown in the rate reductions. And as we look into 2025, that's all going to stabilize. So I think that mix, if you take out the two things we talked about, which was significant outperformance in property and short tail last year in the third quarter along with the closeout that looks like a loss ratio that's sustainable.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. That's all. Yes, that's my follow-up, I guess, would be, Peter, just building upon that comment as you view the market conditions out over the next year, how do you expect the mix to shift between property and casualty relative to where it is today?\nPeter Zaffino: It's hard to tell because I -- as I mentioned before, I think the property slowdown in terms of rate increases should start to reverse as you get to next year because there's so much net that's been retained by insurance companies that they're not getting the appropriate risk-adjusted returns for the cat loss at the low return periods and the increased frequency and severity. So I think that's going to reverse. Casualty is very strong, and Don went into length on excess and surplus lines. And then also you know we're seeing slowdown in financial lines. And so I think that the overall index, I think is going to sustain, but we'll see when we get into the market and see what happens within particular property, but I'm optimistic, that's why I put some time into it in the prepared remarks that we see a rate environment that's going to improve. I don't know, Jon, maybe like we -- just before the call ends, you can give a little bit of perspective in terms of where you see opportunities as we look to 2025 and international.\nJon Hancock: Yes. Thanks, Peter. And I'll try not to repeat everything you've said, but you're right, the dynamic between the first-party lines and the third-party lines is there across international as well. And we've seen first-party lines, we're still seeing good rate and price on property classes. But for me, bit like Don with Lex, we've got these jaws in Global Specialty and Talbot. Global specialty, we are the number one writer of business around the world. We're number one in energy, we're number one in marine. We're top three in aviation. We're number four in credit. And we're growing that business really well. You referenced in your prepared remarks, Peter, 6% growth in the quarter, but actually huge growth in energy, 25% new business growth in marine in the quarter. We're seeing a different dynamic at the moment where we've grown our international specialty book by 10% in the quarter. Yes, Talbot, again, another 6% growth, but the specialty lines at Talbot, the products at Talbot is really renowned for political risks. Marine and energy growing by 18%. If you look at -- add that to the fact that submissions are 25%, up in both Talbot and specialty, our quote rates are higher, our bind rates are higher. And we've got huge opportunity there and we're the best of the market at it. So we'll still keep seeing the opportunity.\nPeter Zaffino: That's great, Jon. Thank you very much and I agree. Before I finally close, I do want to take a moment to thank Sabra for her many contributions at AIG. Over the past five years, Sabra has always been willing to take on a variety of important complex roles and in each instance, she's always done everything she can to add significant value. So thank you, Sabra, including the most recent role as CFO. We wish her nothing but the best in her future endeavors as we welcome Keith Walsh as our new CFO. I also like to thank all of our colleagues around the world for their continued dedication, commitment and teamwork and execution and I want to thank everybody for joining us today. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

            "name": "Peter Zaffino",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you for joining us today to review our third quarter 2024 financial results. Following my remarks, Sabra will provide more detail on the quarter. Then our North America and international leaders, Don Bailey and Jon Hancock will join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge the devastating impact the recent weather events had on our communities, which underscores the difficult reality of changing weather patterns and the frequency and severity of these events. At AIG, our claims teams have been working hard to ensure that we respond quickly. I'm grateful to our colleagues for their commitment to our clients and distribution partners. This is our purpose and it's when our company is needed most. Now let me move to the highlights of our outstanding third quarter performance. We continue to deliver exceptional underwriting results, maintain rigorous expense discipline, execute on our capital management plan and make excellent progress on our strategic priorities. Adjusted after-tax income was $798 million or $1.23 per diluted share, representing a 31% increase in earnings per share year-over-year, driven by strong core earnings growth and disciplined execution of our capital management strategy. Underwriting income for the quarter was $437 million, which included total catastrophe related charges of $417 million. The calendar year combined ratio was 92.6%. Consolidated net investment income on an adjusted pre-tax income basis was $897 million, a 19% increase year-over-year. Other operations, adjusted pre-tax loss was $143 million, an improvement of $135 million or nearly 50% year-over-year. Core operating ROE was 9.2% with core operating equity of $34.5 billion as of September 30, 2024. In the third quarter, we returned approximately $1.8 billion to shareholders through $1.5 billion of stock repurchases and $254 million of dividends. In addition, we repurchased $520 million of common stock in October. We ended the third quarter with a debt-to-total-capital ratio of 17.9%, including AOCI and parent liquidity of $4.2 billion. During my remarks this morning, I will provide information on the following five topics. First, I will review the financial results for our General Insurance business. Second, I will provide observations on the catastrophe market and specifically AIG year-to-date. Third, I will update you on our progress with AIG Next and its impact on other operations. Fourth, I will provide an update on our significant progress in AI and related objectives moving forward. And finally, I'll give more detail on our capital management plan and the path to achieving 10% core ROE. Turning to General Insurance. We had another excellent quarter with strong profitability and growth across our businesses. Gross premiums written for the quarter were $8.6 billion, an increase of 3% from the prior year. Net premiums written for the quarter were $6.4 billion, a 6% increase. Net premiums earned for the quarter were $5.9 billion, a 7% increase with $4.2 billion coming from Global Commercial. The accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 88.3%. We had favorable prior year reserve development of $153 million, a benefit of 2.6 points to the loss ratio. Sabra will provide more detail in her prepared remarks. In Global Commercial, we had 7% net premiums written growth over the prior year quarter, driven by over $1.1 billion of new business, which grew 9% year-over-year. Retention remained at 88%, which is an outstanding outcome. The accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 84.2% and the calendar year combined ratio was 89.9%. The GOE ratio was flat year-over-year, while absorbing over $50 million of expenses that shifted from other operations. In Global Personal, we had 3% net premiums written growth over the prior year quarter, led by 9% new business growth across our Global portfolio. The accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 97.8% and the calendar year combined ratio was 98.8%, both were improvements year-over-year, and we expect this segment to continue to improve its financial performance in 2025. North America Commercial grew net premiums written by 11% year-over-year. We had a closeout transaction in the quarter in our casualty portfolio that benefited overall growth, but negatively impacted the accident year loss ratio. Absent this transaction, our net premiums written growth would have been in the high-single-digits. The businesses that drove growth were casualty at 9%, excluding the closeout transaction, 8% in Glatfelter and 7% in Lexington. Retention in North America was 90% in admitted lines and 78% in Lexington, which is an exceptional outcome for an excess and surplus lines business. New business growth in the quarter was simply outstanding. On a year-over-year basis, we had 22% growth in new business led by Lexington with 24% growth. And the story for Lexington just keeps ongoing. We had over 95,000 new business submissions in the quarter, up 35% year-over-year. Casualty submissions were up over 70%, Western World was up over 30% and property was up over 20%. Also, our financial lines new business was up double-digits. This was due almost exclusively to a rebound in M&A following a slow new business quarter for financial lines in the same period last year. North America Commercial accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 85.1% and the calendar year combined ratio was 95.5%, an exceptional outcome given the significant CAT activity in the quarter. The accident year loss ratio was 61.8% for the quarter, which was an increase of 250 basis points year-over-year and reflected two main variables. First, the closeout transaction in AIGRM that I mentioned earlier, while profitable and incrementally beneficial to the overall combined ratio, it carried a higher loss ratio, which resulted in a 70-basis point headwind. And second, the actual versus expected in the prior year quarter comparison was very favorable as a result of our admitted and wholesale property portfolios experiencing close to 30% rate increases last year that earned in over 2023 and the early part of 2024, creating a 180-basis point headwind. The combined ratio also benefited from a lower expense ratio, reflecting improvement in the GOE ratio. In International Commercial, net premiums written grew 3% year-over-year. Commercial property grew 6% as did Global Specialty, where international specialty grew 10% driven by Energy. Our Talbot business at Lloyd's also grew 6%, driven by 18% growth in the specialty lines, specifically political risk, energy and marine. International retention remained strong at 89%, which was very balanced across the portfolio, led by energy and property, both at 92% and casualty at 91%. International also had very good new business of over $500 million, led by global specialty with 25% new business growth in marine and 40% new business growth in Talbot year-over-year. The International Commercial accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 83.4%, another excellent result. The calendar year combined ratio was 84.3%. Given that the third quarter is usually the most active quarter for natural catastrophes, I want to provide some thoughts on the activity year-to-date and how the evolution of our underwriting and reinsurance strategy has significantly enhanced AIG's performance over time, even in light of this historical increased activity. For the first nine months of the year, preliminary industry estimates of insured losses from natural catastrophes are in excess of $100 billion, which appears to be the new normal. When considering the impact of Hurricane Milton on the industry and the remainder of the fourth quarter, Aon recently published a report that estimated that the 2024 total insured losses for the industry from natural catastrophes will likely exceed $125 billion. When analyzing large single catastrophes, the complexity of determining the initial and ultimate loss is complicated. Modeling firms produce industry loss estimates post event and there are many factors that go into estimating the ultimate losses. It is important to note that no two catastrophes are the same. Property claim services or PCS is a widely used source for independent property loss estimates in the United States. The loss figures that they provide are derived from claims activity and other factors at the time of loss rather than a judgment of the ultimate size of the loss. As a result, the actual scale of total loss is often subject to misinterpretation. Historically, if you look back at major events including Katrina, Superstorm Sandy and Ian, the final report of PCS figures were substantially higher than their original estimates, illustrating the uncertainty around determining ultimates or best estimates for catastrophe losses. At AIG, we've mitigated the impact that weather events have had on our business as reflected in our improved financial performance even as the world has seen more CAT activity. Over the last five years, our losses have dropped dramatically, both in nominal terms and also in terms of the overall market share of the losses. This is a testament to the work we've undertaken to change and evolve our underwriting strategy, reduce volatility and increase the quality of our earnings. If we use 2012 as a reference point, which was a year with meaningful activity, the total insured catastrophe losses on a nominal basis were $65 billion for the industry. That is roughly equivalent to the 20-year average and serves as a useful benchmark. Since 2012, expectations for annual industry catastrophe losses have grown substantially. The average annual industry loss from natural catastrophes from 2017 through 2023 has increased approximately 90% when compared to the average from 2000 to 2016. Since 2017, seven of the last eight years, including the 2024 forecast have had over $100 billion of annual insured losses. It's important to note, against this heightened level of natural catastrophe losses, based on published reports, we estimate approximately 50% of the insured natural catastrophe losses were absorbed in the reinsurance market from 2017 to 2022. However, following the major market reset in 2023, approximately 90% of the losses were retained by the primary insurance companies. And this is a significant change. As I have discussed several times, the work we've done to change AIG's approach to underwriting and reinsurance has resulted in dramatic improvements in our financial performance and balance sheet. Let me give you some specific points to contextualize the magnitude of this impact. Based on AIG's legacy underwriting strategy and reinsurance choices in 2012, AIG posted an initial pre-tax loss of $2 billion from Superstorm Sandy, which represented almost 7% of the estimated $30 billion market loss for that single event. And for the full year 2012, AIG recognized approximately $2.7 billion of losses or approximately 4% of the market losses. Today, AIG is forecasted to be within our catastrophe loss expectations for the full-year or more importantly, less than 1% market share of the forecasted total industry loss for 2024 of over $125 billion. Additionally, it's worth noting that our property portfolio net premiums written are approximately the same amount in 2024 as they were in 2012. However, today, we have 80% lower CAT losses and volatility. And importantly, our year-to-date 2024 commercial property combined ratio is in the low 80s compared to a combined ratio of nearly 120% in 2012. We've completely transformed our business over the past five years, and this is the new AIG. AIG's strategy to manage volatility through our gross underwriting actions and our approach to reinsurance, including our decision to maintain the lowest net retention amongst our Global competitors, has delivered significant benefits for the company and positions us well for the future in an environment with significantly elevated insured loss activity and modeling uncertainty. Let me take a minute to comment on high level expectations for the upcoming January 1 renewal season for property. The significant reset in the property CAT reinsurance market in 2023 means that reinsurers generally have higher attachment points, provide name perils and have significant retro protection and therefore are likely to make an underwriting profit on their global catastrophe portfolios in 2024, given the current loss levels and the benefit of reinstatement premiums. With this expectation of underwriting profit, the overall reinsurance market should remain healthy. Despite the strong capital position of the market, generally speaking, I would expect the market to remain disciplined at January 1, not reducing attachment points and focusing on deploying capital to the insurance companies with higher quality portfolios like AIG. Given that this has become the industry norm, as I mentioned earlier, industry losses from increased frequency and severity will continue to be realized by primary insurers and will not be solved by the reinsurance market in 2025. Let me move on to provide an update on AIG Next, which we launched in early 2024 to further position AIG for the future. Over the past several years, we've been on a journey to simplify the company by weaving the organization together to operate seamlessly across underwriting, actuarial, claims and all of our functional areas with the necessary skills and capabilities to effectively differentiate AIG for the future. In 2025, we expect to fully realize the $500 million in savings from AIG Next. These savings will impact multiple areas across other operations and General Insurance. As part of the AIG Next program, we've established a new definition of parent expense to exclusively reflect costs related to being a global regulated public company and expect those costs to be around $350 million going forward. In the future, costs currently attributed to other operations will either be eliminated or included within the General Insurance results. You can see the impact of this effort already flowing through our income statement as other operations expenses are down nearly $30 million year-over-year or $40 million sequentially. This reduction reflects the expense benefits from AIG Next and the transfer of a portion of these costs to General Insurance GOE. The ability of the businesses to absorb these additional costs with minimal impact to the expense ratio is due in large part to our significant focus on managing expenses. AIG Next has also enabled us to invest in core capabilities and the implementation of strategic innovation initiatives, notably in underwriting, claims and our data, digital and AI strategy. Let me provide you with more detail. Many companies are discussing their data, digital and AI strategies, but what is actually being done varies greatly from company to company. At AIG, we're utilizing GenAI in large language models as digital accelerators and applications that support the innovation journey, but they are not the innovation alone. This is what makes our recently announced collaborative space in Atlanta so unique. It will be the first location in our global footprint where an end-to-end underwriting process will exist from distribution, sales to data insights, underwriting, claims payments and client servicing. This location will allow us to innovate and evolve the end-to-end process, further develop our Agentic GenAI ecosystem, drive role clarity and digitize and modernize our processes. GenAI can produce meaningful gains from reducing manual inputs and driving process efficiencies. However, our GenAI ecosystem is doing much more than that. It integrates proprietary data from multiple sources with data ingestion capabilities to give us better data quality in a fraction of the time. In our early pilots, we've seen data collection and accuracy rates within our underwriting processes improve from levels near 75% to upwards of 90%, while reducing processing time significantly. We're also using our GenAI ecosystem to increase our submission response rate while enabling our underwriters to prioritize the highest value business within our risk appetite. These improvements will help drive growth and operating leverage as we deliver GenAI to our businesses at scale. It will allow our underwriters to spend more time quoting and winning business and less time manually collecting data. Our culture at AIG is one that is deeply rooted in underwriting expertise and excellence. We help clients solve complex risk issues that require judgment and a nuanced understanding of clients' needs, maintaining the underwriter at the center of decision making will continue to be paramount and a key differentiator for us. Our AI initiatives are designed to do just that, deliver better outcomes and drive operating leverage while keeping highly experienced underwriters at the core of the process. I'm now going to turn to capital management, where we continue to execute our balanced disciplined strategy. Our objectives are to preserve strong insurance company capital levels to support organic and potentially inorganic growth, maintain conservative debt leverage ratios, return excess capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends and maintain parent liquidity. We made substantial progress over the last several years to improve the financial strength of AIG. General Insurance is well positioned for sustained profitable growth. This has been a multi-year process that's centered on executing on our underwriting strategy, while increasing profitability and reducing volatility in our portfolio through a better mix of business along with the strategic use of reinsurance. An important result of our improved profitability is our ability to receive ordinary dividends from our operating subsidiaries, which provides consistent and increasing liquidity to the parent company. Year-to-date, we received ordinary dividends or their equivalents of approximately $3 billion from our businesses. Our financial strength is also evidenced by the lower levels of debt on our balance sheet, historically, AIG had one of the highest debt-to-total capital leverage ratios in the industry at over 30%. In 2024, we have reduced debt levels by $1 billion, bringing our debt-to-total capital leverage ratio to 17.9%, including AOCI, amongst the lowest in our peer group, an achievement that requires significant discipline. Through the first nine months of 2024, we returned over $5.5 billion to shareholders through $4.8 billion of common stock repurchases and $765 million of dividends. As we've stated previously, we will continue to execute on our $10 billion share repurchase authorization over the course of 2024 and 2025, subject to market conditions and timing of the closing of pending transactions. The current authorization will bring us within our target share count range of 550 million to 600 million shares. Importantly, our anticipated parent liquidity provides the flexibility to support additional share repurchases, which we will review in 2025. Earlier this year, we increased the cash dividend to shareholders on AIG common stock by 11%. We will continue to review our dividend annually, considering additional increases as appropriate, supported by our increased earnings power. This will be an important focus for us in 2025 and beyond. We ended the third quarter with parent liquidity of $4.2 billion. With the combination of our disciplined capital management, sustained continued underwriting performance and focus on expense management, we expect to deliver a 10% core operating ROE for the full-year 2025. We recognize that with core operating equity of $34.5 billion at the end of the third quarter, parent liquidity, our capital in the insurance company subsidiaries and future proceeds from corporate sell-downs, we have excess capital for the size of the business we are today. We will proactively manage our capital over time to support growth in our business and we will maintain a capital management strategy centered on balance and patience while remaining nimble to execute, should attractive opportunities arise. In summary, I'm very pleased with our outstanding third quarter performance, as we approach year end and plan for 2025, our path forward is clear. We will continue to solidify AIG's position as a global market leader and remain focused on value creation for our customers and shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Sabra. Thank you, Sabra. And Michelle, we're ready for our first question. Thanks, Meyer. Good morning. I think Sabra provided quite a bit of detail in her prepared remarks, but Sabra, do you have anything to perhaps give a little bit of context on financial lines? Great. Thanks, Sabra. Meyer, is there a follow-up? I covered a lot in my prepared remarks. Again, I think the industry has become experts on reinsurance pricing. And I expect that the market will be orderly, but I don't expect attachment points are going to come down for the industry. What I was trying to outline in my comments was that most of it is retained by insurance companies today. And so therefore, how we're going to price business going forward, how we're going to understand the frequency of CAT is going to be really important to do as an insurance company and not rely on reinsurance. I don't think we're going to have a material change in our structures. Of course, we have low attachment points. It's very complex and I won't spend a lot of time on it. But we certainly have the balance sheet. We certainly have the risk appetite to take a little bit more net in the event that we want to, but we like having low attachment points on severity and we like having our aggregate that protects us from frequency. And so we manage our net according to our risk appetite. It's within expectations and I would expect us to continue the same strategic philosophy. Thank you. Thanks, Brian. And I'm going to make a comment. I'm going to have Don talk specifically about Lexington. But you're absolutely right. We see opportunities. Our clients, we have such strong retention and they're looking for us to solve risk issues. New business opportunities are very good. The rating environment is very good. So we're cautious, but we think there's opportunities to grow. In the retail casualty space, in multiple segments that we have as well as in E&S, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that our casualty submissions in E&S have been dramatic and we see great growth opportunities there. But Don, maybe you could expand a little bit on the Lexington. Great. Thanks, Don. Brian, do you have a follow-up? Yes, thanks, Brian. I mean, obviously, we've been talking a lot about the 10% and gave guidance in my prepared remarks about getting to that in 2025. There's a variety of ways in which we can get there. We talked about our combined ratio and the opportunities to improve that. We have such a great underwriting culture and believe that there's lots of opportunities, of course, is market dependent, but our leadership position in the market allows us to remain disciplined and focused on clients. There's -- the other variables, I mean, certainly it's our equity base. We talked about that a little bit and that we believe we can grow into it and that's of course going to generate more earnings opportunity, our net investment income, net premiums written both from a peer growth in terms of strong retention, more new business, but also reinsurance structures, how we look at proportional versus excess of loss and there's ways in which we could have some tailwinds there. Quality of our reserves, which we continue to emphasize, Sabra gave a lot of detail in her prepared remarks and on the answer just now. So we have a lot of confidence there. Capital management actions. We have lots of flexibility subject to when we close Nippon and do other capital market transactions, but there's lots of ways in which from a capital management standpoint allow us to improve. Our ability and track record to successfully manage volatility is very important. And then the last one is our expense management is very disciplined. We are executing on AIG Next. That showed itself in the third quarter. We're not looking to hit the ball out of the park every quarter leading in 2025. We pulled guidance forward that we will be able to get other operations, which was substantially higher to a $350 million lean parent, but also get the expenses either eliminated or into the business without increasing the combined ratio. We're well underway. You can see evidence of that in the third quarter. You'll see more evidence of that in the fourth quarter. So there's a bunch of ways in which I think that we can deliver it. And once we get north of the 10%, we'll provide guidance after that. But thank you. Sure, Rob. Thanks. I'll start with the second part. The guidance we gave was that we would do $10 billion of share repurchases in '24 and '25. And so like you can see through the third quarter, we are well underway executing every quarter. We'll have more liquidity coming in. And so that's the priority with the proceeds coming in from Nippon and as I said, other marketed deals and liquidity that we currently have at the parent company. In terms of M&A, we have given ourselves lots of options. We have the financial strength, the financial flexibility to explore inorganic opportunities. We're always looking at ways in which we can add strategic relevance and something that's compelling to AIG. We already have sizable very high-quality businesses in major markets. I mean, you know about the U.S., U.K., Japan, Singapore, Europe. We believe we can grow those businesses organically, but there may be more opportunities to expand inorganically as well. We're going to remain very disciplined, but we are going to look at businesses and opportunities in inorganic that may complement our geographical footprint or product capabilities. There's opportunities maybe to go into spaces that we're not in today, maybe some of the SME or looking at ones that enhance scale of businesses that we already have market leadership that just will accelerate our ability to execute our risk-adjusted returns. So I want to remain very disciplined, very patient, but we have the financial flexibility and the strategic intent of growing. Yes. I was actually quite pleased with the third quarter in GOE because we looked at other operations and the significant improvement that we made there on the GOE line year-over-year and then sequentially, but also we are absorbing a lot of the expenses as they get pushed into the business. And so while the personal insurance year-over-year, the nominal was down and then on commercial, it was slightly up. When you look at putting $50 million more of cost in, the run rate is actually quite attractive. And so we have two major initiatives that have begun to earn in the third quarter, but you'll start to see a lot more of that in the fourth quarter. And as we get to 2025, one was our voluntary early retirement plan that we had announced in the United States. And then we did a restructuring international that just really happened in September. And so you'll start to see more run rate as we get into the fourth quarter and next year. But I'm really pleased with what we did in the third quarter and believe we are showing a lot of sequential improvement in executing to this future state operating model that's going to be much leaner, much simpler and much easier to follow. Thanks, Rob. So thanks, Alex, for the question on leverage, yes, we have a lot of -- I think it goes into what I said about potential M&A where we've given ourselves a lot of financial flexibility if we find something compelling and attractive. I think the high teens of a leverage to total capital, including AOCI, we're very comfortable with, but absolutely what you were asking is a truth, which is if we find opportunities, can we increase our leverage to be able to execute on that? The answer is yes, we can. And we're going to be very mindful. Obviously, the primary use for proceeds from the Corebridge sell-down will go to share repurchase, but we could continue to work on leverage a little bit to give us even more financial flexibility over time. In terms -- I just want to make sure I understand the second part which is having -- we have a lot of capital. I don't think it's a moment in time and to quantify what we think is excess today, I don't think is something that is overly constructive just because we intend to grow into that. We have shown real opportunities in our business to acquire new business. We had a terrific new business quarter. That momentum continues. And I think look at them, property was probably the one that was sort of slowing down in terms of pricing, but Milton and Helene have changed a lot. And I think that there'll be more flight to quality and there'll be more flexibility for AIG in terms of our ability to drive property growth and on a risk-adjusted basis throughout the world. And so like I think the balanced portfolio opportunities to grow, being able to take more net and being able to hit that 10% ROE is our near-term objective. Yes. Thank you for the question. I mean, North America personal is in transition as we as we've spoke about. It's hard in the primary high net worth business to affect change fast, but we're making great progress. In the quarter alone, the attritional loss ratio has improved on a meaningful basis, GOEs down. What you're seeing is the acquisition ratio increased quite a bit as we transition to the MGU. Now there's a few things happening that will reverse that in 2025. One is we're at scale, everything is fully put into the MGU and we expect the ceding commission that we paid to go down, I think in a meaningful way. And so the acquisition expense ratio will improve accordingly. I want to talk a little bit about like the strategy that we talked about, which is going into more non-admitted and how that's going to accelerate progress. And we announced it last quarter, but just a couple of statistics that will frame why it's early days, but it's working. The rate environment that we're in on an emitted basis in high net worth, we increased 10% in E&S. It went up 20% on our held book. Our partnership with Ryan Specialty, they're building infrastructure, building sales capacity. We're appointing a lot of retail agents that had no access to AIG or capital for high net worth before our signing up. We expect that to accelerate and continue to grow. In the third quarter, our new business, 50% of it was E&S. Again, we had good growth. I mean, the nominal is not going to move the needle, but we have momentum there. And I would expect in 2025, E&S alone in our strategy will grow the top line 10%. The demand is going to be significant. Our ability to be able to respond to that demand is there with plenty of capacity and an appetite that is going to allow us to improve the risk-adjusted returns and the overall combined ratio. Thank you. This is not going to be like the 91.6% question, is it Elyse? Don, do you want to just give a little bit of insight in terms of what's happening with the loss ratio? I think, look, and in the commentary, Elyse, we sort of backed out the two -- they weren't headwinds, they were just anomalies relative to what the prior year was. And then the mix of business will continue to change. We see real opportunities to grow in -- in casualty and so those may have a different loss ratio relative to the overall portfolio. We think there's going to be growth opportunities in property based on the market dynamics that are shifting in 2025 and we see that the headwinds on pricing in financial lines are slowing down. We are not going to continue to ride that way down. And on lead, first excess and leading in D&O, I think Don highlighted this is that we've seen a slowdown in the rate reductions. And as we look into 2025, that's all going to stabilize. So I think that mix, if you take out the two things we talked about, which was significant outperformance in property and short tail last year in the third quarter along with the closeout that looks like a loss ratio that's sustainable. It's hard to tell because I -- as I mentioned before, I think the property slowdown in terms of rate increases should start to reverse as you get to next year because there's so much net that's been retained by insurance companies that they're not getting the appropriate risk-adjusted returns for the cat loss at the low return periods and the increased frequency and severity. So I think that's going to reverse. Casualty is very strong, and Don went into length on excess and surplus lines. And then also you know we're seeing slowdown in financial lines. And so I think that the overall index, I think is going to sustain, but we'll see when we get into the market and see what happens within particular property, but I'm optimistic, that's why I put some time into it in the prepared remarks that we see a rate environment that's going to improve. I don't know, Jon, maybe like we -- just before the call ends, you can give a little bit of perspective in terms of where you see opportunities as we look to 2025 and international. That's great, Jon. Thank you very much and I agree. Before I finally close, I do want to take a moment to thank Sabra for her many contributions at AIG. Over the past five years, Sabra has always been willing to take on a variety of important complex roles and in each instance, she's always done everything she can to add significant value. So thank you, Sabra, including the most recent role as CFO. We wish her nothing but the best in her future endeavors as we welcome Keith Walsh as our new CFO. I also like to thank all of our colleagues around the world for their continued dedication, commitment and teamwork and execution and I want to thank everybody for joining us today. Have a great day."

            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Peter. And I'll try not to repeat everything you've said, but you're right, the dynamic between the first-party lines and the third-party lines is there across international as well. And we've seen first-party lines, we're still seeing good rate and price on property classes. But for me, bit like Don with Lex, we've got these jaws in Global Specialty and Talbot. Global specialty, we are the number one writer of business around the world. We're number one in energy, we're number one in marine. We're top three in aviation. We're number four in credit. And we're growing that business really well. You referenced in your prepared remarks, Peter, 6% growth in the quarter, but actually huge growth in energy, 25% new business growth in marine in the quarter. We're seeing a different dynamic at the moment where we've grown our international specialty book by 10% in the quarter. Yes, Talbot, again, another 6% growth, but the specialty lines at Talbot, the products at Talbot is really renowned for political risks. Marine and energy growing by 18%. If you look at -- add that to the fact that submissions are 25%, up in both Talbot and specialty, our quote rates are higher, our bind rates are higher. And we've got huge opportunity there and we're the best of the market at it. So we'll still keep seeing the opportunity."

            "name": "Don Bailey",
            "content": "Great. And if I could, Peter, just maybe a couple of high-level comments on North America overall and then dig deeper into the Lex growth because they are kind of balanced. So the double-digit growth in North America is balanced growth. We're growing the lines where we see attractive opportunities. And to the point of your question, we're growing in all three channels where we operate, retail, wholesale, alternative. Peter covered some of the North American growth drivers, positive rate of 3% across the portfolio, strong retention of 87%, 90% in the admitted lines and then overall strong new business growth of 22%. On Lexington, we do continue to invest in Lex across all lines. So you'll see Lex continue to show up with more resources, more products, enhanced capabilities going forward. On the third quarter performance, as Peter mentioned, 78% per retention, which is really strong, a 24% increase in new business. And to the point of your question, casualty showed up very well in the E&S space in terms of new business for the quarter. We also saw a 35% increase in submission. So the submission activity continues to be very robust in the E&S space for us. It's generated probably by two things. One is just increasing demand for E&S solutions in general and a flight to quality within E&S. For me personally, when I think about the nature of a wholesale broker today versus when I started in this industry, it's a completely different game. The brokers in the wholesale space operate at a different level today, incredibly well resourced, data driven, effectively deployed technology to drive efficiency, which is critical in wholesale. They're also increasingly being embraced by thousands of independent agents for market access and placement capabilities. So Lex will continue to benefit from that trend in terms of the growth of our book and new business. And Peter, just a couple of data points to close out on E&S, which might be helpful. Today, E&S represents 12% of the $115 billion U.S. P&C industry. In 2018, E&S was 7% of a $50 billion industry. So the pie has gotten considerably larger. And the last data point I'd give you just on distribution. The top five wholesale brokers control over 65% of the growing $115 billion U.S. E&S market. Lex is very well positioned in E&S and very well positioned with these top brokers. So in the North American portfolio this year, we've seen some different movements, Peter. And in some of it, if you look at, we have some one-off movements that certainly moved the loss ratio on this one, which you talked about in your prepared remarks. We talked a little bit about the one-time closeout deal that we did that moved it up. So adverse implications."
        },
        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Sabra Purtill",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter. This morning, I will provide details on third quarter results for General Insurance, net investment income, other operations and capital. Turning to General Insurance. Adjusted pre-tax income or APTI was $1.2 billion. Underwriting income was $437 million, including $411 million of catastrophe losses. Hurricanes Beryl and Helene were the two largest losses in the quarter. Hurricane Milton made landfall on October 9 and therefore, its financial impact will be recognized in the fourth quarter. Peter commented on the complexity of determining ultimates for natural catastrophes. And at this point, we have a very wide range of estimates for modeling firms. Claims activity to date for Milton has been relatively light compared to storms of similar strength and intensity. Our current preliminary loss estimate for Milton is between $175 million and $275 million. The third quarter 2024 accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 88.3%, about 140 basis points higher than last year, principally due to changes in premium mix and reinsurance structure and favorable actual versus expected experience in the third quarter of 2023. We also had one large closeout transaction, which Peter mentioned that increased the consolidated loss ratio by about 40 basis points. Year-to-date, the accident year combined ratio is 88.1%, down 60 basis points from 2023. The accident year loss ratio was 56.4% for the quarter, including the impact of the closeout transaction and 56.4% year-to-date, flat with the first nine months of 2023. We expect the fourth quarter accident year loss ratio as adjusted, will be in line with the first nine months of this year. Turning to prior year development. This quarter, we had $153 million of favorable prior year development, including $34 million from the ADC amortization. During the quarter, we completed detailed valuation reviews or DVRs on almost $22 billion or 47% of our total loss reserves. We reviewed most of the reserves for international in addition to North America property and financial lines. Overall, we had favorable prior year development on short tail lines in global specialty and global commercial property and a modest amount in North America financial lines. This was partially offset by $181 million of adverse development in U.K. and Europe casualty and financial lines on about $8 billion of reserves. This reflects refinements in loss estimates due to recent claims emergence and settlement activity on specific exposures in accident years 2019 and prior, consistent with our reserving philosophy of addressing bad news quickly. In addition, we increased U.S. excess casualty reserves by $72 million due to a large settlement of a legacy mass tort claim also related to accident years 2019 and prior with most of the gross loss and accident years that were ceded to the ADC. We remain very comfortable with the adequacy of our loss reserves, having completed DVRs covering more than 90% of reserves year-to-date and considering the results of our monthly actual versus expected process and other claims diagnostics. While North America Financial Lines had a slight amount of favorable development from accident years 2021 and prior, we did not adjust loss reserves for more recent accident years, which have continued to show favorable indications relative to our books loss assumptions, consistent with our reserving philosophy of giving favorable experience time to mature. Turning to pricing and loss trends. Third quarter experience in Global Commercial Lines was consistent with second quarter 2024 trends. Excluding financial lines and workers' compensation, AIG's Global Commercial pricing, which includes rate and exposure increased 6%, largely in line with loss cost trends. In North America Commercial, which is about half of our global commercial book, pricing excluding financial lines and workers' compensation was up 7% with rate up more than 5%. North America casualty rate increases were strong with Lexington averaging 16% and retail casualty averaging 13%. These are well above our casualty loss cost trends, which as we've previously disclosed are at 10% or higher depending on the line, risk and attachment point. Property rates in North America Retail and Lexington were consistent with second quarter and the underwriting margin remained strong, supported by cumulative rate increases over the past several years and our disciplined underwriting approach, particularly to CAT exposed property. Pricing in International commercial, excluding financial lines was up 4%, in line with loss trend and underwriting profitability remains very strong. International property continued to achieve overall pricing in excess of loss trend. Our global footprint and diverse portfolio enable us to remain agile, focusing on lines of business with attractive risk adjusted returns while maintaining underwriting discipline. We are confident that the overall strength of our portfolio positions us to deliver sustainable underwriting profitability. Turning to investments. Our investment portfolio is of high credit quality, well diversified by asset class and match to our liability duration. The increase in interest rates since 2021 has driven higher portfolio yields even as credit spreads have tightened. Third quarter 2024 net investment income on an APTI basis was $897 million, up 19% from the third quarter of 2023, driven by increased reinvestment rates on fixed maturities, higher short-term investment income, Corebridge dividends and other operations, slightly better private equity returns and lower investment expense. Reinvestment yields on fixed maturities and loans remains above runoff yields, providing positive yield pickup in the quarter. The average new money yield on General Insurance fixed maturities and loans was 60 basis points higher than sales and maturities adjusted for one large sale in the quarter. General Insurance investment income was $773 million, including income on fixed maturities, loans and short-term investments of $718 million and alternative investment income of $43 million. Considering the current interest rate curve, we project fourth quarter General Insurance investment income on fixed maturities, loans and short-term investments to be approximately $710 million due to the impact of floating rate security resets, partially offset by higher reinvestment yields. About 11% of our fixed maturities have monthly or quarterly floating rate resets to SOFR or other short-term market indices, which began to decline in the third quarter. Alternative income is principally from traditional private equity and now includes real estate investment funds that were previously consolidated. These assets are reported on a one quarter lagged basis and based on third quarter market performance, we expect fourth quarter private equity results may be similar to the year-to-date annualized return of 3.5%. Turning to other operations. Adjusted pre-tax loss in the quarter was $143 million, a nearly 50% year-over-year improvement driven by lower GOE and interest expense and higher net investment income, which totaled $125 million in the quarter. Considering both lower short-term rates and projected parent liquidity balances before proceeds from any strategic transactions, short-term investment income could decline in the fourth quarter by about $25 million sequentially. To wrap up the quarter, the balance sheet remains very strong. Book value per share was $71.46 at quarter end, up 4% from June 30, 2024, due to the favorable impact of lower interest rates on AOCI. Book value per share increased 10% from year end 2023. Adjusted book value per share was $73.90, up 2% from June 30 due to reduced shares outstanding and was down 6% from year end 2023 due to different accounting treatment of Corebridge between the two periods. As Peter noted, our debt leverage ratios are very strong. We recently called a $400 million par zero coupon bond, which will close November 22. Core operating ROE, which measures the annualized return on AIG shareholders' equity, excluding the value of Corebridge shares and deferred tax assets, was 9.2% in the quarter and 9.3% year-to-date, reflecting strong General Insurance profitability and capital levels. To conclude, AIG delivered another excellent quarter with significant financial and operational accomplishments. We are confident in our ability to deliver sustained underwriting results and a 10% core operating ROE in 2025, and we look forward to updating you on our progress. With that, I will turn the call back over to Peter. Yes. And let me just make a few comments. I mean, obviously, we had very strong favorable development in the DVRs this quarter. Consistent with our approach, we have allowed favorable development to -- our favorable experience to mature. And this quarter, particularly on shorter tail lines, we had about $300 million of favorable development. I would just note that this quarter did not include workers' compensation that was done in the third quarter of last year and this year it was done in the second quarter and we'll do it in the second quarter for next year as well. What I would just comment on in terms of the -- I'll talk to the excess casualty first because I know that's been in some focus. The trigger for the action in North America casualty, excess casualty was for a particularly large settlement, growth of reinsurance, which was from very old accident years that were covered by the ADC. Absent this settlement, we would not have made any adjustments in that line because the DVRs for that line are done in the second quarter normally. Turning to financial lines. Let me just note that for the quarter in total, we had post-ADC, the adverse development on financial lines was about $28 million in total. That was driven by the adverse development on U.K. financial lines, which again was an older book with -- related to some specific exposures. We did actually recognize favorable development on the U.S. and international portfolios. And I would note that was for older accident years. The favorable development that we recognized is generally in older years where the experience has matured as the policy form is claims made, but we continue to hold reserves, obviously for those older accident years based on the existing claims or other activity within that book. And we will evaluate again in the third quarter of next year is when we'll do our deep dive on the Global Financial lines portfolio."

Now, at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead.\nQuentin McMillan: Thanks very much, and good morning. Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events, and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC provide details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by applicable securities laws, AIG is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change. Today's remarks may also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at aig.com. Additionally, note that following the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial on June 9, 2024, the historical results of Corebridge for all periods presented, are reflected in AIG's condensed consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Finally, today's remarks related to General Insurance results, including key metrics such as net premiums written, underwriting income and underwriting margin are presented on a comparable basis, which reflects year-over-year comparison on a constant dollar basis as applicable, and adjusted for the sale of Crop Risk Services and the sale of Validus Re. We believe this presentation provides the most useful view of General Insurance results and the go forward business in light of the substantial changes to the portfolio since 2023. Please refer to Pages 29 through 31 of the earnings presentation for reconciliations of such metrics reported on a comparable basis. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino.\nPeter Zaffino: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review our second quarter 2024 financial results. We have transformed AIG and have done the foundational work for the next chapter, and I'm excited to take you through it today. Following my remarks, Sabra will provide more detail on the second quarter. Then, our North America and International leaders, Don Bailey and Jon Hancock will join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Our prepared remarks have a lot of detail, particularly related to our deconsolidation of Corebridge. We intend to provide ample time for Q&A. I want to start with highlights of our outstanding second quarter performance. As Quentin mentioned at the beginning of the call, all figures I will reference today will be on a comparable basis, excluding the impact of Validus Re and Crop Risk Services unless otherwise noted in order to provide a clear view of our underlying performance. Adjusted after tax income was $775 million, or $1.16 per diluted share, representing a 38% increase in earnings per share year-over-year, driven by strong organic growth, a continuation of our very strong underwriting performance, ongoing expense discipline, volatility containment and a decrease in shares outstanding. General Insurance net premiums written grew 7%, led by Global Commercial, which grew over 8%. Underwriting income was $430 million. The underlying underwriting income, excluding catastrophes in prior year development improved $110 million or 17% year-over-year. The calendar year combined ratio was 92.5%, a slight increase of 10 basis points from the prior year. The accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes was 87.6%, a 170 basis point improvement from the prior year. The CAT loss ratio was 5.7%, or $325 million of total catastrophe related losses. Consolidated net investment income on an adjusted pre-tax income basis was $884 million, a 14% increase year-over-year. During the quarter, we returned nearly $2 billion to shareholders through $1.7 billion of stock repurchases, and $261 million of dividends. We ended the second quarter with a total debt to total capital ratio of 18%, including AOCI and we have strong parent liquidity of $5.3 billion. Overall, I'm very pleased with our ability to continue to deliver outstanding financial performance and I'm equally pleased with the progress we're making on multiple strategic initiatives. There's several things I want to cover on this call to give you a sense of where we are now, how we got here, and what the future holds. In addition to walking through our financial results, on today's call, I plan to outline the recently announced transactions for our personal travel business and private client select, provide a quick update on [Technical Difficulty] reinsurance renewals and a market update, discuss our disciplined execution of our capital management strategy and provide an update on AIG Next. I should note that our strong financial results in the quarter were complicated by the complex accounting treatment of deconsolidation. In Sabra's prepared remarks, she will explain the impact to our capital structure, including shareholders' equity, as well as details on the GAAP accounting implications to our financial statements. Before I go further, I want to take a moment to comment on the deconsolidation of Corebridge, which marked a major milestone for both AIG and Corebridge. It's important to reflect on the four year journey, the significant accomplishments along the way and the rationale behind this pivotal decision for AIG. At the height of the pandemic in 2020, we undertook a detailed analysis to explore strategic options to maximize value for AIG shareholders, including evaluating whether to separate our life and retirement business, which would eventually become Corebridge from AIG. In October of 2020, we announced our intention to separate. There were many noteworthy accomplishments along the way, and I'd like to highlight a few. In July of 2021, AIG announced that Blackstone Group would become an anchor investor in the new standalone company with its acquisition of 9.9% of Corebridge. Corebridge also entered into a long-term strategic asset management relationship with Blackstone to manage up to $92.5 billion of assets under management over the subsequent six years. At the end of March of 2022, AIG announced a strategic partnership with BlackRock, where they would manage $150 billion of certain fixed income and privately placed assets, of which $90 billion would come from the Corebridge portfolio. In mid-September of 2022, AIG floated at 12.4% of Corebridge and the largest U.S. IPO of the year, a particularly noteworthy achievement during a time of significant market volatility. During 2023, we executed three marketed deals, reducing our overall ownership to 52% by year end. In 2023, Corebridge divested with considerable strategic and transactional support from AIG, Laya Healthcare and UK Life. These sales generated over $1.2 billion of proceeds for Corebridge investors. In May of 2024, AIG announced it would sell 122 million shares at Corebridge, representing an approximately 20% stake in the company to Nippon Life Insurance Company, one of the most respected life insurance companies in the world, subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions. Lastly, in mid-June of this year, AIG announced it had met the requirements for the deconsolidation of Corebridge for accounting purposes. We remain committed to fully selling down a remaining ownership stake in Corebridge over time, subject to market conditions and other considerations. It's been quite a journey and we have accomplished a tremendous amount. Now let's turn to the travel business. During the quarter, we also announced the sale of our global individual personal travel insurance and assistance business, which is another important strategic step in positioning AIG for the future to further simplify our portfolio. The transaction includes the global Travel Guard insurance business as well as its service companies and infrastructure and excludes our travel insurance businesses in Japan and our AIG joint venture arrangement in India with the Tata Group. AIG will continue to provide corporate group travel coverage through our accident and health business. The annual net premiums written for travel are approximately $750 million, most of which are reported under North America Personal Insurance. The sale is expected to close by the end of 2024, subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions. And last week, we announced another significant transaction involving our high net worth business. As we've discussed in prior quarters, over the course of several years, we've been deliberately transforming our high net worth business to be better positioned for the future. We've done this through a series of strategic actions, including the most recent announcement about entering into a strategic relationship with Ryan Specialty to become our excess and surplus lines distribution partner for high and ultra-high net worth markets through our managing general underwriter, Private Client Select insurance services. We like the business and we're committed to it. We've invested over $100 million in infrastructure and digital capabilities for our high net worth business over the past several years, and we believe the business is well-positioned for the future. We're also committed to delivering solutions and growing our admitted capabilities. As we previously communicated, our plan for the portfolio has been to establish an MGU (ph) with appropriate infrastructure and core foundational capabilities, enable multiple points of distribution and eventually attract more capital resources for the MGU, all while continuing to drive exceptional value for our high net worth clients as we grow the business. AIG will provide exclusive E&S paper in all 50 states through Marbleshore Specialty Insurance Company subject to regulatory approvals. This progress reflects the momentum we've created with expanded capabilities and broader partnerships. Now turning to General Insurance results. Gross premiums written for the quarter were $9.9 billion, an increase of 7% from the prior year. Net premiums written for the quarter were $6.9 billion, a 7% increase from the prior year, with 8% growth from Global Commercial and 5% growth from Global Personal. Global Commercial had an excellent quarter with strong net premiums written growth of 8%, driven by significant new business, impressive retention and continued accident year combined ratio improvement. In North America Commercial, net premiums written grew 10%. Lexington grew 16%, led by wholesale casualty, which grew 35%; Western World, which grew 20%; and wholesale property, which grew 12%. Retail casualty grew 11%, with 21% growth in our risk management business and we had 16% growth in excess casualty, and Captive Solutions grew 30%, driven by new business. In International Commercial, net premiums written grew 6%. Global Specialty grew 8%, led by 18% growth in energy, Talbot grew 12% and retail property grew 11%. In the second quarter, Global Commercial produced record new business of nearly $1.3 billion, which is an 18% increase from the prior year quarter. North America Commercial produced new business of $753 million in the quarter, an increase of 26% year-over-year and an increase of over 60% from the prior quarter. The growth was led by Lexington, which had 31% new business growth year-over-year and 75% new business growth from the first quarter, the highest new business volume of any quarter in my tenure. Lexington also achieved a significant milestone with over $1 billion of gross premiums written this quarter, a 16% increase from the prior year quarter. This is the highest gross premiums written quarter for Lexington since we repositioned the business in 2018. In other businesses, retail casualty new business grew over 40%, led by our risk management business and excess casualty. International Commercial produced new business of $522 million for the quarter, an increase of 9% year-over-year. This growth was led by Global Specialty, which had 17% new business growth, led by energy and marine. Casualty, which had over 30% growth, and property, which had over 10% growth. In addition, Global Commercial had very strong renewal retention. International retention was 89% and North America retention was 87%. Moving on to Global Personal Insurance. Net premiums written grew 5% year-over-year. North America Personal net premiums written increased 8% from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by the high net worth business. International Personal net premiums written increased by 4% year-over-year, driven by growth in personal auto and accident health new business. Shifting to the combined ratio, as I noted earlier, the second quarter General Insurance accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes was 87.6%, a 170 basis point improvement year-over-year, driven by 140 basis point improvement in the expense ratio. In Global Commercial, the second quarter accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes was 83.5%, a 180 basis point improvement. The North America Commercial accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes was 84.7%, a 250 basis point improvement. And the International Commercial accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes was 82.1% or a 130 basis point improvement. The Global Personal accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes was 96.8%, a 130 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter. North America personal improved its accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes to 101.8%, a 530 basis point improvement. International personal improved its accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes by 50 basis points and 94.8%, driven by improvements in the expense ratio. Now I want to shift to provide some context around mid-year reinsurance renewals and recent conditions in the reinsurance market. As we have previously discussed, we purchased the vast majority of our treaty reinsurance at January 1. However, approximately 20% of our overall core reinsurance purchasing occurs in the second quarter. We were able to execute on all of our strategic reinsurance goals this quarter, achieving risk adjusted rate decreases and lowering or maintaining retentions across all of our major purchases. The outlook for the second half of 2024, particularly with respect to natural catastrophes is uncertain. The five leading forecasters are predicting above average hurricane activity for the 2024 season. While there was a lot of positive sentiment across the industry following modest natural CAT loss activity in the first quarter, I've learned over my career to wait until the wind and typhoon seasons are over before declaring how the year will be impacted by natural disasters. It's simply too unpredictable. When reviewing capacity in the market, it's important to analyze the available capacity from the rated market and the alternative capital market. We're all well aware of what happened with rated reinsurers in 2022. On average, they moved attachment points significantly higher to higher return periods and they restricted coverage mostly to name perils. If you were to look at the complementary alternative capital market, it has approximately $110 billion of estimated capital deployed and in many ways, more stated available capital in any individual year over the prior 10 years. However, you need to review what makes up that $110 billion to appreciate the true availability for reinsurance. The CAT bond market and ILW market make up approximately 50% of the alternative capital market, the highest nominal amount of any time in history and those products are accompanied with basis risk and in some cases, meaningful basis risk. Additionally, the collateralized market is back to 2016 levels, which is somewhere between $45 billion to $50 billion of capital. The market is deploying 90% of the collateralized limit as occurrence reinsurance or occurrence retro, leaving less than 10% of the remaining collateralized reinsurance available for aggregate covers. Why do I outline this level of detail? Because we've remain very disciplined and maintained our aggregate cover at the same attachment point and AIG utilizes approximately 50% of the globally available ILS reinsurance aggregate CAT capacity. This purchase protects us from the potential frequency of CAT and allows us to prudently manage volatility. And again, based on my experience, once insurers give up lower occurrence or aggregate attachment points, you simply do not get them back. Further, analyzing industry data from over 150 companies published by AAON between 2013 and 2024, average attachment points went up on an inflation adjusted nominal basis everywhere in the world, in some cases significantly during that period. For example, in Asia, average attachment points increased over 270%, EMEA and the UK over 250%, and in the U.S. over 280%. AIG has structured its treaties to have lower attachment points with less volatility. When examining occurrence attachment points across the world from 2022 to 2024, which is another very good measurement, AIG has maintained or reduced its attaching points, making it the lowest amongst our peer group. For the balance of 2024, we have approximately $95 million remaining on our international aggregate cover, excluding Japan and $270 million on our North America aggregate cover, excluding wind and quake. This is well within our established risk appetite and believe we remain well protected against both the frequency and severity of CAT events. Reinsurance premiums are well embedded in our original pricing and our portfolio for properties performing exceptionally well. Now I will provide a high level summary of our capital management strategy and the milestones we've accomplished. We've made enormous progress executing against our capital management goals in a disciplined manner with a focus on positioning AIG for the future and driving value for our shareholders. We have deployed over $30 billion in cash towards that capital management strategy over the last three years, which has provided AIG with maximum flexibility. To provide context on the magnitude of what we accomplished, there are some key highlights. In 2021, AIG had greater than 850 million shares outstanding and approximately $25 billion of outstanding debt and preferred stock. Using current liquidity and proceeds generated from divestitures and earnings, over the past three years, we repurchased over $13.5 billion of shares, reducing our overall share count by over 200 million shares or approximately 25%. As of June 30, 2024, we have less than 650 million shares outstanding. We expect to further reduce this in the second half of 2024 and in 2025, depending on the timing of the closing of the Nippon Life transaction, subject to regulatory approvals, as well as additional future sell downs of our remaining Corebridge shares subject to market conditions. By the end of 2025, we expect our share count to be in the 550 million to 600 million target range, consistent with the guidance that I provided last quarter, representing a total of $10 billion of share repurchases over the course of 2024 and 2025, subject to market conditions. Since 2021, we paid approximately $3 billion of shareholder dividends. We increased the dividend by more than 10% in each of the last two consecutive years. Additionally, we reduced AIG's debt outstanding from $25 billion to $9.8 billion and have achieved our target debt to capital leverage ratio range of 15% to 20% with a second quarter leverage of 18% versus 27% three years ago. Our insurance company subsidiaries are in a very strong capital position with capital ratios above target ranges, which will enable us to continue to grow profitably without having to contribute additional capital. We ended the second quarter with $5.3 billion of parent liquidity and we continue to explore compelling and strategic inorganic opportunities that are complementary to our current business. As part of positioning AIG for the future, over the past several years, we've been on a journey to simplify AIG. We're weaving the company together to operate seamlessly as one cohesive organization across underwriting, claims and all of our functional areas with the skills and capabilities to compete in the future. As a company, we've completed multiple transformation programs. These efforts, including AIG 200 have resulted in a reduction of our expense base of approximately $1.5 billion since 2018, while investing for the future. For example, over the last two years, we've invested approximately $300 million in data, digital workflow, AI and talent to accelerate our progress. If you look over the past five years, it include technology, end-to-end process workflow and foundational data investments that were part of AIG 200, our investment has been over $1 billion. Also at the beginning of 2024, we formally launched AIG Next to further accelerate the realization of additional operational efficiencies. As part of the AIG Next program, we're redefining our existing retained parent costs to reflect only expenses related to being a global regulated public company such as costs related to corporate governance, enterprise risk management and audit. Our objective is to decrease retained parent cost to $325 million to $350 million, or 1% to 1.5% of net premiums earned going forward. Expenses not defined as parent company costs will be fully embedded within the General Insurance results or they'll be redundant. All of the factors being equal, we would expect our full year 2025 calendar year combined ratio to be the same or lower than the full year 2023 metric on a comparable basis as a result of the actions were taken as part of AIG Next. We originally provided guidance that we would reach the combined ratio as the exit run rate at the end of 2025, and we now believe we can achieve it in the 2025 calendar year. Additionally, while I've not spoken in detail about AI in the past, we've been making substantial progress and I want to provide a high level overview. AIG is advancing its data and digital strategy using artificial intelligence, large language models and data ingestion applications with the objective of increasing underwriting efficiency and augmenting execution capabilities. We've spent considerable time over the past 12 months to 18 months creating a blueprint for the future that we use each of these components together, where each one is integral and connected and we redesign and refine the end-to-end underwriting workflow processes. Our primary objective is to construct an AI powered underwriting portfolio optimization capability that provides faster, more thorough, deeper analysis and improved customer service in quoting, binding and policy issuance by enabling increased underwriting productivity through the automation of manual processes. This will drive more accurate informed decisions by leveraging better data through foundational sources such as broker and agent submissions, and supplemented with validated sources of additional third-party data. We will then combine this enhanced capability with advanced modeling and amplify compute capabilities, underpinning this work is a robust governance framework designed to keep pace with the rapidly evolving global AI regulatory landscape. I will discuss two areas of focus, underwriting efficiency and underwriting management. With underwriting efficiency, we're developing a mechanism using large language models by which submissions are automatically filtered through real-time underwriting guidelines, allowing underwriters more capacity and the ability to assess many more submissions that meet our defined underwriting criteria, objectives and risk appetite. In underwriting management, we're dynamically managing the review of submission data with a disciplined application of underwriting guidelines and portfolio objectives, allowing underwriting leadership to more deeply and accurately analyze market conditions and enabling dynamic adjustments to underwriting guidelines, pricing and limit deployment. As we build our agentic ecosystem, we're using a multi-vendor technology strategy with multiple partners that is designed to evolve over-time. Our platform has been built for flexibility, configurability and adaptability to accommodate current and future technology. This includes the ability to support the expansion of generative AI capabilities for scalability globally across our platform, while keeping the underwriter at the center of decision making. This is just a glimpse into the significant work we've been doing to use generative AI and large language models as part of our overall data and digital strategy. We'll continue to advance these efforts over the remainder of this year and as we enter 2025. In summary, I'm very pleased with our performance in the second quarter and what we've accomplished not only during the quarter, but over the past several years to prepare AIG for a bright future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Sabra.\nSabra Purtill: Thank you, Peter. This morning, I will provide details on AIG's exceptional second quarter financial results with a particular focus on the accounting treatment of Corebridge deconsolidation, General Insurance quarterly financial results, written premium rate trends, other operations, book value per share and ROE. I will begin with Corebridge related activity this quarter and the accounting treatment on AIG's financials. A few key dates to outline. On May 16, we announced the agreement with Nippon Life. Because that sale could close within 12 months of the announcement and reduce our ownership to well below 50%, held for sale accounting and the classification of Corebridge as discontinued operations was triggered for accounting purposes. Next, we sold 30 million shares of Corebridge on May 30, which brought our ownership to 48%. However, it did not trigger deconsolidation accounting, because AIG still had a right to majority representation on the Corebridge Board. On June 9, we raised our right to majority representation and one of our designees resigned from the Corebridge Board triggering deconsolidation accounting as well as the required filing of pro-forma financials with the SEC four days later. Discontinued operations and deconsolidation accounting principles drove significant changes in AIG's financials this quarter. We added a few slides in the investor deck to explain these changes, which I will refer to in my remarks. Let me start with the impact of held for sale and discontinued operations on Slide 15. Held for sale accounting stipulates that when you reach an agreement to sell a business, its financials must be recast in the current period with assets and liabilities each classified in one-line for both sides of the balance sheet. However, since Corebridge was a core business that we fully intend to exit, it also met the accounting criteria for discontinued operations, which requires a recast not just for the current reporting period, but also for past periods. As a result, we reclass Corebridge's assets, liabilities and net income into assets and liabilities of discontinued operations and income or loss from discontinued operations net of income tax in the AIG financials for the second quarter and prior periods. This treatment is reflected on Slide 15. While AIG total assets of $544 billion as of March 31, 2024 is the same as originally reported and following discontinued operations presentation, there is a significant movement within the line items. For example, total investments in cash of $324 billion as originally reported, decreased $88 billion with discontinued operations presentation, with $236 billion of Corebridge investments in cash now included in assets of discontinued operations. The next change in the quarter was deconsolidation, which was triggered on June 9. On the fourth quarter 2023 earnings call, I described the accounting steps related to this principle. Today, I'll walk through those steps with the final numbers. Turning to Slide 16, the first step is the fair valuing of Corebridge's assets and liabilities as of June 9. The net fair value amount was $9.7 billion comprised principally of the $8.6 billion market value of our Corebridge shares at that date and the net fair value of intercompany assets and previously consolidated investment entities. Next, we calculate the difference between the fair value of $9.7 billion and the book value on AIG's balance sheet, which was $6.7 billion. This resulted in net gain on sale of Corebridge of $3.0 billion pre-tax or $2.5 billion after tax. After that, accounting principles require the recognition of $7.2 billion of accumulated other comprehensive loss on AIG's balance sheet, which is unrealized losses on Corebridge's investment portfolio due to higher interest rates. This recognition records a $7.2 billion loss from AOCI in AIG retained earnings by booking it through the loss and discontinued operations in the income statement and then reducing AIG's AOCI on the balance sheet. This does not change shareholders' equity shown on Slide 17. To determine the income statement accounting impact of deconsolidation, the $2.5 billion after tax gain and the $7.2 billion of accumulated other comprehensive loss are added together to calculate the net after tax loss on deconsolidation of $4.7 billion. Finally, the next step is to add Corebridge's net income for the quarter prior to June 9, which was $325 million after tax to the net loss on sale, resulting in a total net loss on discontinued operations of $4.4 billion recorded in AIG's income statement for the quarter. Now, I'll cover the impact on AIG's shareholders' equity, turning to Slide 17, which has a walk of AIG's total equity from the end of March to the end of June. AIG's shareholders' equity was $43.4 billion at March 31, including Corebridge on a consolidated basis. Excluding deconsolidation impacts, the second quarter change in AIG shareholders' equity was a decrease of $1.5 billion, reflecting income from continuing operations of $475 million, offset by $1.7 billion of share repurchases and $261 million of dividends paid. This results in a pro forma AIG shareholders' equity of $41.9 billion before deconsolidation. Then, you layer in the deconsolidation impacts by adding the $2.5 billion after tax gain on sale for total AIG shareholders' equity of $44.4 billion at June 30, 2024 or a $1.1 billion net increase in the quarter, resulting in book value per share of $68.40 at June 30, a 6% increase from March 31. Please note as well that $5.7 billion of non-controlling interest in total equity, which represents the portion of Corebridge equity owned by other shareholders is also eliminated with deconsolidation through the recognition in the net book value calculation of the gain on sale. The last deconsolidation impact is on debt and leverage on Slide 18. Total debt for AIG and Corebridge at March 31, 2024 was $19.2 billion and total equity was $49.1 billion for debt to total capital ratio of 28.1%. With deconsolidation, Corebridge's debt of $9.4 billion and non-controlling interest of $5.7 billion are eliminated on AIG's balance sheet. This results in June 30 balances of $9.8 billion for total debt and $54.3 billion for total capital for a debt to total capital ratio of 18.1%, well within our 15% to 20% target leverage range. We hope this explanation in the slides are helpful in understanding the accounting treatment of Corebridge deconsolidation this quarter. I will now cover second quarter General Insurance and other operations results. Turning to General Insurance, adjusted pre-tax income or APTI was $1.2 billion, up 7% on a comparable basis due to strong underwriting results and higher net investment income. General Insurance net investment income was $746 million, up 10% on a comparable basis due to higher reinvestment rates on fixed maturities and loans. Considering current interest rates and $1.6 billion of General Insurance dividends paid to parent at quarter-end, we expect third quarter General Insurance investment income from fixed maturities, loans and short-term investments of about $700 million. Income on alternatives and other investment assets were $33 million and $52 million respectively in the quarter, up $32 million in total from $44 million and $9 million respectively in second quarter 2023. Second quarter 2024 underwriting income on a comparable basis was $430 million versus $420 million in second quarter last year, driven by lower expenses, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses. Year-to-date, underwriting results have been strong with an accident year loss ratio ex-catastrophes of 56.3%, mainly driven by changes in business mix compared to the prior year. Based on earned premium roll-forward and barring unforeseen significant changes in loss trends, we expect the accident year loss ratio ex-catastrophes will remain strong in the second half of 2024 at approximately the same level as the first half. Turning to natural catastrophes. The industry globally had another quarter of elevated losses with approximately 100 events. For AIG, second quarter catastrophe losses totaled $325 million or 5.7 points on the loss ratio, principally from secondary apparels, including severe convective storms in the United States, floods in the Middle East and Brazil, and hail in Japan with a roughly 50-50 split between North America and International. Our largest loss in the quarter totaled $90 million from exceptionally heavy rains in the UAE. Considering the forecast for hurricane season this year and secondary peril losses year-to-date, we believe that using AIG's last year total catastrophe losses is a good proxy for full year 2024. While actual losses will depend on the size and strength of events, our underwriting standards, limits and reinsurance programs, both occurrence and aggregate will help reduce the net impact of catastrophe frequency and severity on AIG's balance sheet. Nevertheless, on a global basis, the third quarter is usually by far the highest catastrophe quarter with losses averaging 40% to 50% of the total for the year. Turning to reserves, prior year development, net of reinsurance was a favorable $79 million, reflecting the net result from DVRs completed on more than $20 billion of reserves, about 45% of the total in the quarter. Overall, the DVRs, which included U.S. casualty, resulted in net favorable development on workers' compensation and modest net unfavorable development of $30 million on excess casualty, including $66 million for accident year 2021. The 2021 excess casualty reserve charges were for a few large known losses and commercial auto loss trends, reflecting the rebound in auto frequency and severity after the pandemic lockdown in 2020 when frequency was very low. We have not seen this increase in frequency and severity trends in the more recent accident years. Within the casualty and excess casualty books overall, severity trends remain generally consistent with our assumptions. While we see some favorable trends in the 2016 to 2019 accident years, we will continue to allow time for these years to mature. Pricing, which includes rate and exposure for Global Commercial Lines this quarter increased 5%, excluding workers' compensation and financial lines, while our view on loss cost trends have remained stable. In North America Commercial, renewal rates increased 2% in the second quarter or 4% if you exclude workers' compensation and financial lines and the exposure increase was 2%. In International Commercial, overall rate was largely flat or a 1% increase excluding financial lines and the exposure increase was 3% excluding financial lines. We continue to monitor our portfolio very closely and while rate in the second quarter is below trends on certain lines of business, such as property, it is above trend in others. To give more insight on property, North America retail and wholesale property saw rate increases drop below trend in the second quarter, but that's on the back of rate increases in excess of 25% in 2023 and cumulatively in excess of 150% since 2018. International property is about 100% higher. In 2023, our property portfolio had an excellent combined ratio. In North America casualty lines, in particular excess casualty, we continue to get rate in excess of loss trend. We continue to focus on writing business that has attractive returns and while the price adequacy of our portfolio, of course, varies by line, it remains strong overall and within our expectations. Turning to other operations, deconsolidation vastly simplified the income statement. Adjusted pre-tax loss in the quarter was $158 million, a 43% improvement year-over-year, primarily attributable to $68 million in Corebridge dividends and higher short-term investment income. Finally, with deconsolidation, we expect our 2024 adjusted tax rate to be about 24% before discrete items in line with our second quarter. With the deconsolidation of Corebridge this quarter, AIG's income statement and balance sheet are simpler and we no longer have the volatility of life insurance and annuity accounting. With all the changes, we took the opportunity to evaluate our non-GAAP equity metrics, which were established more than a decade ago when AIG was a vastly more complicated conglomerate. The principal change was revising our calculation of adjusted book value to only adjust for investment related accumulated other comprehensive income, which is not within management's control and which will revert to par as bonds approach maturity. Adjusted book value per share was $72.78 per share at June 30, 2024. In addition, we added a core operating shareholders' equity metric, which reflects the equity invested in AIG's go-forward business. It is calculated by subtracting from adjusted book value, the market value of Corebridge stock and GAAP deferred tax assets related to net operating losses and tax credits. Both of these assets have significant value to our shareholders, but contribute little to AATI. We believe this metric is more useful for valuing AIG's global general insurance business and also for measuring our progress towards a 10% plus ROE target. Over time, as we reduce our ownership in Corebridge to zero and monetize the DTA through earnings, core operating book value will become the same as adjusted book value. Core operating book value per share was $53.35 per share at June 30, 2024. To wrap-up, AIG delivered another excellent quarter with significant financial and operational accomplishments in 2024. Achieving the deconsolidation of Corebridge was a major accomplishment this quarter and we had continued strong profitability and growth in our General Insurance business. With our portfolio reshaping now largely behind us, we are intently focused on achieving our 10% plus ROE target driven by strong underwriting and top line growth, expense reduction and capital management. We continue to make progress on this goal with a core operating ROE of 8.9% for the second quarter and 9.3% year-to-date. With that, I will turn the call back over to Peter.\nPeter Zaffino: Great. Thank you, Sabra. Operator, we're ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Zaremski with BMO. Your line is open.\nMichael Zaremski: Hey, great. Good morning. First question on the updated kind of combined ratio trajectory guidance for '25. So loud and clear that you'll be able to kind of hit it a bit sooner. I'm curious if you can kind of, if we focus on the loss ratio, what the guidance implies on a like-for-like basis on the loss ratio? Some of the questions we get continuously around most companies seeing some slippage in their loss ratios given lower levels of reserve releases. I'm curious if that's something that's considered within your loss ratio guidance.\nPeter Zaffino: Thanks, Mike, for the question. The guidance that we've given in terms of what we expect for the full year 2025 does not contemplate any improvement in loss ratio. It's all in the expense ratio. And so we're trying to guide everybody is that all the expenses that exist in other operations will transition into parent, they'll go into the business or they'll be eliminated and that we're not going to be increasing our combined ratios based on the guidance that we gave at the end of '23. So we're not anticipating any caveats on loss ratios to be able to meet that guidance.\nMichael Zaremski: And I guess just I'll stick on this for my follow-up. So given pricing is below loss trend in certain lines like property and understanding that the absolute, maybe this is the answer to the absolute pricing levels are still accretive to the -- to ROE or loss ratio just does it. To the extent, the current pricing environment held, why does it kind of make sense that the loss ratio should be able to kind of stay flattish, and not trying to be negative, just trying to nitpick on the margin?\nPeter Zaffino: No. It's a great question. Let's take North America, for example, because you pointed out property. This quarter in terms of the overall index and rate increases, property was the headwind in that index. In casualty, we achieved mid-single digit to high-single digit rate with like 12% and excess casualty plus 2% in exposure. In Lexington, it was 11% increase in casualty, 12% in health care. So again, above loss cost trends. Property was flat this quarter. But you have to look at what's happened with the property market over the past several years. And if you look at the -- even last year in -- like excess and surplus lines, it was a 34% increase and the retail, it was 30%, that's after four years of double-digit rate increase. So I think -- look, with the low activity in CAT maybe in the first quarter, the cumulative rate increases over time, I mean, the property combined ratio fully loaded with CAT, even with giving a little bit back in the second quarter has an outstanding combined ratio. And if I can get that combined ratio for the rest of my career, I'll take it. I mean, like I don't think there's any deterioration in terms of what our overall index will be. And again, I can't really predict, that's why I kind of went into a little bit more detail about like sort of the CAT market is that we don't know. I mean, like, so property is highly driven by what happens in CAT and underlying inflation. And so I'm not going to predict what happens sort of six quarters from now, but I think we feel really comfortable with the portfolio and its profitability.\nMichael Zaremski: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is open.\nMeyer Shields: Thank you. First question, just I was hoping we can get a general sense of the impact of the sale of the travel insurance on underwriting results in North America Personal\nPeter Zaffino: Hey, Meyer. Good morning. In terms of -- I outlined in my prepared remarks, the premium impact, which is the $750 million on net premiums written. But on the overall combined ratio, it's going to be de minimis in terms of what we would lose within General Insurance once we pro forma it out.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Perfect. Second question, I guess, on the excess casualty, if I understood Sabra's comments correctly, you had favorable development even on that line outside of 2021, which was a weird year. And I was hoping you could sort of break that down for us. I assume that that's older years rather than recent years, but I wanted to confirm that.\nPeter Zaffino: Yeah. I'll hand it over to Sabra. But as you know, and she gave a lot of detail in her prepared remarks, and we reviewed 45% of our total book in the second quarter. And in casualty, just based on what's going on in the global market, we really drilled down on every line of business and every year and went through it in tremendous detail. So Sabra, maybe you can just give a few highlights in terms of that analysis.\nSabra Purtill: Yeah. Sure. And just for everyone's benefit, I'll just start by framing a little bit what we did in the quarter for the DVRs. So this quarter, we evaluated $20.2 billion of reserves for U.S. casualty. That's comprised of 23 separate DVRs and more than 200 different lines of business, and then that aggregates to the five lines that you see on the 10-Q. So the net changes in the quarter were only about $20 million after written premiums, and that was $80 million favorable in workers' comp after the ADC, which has about $8 billion of reserves. It was $22 million unfavorable in excess casualty, which also has about $5 billion of reserves. And then in casualty, it's also about $5 billion reserve for $17 million favorable. In terms of the 2021 accident year, as we've noted on previous calls, we've increased our loss cost trends for 2020 and subsequent years. The adjustments we made in 2021 are from just a combination of known early reported claims that due to their facts and circumstances, we expect to penetrate the excess attachment level, including a rebound in the auto frequency and severity. In 2022 and 2023 accident years, we just have not had that same level of early claims experience, and therefore, we still have a high level of IBNR in the reserves. With respect to the accident year within excess casualty, I would note that while we did have the $66 million of adverse development in accident year 2021, we had $33 million of favorable development excess casualty from accident years prior to 2016, and that's where the delta comes it nets down to closer to the $22 million amount.\nMeyer Shields: Yes. Got it. That's exactly what you needed. Thank you.\nPeter Zaffino: Thank you, Meyer. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Appreciate all the color you guys are providing on the call. My first question, Peter, you said that the full year 2025 calendar year combined ratio would be the same or lower than the full year '23. Since you said comparable basis, I'm assuming you mean ex-Crop and Validus. Can you guys just disclose what that figure is, just so we know what you're setting the '25 baseline out? What was the 2023 adjusted figure?\nPeter Zaffino: 91.6%.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. Thank you. And then my second question is, you also mentioned in your prepared remarks, you said something about exploring inorganic opportunities. Can you just expand what that means? You guys have obviously taken action of divesting of certain businesses. So what would you look at on the expansion side and what criteria would any potential inorganic deals need to meet?\nPeter Zaffino: Thanks, Elyse. I included that in my prepared remarks, just based on the amount of financial flexibility, strategic flexibility that we've created for ourselves. The divestitures have been really about not having like really the businesses that we divest were terrific, and they fit very well with their new owners. But some of them needed scale, like travel and crop. And we wanted to be a little bit less in the volatility business, and therefore, Validus Re was divested. I would think as we look to the future, again, we're going to be very selective, very disciplined. But there are opportunities perhaps where we have existing businesses where we feel as though, we have competitive advantages that having more scale would be helpful. There could be complementary geographies as we look to different parts of internationally, but terrific international business. But there could be places where we want to expand further that give us not only better capabilities within that geography, but also could be very good for our multinational network. There are opportunities to invest further in businesses that we have. Think about AIG TATA in India is a fast-growing large scale business that is an industry leader. And so there's opportunities there as well. So we will use the same criteria, which is to make sure it's disciplined, it's additive, its strategic and it actually furthers and accelerates the progress we can make on an organic basis. And so we will -- again, we'll keep giving updates as there's more relevant information to share.\nElyse Greenspan: Thank you.\nPeter Zaffino: Thanks, Elyse.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Cox with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nRob Cox: Hey, thanks. Just a question on the accident year loss ratio ex-cat guidance for approximately the same level in the back half. Can you help us think a little bit more about what goes into that and where that shakes out on a comparable basis versus the -- I think, over 100 basis points of improvement AIG has reported here in the first half?\nPeter Zaffino: Sure. Thank you, Rob. It's really driven by mix of business. And if you take a look at this year compared to last year on a net premium earned basis, like the commercial and personal insurance businesses are literally identical in terms of its overall contribution to total premium. And then the commercial loss ratio largely stayed flat like a 10 basis point improvement, but largely flat. What happened was the Personal Insurance loss ratio dramatically improved, driven by North America which was well over 400 basis points. And so I think that that's really driving the first six months. And if we look at the back half, I mean, should we see the same thing? I think so. But you've seen all the tremendous new business, the momentum we have. The mix of business could be changed a little bit year-over-year when we look at the back half of the year, but that's really what's driving the improved loss ratio in the first six months. So it's really a true mix of business and also the significant improvement that North America personal is making and we expect them to continue to make.\nRob Cox: Okay. Got it. Thank you. And maybe just a follow-up. The move to kind of put some more capital to work in high net worth, is that driven by a change in sort of the view in underwriting opportunities there or have they always been good for AIG and what kind of drove that decision to double down now?\nPeter Zaffino: The high net worth business had the same issues that the commercial business did, which it had too much TIV and it gets more pronounced in the high net worth business, because it's more dense. And so we needed to shed aggregate for a lot of reasons. One is that we had too much exposure in certain geographies like the world changed with COVID, the pandemic and all the macro factors that affected it. And then also the evolution of more capabilities in the non-admitted market. And so what we decided, and we've been thinking about this for a couple of years, is that build out an admitted platform that is going to be very strong, the right infrastructure and have the ability to grow, but also complement that with the non-admitted market and be able to do that where you have flexibility and form rate and limits and how you can actually respond to client needs. And there's a need. And so what we've been working on is what's the best way to do that, partnering with Ryan Specialty. It's a highly fragmented wholesale market. So nobody has a real strong expertise in high net worth unless you start to build it. And I think Ryan has been doing that. And so getting access to the 40,000 independent agents with a product that's going to be saleable, and we have done such a terrific job in terms of creating opportunity for more aggregate that we want to be able to have both options. And we believe that we'll be able to grow the non-admitted property market just based on the partnership that we just announced recently. So it's always been in the plan, but we didn't want to go out and just say, we're going to do non-admitted and have it a fragmented not strategic approach. And so we believe this is going to give us great opportunities to access the market in a different way.\nRob Cox: Thank you.\nPeter Zaffino: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Ward with Citi. Your line is open.\nMike Ward: Thank you. Good morning. I just had one question and is somewhat related. But overall for the business and including commercial lines, curious how you guys are shifting the culture back to sort of a growth mindset, thinking about all the change that you've executed? And I guess, where are we in that part of the story? And should we think about AIG as potentially being able to grow faster than the market, all equal, just by turning some of the spigots back on?\nPeter Zaffino: Yeah. It's a terrific question, and I happen to have Don Bailey and Jon Hancock here with me. So I'm going to ask them both to comment on North America and international. It's a great question. Don, why don't you start with, how we have actually been very focused on not only retention, but new business in North America.\nDon Bailey: Yeah. Thanks, Peter. And we have definitely pivoted to that growth mindset. Its first important to mention that we were doing this off of transforming the business over the last few years. So we come into the growth with a position of strength regarding underwriting discipline, profitability. You've heard about all that. Regarding the growth, we've been very deliberate and creating more value for our distribution partners and clients than ever before, and we're applying much more rigor in pursuing like targeted risks. All of that is what you start to see showing up in the numbers now. And I can give you a little bit more color. The retention that we're delivering high levels of retention across all of our business. I would also add that we're executing on specific market opportunities, notably retail casualty and Lexington. On the retail casualty side, we are on offense. The discipline in the excess market is a positive for us right now, and we're moving on that. Regarding Lex, the growth there comes from three places. We have strong -- continued strong retention there, new products and new customers. So it's not from bigger limits. I would describe it as healthy, horizontal growth. Regarding the sustainability of it, which I think is important, I can look at some of our Lex submission data and share that with you. Year-to-date submissions at Lex are up 42%, and that's on top of 39% growth through last year through six months. We view this as a clear flight to quality in that space. I should also add that we resourced all of that in advance. So we're well positioned to take advantage of what's coming. And Peter, I'll just say this in closing on my end, we're getting all that growth while achieving outstanding loss ratios in the core business.\nPeter Zaffino: Don, thank you. That was great. Jon, maybe a little bit of context on International.\nJon Hancock: Yeah. I mean, I won't repeat what you've already said, Peter or Don, but I would say, this is still a very good market for us to underwrite in. We've got a really large diverse portfolio across international, gives us access to a huge amount of opportunity, different segments, different geographies, different points in time. So we can reshape and shift the book depending on what we see in each market. Similar themes to Don, this has been very planful. This is not opportunistic growth here. We've been building to this for a long time of a very, very high quality book of business. We start with retaining 89% of what we've worked really hard to build a really strong book. New business submissions are up as well. We're retaining that our own flight to quality as well as the market. Hopefully, we've done the markets flight to quality. A couple of highlights for me. We've got a world-class global specialty business. It's grown 8% in the quarter. And that's driven by some very, very good new business in all of the global specialty segments, especially in marine and energy, where we are recognized world leaders in both. We've grown new business in marine 15% over Q1 last year, especially strong in cargo in the UK and across Europe. Peter, you already referenced the energy, 13% increase in new business year-over-year. And that's in all of our global hubs and all of our products actually. So really, really strong targeted growth with one of our best performing profitability businesses. And I'll just finish on, I'll add in Talbot as well Talbot at Lloyd's another very, very good quarter of growth of 12%. And again, that's driven by targeted growth in specialty lines of marine liability that we grew at 13%, cargo and specie at 16% and upstream energy at 19%. And both of those with the market we've got the pipeline that we've got, we expect to see continued good growth.\nPeter Zaffino: That's great, Jon. Thanks to you and Don for that detail, really helpful. I want to thank everybody for joining us today. I do want to thank our colleagues around the world for their continued dedication, commitment, teamwork and all of their execution. I also want to extend my deep gratitude to Tom Bolt, who's retiring at the end of the year for his many significant contributions to AIG during a very important time and congratulate him on his story career. Tom was instrumental in establishing a global framework for AIG's underwriting standards, governance and structures and alignment with our refined risk appetite and has just been a terrific executive at AIG. So again, thank you for joining us today. Everybody, have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

            "name": "Peter Zaffino",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review our second quarter 2024 financial results. We have transformed AIG and have done the foundational work for the next chapter, and I'm excited to take you through it today. Following my remarks, Sabra will provide more detail on the second quarter. Then, our North America and International leaders, Don Bailey and Jon Hancock will join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Our prepared remarks have a lot of detail, particularly related to our deconsolidation of Corebridge. We intend to provide ample time for Q&A. I want to start with highlights of our outstanding second quarter performance. As Quentin mentioned at the beginning of the call, all figures I will reference today will be on a comparable basis, excluding the impact of Validus Re and Crop Risk Services unless otherwise noted in order to provide a clear view of our underlying performance. Adjusted after tax income was $775 million, or $1.16 per diluted share, representing a 38% increase in earnings per share year-over-year, driven by strong organic growth, a continuation of our very strong underwriting performance, ongoing expense discipline, volatility containment and a decrease in shares outstanding. General Insurance net premiums written grew 7%, led by Global Commercial, which grew over 8%. Underwriting income was $430 million. The underlying underwriting income, excluding catastrophes in prior year development improved $110 million or 17% year-over-year. The calendar year combined ratio was 92.5%, a slight increase of 10 basis points from the prior year. The accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes was 87.6%, a 170 basis point improvement from the prior year. The CAT loss ratio was 5.7%, or $325 million of total catastrophe related losses. Consolidated net investment income on an adjusted pre-tax income basis was $884 million, a 14% increase year-over-year. During the quarter, we returned nearly $2 billion to shareholders through $1.7 billion of stock repurchases, and $261 million of dividends. We ended the second quarter with a total debt to total capital ratio of 18%, including AOCI and we have strong parent liquidity of $5.3 billion. Overall, I'm very pleased with our ability to continue to deliver outstanding financial performance and I'm equally pleased with the progress we're making on multiple strategic initiatives. There's several things I want to cover on this call to give you a sense of where we are now, how we got here, and what the future holds. In addition to walking through our financial results, on today's call, I plan to outline the recently announced transactions for our personal travel business and private client select, provide a quick update on [Technical Difficulty] reinsurance renewals and a market update, discuss our disciplined execution of our capital management strategy and provide an update on AIG Next. I should note that our strong financial results in the quarter were complicated by the complex accounting treatment of deconsolidation. In Sabra's prepared remarks, she will explain the impact to our capital structure, including shareholders' equity, as well as details on the GAAP accounting implications to our financial statements. Before I go further, I want to take a moment to comment on the deconsolidation of Corebridge, which marked a major milestone for both AIG and Corebridge. It's important to reflect on the four year journey, the significant accomplishments along the way and the rationale behind this pivotal decision for AIG. At the height of the pandemic in 2020, we undertook a detailed analysis to explore strategic options to maximize value for AIG shareholders, including evaluating whether to separate our life and retirement business, which would eventually become Corebridge from AIG. In October of 2020, we announced our intention to separate. There were many noteworthy accomplishments along the way, and I'd like to highlight a few. In July of 2021, AIG announced that Blackstone Group would become an anchor investor in the new standalone company with its acquisition of 9.9% of Corebridge. Corebridge also entered into a long-term strategic asset management relationship with Blackstone to manage up to $92.5 billion of assets under management over the subsequent six years. At the end of March of 2022, AIG announced a strategic partnership with BlackRock, where they would manage $150 billion of certain fixed income and privately placed assets, of which $90 billion would come from the Corebridge portfolio. In mid-September of 2022, AIG floated at 12.4% of Corebridge and the largest U.S. IPO of the year, a particularly noteworthy achievement during a time of significant market volatility. During 2023, we executed three marketed deals, reducing our overall ownership to 52% by year end. In 2023, Corebridge divested with considerable strategic and transactional support from AIG, Laya Healthcare and UK Life. These sales generated over $1.2 billion of proceeds for Corebridge investors. In May of 2024, AIG announced it would sell 122 million shares at Corebridge, representing an approximately 20% stake in the company to Nippon Life Insurance Company, one of the most respected life insurance companies in the world, subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions. Lastly, in mid-June of this year, AIG announced it had met the requirements for the deconsolidation of Corebridge for accounting purposes. We remain committed to fully selling down a remaining ownership stake in Corebridge over time, subject to market conditions and other considerations. It's been quite a journey and we have accomplished a tremendous amount. Now let's turn to the travel business. During the quarter, we also announced the sale of our global individual personal travel insurance and assistance business, which is another important strategic step in positioning AIG for the future to further simplify our portfolio. The transaction includes the global Travel Guard insurance business as well as its service companies and infrastructure and excludes our travel insurance businesses in Japan and our AIG joint venture arrangement in India with the Tata Group. AIG will continue to provide corporate group travel coverage through our accident and health business. The annual net premiums written for travel are approximately $750 million, most of which are reported under North America Personal Insurance. The sale is expected to close by the end of 2024, subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions. And last week, we announced another significant transaction involving our high net worth business. As we've discussed in prior quarters, over the course of several years, we've been deliberately transforming our high net worth business to be better positioned for the future. We've done this through a series of strategic actions, including the most recent announcement about entering into a strategic relationship with Ryan Specialty to become our excess and surplus lines distribution partner for high and ultra-high net worth markets through our managing general underwriter, Private Client Select insurance services. We like the business and we're committed to it. We've invested over $100 million in infrastructure and digital capabilities for our high net worth business over the past several years, and we believe the business is well-positioned for the future. We're also committed to delivering solutions and growing our admitted capabilities. As we previously communicated, our plan for the portfolio has been to establish an MGU (ph) with appropriate infrastructure and core foundational capabilities, enable multiple points of distribution and eventually attract more capital resources for the MGU, all while continuing to drive exceptional value for our high net worth clients as we grow the business. AIG will provide exclusive E&S paper in all 50 states through Marbleshore Specialty Insurance Company subject to regulatory approvals. This progress reflects the momentum we've created with expanded capabilities and broader partnerships. Now turning to General Insurance results. Gross premiums written for the quarter were $9.9 billion, an increase of 7% from the prior year. Net premiums written for the quarter were $6.9 billion, a 7% increase from the prior year, with 8% growth from Global Commercial and 5% growth from Global Personal. Global Commercial had an excellent quarter with strong net premiums written growth of 8%, driven by significant new business, impressive retention and continued accident year combined ratio improvement. In North America Commercial, net premiums written grew 10%. Lexington grew 16%, led by wholesale casualty, which grew 35%; Western World, which grew 20%; and wholesale property, which grew 12%. Retail casualty grew 11%, with 21% growth in our risk management business and we had 16% growth in excess casualty, and Captive Solutions grew 30%, driven by new business. In International Commercial, net premiums written grew 6%. Global Specialty grew 8%, led by 18% growth in energy, Talbot grew 12% and retail property grew 11%. In the second quarter, Global Commercial produced record new business of nearly $1.3 billion, which is an 18% increase from the prior year quarter. North America Commercial produced new business of $753 million in the quarter, an increase of 26% year-over-year and an increase of over 60% from the prior quarter. The growth was led by Lexington, which had 31% new business growth year-over-year and 75% new business growth from the first quarter, the highest new business volume of any quarter in my tenure. Lexington also achieved a significant milestone with over $1 billion of gross premiums written this quarter, a 16% increase from the prior year quarter. This is the highest gross premiums written quarter for Lexington since we repositioned the business in 2018. In other businesses, retail casualty new business grew over 40%, led by our risk management business and excess casualty. International Commercial produced new business of $522 million for the quarter, an increase of 9% year-over-year. This growth was led by Global Specialty, which had 17% new business growth, led by energy and marine. Casualty, which had over 30% growth, and property, which had over 10% growth. In addition, Global Commercial had very strong renewal retention. International retention was 89% and North America retention was 87%. Moving on to Global Personal Insurance. Net premiums written grew 5% year-over-year. North America Personal net premiums written increased 8% from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by the high net worth business. International Personal net premiums written increased by 4% year-over-year, driven by growth in personal auto and accident health new business. Shifting to the combined ratio, as I noted earlier, the second quarter General Insurance accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes was 87.6%, a 170 basis point improvement year-over-year, driven by 140 basis point improvement in the expense ratio. In Global Commercial, the second quarter accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes was 83.5%, a 180 basis point improvement. The North America Commercial accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes was 84.7%, a 250 basis point improvement. And the International Commercial accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes was 82.1% or a 130 basis point improvement. The Global Personal accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes was 96.8%, a 130 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter. North America personal improved its accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes to 101.8%, a 530 basis point improvement. International personal improved its accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes by 50 basis points and 94.8%, driven by improvements in the expense ratio. Now I want to shift to provide some context around mid-year reinsurance renewals and recent conditions in the reinsurance market. As we have previously discussed, we purchased the vast majority of our treaty reinsurance at January 1. However, approximately 20% of our overall core reinsurance purchasing occurs in the second quarter. We were able to execute on all of our strategic reinsurance goals this quarter, achieving risk adjusted rate decreases and lowering or maintaining retentions across all of our major purchases. The outlook for the second half of 2024, particularly with respect to natural catastrophes is uncertain. The five leading forecasters are predicting above average hurricane activity for the 2024 season. While there was a lot of positive sentiment across the industry following modest natural CAT loss activity in the first quarter, I've learned over my career to wait until the wind and typhoon seasons are over before declaring how the year will be impacted by natural disasters. It's simply too unpredictable. When reviewing capacity in the market, it's important to analyze the available capacity from the rated market and the alternative capital market. We're all well aware of what happened with rated reinsurers in 2022. On average, they moved attachment points significantly higher to higher return periods and they restricted coverage mostly to name perils. If you were to look at the complementary alternative capital market, it has approximately $110 billion of estimated capital deployed and in many ways, more stated available capital in any individual year over the prior 10 years. However, you need to review what makes up that $110 billion to appreciate the true availability for reinsurance. The CAT bond market and ILW market make up approximately 50% of the alternative capital market, the highest nominal amount of any time in history and those products are accompanied with basis risk and in some cases, meaningful basis risk. Additionally, the collateralized market is back to 2016 levels, which is somewhere between $45 billion to $50 billion of capital. The market is deploying 90% of the collateralized limit as occurrence reinsurance or occurrence retro, leaving less than 10% of the remaining collateralized reinsurance available for aggregate covers. Why do I outline this level of detail? Because we've remain very disciplined and maintained our aggregate cover at the same attachment point and AIG utilizes approximately 50% of the globally available ILS reinsurance aggregate CAT capacity. This purchase protects us from the potential frequency of CAT and allows us to prudently manage volatility. And again, based on my experience, once insurers give up lower occurrence or aggregate attachment points, you simply do not get them back. Further, analyzing industry data from over 150 companies published by AAON between 2013 and 2024, average attachment points went up on an inflation adjusted nominal basis everywhere in the world, in some cases significantly during that period. For example, in Asia, average attachment points increased over 270%, EMEA and the UK over 250%, and in the U.S. over 280%. AIG has structured its treaties to have lower attachment points with less volatility. When examining occurrence attachment points across the world from 2022 to 2024, which is another very good measurement, AIG has maintained or reduced its attaching points, making it the lowest amongst our peer group. For the balance of 2024, we have approximately $95 million remaining on our international aggregate cover, excluding Japan and $270 million on our North America aggregate cover, excluding wind and quake. This is well within our established risk appetite and believe we remain well protected against both the frequency and severity of CAT events. Reinsurance premiums are well embedded in our original pricing and our portfolio for properties performing exceptionally well. Now I will provide a high level summary of our capital management strategy and the milestones we've accomplished. We've made enormous progress executing against our capital management goals in a disciplined manner with a focus on positioning AIG for the future and driving value for our shareholders. We have deployed over $30 billion in cash towards that capital management strategy over the last three years, which has provided AIG with maximum flexibility. To provide context on the magnitude of what we accomplished, there are some key highlights. In 2021, AIG had greater than 850 million shares outstanding and approximately $25 billion of outstanding debt and preferred stock. Using current liquidity and proceeds generated from divestitures and earnings, over the past three years, we repurchased over $13.5 billion of shares, reducing our overall share count by over 200 million shares or approximately 25%. As of June 30, 2024, we have less than 650 million shares outstanding. We expect to further reduce this in the second half of 2024 and in 2025, depending on the timing of the closing of the Nippon Life transaction, subject to regulatory approvals, as well as additional future sell downs of our remaining Corebridge shares subject to market conditions. By the end of 2025, we expect our share count to be in the 550 million to 600 million target range, consistent with the guidance that I provided last quarter, representing a total of $10 billion of share repurchases over the course of 2024 and 2025, subject to market conditions. Since 2021, we paid approximately $3 billion of shareholder dividends. We increased the dividend by more than 10% in each of the last two consecutive years. Additionally, we reduced AIG's debt outstanding from $25 billion to $9.8 billion and have achieved our target debt to capital leverage ratio range of 15% to 20% with a second quarter leverage of 18% versus 27% three years ago. Our insurance company subsidiaries are in a very strong capital position with capital ratios above target ranges, which will enable us to continue to grow profitably without having to contribute additional capital. We ended the second quarter with $5.3 billion of parent liquidity and we continue to explore compelling and strategic inorganic opportunities that are complementary to our current business. As part of positioning AIG for the future, over the past several years, we've been on a journey to simplify AIG. We're weaving the company together to operate seamlessly as one cohesive organization across underwriting, claims and all of our functional areas with the skills and capabilities to compete in the future. As a company, we've completed multiple transformation programs. These efforts, including AIG 200 have resulted in a reduction of our expense base of approximately $1.5 billion since 2018, while investing for the future. For example, over the last two years, we've invested approximately $300 million in data, digital workflow, AI and talent to accelerate our progress. If you look over the past five years, it include technology, end-to-end process workflow and foundational data investments that were part of AIG 200, our investment has been over $1 billion. Also at the beginning of 2024, we formally launched AIG Next to further accelerate the realization of additional operational efficiencies. As part of the AIG Next program, we're redefining our existing retained parent costs to reflect only expenses related to being a global regulated public company such as costs related to corporate governance, enterprise risk management and audit. Our objective is to decrease retained parent cost to $325 million to $350 million, or 1% to 1.5% of net premiums earned going forward. Expenses not defined as parent company costs will be fully embedded within the General Insurance results or they'll be redundant. All of the factors being equal, we would expect our full year 2025 calendar year combined ratio to be the same or lower than the full year 2023 metric on a comparable basis as a result of the actions were taken as part of AIG Next. We originally provided guidance that we would reach the combined ratio as the exit run rate at the end of 2025, and we now believe we can achieve it in the 2025 calendar year. Additionally, while I've not spoken in detail about AI in the past, we've been making substantial progress and I want to provide a high level overview. AIG is advancing its data and digital strategy using artificial intelligence, large language models and data ingestion applications with the objective of increasing underwriting efficiency and augmenting execution capabilities. We've spent considerable time over the past 12 months to 18 months creating a blueprint for the future that we use each of these components together, where each one is integral and connected and we redesign and refine the end-to-end underwriting workflow processes. Our primary objective is to construct an AI powered underwriting portfolio optimization capability that provides faster, more thorough, deeper analysis and improved customer service in quoting, binding and policy issuance by enabling increased underwriting productivity through the automation of manual processes. This will drive more accurate informed decisions by leveraging better data through foundational sources such as broker and agent submissions, and supplemented with validated sources of additional third-party data. We will then combine this enhanced capability with advanced modeling and amplify compute capabilities, underpinning this work is a robust governance framework designed to keep pace with the rapidly evolving global AI regulatory landscape. I will discuss two areas of focus, underwriting efficiency and underwriting management. With underwriting efficiency, we're developing a mechanism using large language models by which submissions are automatically filtered through real-time underwriting guidelines, allowing underwriters more capacity and the ability to assess many more submissions that meet our defined underwriting criteria, objectives and risk appetite. In underwriting management, we're dynamically managing the review of submission data with a disciplined application of underwriting guidelines and portfolio objectives, allowing underwriting leadership to more deeply and accurately analyze market conditions and enabling dynamic adjustments to underwriting guidelines, pricing and limit deployment. As we build our agentic ecosystem, we're using a multi-vendor technology strategy with multiple partners that is designed to evolve over-time. Our platform has been built for flexibility, configurability and adaptability to accommodate current and future technology. This includes the ability to support the expansion of generative AI capabilities for scalability globally across our platform, while keeping the underwriter at the center of decision making. This is just a glimpse into the significant work we've been doing to use generative AI and large language models as part of our overall data and digital strategy. We'll continue to advance these efforts over the remainder of this year and as we enter 2025. In summary, I'm very pleased with our performance in the second quarter and what we've accomplished not only during the quarter, but over the past several years to prepare AIG for a bright future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Sabra. Great. Thank you, Sabra. Operator, we're ready for questions. Thanks, Mike, for the question. The guidance that we've given in terms of what we expect for the full year 2025 does not contemplate any improvement in loss ratio. It's all in the expense ratio. And so we're trying to guide everybody is that all the expenses that exist in other operations will transition into parent, they'll go into the business or they'll be eliminated and that we're not going to be increasing our combined ratios based on the guidance that we gave at the end of '23. So we're not anticipating any caveats on loss ratios to be able to meet that guidance. No. It's a great question. Let's take North America, for example, because you pointed out property. This quarter in terms of the overall index and rate increases, property was the headwind in that index. In casualty, we achieved mid-single digit to high-single digit rate with like 12% and excess casualty plus 2% in exposure. In Lexington, it was 11% increase in casualty, 12% in health care. So again, above loss cost trends. Property was flat this quarter. But you have to look at what's happened with the property market over the past several years. And if you look at the -- even last year in -- like excess and surplus lines, it was a 34% increase and the retail, it was 30%, that's after four years of double-digit rate increase. So I think -- look, with the low activity in CAT maybe in the first quarter, the cumulative rate increases over time, I mean, the property combined ratio fully loaded with CAT, even with giving a little bit back in the second quarter has an outstanding combined ratio. And if I can get that combined ratio for the rest of my career, I'll take it. I mean, like I don't think there's any deterioration in terms of what our overall index will be. And again, I can't really predict, that's why I kind of went into a little bit more detail about like sort of the CAT market is that we don't know. I mean, like, so property is highly driven by what happens in CAT and underlying inflation. And so I'm not going to predict what happens sort of six quarters from now, but I think we feel really comfortable with the portfolio and its profitability. Hey, Meyer. Good morning. In terms of -- I outlined in my prepared remarks, the premium impact, which is the $750 million on net premiums written. But on the overall combined ratio, it's going to be de minimis in terms of what we would lose within General Insurance once we pro forma it out. Yeah. I'll hand it over to Sabra. But as you know, and she gave a lot of detail in her prepared remarks, and we reviewed 45% of our total book in the second quarter. And in casualty, just based on what's going on in the global market, we really drilled down on every line of business and every year and went through it in tremendous detail. So Sabra, maybe you can just give a few highlights in terms of that analysis. Thank you, Meyer. Next question, please. 91.6%. Thanks, Elyse. I included that in my prepared remarks, just based on the amount of financial flexibility, strategic flexibility that we've created for ourselves. The divestitures have been really about not having like really the businesses that we divest were terrific, and they fit very well with their new owners. But some of them needed scale, like travel and crop. And we wanted to be a little bit less in the volatility business, and therefore, Validus Re was divested. I would think as we look to the future, again, we're going to be very selective, very disciplined. But there are opportunities perhaps where we have existing businesses where we feel as though, we have competitive advantages that having more scale would be helpful. There could be complementary geographies as we look to different parts of internationally, but terrific international business. But there could be places where we want to expand further that give us not only better capabilities within that geography, but also could be very good for our multinational network. There are opportunities to invest further in businesses that we have. Think about AIG TATA in India is a fast-growing large scale business that is an industry leader. And so there's opportunities there as well. So we will use the same criteria, which is to make sure it's disciplined, it's additive, its strategic and it actually furthers and accelerates the progress we can make on an organic basis. And so we will -- again, we'll keep giving updates as there's more relevant information to share. Thanks, Elyse. Sure. Thank you, Rob. It's really driven by mix of business. And if you take a look at this year compared to last year on a net premium earned basis, like the commercial and personal insurance businesses are literally identical in terms of its overall contribution to total premium. And then the commercial loss ratio largely stayed flat like a 10 basis point improvement, but largely flat. What happened was the Personal Insurance loss ratio dramatically improved, driven by North America which was well over 400 basis points. And so I think that that's really driving the first six months. And if we look at the back half, I mean, should we see the same thing? I think so. But you've seen all the tremendous new business, the momentum we have. The mix of business could be changed a little bit year-over-year when we look at the back half of the year, but that's really what's driving the improved loss ratio in the first six months. So it's really a true mix of business and also the significant improvement that North America personal is making and we expect them to continue to make. The high net worth business had the same issues that the commercial business did, which it had too much TIV and it gets more pronounced in the high net worth business, because it's more dense. And so we needed to shed aggregate for a lot of reasons. One is that we had too much exposure in certain geographies like the world changed with COVID, the pandemic and all the macro factors that affected it. And then also the evolution of more capabilities in the non-admitted market. And so what we decided, and we've been thinking about this for a couple of years, is that build out an admitted platform that is going to be very strong, the right infrastructure and have the ability to grow, but also complement that with the non-admitted market and be able to do that where you have flexibility and form rate and limits and how you can actually respond to client needs. And there's a need. And so what we've been working on is what's the best way to do that, partnering with Ryan Specialty. It's a highly fragmented wholesale market. So nobody has a real strong expertise in high net worth unless you start to build it. And I think Ryan has been doing that. And so getting access to the 40,000 independent agents with a product that's going to be saleable, and we have done such a terrific job in terms of creating opportunity for more aggregate that we want to be able to have both options. And we believe that we'll be able to grow the non-admitted property market just based on the partnership that we just announced recently. So it's always been in the plan, but we didn't want to go out and just say, we're going to do non-admitted and have it a fragmented not strategic approach. And so we believe this is going to give us great opportunities to access the market in a different way. Thank you. Yeah. It's a terrific question, and I happen to have Don Bailey and Jon Hancock here with me. So I'm going to ask them both to comment on North America and international. It's a great question. Don, why don't you start with, how we have actually been very focused on not only retention, but new business in North America. Don, thank you. That was great. Jon, maybe a little bit of context on International. That's great, Jon. Thanks to you and Don for that detail, really helpful. I want to thank everybody for joining us today. I do want to thank our colleagues around the world for their continued dedication, commitment, teamwork and all of their execution. I also want to extend my deep gratitude to Tom Bolt, who's retiring at the end of the year for his many significant contributions to AIG during a very important time and congratulate him on his story career. Tom was instrumental in establishing a global framework for AIG's underwriting standards, governance and structures and alignment with our refined risk appetite and has just been a terrific executive at AIG. So again, thank you for joining us today. Everybody, have a great day."

            "content": "Yeah. I mean, I won't repeat what you've already said, Peter or Don, but I would say, this is still a very good market for us to underwrite in. We've got a really large diverse portfolio across international, gives us access to a huge amount of opportunity, different segments, different geographies, different points in time. So we can reshape and shift the book depending on what we see in each market. Similar themes to Don, this has been very planful. This is not opportunistic growth here. We've been building to this for a long time of a very, very high quality book of business. We start with retaining 89% of what we've worked really hard to build a really strong book. New business submissions are up as well. We're retaining that our own flight to quality as well as the market. Hopefully, we've done the markets flight to quality. A couple of highlights for me. We've got a world-class global specialty business. It's grown 8% in the quarter. And that's driven by some very, very good new business in all of the global specialty segments, especially in marine and energy, where we are recognized world leaders in both. We've grown new business in marine 15% over Q1 last year, especially strong in cargo in the UK and across Europe. Peter, you already referenced the energy, 13% increase in new business year-over-year. And that's in all of our global hubs and all of our products actually. So really, really strong targeted growth with one of our best performing profitability businesses. And I'll just finish on, I'll add in Talbot as well Talbot at Lloyd's another very, very good quarter of growth of 12%. And again, that's driven by targeted growth in specialty lines of marine liability that we grew at 13%, cargo and specie at 16% and upstream energy at 19%. And both of those with the market we've got the pipeline that we've got, we expect to see continued good growth."

            "name": "Don Bailey",
            "content": "Yeah. Thanks, Peter. And we have definitely pivoted to that growth mindset. Its first important to mention that we were doing this off of transforming the business over the last few years. So we come into the growth with a position of strength regarding underwriting discipline, profitability. You've heard about all that. Regarding the growth, we've been very deliberate and creating more value for our distribution partners and clients than ever before, and we're applying much more rigor in pursuing like targeted risks. All of that is what you start to see showing up in the numbers now. And I can give you a little bit more color. The retention that we're delivering high levels of retention across all of our business. I would also add that we're executing on specific market opportunities, notably retail casualty and Lexington. On the retail casualty side, we are on offense. The discipline in the excess market is a positive for us right now, and we're moving on that. Regarding Lex, the growth there comes from three places. We have strong -- continued strong retention there, new products and new customers. So it's not from bigger limits. I would describe it as healthy, horizontal growth. Regarding the sustainability of it, which I think is important, I can look at some of our Lex submission data and share that with you. Year-to-date submissions at Lex are up 42%, and that's on top of 39% growth through last year through six months. We view this as a clear flight to quality in that space. I should also add that we resourced all of that in advance. So we're well positioned to take advantage of what's coming. And Peter, I'll just say this in closing on my end, we're getting all that growth while achieving outstanding loss ratios in the core business."

            "name": "Sabra Purtill",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter. This morning, I will provide details on AIG's exceptional second quarter financial results with a particular focus on the accounting treatment of Corebridge deconsolidation, General Insurance quarterly financial results, written premium rate trends, other operations, book value per share and ROE. I will begin with Corebridge related activity this quarter and the accounting treatment on AIG's financials. A few key dates to outline. On May 16, we announced the agreement with Nippon Life. Because that sale could close within 12 months of the announcement and reduce our ownership to well below 50%, held for sale accounting and the classification of Corebridge as discontinued operations was triggered for accounting purposes. Next, we sold 30 million shares of Corebridge on May 30, which brought our ownership to 48%. However, it did not trigger deconsolidation accounting, because AIG still had a right to majority representation on the Corebridge Board. On June 9, we raised our right to majority representation and one of our designees resigned from the Corebridge Board triggering deconsolidation accounting as well as the required filing of pro-forma financials with the SEC four days later. Discontinued operations and deconsolidation accounting principles drove significant changes in AIG's financials this quarter. We added a few slides in the investor deck to explain these changes, which I will refer to in my remarks. Let me start with the impact of held for sale and discontinued operations on Slide 15. Held for sale accounting stipulates that when you reach an agreement to sell a business, its financials must be recast in the current period with assets and liabilities each classified in one-line for both sides of the balance sheet. However, since Corebridge was a core business that we fully intend to exit, it also met the accounting criteria for discontinued operations, which requires a recast not just for the current reporting period, but also for past periods. As a result, we reclass Corebridge's assets, liabilities and net income into assets and liabilities of discontinued operations and income or loss from discontinued operations net of income tax in the AIG financials for the second quarter and prior periods. This treatment is reflected on Slide 15. While AIG total assets of $544 billion as of March 31, 2024 is the same as originally reported and following discontinued operations presentation, there is a significant movement within the line items. For example, total investments in cash of $324 billion as originally reported, decreased $88 billion with discontinued operations presentation, with $236 billion of Corebridge investments in cash now included in assets of discontinued operations. The next change in the quarter was deconsolidation, which was triggered on June 9. On the fourth quarter 2023 earnings call, I described the accounting steps related to this principle. Today, I'll walk through those steps with the final numbers. Turning to Slide 16, the first step is the fair valuing of Corebridge's assets and liabilities as of June 9. The net fair value amount was $9.7 billion comprised principally of the $8.6 billion market value of our Corebridge shares at that date and the net fair value of intercompany assets and previously consolidated investment entities. Next, we calculate the difference between the fair value of $9.7 billion and the book value on AIG's balance sheet, which was $6.7 billion. This resulted in net gain on sale of Corebridge of $3.0 billion pre-tax or $2.5 billion after tax. After that, accounting principles require the recognition of $7.2 billion of accumulated other comprehensive loss on AIG's balance sheet, which is unrealized losses on Corebridge's investment portfolio due to higher interest rates. This recognition records a $7.2 billion loss from AOCI in AIG retained earnings by booking it through the loss and discontinued operations in the income statement and then reducing AIG's AOCI on the balance sheet. This does not change shareholders' equity shown on Slide 17. To determine the income statement accounting impact of deconsolidation, the $2.5 billion after tax gain and the $7.2 billion of accumulated other comprehensive loss are added together to calculate the net after tax loss on deconsolidation of $4.7 billion. Finally, the next step is to add Corebridge's net income for the quarter prior to June 9, which was $325 million after tax to the net loss on sale, resulting in a total net loss on discontinued operations of $4.4 billion recorded in AIG's income statement for the quarter. Now, I'll cover the impact on AIG's shareholders' equity, turning to Slide 17, which has a walk of AIG's total equity from the end of March to the end of June. AIG's shareholders' equity was $43.4 billion at March 31, including Corebridge on a consolidated basis. Excluding deconsolidation impacts, the second quarter change in AIG shareholders' equity was a decrease of $1.5 billion, reflecting income from continuing operations of $475 million, offset by $1.7 billion of share repurchases and $261 million of dividends paid. This results in a pro forma AIG shareholders' equity of $41.9 billion before deconsolidation. Then, you layer in the deconsolidation impacts by adding the $2.5 billion after tax gain on sale for total AIG shareholders' equity of $44.4 billion at June 30, 2024 or a $1.1 billion net increase in the quarter, resulting in book value per share of $68.40 at June 30, a 6% increase from March 31. Please note as well that $5.7 billion of non-controlling interest in total equity, which represents the portion of Corebridge equity owned by other shareholders is also eliminated with deconsolidation through the recognition in the net book value calculation of the gain on sale. The last deconsolidation impact is on debt and leverage on Slide 18. Total debt for AIG and Corebridge at March 31, 2024 was $19.2 billion and total equity was $49.1 billion for debt to total capital ratio of 28.1%. With deconsolidation, Corebridge's debt of $9.4 billion and non-controlling interest of $5.7 billion are eliminated on AIG's balance sheet. This results in June 30 balances of $9.8 billion for total debt and $54.3 billion for total capital for a debt to total capital ratio of 18.1%, well within our 15% to 20% target leverage range. We hope this explanation in the slides are helpful in understanding the accounting treatment of Corebridge deconsolidation this quarter. I will now cover second quarter General Insurance and other operations results. Turning to General Insurance, adjusted pre-tax income or APTI was $1.2 billion, up 7% on a comparable basis due to strong underwriting results and higher net investment income. General Insurance net investment income was $746 million, up 10% on a comparable basis due to higher reinvestment rates on fixed maturities and loans. Considering current interest rates and $1.6 billion of General Insurance dividends paid to parent at quarter-end, we expect third quarter General Insurance investment income from fixed maturities, loans and short-term investments of about $700 million. Income on alternatives and other investment assets were $33 million and $52 million respectively in the quarter, up $32 million in total from $44 million and $9 million respectively in second quarter 2023. Second quarter 2024 underwriting income on a comparable basis was $430 million versus $420 million in second quarter last year, driven by lower expenses, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses. Year-to-date, underwriting results have been strong with an accident year loss ratio ex-catastrophes of 56.3%, mainly driven by changes in business mix compared to the prior year. Based on earned premium roll-forward and barring unforeseen significant changes in loss trends, we expect the accident year loss ratio ex-catastrophes will remain strong in the second half of 2024 at approximately the same level as the first half. Turning to natural catastrophes. The industry globally had another quarter of elevated losses with approximately 100 events. For AIG, second quarter catastrophe losses totaled $325 million or 5.7 points on the loss ratio, principally from secondary apparels, including severe convective storms in the United States, floods in the Middle East and Brazil, and hail in Japan with a roughly 50-50 split between North America and International. Our largest loss in the quarter totaled $90 million from exceptionally heavy rains in the UAE. Considering the forecast for hurricane season this year and secondary peril losses year-to-date, we believe that using AIG's last year total catastrophe losses is a good proxy for full year 2024. While actual losses will depend on the size and strength of events, our underwriting standards, limits and reinsurance programs, both occurrence and aggregate will help reduce the net impact of catastrophe frequency and severity on AIG's balance sheet. Nevertheless, on a global basis, the third quarter is usually by far the highest catastrophe quarter with losses averaging 40% to 50% of the total for the year. Turning to reserves, prior year development, net of reinsurance was a favorable $79 million, reflecting the net result from DVRs completed on more than $20 billion of reserves, about 45% of the total in the quarter. Overall, the DVRs, which included U.S. casualty, resulted in net favorable development on workers' compensation and modest net unfavorable development of $30 million on excess casualty, including $66 million for accident year 2021. The 2021 excess casualty reserve charges were for a few large known losses and commercial auto loss trends, reflecting the rebound in auto frequency and severity after the pandemic lockdown in 2020 when frequency was very low. We have not seen this increase in frequency and severity trends in the more recent accident years. Within the casualty and excess casualty books overall, severity trends remain generally consistent with our assumptions. While we see some favorable trends in the 2016 to 2019 accident years, we will continue to allow time for these years to mature. Pricing, which includes rate and exposure for Global Commercial Lines this quarter increased 5%, excluding workers' compensation and financial lines, while our view on loss cost trends have remained stable. In North America Commercial, renewal rates increased 2% in the second quarter or 4% if you exclude workers' compensation and financial lines and the exposure increase was 2%. In International Commercial, overall rate was largely flat or a 1% increase excluding financial lines and the exposure increase was 3% excluding financial lines. We continue to monitor our portfolio very closely and while rate in the second quarter is below trends on certain lines of business, such as property, it is above trend in others. To give more insight on property, North America retail and wholesale property saw rate increases drop below trend in the second quarter, but that's on the back of rate increases in excess of 25% in 2023 and cumulatively in excess of 150% since 2018. International property is about 100% higher. In 2023, our property portfolio had an excellent combined ratio. In North America casualty lines, in particular excess casualty, we continue to get rate in excess of loss trend. We continue to focus on writing business that has attractive returns and while the price adequacy of our portfolio, of course, varies by line, it remains strong overall and within our expectations. Turning to other operations, deconsolidation vastly simplified the income statement. Adjusted pre-tax loss in the quarter was $158 million, a 43% improvement year-over-year, primarily attributable to $68 million in Corebridge dividends and higher short-term investment income. Finally, with deconsolidation, we expect our 2024 adjusted tax rate to be about 24% before discrete items in line with our second quarter. With the deconsolidation of Corebridge this quarter, AIG's income statement and balance sheet are simpler and we no longer have the volatility of life insurance and annuity accounting. With all the changes, we took the opportunity to evaluate our non-GAAP equity metrics, which were established more than a decade ago when AIG was a vastly more complicated conglomerate. The principal change was revising our calculation of adjusted book value to only adjust for investment related accumulated other comprehensive income, which is not within management's control and which will revert to par as bonds approach maturity. Adjusted book value per share was $72.78 per share at June 30, 2024. In addition, we added a core operating shareholders' equity metric, which reflects the equity invested in AIG's go-forward business. It is calculated by subtracting from adjusted book value, the market value of Corebridge stock and GAAP deferred tax assets related to net operating losses and tax credits. Both of these assets have significant value to our shareholders, but contribute little to AATI. We believe this metric is more useful for valuing AIG's global general insurance business and also for measuring our progress towards a 10% plus ROE target. Over time, as we reduce our ownership in Corebridge to zero and monetize the DTA through earnings, core operating book value will become the same as adjusted book value. Core operating book value per share was $53.35 per share at June 30, 2024. To wrap-up, AIG delivered another excellent quarter with significant financial and operational accomplishments in 2024. Achieving the deconsolidation of Corebridge was a major accomplishment this quarter and we had continued strong profitability and growth in our General Insurance business. With our portfolio reshaping now largely behind us, we are intently focused on achieving our 10% plus ROE target driven by strong underwriting and top line growth, expense reduction and capital management. We continue to make progress on this goal with a core operating ROE of 8.9% for the second quarter and 9.3% year-to-date. With that, I will turn the call back over to Peter. Yeah. Sure. And just for everyone's benefit, I'll just start by framing a little bit what we did in the quarter for the DVRs. So this quarter, we evaluated $20.2 billion of reserves for U.S. casualty. That's comprised of 23 separate DVRs and more than 200 different lines of business, and then that aggregates to the five lines that you see on the 10-Q. So the net changes in the quarter were only about $20 million after written premiums, and that was $80 million favorable in workers' comp after the ADC, which has about $8 billion of reserves. It was $22 million unfavorable in excess casualty, which also has about $5 billion of reserves. And then in casualty, it's also about $5 billion reserve for $17 million favorable. In terms of the 2021 accident year, as we've noted on previous calls, we've increased our loss cost trends for 2020 and subsequent years. The adjustments we made in 2021 are from just a combination of known early reported claims that due to their facts and circumstances, we expect to penetrate the excess attachment level, including a rebound in the auto frequency and severity. In 2022 and 2023 accident years, we just have not had that same level of early claims experience, and therefore, we still have a high level of IBNR in the reserves. With respect to the accident year within excess casualty, I would note that while we did have the $66 million of adverse development in accident year 2021, we had $33 million of favorable development excess casualty from accident years prior to 2016, and that's where the delta comes it nets down to closer to the $22 million amount."

This conference is being recorded. \n Now at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead. \nQuentin McMillan: Good morning, and thanks very much. Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC provide details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by applicable securities laws, AIG is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements if circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change.  \n Today's remarks may also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at aig.com.  \n Additionally, note that today's remarks will include results of AIG Life and Retirement segment and other operations on the same basis as prior quarters, which is how we expect to continue to report until the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial. AIG segments and U.S. GAAP financial results, as well as AIG's key financial metrics with respect thereto, differ from those reported by Corebridge Financial. Corebridge Financial will host its earnings call on Friday, May 3.  \n Finally, today's remarks as they relate to net premiums written, adjusted pretax income, underwriting income and margin in General Insurance are presented both on a reported basis as well as a comparable basis, which reflects year-over-year comparison on a constant dollar basis as applicable, adjusted for the sale of Crop Risk Services and the sale of Validus Re. Please refer to the footnote on Page 26 of the first quarter financial supplement for prior period results for the Crop business and Validus Re. \n With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review our first quarter 2024 financial results. Following my remarks, Sabra will provide more detail on the quarter and then we'll take questions. Kevin Hogan will join us for the Q&A portion of the call.\n Here are some highlights from the quarter. Adjusted after-tax income was $1.2 billion or $1.77 per diluted common share, representing a 9% increase in earnings per share year-over-year. Consolidated net investment income on an adjusted pretax income basis was $3.5 billion, a 13% increase year-over-year. General Insurance underwriting income was $596 million, a 19% increase year-over-year, reflecting improved accident year results, including lower catastrophes and increased 67% year-over-year on a comparable basis, if you exclude divested businesses from the prior year quarter.  \n The accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 88.4%, a 30 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter and was the tenth consecutive quarter of a sub-90 combined ratio. The quarter also reflected the significant improvement we have made in controlling volatility in our property portfolio as total catastrophe-related losses in the quarter were $107 million or 1.9%, representing a 230 basis point improvement year-over-year. \n Turning to Life and Retirement. The business reported very good results with premiums and deposits of $10.7 billion in the first quarter, their highest quarterly result achieved in the last decade, and strong APTI growth of 12% over the prior year quarter. \n Last September, Corebridge entered into a definitive agreement to sell the U.K. Life Insurance business to Aviva plc, which calls on April 8. Net proceeds were approximately $550 million and will be used for Corebridge share repurchases.  \n During the quarter, we returned over $2.4 billion to shareholders through $1.7 billion of common stock repurchases, $250 million of dividends and the redemption of all our outstanding Series A preferred stock for $500 million. We repaid $459 million of debt upon maturity, lowering our total debt to $9.8 billion. In addition, we repurchased approximately $613 million of common stock in April. \n Based on our strong performance, the AIG Board of Directors approved an 11% increase in AIG's quarterly common stock dividend to $0.40 per share. The AIG Board of Directors also increased the share repurchase authorization to $10 billion, effective May 1. Lastly, we ended the first quarter with strong parent liquidity of $5.1 billion. Overall, I'm very pleased with our first quarter results and the continued strong execution of our strategy to deliver sustained underwriting excellence, profitability and disciplined capital management.\n During my remarks this morning, I will discuss 4 important topics: first, I will provide some financial highlights in the quarter focused on the General Insurance business, including some insight into our net premiums written; second, I will talk briefly about the results in Life and Retirement; third, I will provide an update on our capital management strategy, specifically our plans for 2024 and 2025; and finally, I will discuss our path to a 10%-plus ROCE and provide more detail on AIG Next and our future state operating structure that will create value through a leaner and more unified company. \n Let me take a moment to update you on our sell-down of Corebridge. Our Corebridge holdings currently stand at 324 million common shares outstanding, which represents a 53% ownership stake. We continue to explore all alternatives to reduce our ownership stake in Corebridge. Once Corebridge is deconsolidated from AIG, Life and Retirement's balance sheet and income statement will no longer be included in AIG's consolidated financial statements, and our remaining ownership stake will be reported in parent investments with dividends reported in net investment income. \n Sabra went through this in detail on our last earnings call. We have been evaluating opportunities to maximize long-term value for Corebridge and have considered multiple strategic alternatives that we believe will best position Corebridge for future success. We remain committed to reducing AIG's ownership and to fully selling our remaining stake, and I will continue to provide updates to all of our stakeholders.  \n In terms of the use of Corebridge-related proceeds, AIG expects to continue to utilize excess capital and liquidity, with a focus on returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and liability management, which I will discuss later when I outline our capital management strategy.\n Now turning to General Insurance. Net premiums written were $4.5 billion and reflected the impact of the dispositions of Validus Re and Crop Risk Services as well as actions we've taken to restructure specific treaty reinsurance. Overall, Global Commercial had a very strong quarter. Excluding the impact of our divestitures, Global Commercial net premiums written growth was 1% year-over-year.\n First, I want to reconfirm the guidance for the year. We expect high single-digit growth in net premiums written for the full year in our Global Commercial Insurance business. Now the results. In North America Commercial, net premiums written grew 4%. Lexington grew 24%, which was led by Casualty and Western World. Our Excess Casualty line grew 46% and our Captive Solutions grew 20%.  \n There's been meaningful commentary on the Excess & Surplus Lines market, and we continue to experience terrific fundamentals and results in Lexington. Let me provide a few examples. Our submission volume was up over 50% year-over-year. Lexington delivered strong new business, outperforming last year's record first quarter results, balanced across all lines. And retention remains strong for Lexington at 78%. \n Shifting to North America Retail Property, net premiums written were negative $120 million in the quarter, driven by first quarter reinsurance purchased and had over a 600 basis point impact on the first quarter net premiums written growth for North America commercial compared to prior year. North America Financial Lines declined 4% year-over-year. In prior quarters, we provided meaningful commentary on the dynamics within Financial Lines, so I will not go through that again. \n It's been a challenging market environment with continued headwinds on rate. Having said that, we continue to believe our portfolio is strong, and we remain disciplined. Sabra will give more detail in her prepared remarks. \n In International Commercial, net premiums written were flat for the quarter. International Property grew 23%, and Talbot grew 18%. This was offset by a decline in our Global Specialty business of slightly over 10% due to some top line weakness in energy and the effects of the reinsurance restructuring. Also, we had a 5% decline in International Financial Lines. \n Now turning to the combined ratio. Our Global Commercial business in the first quarter had an outstanding result with an 84.4% accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophe, a 150 basis point improvement year-over-year. The accident year combined ratio, including catastrophe, was 86.6%, a 500 basis point improvement year-over-year. \n This was led by International Commercial which, on a comparable basis, had an 82.8% accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophe, which is a 140 basis point improvement year-over-year; and an 83.5% accident year combined ratio, including catastrophe, which is a 770 basis point improvement year-over-year.\n North America Commercial also had an outstanding result with an 85.9% accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophe, which is a 180 basis point improvement year-over-year; and an 89.5% accident year combined ratio, including catastrophe which is a 260 basis point improvement year-over-year. These results were simply outstanding and are a testament to our commitment and culture of underwriting excellence.  \n Shifting now to global Personal Insurance. Net premiums written were flat to prior year. We had modest growth in Personal Auto and Individual Travel and reductions in high net worth driven largely by reinsurance and Accident & Health, largely driven by 2 nonrenewals in China, as part of our focus on portfolio improvements in our Accident & Health business.  \n North America Personal had a 97.7% accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophe. This is a 990 basis point improvement year-over-year and a 101.6% accident year combined ratio, including catastrophe, which is an 870 basis point improvement year-over-year.  \n As we discussed last year, we expect a material financial improvement in 2024 that will be driven by higher earned premium and a lower loss ratio from the high net worth business. We saw this manifest in the first quarter and expect this improvement to continue throughout 2024.  \n International parcel insurance had a 96.8% accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophe, which increased 90 basis points year-over-year; and a 96.8% accident year combined ratio, including catastrophe, which is a 20 basis point improvement year-over-year. Overall, I'm very pleased with the financial performance of General Insurance, which delivered another excellent quarter.  \n Our reinsurance decisions in the first quarter had an impact on net premiums written. As we've discussed over the past several years, our reinsurance partnerships and global treaty structures have been purposeful. Our objective has been to deliver improved underwriting profitability and evolve our business portfolio to be appropriately diversified to deliver consistent results throughout the market cycle.  \n We believe this strategy has provided sustained value to our clients while also delivering improved risk-adjusted returns. It has significantly repositioned AIG, especially as we prepare to deconsolidate from Corebridge. Our goals with our reinsurance purchasing have been to preserve and optimize capital and enhance the quality of earnings through active management of the volatility of our underwriting results. This deliberate approach to reinsurance has helped position AIG with a very strong balance sheet and has given us the flexibility to add exposure where risk-adjusted returns are very attractive while also moderating volatility in our underwriting results. \n As a result of our divestiture of Validus Re, combined with the reduction in gross limits in property through our underwriting strategy, we have reduced our PMLs and created meaningful capacity to increase our property writings throughout our global platform should they meet our expected returns. Without going through each return period by peril and region, our key zone PMLs on average, have decreased by over 40% compared to the first quarter of 2023, which provides considerable aggregate for future growth while appropriately managing the exposures we're assuming. \n Our reinsurance purchasing is deliberately concentrated at January 1. As a result, any changes in purchasing tend to be more pronounced in the first quarter reporting of net premiums written. In January 2024, we also made some changes related to the allocation of catastrophe costs among the businesses, so that catastrophe costs are more accurately reflected in pricing. Historically, some of these costs have been shared with Validus Re. We reallocated PMLs and the catastrophe costs to where we believe the most attractive opportunities for growth existed in our portfolio.\n It's worth noting, when considering our property catastrophe placement, we believe we have the lowest attachment point of our peer group. Over time, we have the balance sheet and perhaps the risk appetite to take more net on our catastrophe program post deconsolidation and subject to market conditions.  \n As a point of reference, if we chose to raise our catastrophe attachment point to $500 million worldwide, our attachment point would likely remain the lowest among our peer group with 1 in 11 attachment point in North America wind and 1 in 19 attachment in North America earthquake based on today's exposure. Importantly, our net premiums written in commercial would have been 15% greater in the first quarter if we had elected to have a $500 million attachment point across our global portfolio.  \n Our earnings potential is significant. And when combined with the strength of our balance sheet, it will provide us with the flexibility to continuously evaluate and refine our strategic reinsurance purchasing as we enter 2025. \n Turning to Life and Retirement. As I noted earlier, the business continued to produce strong results in the first quarter. In April, Corebridge completed their Corebridge forward restructuring. $400 million of savings has been actioned or contracted, and they expect to realize the vast majority of the savings by the end of 2024 at a cost to achieve of $300 million.  \n Corebridge repurchased approximately $240 million of common shares during the first quarter, and they have repurchased $370 million of common shares year-to-date. Corebridge ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet with parent liquidity of $1.7 billion. This week, the Corebridge Board of Directors approved a share buyback authorization of $2 billion, which reflects their stated commitment to delivering a 60% to 65% payout ratio to shareholders, subject to market conditions. \n Turning to other operations. We have made significant progress towards our future state operating model. Adjusted pretax loss from other operations in the quarter, including Life and Retirement, was $408 million, a 17% improvement year-over-year. The improvement was primarily attributable to lower general operating expense, higher short-term investment income and lower interest expense at AIG due to debt reduction actions. We expect our future state parent expenses to be in the range of $325 million to $350 million by year-end 2024. After deconsolidation, we intend to use 1% to 1.5% of net premiums earned as a benchmark of total parent expenses in the future.  \n Turning to capital management. In the first quarter, we continue to execute on our balanced capital management strategy. Over the past couple of years, we have significantly strengthened our balance sheet by making key decisions that have increased our financial flexibility while always planning for the long term, which has allowed us to accelerate the execution of our strategy and unlock meaningful value for AIG shareholders.  \n Along with establishing appropriate debt capital structures for AIG and Corebridge and diligently executing on AIG's capital management priorities, we have also completed over $40 billion of capital market transactions since 2022. We have been very disciplined in the execution of the components of our capital management strategy that we first outlined in 2022.  \n As a reminder, our objectives were: to maintain very strong insurance company capital levels to support organic growth and a steady source of operating subsidiary dividends to service parent company needs; to reduce our total debt outstanding and improve our leverage ratios, providing a well-structured and well-laddered debt portfolio with no outsized amounts due in any given year, particularly over the next 5 years; to return excess capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends; to increase our dividend as our earnings and financial flexibility improved; and to maintain a strong parent liquidity position.  \n All of our Tier 1 insurance company subsidiaries are at or above their target capital ranges and have the ability to support meaningful growth without additional capital contributions. At current profitability levels, we had approximately $3 billion of run rate dividend capacity from our global General Insurance subsidiaries with approximately $2 billion attributable to the U.S. General Insurance company's dividend capacity. \n We have increased the U.S. General Insurance company dividend capacity by approximately 400% over the last 3 years. This reflects a significant increase from 2021, when it was $550 million; and in 2022, when it was $1.4 billion. Looking forward, we expect to continue positioning AIG with maximum capital flexibility for growth, including reviewing our reinsurance over time and considering compelling and strategic inorganic growth opportunities should they exist.  \n In addition to strong insurance company capitalization, we've continued to significantly reduce our overall debt. Outstanding debt is now approximately $9.8 billion, a reduction of over $12 billion since the end of 2021, which has been a remarkable result for AIG. We had previously provided guidance that we're targeting a 20% to 25% total debt-to-capital ratio, and we expect to be in the 15% to 20% range upon deconsolidation.\n While we may do additional work on maturities, we would not expect that to take priority over share repurchases. Since 2022, we've increased our focus on share repurchase activities. We completed over $5 billion of repurchases in 2022 and approximately $3 billion in 2023. Looking ahead, we expect up to $6 billion in repurchases in 2024 and up to $4 billion in 2025, depending on the timing of future Corebridge sell-downs and market conditions.\n All of the expected activity in 2024 and 2025 will be covered by the $10 billion share authorization that we announced yesterday. For the balance of 2024, we expect to be able to repurchase about $1.5 billion of common stock a quarter depending on excess parent liquidity levels, including future Corebridge sale proceeds, General Insurance dividends and market conditions. \n And based on the current stock price, we would expect this to get us closer to the higher end of our target share count range of 600 million to 650 million common shares by the end of the second quarter and towards the lower end of the range by the end of 2024. Furthermore, based on this outlook and depending on the stock price and market conditions, we would expect to be between 550 million and 600 million shares outstanding by year-end 2025.  \n Turning to our dividend. The AIG Board of Directors recently increased the cash dividend of $0.40 per share on AIG common stock up 11%, the second consecutive year with an increase of more than 10%. I could not be more pleased with our progress. We remain confident in our ability to deliver while continuing the positive momentum in our financial performance. \n We remain committed to delivering an adjusted 10%-plus ROCE post deconsolidation of Corebridge. For the first quarter, we achieved a 9.3% adjusted ROCE and a 13.3% adjusted ROCE in General Insurance. Contributing to ROCE will be AIG Next, which will focus on achieving an expense base that will generate additional savings for AIG while reducing complexity throughout our organization and simplifying how we operate. AIG Next will create clarity in our operating structure, including aligning our underwriting and claims organizations with our operations and functions while defining our parent company of the future.  \n This is the key objective as we weave AIG together. To be a less complex, more effective and leaner company with the appropriate infrastructure and capabilities for the business we will be post deconsolidation. AIG Next has clearly defined work streams governed by a very experienced, centralized team with significant experience in transformations and company design reporting directly to me. \n As I stated on previous calls, we expect AIG Next to generate approximately $500 million in annual run rate savings by the end of 2025. Of the $500 million in run rate savings, we expect $350 million to be actioned in 2024, which is an increase of the guidance we have provided in the past, and the balance will be actioned within 2025 with a cost to achieve of $500 million.  \n To date, we've made meaningful progress on AIG Next across multiple work streams. In April, we announced a voluntary early retirement program available to colleagues in the United States who meet the eligibility criteria. Eligible participants will have the opportunity to accelerate their retirement from AIG with enhanced retirement benefits. \n The population of eligible participants represents approximately 25% of our U.S. workforce. About half of the eligible participants are located in the high-cost New York metropolitan area. We are anticipating a 50% take-up rate, which would result in approximately $225 million of onetime cost and a net run rate benefit of approximately $150 million after reinvestment for the skills and capabilities we need for the future. The numbers I have provided for our early retirement program are included in the total numbers I provided for AIG Next.  \n In summary, I'm very pleased with our overall performance as we start 2024. As I said in my recent letter to shareholders, our ability to execute continues to be one of the company's best attributes. We have accomplished a significant amount in the past several years in order to position AIG for the future, and we have continued to deliver in the first quarter, which will enable us to achieve our objectives in 2024 and beyond.\n I am confident that we will continue to uphold our commitment to achieving underwriting excellence and high-quality earnings over the long term, benefiting all of our stakeholders as we continue to simplify and streamline our business and create the AIG of tomorrow.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Sabra. \nSabra Purtill: Thank you, Peter. This morning, I will provide details on AIG's first quarter results, including General Insurance, investment income in Life and Retirement and a balance sheet update. \n First quarter 2024 adjusted after-tax income attributable to AIG common shareholders, or AATI, was $1.2 billion, flat to last year due to the reduction in our ownership of Corebridge from 77.3% to 52.7% at the end of this quarter. General Insurance adjusted pretax income, or APTI, increased $110 million year-over-year, driven by higher underwriting and net investment income. The prior year quarter included APTI of approximately $175 million from Validus Re and Crop Risk Services. On a comparable basis, excluding the divested businesses, General Insurance APTI was up about $285 million.  \n As Peter noted, first quarter General Insurance underwriting income was $596 million, up $94 million from the prior year quarter. On a comparable basis, underwriting income rose $239 million year-over-year.  \n International Commercial Lines was the primary contributor to higher underwriting profitability with $175 million increase in underwriting income. North America Commercial Lines underwriting income was down $95 million from the prior year quarter as reported but up $35 million on a comparable basis. Underwriting income includes catastrophe losses of $107 million in the quarter or 190 basis points on the loss ratio, down from $265 million or 420 basis points last year.\n Prior year development this quarter was a favorable $34 million compared to a favorable $68 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter's development was solely from the amortization of the deferred gain on the adverse development cover which is recalculated each year based on prior year experience. For 2024, the amortization gain will be $34 million each quarter compared to $41 million a quarter last year. \n Turning to underwriting ratios. The General Insurance calendar year combined ratio was 89.8% this quarter, a 210 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter and a 380 basis point improvement on a comparable basis. We provided additional data on Page 26 of the financial supplement on the impact of the divestitures on 2023 North American commercial combined ratios. \n The accident year combined ratio ex catastrophes was 88.4%, a 30 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter and a 160 basis point improvement on a comparable basis. The accident year loss ratio adjusted for catastrophes was 56.6% this quarter, 10 basis points better than the first quarter of 2023 as reported and 70 basis points better on a comparable basis. This improvement reflects continued earn-in of rate above loss cost trend and better underwriting and risk selection, particularly in Global Commercial lines.\n The expense ratio for the quarter was 31.8%, down 20 basis points from the prior year quarter as reported, with a $43 million reduction in general operating expenses. On a comparable basis, the expense ratio improved 90 basis points with 10 basis points from the acquisition ratio and 80 basis points from the general operating expense ratio, reflecting continued expense discipline as general operating expenses rose only $6 million. \n As Peter covered General Insurance premium growth, I will focus on Commercial Lines new business, renewal rate, loss trends and retention as well as reserves. New business production in Global Commercial remained strong. In North America, new business was almost $450 million and balanced across all lines with excellent performance from Lexington. \n International Commercial new business levels were very good, with over $500 million in the quarter, led by Talbot, Property and Casualty, offset by lower new business in energy and Financial Lines. In North America Commercial, overall rate, excluding workers' compensation, increased 5% in the quarter with exposure adding 2% for overall pricing of 7%, which is above loss cost trend. Excluding workers' comp and Financial Lines, North America commercial rate was up more than 8% in the quarter, with exposure up 2% for overall pricing over 10%, meaningfully above the loss cost trend. \n North America commercial rate increase reflect strengthening pricing trends in Casualty, including Lexington Casualty, which was up 11%; Lexington Healthcare up 15%; and Excess Casualty up 16%. In International Commercial, overall rate increased 3% and exposure added 2% for an overall pricing increase of 5%, modestly ahead of the loss cost trend. Excluding Financial Lines, International rate was up 5% with overall pricing up 7%, well ahead of loss cost trend. The rate increase was driven by Property, which was up 7%; energy up 8%; and marine up 7%. \n As we've discussed, Financial Lines is a notable exception to pricing trends. This was particularly the case in excess. We are taking a long-term view in Financial Lines and remain disciplined on risk selection, terms and conditions, pricing and reserving. While rate trend has been negative the past few quarters, in aggregate, the cumulative rate level in North America Financial Lines is about 50% higher than 5 years ago. \n Renewal retention has improved over the past several years and remained strong. As a reminder, we calculate renewal retention using expiring premiums, excluding the impact of renewal rate and exposure changes on the ratio. Global Commercial retention increased to 89%, stable at 88% in North America and rose to 89% in International.  \n Turning to reserves. I wanted to provide some background on AIG's reserve review schedule for 2024 and quarterly processes. At AIG, we performed detailed valuation reviews, or DVRs, on each book once a year. In DVRs, we look at loss development and trends in prior and current accident years and consider changes in our reserving factors and approaches based on emerged experience. We do not perform DVRs in the first quarter.  \n In the second quarter of 2024, we will review the North America Casualty book, including excess and primary Casualty, Lexington, workers' compensation and mass tort comprising about $20 billion of reserves or 44% of our total reserves. In the third quarter, we will review International Commercial Lines, Global Financial Lines, Commercial Property and other lines, totaling about $22 billion or 47% of reserves with the balance of the DVRs completed in the fourth quarter.  \n Between DVRs, our actuarial team evaluates pricing, claims, loss trends and reserves across the portfolio. Each quarter, we complete an actual versus expected review, or AVE, for each book. The AVE review gives us a current look at trends and the opportunity to address issues prior to the scheduled DVR. Examples of such items include large new claims, notable changes in claims patterns or settlements, changes in attritional loss trends beyond normal ranges or significant major events.  \n We are aware that the industry has begun to address adverse casualty loss development trends in the 2016 to 2019 accident years. On our third quarter 2023 call, Peter provided significant detail on the reunderwriting and repricing of our casualty book that we began in 2018 with an entirely new framework and approach to underwriting. In addition, we changed our reserving assumptions on the book. And by 2021, we had increased reserves on North American Casualty, 2016 through 2019 accident years, by over $1 billion. We also continued to refine our actuarial judgments, and in 2019, we raised the loss cost trend assumption for certain Excess Casualty segments to 10%. And by 2022, all Excess Casualty segments were at or above 10%. \n Our AVE reviews on North American Casualty since the second quarter 2023 DVR continue to show loss experience within the range of our expectations on the 2016 to 2019 accident years. As we have previously outlined, our reserving philosophy is to react to adverse trends quickly and to allow time for favorable trends, particularly in recent accident years, to mature. We did not make any adjustments to our casualty reserves this quarter, in total or within the 2016 to 2019 accident years. AIG's reserves and balance sheet are much stronger today, and our reinsurance is much more comprehensive, helping improve our underwriting results and reduce volatility.\n Turning now to investment income. AIG continues to benefit from reinvestment rates on fixed maturities and loans that exceeded sales and maturities, helping drive higher yields and net investment income in General Insurance and Life and Retirement. This quarter, consolidated net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.5 billion, up 13% from the prior year quarter and up 2% in General Insurance and 16% in Life and Retirement.  \n General Insurance net investment income growth was negatively impacted by the sale of Validus Re, which had a $5 billion portfolio. Adjusted for income on that portfolio in the prior year quarter, General Insurance net investment income rose about 7%, with a 9% increase in fixed maturities and loans driven by higher reinvestment rates.\n This quarter, new money rates on fixed maturities and loans averaged 5.9%, 150 basis points higher than the yield on sales and maturities in the quarter. The new money rates were about 115 basis points higher in General Insurance, and 165 basis points higher in Life and Retirement. \n The annualized yield on fixed maturities and loans, excluding calls, prepayments and other onetime items, was 3.9% in General Insurance, 3 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2023 and 44 basis points higher than the prior year quarter. The sequential yield comparison in General Insurance was negatively impacted by the sale of Validus Re. First quarter General Insurance alternative investment income was $54 million or an annualized return of 5.2% this quarter, down $41 million from the prior year quarter.  \n Continuing to Life and Retirement. Sales and earnings were strong this quarter. First quarter sales remained at historically high levels with premiums and deposits of $10.7 billion driven by strong sales in fixed annuities and pension risk transfer.\n Life and Retirement segment APTI was $991 million, up 12% from the prior year quarter, driven by higher base portfolio spread income due to higher reinvestment rates, higher fee income due to higher market levels and lower general operating expenses, partially offset by lower alternative investment income. Life and Retirement alternative investment income was negative $23 million this quarter for an annualized yield of negative 1.8% due to private equity losses and very low income on hedge funds and real estate compared to breakeven last year. Corebridge's total contribution to AIG's AATI, including corporate expenses, declined by approximately $100 million or 20% over the prior year quarter due to the reduction in our ownership. \n Turning to the balance sheet. Book value per common share was $64.66 this quarter, down 1% from year-end 2023 and up 10% from the prior year quarter, driven mostly by the impact of interest rates. Adjusted book value per share was $77.79, up 1% from year-end 2023 and up 3% from the prior year quarter, reflecting the net impact of earnings, dividends and share repurchases.  \n Peter covered our capital management actions year-to-date. With respect to debt leverage, consolidated debt and preferred stock to total capital, excluding AOCI, which includes $9.4 billion of Corebridge debt, was 23.6% at March 31, down 70 basis points from year-end 2023. Excluding Corebridge debt on a pro forma deconsolidated basis, AIG debt to total capital is expected to be within the new 15% to 20% debt target range that Peter provided.  \n To conclude, AIG delivered another excellent quarter with significant financial and operational accomplishments. In 2024, AIG Next and the deconsolidation of Corebridge will drive significant progress towards achieving our 10%-plus adjusted ROCE goal. We are confident in our ability to achieve this goal and look forward to updating you on our progress.  \n With that, I will turn the call back over to Peter. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Thank you, Sabra. And operator, we're ready for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Zaremski with BMO. \nMichael Zaremski: Looking over the -- your prepared remarks, Peter, and you used the term inorganic opportunities should they exist in reviewing reinsurance. So you also talked about the capital management expectations. So I guess would -- should we be thinking about the repurchase program as kind of a base case, but should there be other opportunities you might look to do something organic? Or just was there anything kind of new in there, in that wording that we should -- that you're trying to get us to think about? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Thanks, Mike. It's a very good question. We are going to stay very committed to the capital management structure we outlined, which is why I gave guidance on not only '24 but '25 in terms of share repurchases.\n I think we've been consistent, and I added in when we're more comprehensive in our description in terms of capital management, that should inorganic opportunities exist, and they're compelling, which just means does it add product, does it add geography? Not scale and size, but just something that does help us strategically reposition ourselves. I wouldn't want to rule that out, but it's not a priority in the short term. And so that's really the context of what I provide in my prepared remarks. \nMichael Zaremski: Okay. Understood. And my follow-up is just on the overall competitive environment relative to growth. So you guys have been very open. You have lots of pricing gauges. You've talked about Financial Lines being -- continue to be a soft-ish marketplace. but you've also said that you estimate pricing above loss cost trend. \n But is there -- is this a conducive environment for AIG to want to kind of grow opportunistically? Or is it more just in certain pockets? I guess just for the backdrop, some of us look at the Marsh pricing index and it feels like there's, in my words, not a lot of gap or a narrow gap between kind of pricing and loss trends, potentially. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Yes. Thanks. It's a very good question. Let me start on growth. You can't -- one is you can't always look at broker index. Again, I don't know what Marsh index tracks, but sometimes, they don't catch fee business. They don't really catch the entire sort of market, which is the market we play in. \n I do think it's conducive to grow. We don't look for top line growth to sacrifice profitability, and I think we evidenced that in this quarter and we've evidenced it over the past couple of years, that we continue to want to improve our combined ratios and look at businesses where the best risk-adjusted returns are. And so we have shaped the portfolio that way.\n It's hard in any one quarter to sometimes draw conclusions like you saw in terms of the gross premium written in this quarter. It's really driven by 3 lines: Specialty; Financial Lines; and Casualty. The first quarter was impacted in International by energy within the Specialty class. But it's a great business, we're a world leader in that class, great underwriting capabilities and global distribution. And expect us to continue to grow that, and it's a very attractive combined ratio. \n So I think there's a little bit of noise. We had some captives. We had reinsurance impact the quarter, because we switched from some pro rata to excess of loss. I don't think I need to go into too much more detail on Financial Lines. It's definitely an area where we watch very carefully. Sabra provided a lot of great context in her prepared remarks. But we're going to focus on making sure we have the highest-quality book. \n I mean, our retention I think, spoke volumes this quarter in terms of the portfolio we like. I mean, with 89% in International, 88% in North America, across the board, that was tremendous, good new business. And so we definitely find opportunities. \n I mean, the one area I just want to just note. Because Lexington, we talk about it every quarter because it just continues to just be exceptional. But the market dynamics have changed quite a bit. And when we look at Excess & Surplus lines, we think there's great opportunities to continue to grow. Even though there may have been some slowdown in Property, there's other lines of business, like casualty that we're seeing massive submission activity. And I just wouldn't look at the E&S market as a hard market play or a soft market play. It's just a market that's going to be here to stay in a different way. And so we're very much investing in that. I think the margins are great and the growth opportunities are significant. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. \nElyse Greenspan: Peter, my first question, last quarter, you had implied that a Corebridge deconsolidation would come by the end of the second quarter. Does that time frame remain intact? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: There's not a whole lot more I can offer in terms of the prepared remarks. Every sell-down has been important, but this one is particularly important just because we would likely become a seller of shares that will deconsolidate Corebridge. So we continue to focus on making certain we're looking at every option available. \n And considering all of those variables, Corebridge has done a significant amount of work working with AIG and independently to position itself to be a separate public company. It's done an exceptional job. We're completed, most of our transition service agreements, which just means they're more operationally prepared to go. \n And so again, subject to market conditions, I think my guidance I gave last quarter stands. We would expect to try and do something before the end of the second quarter. \nElyse Greenspan: And then my follow-up is on the new share count target that you provided for the end of '25, that 550 million to 600 million. I'm just trying to get a case of -- what the base case is for just Corebridge within that. Does that assume additional secondaries? If you did an exchange offer, would that be accretive to that share count target? I just want to get a sense of when you guys came up with this 550 million to 600 million, what you're assuming for Corebridge within that share count target. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Yes. Thanks, Elyse. I think while we gave the guidance into 2025 is -- what I said in my prepared remarks is that by the end of the second quarter, if we exercise on the share repurchases that we've outlined, we would be at the higher end of the range of the 600 million to 650 million. And if we continue the $1.5 billion a quarter, which, yes, would contemplate doing a sell-down of Corebridge. But there's other forms of liquidity that come into AIG, but we would need to sell down to be able to do the $1.5 billion in the third and fourth quarter, but that gets us to the lower end of the range.\n And then as we continue to do future sell-downs, we would get below the 600 million share count, which is why we decided to give a little bit more guidance as we get into 2025. It does not include a sell-down to 0, but it does contemplate several transactions that would take place in the next 4 quarters. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous. \nRyan Tunis: Just a follow-up, I guess, on that last question, Peter. Just, I guess, the messaging on the $10 billion share repurchase authorization. Are you trying to say that the intention is to do kind of no more than $10 billion until the end of '25? Or is that -- should we just take this as an update of what you think you can do based on what you're seeing today? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: I would take it as just an update. We would have gone past our current Board authorization with the 2025 guidance and worked very closely with the AIG Board of Directors to talk about what we expected the capital management strategy to be in the next 6 quarters. And that's really how we derive the $10 billion. But I wouldn't think about it anything more than that. \nRyan Tunis: Got it. And then a follow-up, I guess, just thinking about the reinsurance. And obviously, you're continuing to add more, but you're saying potentially, like in the future, maybe scaling back on that a bit could be a way you could use some of your excess capital. \n Could you just talk a little bit about, I guess, how we should think about how the gross underwriting, I guess, has improved at AIG over the past few years? And yes, like what would make you comfortable -- because we only see stuff on a net basis, but like what would give you comfort in retaining more net? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Well, in terms of the portfolio, I'm comfortable today taking more net. But what we've done over this multiyear period in terms of strategically positioning the reinsurance is working very closely with our reinsurance partners, looking across multiple lines of business and multiple geographies in the placement of reinsurance. And then also making certain that we control volatility in this period of transition. That's been really important.\n I want to emphasize that because we not only are looking at our accident year combined ratios, excluding catastrophe, we have kept our retentions or lowered them in a period of high uncertainty and high volatility because we don't want to have any outsized losses or surprises perhaps or an active cat season. \n Also, I think we're very different than other insurance companies in terms of how we purchase reinsurance. It's not done at the business level. It is not done within just the finance function or treasury, it's done -- reports directly to me. And so I work very closely with Charlie Fry, work very closely with Sabra in terms of what our risk appetite is going to be for that particular year. And we've protected capital and had more quality earnings as a result of some of the reinsurance that we place. \n A couple of examples of things that are just very good, but impacted the first quarter is switching more to excess of loss in certain segments like energy, we transitioned and proportionally signed down a little bit of the quota share. But it wasn't economic because we ended up getting a better outcome on the quota share with 200 basis points of improvement. So it's just repositioning the portfolio. Did the same thing with property cat.\n And the reason I just gave the example on our earnings and sort of prepared remarks is just, on property cat, we can absolutely take more net if we decide to as we enter 2025, depending on the portfolio and depending on our appetite for volatility. We'll still have one of the lowest attachment points of any of our peers across the world.\n We enhanced coverage. There's a lot more coverage in our property cat. We've enhanced our high net worth business in terms of excess of loss and more comprehensive coverage. And also -- again, and I'll stop here because I could go on for hours on this discussion, but is on casualty, we renewed or improved our overall construct across the globe based on the quality of our growth portfolio. \n So to start thinking about ways in which we can do reinsurance differently will not have anything really to do with the gross portfolio because they're very much like that. It's more of where do we want volatility and where do we want to take more net? And we see opportunities as we enter 2025. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Cox with Goldman Sachs. \nRobert Cox: First question on underwriting leverage. If I take comments on capital at the insurance companies with opportunities in Property post the sale of Validus, it seems like AIG could meaningfully increase underwriting leverage here, which could obviously contribute to the 10%-plus ROCE. Could you provide any additional color on how you're thinking about underwriting leverage here, and maybe some metrics you'd point us to? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Sure. I'll ask Sabra to comment on some of the leverage within the insurance company subsidiaries. We see great opportunities for us to grow within -- across the world. And you've mentioned Property and specifics. We have significantly reduced PMLs, which means we have aggregate to grow. And we have the capital to grow. \n And the interesting part of AIG is that when we look at Property, we have so many different points of entry depending on the risk-adjusted returns that exist. If I start in the United States, and this is not all inclusive, but just as a few examples, we have Lexington E&S property, we have Retail Property, we have the high net worth business, and that can be done on an admitted or non-admitted basis. We have Retail Property. In International, we have Japan Property that's specific to Japan. We have Talbot. And we have Global Specialty. So there's so many different points of entry. Depending on the risk-adjusted returns, we can scale up or scale down, but believe that there's going to be great opportunities for us in the future. \n Yes. I mean, the first quarter tempered on Property. But look, we're not in the cat season yet, and our industry is famous of just framing out the market at a point in time. We got a long ways to go this year in terms of where the opportunities exist, but we absolutely have the leverage to  grow if we like the risk-adjusted returns. \n Sabra, do you want to comment on that? \nSabra Purtill: Yes. Thank you, Peter. What I would just observe is, as we've stated in the past, and I'll reiterate today, all of our General Insurance subsidiaries or Tier 1 subsidiaries on a global basis have capital at or above our target ranges. And within the United States pool, which is the largest pool of our General Insurance capital, our risk-based capital ratios at the end of last year were around 460%, which is well higher than many of our peers.\n So what I would note is that within the General Insurance companies, we're strongly capitalized to be able to support growth, obviously, protected by the reinsurance programs that we have. But I would just, as a general note, comment that premiums to surplus leverage isn't the best way to look at capital within a General Insurance company, particularly given a company like AIG, which is a leading player in Casualty and Specialty lines across the globe. \nRobert Cox: That's really helpful color. Yes, just a follow-up on Excess Casualty. I appreciate the comments. The premiums were up 46% in the quarter, and it seems like pricing is up meaningfully. It seems like AIG is taking advantage of market conditions where perhaps some others are pulling back. So I was hoping you could provide a little bit more commentary on the opportunities you're seeing there. And what makes AIG comfortable with the current environment? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Thank you. We do see great opportunities in Casualty. We highlighted some of the performance in the quarter. We had to start, because of the portfolio that existed, reunderwriting the Casualty portfolio well before, I think, it was discussed really in the industry. And with that, became a new underwriting philosophy, new underwriting strategy, new terms and conditions, new attachment points, net limit, gross limits, pricing, margin. And so that's been a journey for us for years. \n We mentioned the 16% in Excess Casualty in terms of rate is as strong as we've seen in the past several years. And so that we do think there's a lot of capacity pulling back. We have very comprehensive reinsurance to mitigate volatility and enable us to put out limits depending on our risk appetite. And obviously, we're cautious. We're watching the different lines of business within Casualty and their trends, but absolutely see opportunities to grow. \n And when you look at our premium, don't think about it as we've grown policy count or limit, it's actually the opposite. I mean, like our client count, policy count and limits are all dramatically reduced when you compare them to 3 or 4 years ago. It's just been the effect of where we participated and how we price the business. And believe that, again, we're going to be cautious, but there are real opportunities for growth in the current market. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Ward with Citigroup. \nMichael Ward: I'm a little bit curious just on the potential sell-down of Corebridge. How do you weigh the options between doing several smaller chunks of sell-down from here versus maybe the potential for doing a sell-down of the remaining stake? And then another thing on the other side, right, we sort of think about this $500 million a month buyback. Is there the option to potentially do an ASR post sell-down? \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: I wish I could provide a little bit more detail on the first part of the question. We're looking at all alternatives, all size. I mean, so much is market-dependent. You have certain windows. And we want to make sure -- we have multiple stakeholders, I mean, within Corebridge shareholders, AIG shareholders, so sort of balancing that is really important for us.\n But as I said in my answer and prepared remarks, we're ready to go. Everybody is anxious to move forward, but we're going to make sure we do it in a very methodical way to where we don't do anything that's not in the best interest of all that we've done so far and our stakeholders. So we will consider multiple options and keep everybody updated. \n On the ASR, I mean, I think we've largely thought about this, and Sabra, if you want to comment to close out. We've done share repurchase in a methodical way. We always consider different ways in which we can do it. But maybe you can just comment, and then I'll close it out. \nSabra Purtill: Yes, thanks. The thing you should keep in mind is that with the amount of shares that we can repurchase or can be repurchased by a company in any given month, whether it's an ASR or it's a 10b5-1 plan or open market purchases, it's constrained by the same factor, which is the average daily trading volume. \n We have looked at doing ASRs. And to date, what we've preferred to do is just be consistently in the market every day through a 10b5-1 plan. But it's certainly something if we were to do a larger sale of a Corebridge stake where we wanted to redeploy that quickly and get the benefit of that into our share count, then an ASR is a tool that we can use to do that. But in terms of the volume per month, it doesn't really vary that different, whether it's an ASR or a 10b5-1. \nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO: Thanks, Sabra. And in closing, I just want to thank all of our colleagues around the world for their continued dedication, teamwork, execution on all the progress we've made. And I want to thank everybody for joining us today and your questions. Everybody, have a great day. \nOperator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

            "name": "Sabra Purtill",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter. This morning, I will provide details on AIG's first quarter results, including General Insurance, investment income in Life and Retirement and a balance sheet update. \n First quarter 2024 adjusted after-tax income attributable to AIG common shareholders, or AATI, was $1.2 billion, flat to last year due to the reduction in our ownership of Corebridge from 77.3% to 52.7% at the end of this quarter. General Insurance adjusted pretax income, or APTI, increased $110 million year-over-year, driven by higher underwriting and net investment income. The prior year quarter included APTI of approximately $175 million from Validus Re and Crop Risk Services. On a comparable basis, excluding the divested businesses, General Insurance APTI was up about $285 million.  \n As Peter noted, first quarter General Insurance underwriting income was $596 million, up $94 million from the prior year quarter. On a comparable basis, underwriting income rose $239 million year-over-year.  \n International Commercial Lines was the primary contributor to higher underwriting profitability with $175 million increase in underwriting income. North America Commercial Lines underwriting income was down $95 million from the prior year quarter as reported but up $35 million on a comparable basis. Underwriting income includes catastrophe losses of $107 million in the quarter or 190 basis points on the loss ratio, down from $265 million or 420 basis points last year.\n Prior year development this quarter was a favorable $34 million compared to a favorable $68 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter's development was solely from the amortization of the deferred gain on the adverse development cover which is recalculated each year based on prior year experience. For 2024, the amortization gain will be $34 million each quarter compared to $41 million a quarter last year. \n Turning to underwriting ratios. The General Insurance calendar year combined ratio was 89.8% this quarter, a 210 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter and a 380 basis point improvement on a comparable basis. We provided additional data on Page 26 of the financial supplement on the impact of the divestitures on 2023 North American commercial combined ratios. \n The accident year combined ratio ex catastrophes was 88.4%, a 30 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter and a 160 basis point improvement on a comparable basis. The accident year loss ratio adjusted for catastrophes was 56.6% this quarter, 10 basis points better than the first quarter of 2023 as reported and 70 basis points better on a comparable basis. This improvement reflects continued earn-in of rate above loss cost trend and better underwriting and risk selection, particularly in Global Commercial lines.\n The expense ratio for the quarter was 31.8%, down 20 basis points from the prior year quarter as reported, with a $43 million reduction in general operating expenses. On a comparable basis, the expense ratio improved 90 basis points with 10 basis points from the acquisition ratio and 80 basis points from the general operating expense ratio, reflecting continued expense discipline as general operating expenses rose only $6 million. \n As Peter covered General Insurance premium growth, I will focus on Commercial Lines new business, renewal rate, loss trends and retention as well as reserves. New business production in Global Commercial remained strong. In North America, new business was almost $450 million and balanced across all lines with excellent performance from Lexington. \n International Commercial new business levels were very good, with over $500 million in the quarter, led by Talbot, Property and Casualty, offset by lower new business in energy and Financial Lines. In North America Commercial, overall rate, excluding workers' compensation, increased 5% in the quarter with exposure adding 2% for overall pricing of 7%, which is above loss cost trend. Excluding workers' comp and Financial Lines, North America commercial rate was up more than 8% in the quarter, with exposure up 2% for overall pricing over 10%, meaningfully above the loss cost trend. \n North America commercial rate increase reflect strengthening pricing trends in Casualty, including Lexington Casualty, which was up 11%; Lexington Healthcare up 15%; and Excess Casualty up 16%. In International Commercial, overall rate increased 3% and exposure added 2% for an overall pricing increase of 5%, modestly ahead of the loss cost trend. Excluding Financial Lines, International rate was up 5% with overall pricing up 7%, well ahead of loss cost trend. The rate increase was driven by Property, which was up 7%; energy up 8%; and marine up 7%. \n As we've discussed, Financial Lines is a notable exception to pricing trends. This was particularly the case in excess. We are taking a long-term view in Financial Lines and remain disciplined on risk selection, terms and conditions, pricing and reserving. While rate trend has been negative the past few quarters, in aggregate, the cumulative rate level in North America Financial Lines is about 50% higher than 5 years ago. \n Renewal retention has improved over the past several years and remained strong. As a reminder, we calculate renewal retention using expiring premiums, excluding the impact of renewal rate and exposure changes on the ratio. Global Commercial retention increased to 89%, stable at 88% in North America and rose to 89% in International.  \n Turning to reserves. I wanted to provide some background on AIG's reserve review schedule for 2024 and quarterly processes. At AIG, we performed detailed valuation reviews, or DVRs, on each book once a year. In DVRs, we look at loss development and trends in prior and current accident years and consider changes in our reserving factors and approaches based on emerged experience. We do not perform DVRs in the first quarter.  \n In the second quarter of 2024, we will review the North America Casualty book, including excess and primary Casualty, Lexington, workers' compensation and mass tort comprising about $20 billion of reserves or 44% of our total reserves. In the third quarter, we will review International Commercial Lines, Global Financial Lines, Commercial Property and other lines, totaling about $22 billion or 47% of reserves with the balance of the DVRs completed in the fourth quarter.  \n Between DVRs, our actuarial team evaluates pricing, claims, loss trends and reserves across the portfolio. Each quarter, we complete an actual versus expected review, or AVE, for each book. The AVE review gives us a current look at trends and the opportunity to address issues prior to the scheduled DVR. Examples of such items include large new claims, notable changes in claims patterns or settlements, changes in attritional loss trends beyond normal ranges or significant major events.  \n We are aware that the industry has begun to address adverse casualty loss development trends in the 2016 to 2019 accident years. On our third quarter 2023 call, Peter provided significant detail on the reunderwriting and repricing of our casualty book that we began in 2018 with an entirely new framework and approach to underwriting. In addition, we changed our reserving assumptions on the book. And by 2021, we had increased reserves on North American Casualty, 2016 through 2019 accident years, by over $1 billion. We also continued to refine our actuarial judgments, and in 2019, we raised the loss cost trend assumption for certain Excess Casualty segments to 10%. And by 2022, all Excess Casualty segments were at or above 10%. \n Our AVE reviews on North American Casualty since the second quarter 2023 DVR continue to show loss experience within the range of our expectations on the 2016 to 2019 accident years. As we have previously outlined, our reserving philosophy is to react to adverse trends quickly and to allow time for favorable trends, particularly in recent accident years, to mature. We did not make any adjustments to our casualty reserves this quarter, in total or within the 2016 to 2019 accident years. AIG's reserves and balance sheet are much stronger today, and our reinsurance is much more comprehensive, helping improve our underwriting results and reduce volatility.\n Turning now to investment income. AIG continues to benefit from reinvestment rates on fixed maturities and loans that exceeded sales and maturities, helping drive higher yields and net investment income in General Insurance and Life and Retirement. This quarter, consolidated net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.5 billion, up 13% from the prior year quarter and up 2% in General Insurance and 16% in Life and Retirement.  \n General Insurance net investment income growth was negatively impacted by the sale of Validus Re, which had a $5 billion portfolio. Adjusted for income on that portfolio in the prior year quarter, General Insurance net investment income rose about 7%, with a 9% increase in fixed maturities and loans driven by higher reinvestment rates.\n This quarter, new money rates on fixed maturities and loans averaged 5.9%, 150 basis points higher than the yield on sales and maturities in the quarter. The new money rates were about 115 basis points higher in General Insurance, and 165 basis points higher in Life and Retirement. \n The annualized yield on fixed maturities and loans, excluding calls, prepayments and other onetime items, was 3.9% in General Insurance, 3 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2023 and 44 basis points higher than the prior year quarter. The sequential yield comparison in General Insurance was negatively impacted by the sale of Validus Re. First quarter General Insurance alternative investment income was $54 million or an annualized return of 5.2% this quarter, down $41 million from the prior year quarter.  \n Continuing to Life and Retirement. Sales and earnings were strong this quarter. First quarter sales remained at historically high levels with premiums and deposits of $10.7 billion driven by strong sales in fixed annuities and pension risk transfer.\n Life and Retirement segment APTI was $991 million, up 12% from the prior year quarter, driven by higher base portfolio spread income due to higher reinvestment rates, higher fee income due to higher market levels and lower general operating expenses, partially offset by lower alternative investment income. Life and Retirement alternative investment income was negative $23 million this quarter for an annualized yield of negative 1.8% due to private equity losses and very low income on hedge funds and real estate compared to breakeven last year. Corebridge's total contribution to AIG's AATI, including corporate expenses, declined by approximately $100 million or 20% over the prior year quarter due to the reduction in our ownership. \n Turning to the balance sheet. Book value per common share was $64.66 this quarter, down 1% from year-end 2023 and up 10% from the prior year quarter, driven mostly by the impact of interest rates. Adjusted book value per share was $77.79, up 1% from year-end 2023 and up 3% from the prior year quarter, reflecting the net impact of earnings, dividends and share repurchases.  \n Peter covered our capital management actions year-to-date. With respect to debt leverage, consolidated debt and preferred stock to total capital, excluding AOCI, which includes $9.4 billion of Corebridge debt, was 23.6% at March 31, down 70 basis points from year-end 2023. Excluding Corebridge debt on a pro forma deconsolidated basis, AIG debt to total capital is expected to be within the new 15% to 20% debt target range that Peter provided.  \n To conclude, AIG delivered another excellent quarter with significant financial and operational accomplishments. In 2024, AIG Next and the deconsolidation of Corebridge will drive significant progress towards achieving our 10%-plus adjusted ROCE goal. We are confident in our ability to achieve this goal and look forward to updating you on our progress.  \n With that, I will turn the call back over to Peter. Yes. Thank you, Peter. What I would just observe is, as we've stated in the past, and I'll reiterate today, all of our General Insurance subsidiaries or Tier 1 subsidiaries on a global basis have capital at or above our target ranges. And within the United States pool, which is the largest pool of our General Insurance capital, our risk-based capital ratios at the end of last year were around 460%, which is well higher than many of our peers.\n So what I would note is that within the General Insurance companies, we're strongly capitalized to be able to support growth, obviously, protected by the reinsurance programs that we have. But I would just, as a general note, comment that premiums to surplus leverage isn't the best way to look at capital within a General Insurance company, particularly given a company like AIG, which is a leading player in Casualty and Specialty lines across the globe. Yes, thanks. The thing you should keep in mind is that with the amount of shares that we can repurchase or can be repurchased by a company in any given month, whether it's an ASR or it's a 10b5-1 plan or open market purchases, it's constrained by the same factor, which is the average daily trading volume. \n We have looked at doing ASRs. And to date, what we've preferred to do is just be consistently in the market every day through a 10b5-1 plan.

            "name": "Peter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review our first quarter 2024 financial results. Following my remarks, Sabra will provide more detail on the quarter and then we'll take questions. Kevin Hogan will join us for the Q&A portion of the call.\n Here are some highlights from the quarter. Adjusted after-tax income was $1.2 billion or $1.77 per diluted common share, representing a 9% increase in earnings per share year-over-year. Consolidated net investment income on an adjusted pretax income basis was $3.5 billion, a 13% increase year-over-year. General Insurance underwriting income was $596 million, a 19% increase year-over-year, reflecting improved accident year results, including lower catastrophes and increased 67% year-over-year on a comparable basis, if you exclude divested businesses from the prior year quarter.  \n The accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 88.4%, a 30 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter and was the tenth consecutive quarter of a sub-90 combined ratio. The quarter also reflected the significant improvement we have made in controlling volatility in our property portfolio as total catastrophe-related losses in the quarter were $107 million or 1.9%, representing a 230 basis point improvement year-over-year. \n Turning to Life and Retirement. The business reported very good results with premiums and deposits of $10.7 billion in the first quarter, their highest quarterly result achieved in the last decade, and strong APTI growth of 12% over the prior year quarter. \n Last September, Corebridge entered into a definitive agreement to sell the U.K. Life Insurance business to Aviva plc, which calls on April 8. Net proceeds were approximately $550 million and will be used for Corebridge share repurchases.  \n During the quarter, we returned over $2.4 billion to shareholders through $1.7 billion of common stock repurchases, $250 million of dividends and the redemption of all our outstanding Series A preferred stock for $500 million. We repaid $459 million of debt upon maturity, lowering our total debt to $9.8 billion. In addition, we repurchased approximately $613 million of common stock in April. \n Based on our strong performance, the AIG Board of Directors approved an 11% increase in AIG's quarterly common stock dividend to $0.40 per share. The AIG Board of Directors also increased the share repurchase authorization to $10 billion, effective May 1. Lastly, we ended the first quarter with strong parent liquidity of $5.1 billion. Overall, I'm very pleased with our first quarter results and the continued strong execution of our strategy to deliver sustained underwriting excellence, profitability and disciplined capital management.\n During my remarks this morning, I will discuss 4 important topics: first, I will provide some financial highlights in the quarter focused on the General Insurance business, including some insight into our net premiums written; second, I will talk briefly about the results in Life and Retirement; third, I will provide an update on our capital management strategy, specifically our plans for 2024 and 2025; and finally, I will discuss our path to a 10%-plus ROCE and provide more detail on AIG Next and our future state operating structure that will create value through a leaner and more unified company. \n Let me take a moment to update you on our sell-down of Corebridge. Our Corebridge holdings currently stand at 324 million common shares outstanding, which represents a 53% ownership stake. We continue to explore all alternatives to reduce our ownership stake in Corebridge. Once Corebridge is deconsolidated from AIG, Life and Retirement's balance sheet and income statement will no longer be included in AIG's consolidated financial statements, and our remaining ownership stake will be reported in parent investments with dividends reported in net investment income. \n Sabra went through this in detail on our last earnings call. We have been evaluating opportunities to maximize long-term value for Corebridge and have considered multiple strategic alternatives that we believe will best position Corebridge for future success. We remain committed to reducing AIG's ownership and to fully selling our remaining stake, and I will continue to provide updates to all of our stakeholders.  \n In terms of the use of Corebridge-related proceeds, AIG expects to continue to utilize excess capital and liquidity, with a focus on returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and liability management, which I will discuss later when I outline our capital management strategy.\n Now turning to General Insurance. Net premiums written were $4.5 billion and reflected the impact of the dispositions of Validus Re and Crop Risk Services as well as actions we've taken to restructure specific treaty reinsurance. Overall, Global Commercial had a very strong quarter. Excluding the impact of our divestitures, Global Commercial net premiums written growth was 1% year-over-year.\n First, I want to reconfirm the guidance for the year. We expect high single-digit growth in net premiums written for the full year in our Global Commercial Insurance business. Now the results. In North America Commercial, net premiums written grew 4%. Lexington grew 24%, which was led by Casualty and Western World. Our Excess Casualty line grew 46% and our Captive Solutions grew 20%.  \n There's been meaningful commentary on the Excess & Surplus Lines market, and we continue to experience terrific fundamentals and results in Lexington. Let me provide a few examples. Our submission volume was up over 50% year-over-year. Lexington delivered strong new business, outperforming last year's record first quarter results, balanced across all lines. And retention remains strong for Lexington at 78%. \n Shifting to North America Retail Property, net premiums written were negative $120 million in the quarter, driven by first quarter reinsurance purchased and had over a 600 basis point impact on the first quarter net premiums written growth for North America commercial compared to prior year. North America Financial Lines declined 4% year-over-year. In prior quarters, we provided meaningful commentary on the dynamics within Financial Lines, so I will not go through that again. \n It's been a challenging market environment with continued headwinds on rate. Having said that, we continue to believe our portfolio is strong, and we remain disciplined. Sabra will give more detail in her prepared remarks. \n In International Commercial, net premiums written were flat for the quarter. International Property grew 23%, and Talbot grew 18%. This was offset by a decline in our Global Specialty business of slightly over 10% due to some top line weakness in energy and the effects of the reinsurance restructuring. Also, we had a 5% decline in International Financial Lines. \n Now turning to the combined ratio. Our Global Commercial business in the first quarter had an outstanding result with an 84.4% accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophe, a 150 basis point improvement year-over-year. The accident year combined ratio, including catastrophe, was 86.6%, a 500 basis point improvement year-over-year. \n This was led by International Commercial which, on a comparable basis, had an 82.8% accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophe, which is a 140 basis point improvement year-over-year; and an 83.5% accident year combined ratio, including catastrophe, which is a 770 basis point improvement year-over-year.\n North America Commercial also had an outstanding result with an 85.9% accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophe, which is a 180 basis point improvement year-over-year; and an 89.5% accident year combined ratio, including catastrophe which is a 260 basis point improvement year-over-year. These results were simply outstanding and are a testament to our commitment and culture of underwriting excellence.  \n Shifting now to global Personal Insurance. Net premiums written were flat to prior year. We had modest growth in Personal Auto and Individual Travel and reductions in high net worth driven largely by reinsurance and Accident & Health, largely driven by 2 nonrenewals in China, as part of our focus on portfolio improvements in our Accident & Health business.  \n North America Personal had a 97.7% accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophe. This is a 990 basis point improvement year-over-year and a 101.6% accident year combined ratio, including catastrophe, which is an 870 basis point improvement year-over-year.  \n As we discussed last year, we expect a material financial improvement in 2024 that will be driven by higher earned premium and a lower loss ratio from the high net worth business. We saw this manifest in the first quarter and expect this improvement to continue throughout 2024.  \n International parcel insurance had a 96.8% accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophe, which increased 90 basis points year-over-year; and a 96.8% accident year combined ratio, including catastrophe, which is a 20 basis point improvement year-over-year. Overall, I'm very pleased with the financial performance of General Insurance, which delivered another excellent quarter.  \n Our reinsurance decisions in the first quarter had an impact on net premiums written. As we've discussed over the past several years, our reinsurance partnerships and global treaty structures have been purposeful. Our objective has been to deliver improved underwriting profitability and evolve our business portfolio to be appropriately diversified to deliver consistent results throughout the market cycle.  \n We believe this strategy has provided sustained value to our clients while also delivering improved risk-adjusted returns. It has significantly repositioned AIG, especially as we prepare to deconsolidate from Corebridge. Our goals with our reinsurance purchasing have been to preserve and optimize capital and enhance the quality of earnings through active management of the volatility of our underwriting results. This deliberate approach to reinsurance has helped position AIG with a very strong balance sheet and has given us the flexibility to add exposure where risk-adjusted returns are very attractive while also moderating volatility in our underwriting results. \n As a result of our divestiture of Validus Re, combined with the reduction in gross limits in property through our underwriting strategy, we have reduced our PMLs and created meaningful capacity to increase our property writings throughout our global platform should they meet our expected returns. Without going through each return period by peril and region, our key zone PMLs on average, have decreased by over 40% compared to the first quarter of 2023, which provides considerable aggregate for future growth while appropriately managing the exposures we're assuming. \n Our reinsurance purchasing is deliberately concentrated at January 1. As a result, any changes in purchasing tend to be more pronounced in the first quarter reporting of net premiums written. In January 2024, we also made some changes related to the allocation of catastrophe costs among the businesses, so that catastrophe costs are more accurately reflected in pricing. Historically, some of these costs have been shared with Validus Re. We reallocated PMLs and the catastrophe costs to where we believe the most attractive opportunities for growth existed in our portfolio.\n It's worth noting, when considering our property catastrophe placement, we believe we have the lowest attachment point of our peer group. Over time, we have the balance sheet and perhaps the risk appetite to take more net on our catastrophe program post deconsolidation and subject to market conditions.  \n As a point of reference, if we chose to raise our catastrophe attachment point to $500 million worldwide, our attachment point would likely remain the lowest among our peer group with 1 in 11 attachment point in North America wind and 1 in 19 attachment in North America earthquake based on today's exposure. Importantly, our net premiums written in commercial would have been 15% greater in the first quarter if we had elected to have a $500 million attachment point across our global portfolio.  \n Our earnings potential is significant. And when combined with the strength of our balance sheet, it will provide us with the flexibility to continuously evaluate and refine our strategic reinsurance purchasing as we enter 2025. \n Turning to Life and Retirement. As I noted earlier, the business continued to produce strong results in the first quarter. In April, Corebridge completed their Corebridge forward restructuring. $400 million of savings has been actioned or contracted, and they expect to realize the vast majority of the savings by the end of 2024 at a cost to achieve of $300 million.  \n Corebridge repurchased approximately $240 million of common shares during the first quarter, and they have repurchased $370 million of common shares year-to-date. Corebridge ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet with parent liquidity of $1.7 billion. This week, the Corebridge Board of Directors approved a share buyback authorization of $2 billion, which reflects their stated commitment to delivering a 60% to 65% payout ratio to shareholders, subject to market conditions. \n Turning to other operations. We have made significant progress towards our future state operating model. Adjusted pretax loss from other operations in the quarter, including Life and Retirement, was $408 million, a 17% improvement year-over-year. The improvement was primarily attributable to lower general operating expense, higher short-term investment income and lower interest expense at AIG due to debt reduction actions. We expect our future state parent expenses to be in the range of $325 million to $350 million by year-end 2024. After deconsolidation, we intend to use 1% to 1.5% of net premiums earned as a benchmark of total parent expenses in the future.  \n Turning to capital management. In the first quarter, we continue to execute on our balanced capital management strategy. Over the past couple of years, we have significantly strengthened our balance sheet by making key decisions that have increased our financial flexibility while always planning for the long term, which has allowed us to accelerate the execution of our strategy and unlock meaningful value for AIG shareholders.  \n Along with establishing appropriate debt capital structures for AIG and Corebridge and diligently executing on AIG's capital management priorities, we have also completed over $40 billion of capital market transactions since 2022. We have been very disciplined in the execution of the components of our capital management strategy that we first outlined in 2022.  \n As a reminder, our objectives were: to maintain very strong insurance company capital levels to support organic growth and a steady source of operating subsidiary dividends to service parent company needs; to reduce our total debt outstanding and improve our leverage ratios, providing a well-structured and well-laddered debt portfolio with no outsized amounts due in any given year, particularly over the next 5 years; to return excess capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends; to increase our dividend as our earnings and financial flexibility improved; and to maintain a strong parent liquidity position.  \n All of our Tier 1 insurance company subsidiaries are at or above their target capital ranges and have the ability to support meaningful growth without additional capital contributions. At current profitability levels, we had approximately $3 billion of run rate dividend capacity from our global General Insurance subsidiaries with approximately $2 billion attributable to the U.S. General Insurance company's dividend capacity. \n We have increased the U.S. General Insurance company dividend capacity by approximately 400% over the last 3 years. This reflects a significant increase from 2021, when it was $550 million; and in 2022, when it was $1.4 billion. Looking forward, we expect to continue positioning AIG with maximum capital flexibility for growth, including reviewing our reinsurance over time and considering compelling and strategic inorganic growth opportunities should they exist.  \n In addition to strong insurance company capitalization, we've continued to significantly reduce our overall debt. Outstanding debt is now approximately $9.8 billion, a reduction of over $12 billion since the end of 2021, which has been a remarkable result for AIG. We had previously provided guidance that we're targeting a 20% to 25% total debt-to-capital ratio, and we expect to be in the 15% to 20% range upon deconsolidation.\n While we may do additional work on maturities, we would not expect that to take priority over share repurchases. Since 2022, we've increased our focus on share repurchase activities. We completed over $5 billion of repurchases in 2022 and approximately $3 billion in 2023. Looking ahead, we expect up to $6 billion in repurchases in 2024 and up to $4 billion in 2025, depending on the timing of future Corebridge sell-downs and market conditions.\n All of the expected activity in 2024 and 2025 will be covered by the $10 billion share authorization that we announced yesterday. For the balance of 2024, we expect to be able to repurchase about $1.5 billion of common stock a quarter depending on excess parent liquidity levels, including future Corebridge sale proceeds, General Insurance dividends and market conditions. \n And based on the current stock price, we would expect this to get us closer to the higher end of our target share count range of 600 million to 650 million common shares by the end of the second quarter and towards the lower end of the range by the end of 2024. Furthermore, based on this outlook and depending on the stock price and market conditions, we would expect to be between 550 million and 600 million shares outstanding by year-end 2025.  \n Turning to our dividend. The AIG Board of Directors recently increased the cash dividend of $0.40 per share on AIG common stock up 11%, the second consecutive year with an increase of more than 10%. I could not be more pleased with our progress. We remain confident in our ability to deliver while continuing the positive momentum in our financial performance. \n We remain committed to delivering an adjusted 10%-plus ROCE post deconsolidation of Corebridge. For the first quarter, we achieved a 9.3% adjusted ROCE and a 13.3% adjusted ROCE in General Insurance. Contributing to ROCE will be AIG Next, which will focus on achieving an expense base that will generate additional savings for AIG while reducing complexity throughout our organization and simplifying how we operate. AIG Next will create clarity in our operating structure, including aligning our underwriting and claims organizations with our operations and functions while defining our parent company of the future.  \n This is the key objective as we weave AIG together. To be a less complex, more effective and leaner company with the appropriate infrastructure and capabilities for the business we will be post deconsolidation. AIG Next has clearly defined work streams governed by a very experienced, centralized team with significant experience in transformations and company design reporting directly to me. \n As I stated on previous calls, we expect AIG Next to generate approximately $500 million in annual run rate savings by the end of 2025. Of the $500 million in run rate savings, we expect $350 million to be actioned in 2024, which is an increase of the guidance we have provided in the past, and the balance will be actioned within 2025 with a cost to achieve of $500 million.  \n To date, we've made meaningful progress on AIG Next across multiple work streams. In April, we announced a voluntary early retirement program available to colleagues in the United States who meet the eligibility criteria. Eligible participants will have the opportunity to accelerate their retirement from AIG with enhanced retirement benefits. \n The population of eligible participants represents approximately 25% of our U.S. workforce. About half of the eligible participants are located in the high-cost New York metropolitan area. We are anticipating a 50% take-up rate, which would result in approximately $225 million of onetime cost and a net run rate benefit of approximately $150 million after reinvestment for the skills and capabilities we need for the future. The numbers I have provided for our early retirement program are included in the total numbers I provided for AIG Next.  \n In summary, I'm very pleased with our overall performance as we start 2024. As I said in my recent letter to shareholders, our ability to execute continues to be one of the company's best attributes. We have accomplished a significant amount in the past several years in order to position AIG for the future, and we have continued to deliver in the first quarter, which will enable us to achieve our objectives in 2024 and beyond.\n I am confident that we will continue to uphold our commitment to achieving underwriting excellence and high-quality earnings over the long term, benefiting all of our stakeholders as we continue to simplify and streamline our business and create the AIG of tomorrow.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Sabra. Thank you, Sabra. And operator, we're ready for questions. Thanks, Mike. It's a very good question. We are going to stay very committed to the capital management structure we outlined, which is why I gave guidance on not only '24 but '25 in terms of share repurchases.\n I think we've been consistent, and I added in when we're more comprehensive in our description in terms of capital management, that should inorganic opportunities exist, and they're compelling, which just means does it add product, does it add geography? Not scale and size, but just something that does help us strategically reposition ourselves. I wouldn't want to rule that out, but it's not a priority in the short term. And so that's really the context of what I provide in my prepared remarks. Yes. Thanks. It's a very good question. Let me start on growth. You can't -- one is you can't always look at broker index. Again, I don't know what Marsh index tracks, but sometimes, they don't catch fee business. They don't really catch the entire sort of market, which is the market we play in. \n I do think it's conducive to grow. We don't look for top line growth to sacrifice profitability, and I think we evidenced that in this quarter and we've evidenced it over the past couple of years, that we continue to want to improve our combined ratios and look at businesses where the best risk-adjusted returns are. And so we have shaped the portfolio that way.\n It's hard in any one quarter to sometimes draw conclusions like you saw in terms of the gross premium written in this quarter. It's really driven by 3 lines: Specialty; Financial Lines; and Casualty. The first quarter was impacted in International by energy within the Specialty class. But it's a great business, we're a world leader in that class, great underwriting capabilities and global distribution. And expect us to continue to grow that, and it's a very attractive combined ratio. \n So I think there's a little bit of noise. We had some captives. We had reinsurance impact the quarter, because we switched from some pro rata to excess of loss. I don't think I need to go into too much more detail on Financial Lines. It's definitely an area where we watch very carefully. Sabra provided a lot of great context in her prepared remarks. But we're going to focus on making sure we have the highest-quality book. \n I mean, our retention I think, spoke volumes this quarter in terms of the portfolio we like. I mean, with 89% in International, 88% in North America, across the board, that was tremendous, good new business. And so we definitely find opportunities. \n I mean, the one area I just want to just note. Because Lexington, we talk about it every quarter because it just continues to just be exceptional. But the market dynamics have changed quite a bit. And when we look at Excess & Surplus lines, we think there's great opportunities to continue to grow. Even though there may have been some slowdown in Property, there's other lines of business, like casualty that we're seeing massive submission activity. And I just wouldn't look at the E&S market as a hard market play or a soft market play. It's just a market that's going to be here to stay in a different way. And so we're very much investing in that. I think the margins are great and the growth opportunities are significant. There's not a whole lot more I can offer in terms of the prepared remarks. Every sell-down has been important, but this one is particularly important just because we would likely become a seller of shares that will deconsolidate Corebridge. So we continue to focus on making certain we're looking at every option available. \n And considering all of those variables, Corebridge has done a significant amount of work working with AIG and independently to position itself to be a separate public company. It's done an exceptional job. We're completed, most of our transition service agreements, which just means they're more operationally prepared to go. \n And so again, subject to market conditions, I think my guidance I gave last quarter stands. We would expect to try and do something before the end of the second quarter. Yes. Thanks, Elyse. I think while we gave the guidance into 2025 is -- what I said in my prepared remarks is that by the end of the second quarter, if we exercise on the share repurchases that we've outlined, we would be at the higher end of the range of the 600 million to 650 million. And if we continue the $1.5 billion a quarter, which, yes, would contemplate doing a sell-down of Corebridge. But there's other forms of liquidity that come into AIG, but we would need to sell down to be able to do the $1.5 billion in the third and fourth quarter, but that gets us to the lower end of the range.\n And then as we continue to do future sell-downs, we would get below the 600 million share count, which is why we decided to give a little bit more guidance as we get into 2025. It does not include a sell-down to 0, but it does contemplate several transactions that would take place in the next 4 quarters. I would take it as just an update. We would have gone past our current Board authorization with the 2025 guidance and worked very closely with the AIG Board of Directors to talk about what we expected the capital management strategy to be in the next 6 quarters. And that's really how we derive the $10 billion. But I wouldn't think about it anything more than that. Well, in terms of the portfolio, I'm comfortable today taking more net. But what we've done over this multiyear period in terms of strategically positioning the reinsurance is working very closely with our reinsurance partners, looking across multiple lines of business and multiple geographies in the placement of reinsurance. And then also making certain that we control volatility in this period of transition. That's been really important.\n I want to emphasize that because we not only are looking at our accident year combined ratios, excluding catastrophe, we have kept our retentions or lowered them in a period of high uncertainty and high volatility because we don't want to have any outsized losses or surprises perhaps or an active cat season. \n Also, I think we're very different than other insurance companies in terms of how we purchase reinsurance. It's not done at the business level. It is not done within just the finance function or treasury, it's done -- reports directly to me. And so I work very closely with Charlie Fry, work very closely with Sabra in terms of what our risk appetite is going to be for that particular year. And we've protected capital and had more quality earnings as a result of some of the reinsurance that we place. \n A couple of examples of things that are just very good, but impacted the first quarter is switching more to excess of loss in certain segments like energy, we transitioned and proportionally signed down a little bit of the quota share. But it wasn't economic because we ended up getting a better outcome on the quota share with 200 basis points of improvement. So it's just repositioning the portfolio. Did the same thing with property cat.\n And the reason I just gave the example on our earnings and sort of prepared remarks is just, on property cat, we can absolutely take more net if we decide to as we enter 2025, depending on the portfolio and depending on our appetite for volatility. We'll still have one of the lowest attachment points of any of our peers across the world.\n We enhanced coverage. There's a lot more coverage in our property cat. We've enhanced our high net worth business in terms of excess of loss and more comprehensive coverage. And also -- again, and I'll stop here because I could go on for hours on this discussion, but is on casualty, we renewed or improved our overall construct across the globe based on the quality of our growth portfolio. \n So to start thinking about ways in which we can do reinsurance differently will not have anything really to do with the gross portfolio because they're very much like that. It's more of where do we want volatility and where do we want to take more net? And we see opportunities as we enter 2025. Sure. I'll ask Sabra to comment on some of the leverage within the insurance company subsidiaries. We see great opportunities for us to grow within -- across the world. And you've mentioned Property and specifics. We have significantly reduced PMLs, which means we have aggregate to grow. And we have the capital to grow. \n And the interesting part of AIG is that when we look at Property, we have so many different points of entry depending on the risk-adjusted returns that exist. If I start in the United States, and this is not all inclusive, but just as a few examples, we have Lexington E&S property, we have Retail Property, we have the high net worth business, and that can be done on an admitted or non-admitted basis. We have Retail Property. In International, we have Japan Property that's specific to Japan. We have Talbot. And we have Global Specialty. So there's so many different points of entry. Depending on the risk-adjusted returns, we can scale up or scale down, but believe that there's going to be great opportunities for us in the future. \n Yes. I mean, the first quarter tempered on Property. But look, we're not in the cat season yet, and our industry is famous of just framing out the market at a point in time. We got a long ways to go this year in terms of where the opportunities exist, but we absolutely have the leverage to  grow if we like the risk-adjusted returns. \n Sabra, do you want to comment on that? Thank you. We do see great opportunities in Casualty. We highlighted some of the performance in the quarter. We had to start, because of the portfolio that existed, reunderwriting the Casualty portfolio well before, I think, it was discussed really in the industry. And with that, became a new underwriting philosophy, new underwriting strategy, new terms and conditions, new attachment points, net limit, gross limits, pricing, margin. And so that's been a journey for us for years. \n We mentioned the 16% in Excess Casualty in terms of rate is as strong as we've seen in the past several years. And so that we do think there's a lot of capacity pulling back. We have very comprehensive reinsurance to mitigate volatility and enable us to put out limits depending on our risk appetite. And obviously, we're cautious. We're watching the different lines of business within Casualty and their trends, but absolutely see opportunities to grow. \n And when you look at our premium, don't think about it as we've grown policy count or limit, it's actually the opposite. I mean, like our client count, policy count and limits are all dramatically reduced when you compare them to 3 or 4 years ago. It's just been the effect of where we participated and how we price the business. And believe that, again, we're going to be cautious, but there are real opportunities for growth in the current market. I wish I could provide a little bit more detail on the first part of the question. We're looking at all alternatives, all size. I mean, so much is market-dependent. You have certain windows. And we want to make sure -- we have multiple stakeholders, I mean, within Corebridge shareholders, AIG shareholders, so sort of balancing that is really important for us.\n But as I said in my answer and prepared remarks, we're ready to go. Everybody is anxious to move forward, but we're going to make sure we do it in a very methodical way to where we don't do anything that's not in the best interest of all that we've done so far and our stakeholders. So we will consider multiple options and keep everybody updated. \n On the ASR, I mean, I think we've largely thought about this, and Sabra, if you want to comment to close out. We've done share repurchase in a methodical way. We always consider different ways in which we can do it. But maybe you can just comment, and then I'll close it out. Thanks, Sabra. And in closing, I just want to thank all of our colleagues around the world for their continued dedication, teamwork, execution on all the progress we've made. And I want to thank everybody for joining us today and your questions. Everybody, have a great day."
