[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your host today, Peter Salkowski, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nPeter Salkowski: Thank you, Sarah. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Peter Salkowski, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fortinet. I\u2019m pleased to welcome everyone to our call to discuss Fortinet\u2019s fiscal results for fourth quarter of 2020. Speakers on today\u2019s call are Ken Xie, Fortinet\u2019s Founder, Chairman and CEO; and Keith Jensen our CFO. This is a live call that will be available for replay via webcast on our Investor Relations website. Ken will begin our call today by providing a high-level perspective on our business. Keith will then review our financial and operating results for the fourth quarter, providing guidance for the first quarter of 2020 and the full year. We\u2019ll then open the call for questions. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please keep your questions brief and limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question, to allow others to participate. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that on today\u2019s call we will be making forward-looking statements and these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Please refer to our SEC filings, in particular, the Risk Factors in our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for more information. All forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation and specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also, all references to financial metrics that we make on today\u2019s call are non-GAAP, unless stated otherwise. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations is located in our earnings press release and in the presentation that accompanies today\u2019s remarks, both of which are posted on the Investor Relations website. Lastly, all references to growth are on a year-over-year basis, unless noted otherwise. I will now turn the call over to Ken.\nKen Xie: Thanks, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining today\u2019s call to review our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results. Fourth quarter billing increased 20% to $961 million. Our secure SD-WAN offering accounted for over 13% of fourth quarter billing. Product revenue accelerated quarter-over-quarter to 21%, contributing to a total revenue growth of 21%. Operating margin benefited from solid revenue performance. We achieved all-time company record non-GAAP operating margin of 29.4% for the fourth quarter. Given the many opportunities ahead, we plan to shift our focus more to growth for the at least next few quarters. Today, we announced the FortiOS 7.0 with 300 new features and updates. With this release, Fortinet is the only leading cybersecurity vendor to offer firewall-based zero trust network access enabling remote access to replace the traditional VPN. This reduces attack surface while improving the user experience. Fortinet\u2019s Zero Trust Network Access solution also simplifies management by using the same access policy, whether on or off network. Tighter integration of a SASE solution with the FortiOS 7.0 gives enterprises the flexibility they need to enable their workforce to work from home with consistent, enterprise-grade security delivered on-premise, or now, via cloud-based SASE consumption for security-as-a-service. The FortiOS 7.0 extends network connectivity and security beyond the WAN Edge with innovations in 5G and LTE that improve the wireless network performance and increase resiliency. Our 5G offering enables organizations to achieve secure, scalable and highly available network connectivity anywhere. The release of FortiOS 7.0 expands the Fortinet Security Fabric delivering on our mission to provide broad, integrated and automated security to any device, any application everywhere. Cybersecurity is at an inflection point. And increasingly, organizations are consolidating towards a platform approach and not just a separate platform for endpoint, network security or cloud security but a holistic platform that is integrated, automated across all this area. The Fortinet Security Fabric is a cyber security platform built on broad and deep set of networking security technology from endpoint to network to cloud, organically built to seamlessly communicate and operate together. This consolidation with our security-driven networking approach will be key drivers going forward. Today Fortinet is recognized in 8th Gartner Magic Quadrant. Our FortiGate product is a leader in both, SD-WAN and the Next Generation Firewall Magic Quadrant. We continue to experience excellent adoption of our secure SD-WAN and expect our unique solution to become a market share leader within a few years. In addition, for our growth drivers, we estimate our total addressable market will grow at an annual compound rate of a 10% over the next four years to reach $93 billion by 2024. The recent SolarWinds security incident and the pandemic elevated the need for a broad, integrated and automated platform. And we expect companies will raise the percentage of IT spending used for security as they work to secure their entire infrastructure across multiple edges in a zero trust environment. Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers and partners worldwide for their continuous support to manage our response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Keith?\nKeith Jensen: Thank you, Ken.  Let\u2019s start the fourth quarter review with revenue. Total revenue of $748 million was up 21%. Product revenue was up 21%. Service revenue was up 21%. Product revenue of $288 million saw substantial sequential acceleration in growth relating from strong demand for fabric -- Security Fabric Platform and FortiGate across all form factors, hardware, software, and virtual machine. While secure SD-WAN use cases continued their dramatic growth, the majority of product revenue was driven by the wide range of other operating system capabilities embedded in FortiGates and their related use cases. Service revenue of $460 million benefited from strong demand for fabric and cloud security solutions. Support and professional services revenue increased 21% to $210 million. The revenue mix shift from 8x5 to 24x7 support was 12 points, with 24x7 now representing 66% of the mix. Security subscription services and cloud provider revenue increased 21% to $249 million. Moving to the mix of FortiGate and non-FortiGate revenue. Network security revenue increased 18%, driven by the high end and entry-level FortiGate product families. Non-FortiGate products and service revenue increased 29%, driven by a 34% increase in revenue for fabric and cloud security solutions. Before continuing with the fourth quarter results, I\u2019d like to highlight our 2020 full-year revenue performance. In the midst of a pandemic induced recession, total revenue for the year grew 20% to $2.6 billion. We take great pride in our focus on organic growth. And 2020 represents the third consecutive year with revenue growth of 20%. This consistent performance speaks to our geographic and customer diversity, the continued success of the integrated platform strategy, and our proprietary ASIC advantage that enables a shared operating system across the platform, drives our cost per performance advantage, increase the capacity to add features and functions while maintaining price points. Total non-FortiGate revenue for the year grew over 25% to more than $725 million. In other words, our fabric, cloud and other security products and services are on a pace to be a $1 billion business as we exit 2021. Our non-FortiGate and FortiGate products and solutions include a complete range of form factors and delivery methods, including physical and virtual appliances, cloud, SaaS and perpetual software, as well as hosted and non-hosted solutions. Together, they provide a range of security solutions and form factors, enabling integrated protection for hybrid environments, and their expanding digital attack surface and edges. Pivoting back to our Q4 results, let\u2019s turn to revenue by geo. Our geographic revenue performance continued to align with the pandemic\u2019s economic path, and with it highlighted the geographic diversification of our business. As summarized on slide 7, revenue in Asia Pacific increased 23% as many Asian countries and economies continue to remain largely open. EMEA revenue increased 22%, and the Americas posted revenue growth of 20%. Let\u2019s shift to billings. Total fourth quarter billings were $961 million, up 20%. FortiGate billings increased 16% and accounted for 71% of total billings. As shown on slide 9, high-end and entry-level FortiGates posted strong billings growth for the quarter. Non-FortiGate billings increased 29% of total billings, driven by demand for fabric and cloud security solutions. As with revenue, geo billings performance aligns with the economic path of the pandemic. In terms of growth, APAC billings outperformed all geos, followed by Europe and the Americas. The Americas reflect the continuing impact of the pandemic and especially in Latin America. Moving to billings by customer segments. The small enterprise segment posted solid growth across all geos, illustrating the strength of our Engage channel partner program. This segment is driven by new customer acquisitions, customer security fabric expansions, solid execution by our channel partners and the large diverse makeup of this multinational customer segment. Moving to worldwide billings by industry verticals. The worldwide government sector topped all verticals at 17% of total billings and grew 28% with another strong performance from our international team. Service providers and MSSPs accounted for 16% of total billings. Retail accounted for 10% of total billings, up 2 percentage points quarter-over-quarter. And Education continued to rebound with billings growth up 26% year-over-year. Looking now at deals by dollar size. We had 68 deals over $1 million in the fourth quarter compared to 64 deals in the fourth quarter of 2019. Secure SD-WAN accounted for 16 deals over $1 million, versus 11 deals in the fourth quarter of 2019. On a full year basis, SD-WAN accounted for approximately 11% of our total billings and doubled year-over-year. Moving back to the income statement. As shown on slide 4, gross margin improved 40 basis points to 78.5%. The strong 29% quarter-over-quarter product revenue growth created a mix shift from services to product revenue. The mix shift was a headwind for quarter-over-quarter gross margin comparisons. Product gross margin improved 130 basis points to 63.2%. Product gross margin continued to benefit from a higher mix of software products and the lower direct cost of our newer generation of FortiGate products. Operating margin for the fourth quarter increased 210 basis points to 29.4%, benefiting from the gross margin improvement and continued lower travel and marketing program expenses, offset by the addition of new sales team members as we continue to prepare for additional growth. At the end of the year, the total headcount was 8,238, an increase of 16%. Moving to the statement of cash flow summarized on slides 10, 11 and 12. Cash flow for the fourth quarter came in at $264 million. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 300,000 shares of our common stock for a total cost of $34 million. For the full year, we repurchased 11.7 million shares for a total cost of $1.1 billion. At the end of the fourth quarter, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $1 billion with the authorization set to expire at the end of February in 2022. Throughout the pandemic, we have leveraged the strength of our balance sheet as a competitive advantage to support our partners and customers as they experience geo-specific economic challenges. As a result, average days sales outstanding increased 8 days to 87 days, in line with our expectations and reflecting our decision to provide geographically targeted extended payment plans. Inventory turns improved to 2.7 times from 2.1 times in the third quarter and was relatively flat year-over-year. We expect extended payment terms and higher inventory balances to be in effect as we move through at least the first half of 2021. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $32 million, including $22 million related to construction and other real estate activity. We estimate capital expenditures for the first quarter between $50 million and $60 million, and for all of 2021 to be between $150 million and $170 million. 2021 CapEx projects include expanding our data center footprint and spending that was moved from 2020 due to delays in the new campus building. The average contract term in the fourth quarter was approximately 28 months, up less than 2 months from the fourth quarter of 2019. The growth in SD-WAN and other large enterprise deals contributed to the increase. As we look forward, I\u2019d like to review our outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2021, summarized on slide 13, which is subject to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the first quarter, we expect billings in the range of $765 million to $780 million; revenue in the range of $670 million is $685 million; non-GAAP gross margin of 78.5% to 79.5%; non-GAAP operating margin of 22.5% to 23.5%, reflecting the typical revenue seasonality associated with the first quarter; non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.70 to $0.75, which assumes a share count of between 167 million and 169 million. We expect the non-GAAP tax rate of 21%. Before providing our 2021 guidance, I\u2019d like to congratulate every member of the Fortinet team, for the truly outstanding execution in 2020 in the face of unprecedented challenges and rapidly changing and unpredictable dynamics. The effort and results have been outstanding. And this is on top of now several years of consistent, predictable performance, and continuing improvements in key growth and profitability metrics. Today, we reported our third consecutive year of total revenue growth of 20%, while increasing our non-GAAP operating margin, an average of over 200 basis points a year for the same period. Our goal remains to balance growth and profitability within the framework we have provided. As Ken mentioned, given the many growth opportunities that lie ahead, we currently plan to tilt our bias within this framework, more towards growth for at least the next several quarters. The opportunities we see are supported by a strong pipeline heading into 2021, increased sales capacity and our development efforts, which include the NP7 chip and our new FortiOS 7.0 operating system. With that, for 2021, we expect billings in the range of $3,560 million to $3,640 million, which at the midpoint represents growth of approximately 17%; revenue in the range of $3,025 million to $3,075 million, which at the midpoint represents growth of 18%; total service revenue in the range of $2,015 million to $2,045 million, which represents growth of approximately 21% and implies product revenue growth of approximately 11% and $1 billion in product revenue for 2021, quite the milestone for Fortinet; non-GAAP gross margin of 78% to 80%; non-GAAP operating margin of 25% to 27%. When backing out the 2020 T&E benefit, the midpoint of guidance represents a 50 to 100 basis-point increase in operating margin for 2021. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.60 to $3.75, which assumes a share count of between 170 million to 172 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 21%. We expect cash taxes to be approximately $80 million. Now, with Ken, I\u2019d like to thank our partners, customers and the Fortinet team for all their support and hard work during these difficult and unique times. I\u2019d also like to offer a special welcome to the Panopta team. And I\u2019ll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A session.\nPeter Salkowski: Thank you, Keith. Operator, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Goldman Sachs.\nBrian Essex: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. And congrats on a great set of results. Maybe, Ken, if I could ask, you\u2019ve got a number of different product cycles ahead of you this year. You\u2019ve got NP7. You\u2019ve already talked about SD-WAN. You\u2019ve got hyperscale penetration and potential exposure to 5G. Can you maybe talk about the contribution from each of those that\u2019s embedded in your guidance? And, what are you seeing currently in the market, and what\u2019s yet to come?\nKen Xie: I think for NP7, it\u2019s still in the ramp-up stage. We continue to build a new our platform using NP7, it\u2019s better for the high end and middle range. The FortiOS 7.0 is also a growth driver, but we are in the beta-3 process right now this quarter. That\u2019s what\u2019s helping contribute to the additional growth, especially in the zero trust and SASE environment and also this infrastructure security later this year, but it\u2019s -- so far, I see the product growth, like 21% is a lot of contribution from whether the SD-WAN or we call security-driven networking and also in the probably like 1 to 2 years ago, when we released the SoC4. So, that\u2019s a little bit towards the low end side of the FortiGate, which you can see nicely grows over there. And also the team is doing a great job in the sales and marketing.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think the guidance, the process is not so much about individual products or even in some cases, individual use cases. We identified 15 to 20 different use cases for firewalls. It\u2019s more about what we see in terms of market opportunity, what we see in pipeline than maybe by geography or deal opportunity or what have you as some of the key inputs that go into it. But, I wouldn\u2019t really think of it as -- I certainly would not want you to walk away from the conversation thinking that the guidance that we provided is dependent upon some degree of 5G or SASE or something that\u2019s above and beyond.\nBrian Essex: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Maybe just a quick follow-up. Nice large deal activity, certainly more than we picked up in the channel. Maybe if you could talk a little bit about the competitive dynamics on the large end of your market scale. Where you\u2019re seeing that business come from? How much is displacement, and how much is expansion of I guess existing customer opportunity?\nKen Xie: Yes, definitely, whether from our customer or our partner is starting to get a much better, more competitive and a lot of advantage using the Fortinet product, whether the FortiGate leverage new ASIC, the new OS with much more additional function compared to competitor. So, that\u2019s where like increased gap we have ahead of competitor now. And that\u2019s actually helping to drive -- accelerate the product revenue growth. And on the other side, we have a little bit different approach for whether the SASE or cloud endpoint. So, we more emphasize, integrate together, automate together, especially in the OS level, that\u2019s -- none of our competitors has that. And also, most of this also organically internally developed, designed to work together, automate together from day one. That\u2019s also different from competitor, come from acquisition, which is more difficult to integrate and also difficult to manage long term. So, we do feel we have a more and more advantage in the marketplace right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer.\nShaul Eyal: Congrats on the ongoing strong execution levels. I want to start with a gross margin related question. So, gross margins guidance for \u201921 indicates an improvement, 1 to 2 basis points on average. And I\u2019d like to understand whether it is driven by the ongoing shift to more cloud activities, i.e., more subscription services, or is it driven by some improvement with your ASIC-driven strategy?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think, the last part is probably the headline, which is that each successive generation of the ASIC in addition to creating more speed, more capacity, if you will, more throughput. It also creates capacity to consolidate features of the BOM that were previously separate. And the success of generation has shown the benefit of that. I think over the last year or two, we\u2019ve done a very good job of retaining that cost benefit in terms of the structure. You can look back and see what\u2019s happened with the gross margin, on the product gross margin line. Obviously, you do then also get the benefit in total, when you add into two-thirds of the business that are services that are coming at a much more attractive margin. So, the combination of those two, I think, is working very, very well for us as we exit 2020 and move into 2021.\nShaul Eyal: And maybe high level on the Sunburst breach. Have you seen any incremental interest starting in mid-December, maybe building into year-end, again, just aside from the typical healthy year and seasonality trend?\nKen Xie: I\u2019d say probably -- we do see a lot of need -- interest, especially to secure the whole infrastructure, including supply chain with all different third-party kind of product, all these things. But it\u2019s still -- I\u2019d say it\u2019s definitely more people certainly interest in this area, but it\u2019s -- the business side is probably not changing that much yet. But, we do see going forward, probably later this year will be, because it\u2019s definitely with the security concern, like I mentioned, the security spending among our IT spending probably will keeping increase.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America.\nTal Liani: I have two questions. The first one is, Ken, in your prepared remarks, you said that this year is going to be a year of focus on growth. What does it mean? Does it mean that you\u2019re going to increase expenses and the margin increases will moderate? Can you elaborate on the meaning behind your statement that you\u2019re going to now focus on growth this year? And how does it differ from previous year, for example?\nKen Xie: We do see like whether some investment we made in the sales and marketing, like we said, we have increased sales capacity and also we also have a better visibility, we increased the marketing. And at the same time, from the product, from infrastructure side, we also will keeping invest, especially organic internal development, like building the new infrastructure, and where to address the cloud and the networking endpoint and also working with service provider. So, basically, we do see -- the market itself also is starting kind of accelerating, especially in some new areas, whether the security-driven networking, including both SD-WAN or 5G, and that has the new infrastructure, but also some kind of a service model, leverage the infrastructure, which we will keeping invest more in there. So, that\u2019s what we feel. So, this will give us a much more growth opportunity and both internally like whether the NP7 or the FortiOS 7.0 is timing quite well. So, it will help us drive the faster growth.\nTal Liani: And does it have any impact on margins.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. Tal, I\u2019ll just add to that. I think the -- sorry to interrupt you. Look, I think, we were very successful throughout 2020, even during the pandemic, maintaining our -- and growing our operating margins very dramatically, but at the same time, adding sales capacity. And I think, when we sat down to build the guidance out in the plan for 2021, coming into the year with the capacity levels that we have, together with the increase in tenure that we\u2019re seeing as well as the pipeline, I think we feel very good about this opportunity to take advantage of the growth. And I think, we\u2019re still -- I think, the margin guidance at the midpoint of 26% is very much within the framework and actually up a little bit.\nTal Liani: Got it. My second question is about the needed investment in infrastructure to accommodate SASE and similar business models. What is the company doing in order to address it? Can you just elaborate on what\u2019s happening behind the scene?\nKen Xie: Yes. The SASE approach for Fortinet is different than some other competitors. We do want to have a more integrated automated approach. And also, we are the only one in the OS level, both the SASE and also zero trust network access. So, that\u2019s making whether working with Fortinet or service provider or even customer enterprise themselves to develop their own kind of SASE approach, which will be much better fit for their own kind of privacy, whether it\u2019s GDP or some other requirement, it\u2019s much better secure compared to some other approach. So, that\u2019s where we feel -- we do have some investment, but some investments, like infrastructure, we\u2019re also working with our service provider together.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Owens with Piper Sandler.\nBen Schmidt: Hi. This is Ben Schmidt on for Rob. Thanks for taking my questions. As much of the attention in the space begins to shift towards cloud and SASE, how do you think about your longer term strategy from a remote connectivity perspective? And what do you think -- and what do you expect for the branch office?\nKen Xie: I think, for our technology, we can support in both the thin branch and the thick branch office approach. And also, even for the SASE, so we leave the flexibility to enterprise, which we can whether leverage the vendor or they can leverage their service provider or carrier or they can build themselves. So, that\u2019s why we say, we put in the OS level, it\u2019s much more integrated, automated compared to some other approach, which has to let vendors infrastructure. So for us, like this OS level integration of SASE will leave a lot of flexibility and gradually for the customer to transition, whether they move service-based or they still want to like have, we call security infrastructure approach. So that\u2019s where we have the flexibility to have customers select their own approach based on own need. And at the same time, we\u2019ll make the whole infrastructure secure, like we say, whether the security-driven networking with SD-WAN, 5G or internal segmentation, whether in the data center or with the enterprise campus environment. So, that\u2019s why we feel, even we take a little bit more time to build this kind of a highly integrated OS level approach, but the result is much better and more advanced than some other loosely -- other approach.\nBen Schmidt: Okay. And on the growth investment, can you guys add just a little bit more to how much of the capacity has already been added? And how much you\u2019re expecting to add, I guess, how much more needs to be added for this year? And, can you remind us what the normal ramp time period is for new reps?\nKen Xie: For the new rep, probably a little bit different for each second vertical, like the channel probably within a few months, like 3 months time frame, and then the enterprise probably 6 to 12 months [ph]. [Indiscernible] take like 1 to 2 years like that carry all the things. So, we\u2019re going to also like differentiate, I think based on how the pandemic, how the other progress going and also the market opportunity there. But, I\u2019d say, we do kind of plan into increase more capacity when we see more opportunity there and try to match the investment with -- I think whether the internal, like the new product and also the market opportunities, so definitely will help us keep driving the SASE growth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani with UBS.\nFatima Boolani: Ken, maybe I\u2019ll start with you. Just drilling into your vertical-based performance, you talked about the global government vertical being -- comprising a fifth of your billings in the quarter and that some of the highest levels we\u2019ve seen. And so, I\u2019m wondering if you can remind us what your U.S. public sector exposure is within that government exposure? And then, more specifically, how is Fortinet positioned, both from a product and go-to-market perspective in the U.S. federal, especially as we sort of think about the $10 billion cybersecurity spending protocol from the new Biden administration? And then, I have a quick follow-up for Keith.\nKen Xie: Yes. The government business for Fortinet\u2019s global base, it\u2019s about 17% of our total business for us right now. And compared to like a few years ago, the carrier service provider is the number 1 is over 20%. Now, they are like 16%. For the U.S. government, we still see a lot of opportunity and the same thing for the U.S. market. And so, we\u2019re going to keep in building the team and increase capacity and to take this opportunity and grow faster and larger. What\u2019s the second question?\nKeith Jensen: I think, we\u2019ve talked before that the U.S. fed is low single digits of our government business -- of our business, nothing to add that.\nFatima Boolani: Got you. Very helpful. Keith, just sticking to Americas, we saw a very nice acceleration in 4Q in the Americas theater, and against what was maybe an uneven geographical performance for the U.S. over the course of 2020. So I\u2019m wondering if you can just put a finer point on the types of things that went right and the types of things that really went on in the quarter, and the key drivers of the strength, particularly in the Americas. And that\u2019s it for me.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. So, I think a good question, but a lot of ways, different answers. If you look at geographically, Latin America continues to be, by far, the most challenged, if you will. Canada probably did the best of the three, and I would put the U.S. right in the middle. I do think that we\u2019re very pleased with how the U.S. has come back. The second quarter, now that we all are pandemic experts about what to expect out of the business and looking at Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4. It\u2019s pretty obvious that -- and we kind of felt this coming out of the second quarter that Q2 was a low watermark, both for the Company in total, but also for the U.S. And I think you\u2019ve picked up on -- since that point, there\u2019s been a steady progression of, for lack of a better term, recovery in that part of the business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse.\nBrad Zelnick: Thank you so much. And congratulations to the entire Fortinet team on a great end to a great year. My first question for you, Ken, in your comments, you basically said that you aspire to be the market share leader in SD-WAN, which I think is a really important goal that you have. And I just was curious, from your perspective, what needs to happen to get there? How do you take share from your two largest competitors that have significant installed base relationships? And over what time can this play out?\nKen Xie: I think, for us, we have a unique advantage of we build SD-WAN with security together, and we also leverage ASIC to like increase computing power, lower competing cost a lot. So, that\u2019s none of our competitors have not. And also the other two big leaders, they come from acquisition, that\u2019s where going forward, they probably will be slower on whether the innovation of the market change dynamic there. So, that\u2019s what you can see from the FortiOS 7.0 release. We did see the increased additional function, whether the SD-WAN, the 5G and other parts. So, we do also believe, going forward, like half or majority of the SD-WAN market will need security. So, we have a huge advantage there. So, that\u2019s where -- even have a bigger installation base, but the advantage we have from the product, from a function, from the cost side, I think will be huge, and what have us keeping driving the market share. And so far, like year-over-year, we almost doubled the SD-WAN business compared to the 2019 in the \u201820.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. And maybe just quickly for Keith. Keith, what are the levers to think about, in light of sales headcount, and the plans for this year?\nKeith Jensen: Brad, I\u2019m not quite sure I fully understand the question, but maybe I\u2019ll give it a shot and that to share one data point of coming into this year, if I look at the level of sales capacity we have versus what the plan is that we\u2019re talking about. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve -- this is as well positioned as we have been coming into a year to pivot towards this growth model that Ken has talked about. And I think that -- the pipeline feels very good. The tenure feels very good. The use cases, the TAM feels very, very good to us. The new FortiOS, the NP7 shift is coming out, the platform advantage, the cost advantage that we have for performance. I think that we are in a very good position to execute this. And again, we\u2019re maintaining it within the framework that we\u2019ve talked about previously.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JP Morgan.\nSterling Auty: Just one question from my side. Ken, in your prepared remarks, I think, you talked about that the industry is finally raised, the customers move to consolidation on fewer vendors, more of a broad platform approach. With that in mind, where would you gauge the Fortinet platform and what are the areas that you would like to bolster to improve your position moving forward?\nKen Xie: You can see that, like we call the security fabric has a pretty nice growth, almost double compared to the FortiGate growth there. That\u2019s also because customers want to have all these whole infrastructure secure integrated automated solution. So, that\u2019s where we\u2019re continuing to see -- we\u2019re keeping gaining share there. So, that\u2019s involving probably 20, 30 different products. And on the other side, on the FortiGate part, we call the security-driven networking, that\u2019s whether the SD-WAN, the 5G and now with integrated SASE and some other part working closely with service provider carrier, we also see a lot of opportunity within the FortiGate side. So, that\u2019s where we see -- so far, we are keeping like -- if the market itself grows like 10%, we do see we can grow much faster than the market keeping gaining share. And both, on the FortiGate and also on the -- we call it, the broad fabric approach, which is involved in both the endpoint and the networking and the cloud altogether. And all this integrated together, based on the FortiOS and some under connectivity related to the FortiOS.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Tindle with Raymond James.\nAdam Tindle: Ken, I just wanted to start on the focus more on growth comment and how you\u2019re investing some of your healthy margin and some sales and marketing initiatives. We also heard a similar message from a competitor yesterday. And just thinking about the broader industry implications of that an outsider could maybe make the case that we enter a period of greater industry competition and pricing pressure as major competitors are investing heavily in sales and marketing, certainly doesn\u2019t seem to be the case based on your full year margin guide. So, maybe some thoughts on why that scenario does not play out?\nKeith Jensen: Ken, can I jump in and answer on your behalf? I think, the reference probably is to a company that has a very, very different business model. Whether you\u2019re looking at growth rates or you\u2019re looking at product service mix or what have you. So, I don\u2019t know that that would draw that straight-line comparison. I think, the business model that we\u2019re executing here has been extremely successful, and I expect it will continue to be so. In terms of discounting, I think that there\u2019s days that I don\u2019t like carrying it, but we\u2019re view as being the price for performance leader, that our pricing is really -- we\u2019re oftentimes, I think, brought into RFPs and opportunities to set the milestone that the competitors are forced to react to as opposed to the other way around. If you go back and look at the comments that we\u2019ve offered throughout 2020, even in the pandemic, more often than not, discounting, if you will, has been a tailwind for us in our ability to execute against it as opposed to a headwind. And by that, I define discounting, mean lower discounting pressure in that quarter than the prior period. So, I don\u2019t think we have the concerns that may have been described there.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up, Keith. And sorry, a little bit in the weeds on this one. But, the billings guidance for Q1, it\u2019s down about 20% sequentially at the midpoint and typically down low double digits or so, mid-teens in that range. Last year, at the start of COVID, it was down 17%. So, part of the question is, why would the sequential decline in billings be worse than the environment when we entered COVID, during Q1 of last year? You talked about having a strong pipeline, supporting the desire to invest. Maybe just some help with the color on the disconnect between those two items. Thank you.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think one -- which you\u2019re talking about is just a tremendous performance in the fourth quarter of 2020. I know that 20 -- fourth quarter of 2019 was a good quarter, but Q4 2020 on top of that \u201819 performance, I think is part of it. And this is typically the smallest quarter for us in the year. Historically, you\u2019ve seen some sort of shift, and it\u2019s nothing new and from going from Q4 to Q1 and then you start to see the progression thereafter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.\nKeith Bachman: Ken, I wanted to ask my first question of you. You\u2019ve talked about 5G. Why is that an opportunity? Who\u2019s your customer? And what -- why does Fortinet win in that instance of the deployment of 5G? And if you could just talk a little bit about when do you think that you\u2019ll get some benefits from this?\nKen Xie: I think we do see 5G connect a lot of devices to the Internet, which also increased a lot of security risk. We call there\u2019s a new attack service, a new edge need to be covered. So, that\u2019s where especially, we\u2019re working with a lot of service providers for the 5G service to a lot of enterprise and connect all these different devices in the OT/IoT space. So that we do see as a huge opportunity. And so, with our position with the carrier service provider and we do see the 5G can be one of the driving -- growth driving factor for us this year and it could be material towards the end of the year. Going forward, it\u2019s also huge, huge opportunity, even secure whether -- it\u2019s part of the whole infrastructure, which grow very, very fast and a lot of our carrier service providers starting to have investment in this area also.\nKeith Bachman: Okay, interesting. Okay. And then, Keith, one for you. For the guidance of \u201821, you talked about CapEx. Any other puts and takes you want us to think about as it relates to OCF or operating cash flow?\nKeith Jensen: No, not really. I mean, I made the point about inventory. The turns came in for us pretty strong in the fourth quarter, but I think that\u2019s a direct reflection of the success that we had in the product revenue line in the fourth quarter. So that was probably a little bit better than we expected. I do think during this pandemic era that we\u2019ll continue to maintain somewhat higher levels of inventory. I think that\u2019s in our best interest. The extended payment term program, I think that every CFO wants to wind that down as fast as possible and every distributor wants to hold on to it for life. So, that will be an ongoing battle for us throughout 2021, I think.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research.\nBen Bollin: My first question, you\u2019ve made your aspirations pretty clear in SD-WAN. Could you share with us a little bit about aspirations, intentions as you move into SASE and zero trust, how you see yourself positioned?\nKen Xie: Yes. SD-WAN is a part of the SASE offering. What we do is a little bit different than competitors. We build within the FortiGate, FortiOS, which also can be offered, whether based on the physical price or the virtual software or kind of cloud delivering. And that\u2019s where the new FortiOS 7.0 gives all this flexibility and connects a lot of other part of infrastructure security service together. So, that\u2019s where we\u2019ll continue to see SD-WAN and keeping growing probably -- by much, it probably was keeping grown like 30%, 40% year-over-year this year. We do believe we\u2019re also keeping gaining market share. And at the same time, the 5G -- the other opportunities come up, we already offered in the new FortiOS 7.0, which also could be a pretty good driver for the additional growth we have.\nBen Bollin: Could you also talk a little bit about how you envision FortiOS 7 rolling out, once available? How backwards compatible will it be for legacy appliances? And if you\u2019ve looked at some of the historical OS refreshes, how long does it take the footprint to roll over, as this rolls through the base? Thank you.\nKen Xie: It\u2019s really dependent on customer. Some -- I have to say, the channel probably reacts a little bit faster and then there\u2019s enterprise, then the service providers sometimes take a little bit time. Because large service providers, they also have to support in some of that. But we do see this enables a lot of new opportunities. And they also like this tightly integrated approach, whether the SD-WAN, SASE, we call security driven networking, which do enable them to offer the additional service, additional kind of business and protect additional edge. That\u2019s why we say, you need to protect all different edge together and automate -- integrate together instead of have a different product, different kind of a vendor for each part, which is difficult to integrate and automate. So, that\u2019s where we see the response from like 300 new features and updates in this OS to cover quite a broad area. And that we do see customers do need some time to gradually like train, pick up on this new function. But, a lot of them, they see the huge benefit of this new function. And that\u2019s where we see, it\u2019s a huge opportunity for us. But probably towards the second half of the year, we\u2019ll see a lot of benefit of it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Eric Heath [ph] on for Michael. Just one for me. Keith, it seemed like you guided billings for 4Q, assuming some macro headwinds. How did that play out differently than you expected, especially on the product side? And in the end, did you see deferrals of hardware refreshes in 2020 that might snap back in 2021?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. We have such a long product list. I don\u2019t think that we really saw deferrals of refreshes, despite the asset concept. I think the -- I don\u2019t think Q4 was unusual in terms of what you normally see, with other years. And by that, I mean, I think, there was probably some element of the typical budget flush flowing through. I think, there was probably some element of salespeople working really hard to hit accelerators. And I think there was also some element of deals that simply pushed. I don\u2019t think that -- Ken kind of made a good point earlier to build on a little bit. I think, the solar wins event happened so late in the quarter, at least for us and probably for many other security companies. It seems doubtful that that activity really had much impact on the last two weeks of December in the quarter. I do think, and Ken made this point that it certainly raises awareness of security and events like that, unfortunately, for the world at large, keep focus on security that matters and the importance of it that people are going to suffer because of it. So, I don\u2019t know that in terms of learning to be cautious, if you will, going back to the beginning of your question and the guidance setting, I do think there was an element of caution, once we came out of the second quarter and saw how the dynamic impact close rates. And you saw that come through in the guidance setting process in both Q3 and Q4.\nKen Xie: Also, we see a pretty nice growth in SMB, but overall, the SMBs still have very low percentage leverage, whether the network security or cybersecurity. That\u2019s where -- including retail. So that\u2019s where we see there\u2019s a -- still have a huge growth opportunity over there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski with D.A. Davidson.\nAndrew Nowinski: Great. Thank you. And congrats on the nice quarter. Maybe just starting with a high-level question. So, as we think about the mix of your revenue, do you think the SolarWinds attack will create a positive tailwind for more spending in the firewall market, or do you think it will pressure your product growth as customers perhaps shift spending towards some of your cloud-based and subscription solutions?\nKen Xie: I said, probably they would drive to have a more integrated and bigger infrastructure security. So, that\u2019s where probably -- definitely, it\u2019s sort of when it\u2019s more like kind of come from the network side. On the other side, they are also trying to like cover what the pandemic is, whether it\u2019s work from home, there\u2019s a lot of other like business trying to digitalize during this process, which also increased the security need. That\u2019s why I say, the security spending kind of on the overall IT spending probably will keep increasing this year, and that\u2019s what\u2019s also helping drive. The SolarWinds is just like a few years ago, there\u2019s a case where the target and other things, definitely awareness of the importance of cybersecurity.\nAndrew Nowinski: Great. Thanks, Ken. And then, just a follow-up. As we think about the growth phase you\u2019re entering here this year and your go-to-market strategy to drive that growth, if you look back over the last few years, your playbook has certainly been the lead with the firewall. I\u2019m just wondering in this new growth phase, are you using the same playbook to accelerate the growth, or are you seeing more deals come to you via your SIM products and your virtual solutions and your other subscriptions and perhaps changing your go-to-market strategy to drive that growth?\nKen Xie: In the next few years, the network security market is still the biggest market, also probably the fast-growing market, not just because there\u2019s more connectivity, like 5G, SD-WAN and some other part, work from home, but also that\u2019s the center of the whole infrastructure security. But also, you cannot just -- to network security only, you also need to have network security working closely with endpoint, with some other infrastructure, cloud, some other parts together. That\u2019s why we call the integrated automated solution to respond to any of this quick changing dynamic industry here. That\u2019s where it\u2019s important, we keep the organic growth and we also keep -- develop the product on day one to make it integrated, automated together. It\u2019s a little bit different compared to competitor, which whether come from acquisition or some other parties is more challenging to integrate and also keep the innovation going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gray Powell with BTIG.\nGray Powell: Thanks for taking the questions. And congratulations on the good results. So, maybe circling back on the 5G questions. In past telecom upgrade cycles, maybe 3G was too long ago, but looking back at like the 4G upgrade cycle, how did that play through to Fortinet? What kind of tailwinds did you see then? And then, how does the 5G cycle feel in comparison?\nKen Xie: Yes. Compared to 3G, 4G is more connect people, whether the phone, whatever, together, the 5G is more connect to the device. And that\u2019s also the number of connection probably will increase as it may be 10x at least, because there\u2019s much more devices to be connected, and that also kind of more addresses a lot of industry need, whether certain smart city or auto drive or a lot of bigger infrastructure. So that\u2019s -- we do see a lot of a business opportunity, because so far, the network security will be more towards B2B towards the business side compared towards the consumer part. That\u2019s we do see huge opportunity going forward. It\u2019s just like a couple of years ago, the SD-WAN, right? So, SD-WAN can help in drive a lot of smart connection with the application and more dynamic, based on application, have a different connection there. So that\u2019s where the 5G definitely has a lot of additional opportunity but also bring a lot of risk to the business there, which need to be protected. And also service provider, we see play quite important role there, which is we have probably the best service provider carrier relation among other cybersecurity vendors there. So we do see a lot of potential in this area.\nOperator: Our last question will come from the line of Irvin Liu with Evercore ISI.\nIrvin Liu: I have one question and one follow-up. First, I was wondering if you can perhaps update us on your business mix by customer size, maybe a breakout by enterprise, commercial or SMB. And whether you\u2019ve seen a shift up or down market? And how do you see this mix trending through calendar \u201821?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think, we had a slide in our Analyst Day in November 2019 that basically answered one-third, one-third, one-third. And then, to explain it a little bit of MSSP gets allocated between them. But, you end up with something that\u2019s very, very much like that. Small business, small enterprise, one-third; mid, one-third; enterprise, one-third. I think, the thing that has been a very pleasant surprise to us throughout 2020 in the pandemic was how well the enterprise -- the small enterprise segment of the business held up. It really did very well.\nIrvin Liu: Got it. And for my follow-up, we\u2019re now one year into the current pandemic. And assuming things normalize in the back half of calendar \u201821, do you anticipate any changes or shifts in demand or customer buying patterns, assuming a return to normal environment?\nKen Xie: I think, during the pandemic, the customer, especially enterprise customer turned to hold down to the current vendor, especially in the developed country. But it\u2019s -- but for us, like whether in the U.S. or some of these countries, we\u2019re keeping gaining market share. So, we do get into a lot of new customer, which will probably take more effort during the pandemic because it\u2019s difficult to meet people or do certain testing there. Once it\u2019s open, we do see there\u2019s more opportunity, more windows open for us, especially with the new hardware, new OS and the new infrastructure. So, that also leads us to kind of a little bit towards investing in the growth for us going forward in the next few quarters at least.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think, Ken is spot on with that. I think, quote unquote, nice thing about the pandemic is I think we have a lot of understanding about our business and what to expect in pandemic quarters. And I think that all of us here at Fortinet, and I think throughout the country are looking forward to, at some point in time, we need a vaccine and then the other gross drivers kick in, and that seems destined to be sometimes towards the second half of this year. I think, we\u2019re all very aware of some of those GDP numbers and the year-over-year swings that we\u2019re seeing from negative 3% to positive 6% or 7%. Those are pretty dramatic numbers. But, I think most people\u2019s expectations are that that\u2019s where they going to come when the economies and the countries start opening up further.\nPeter Salkowski: We\u2019re going to close the call at this point. As you read in today\u2019s press release, I\u2019d like to point out to everybody that Fortinet\u2019s Accelerate 2021 virtual conference will be held on March 9th for the U.S. As part of that conference, we\u2019ll be doing an Analyst Day. So, you can register, there\u2019s a link in the press release as well as up on the website to register for investors and analysts. So, please do that prior to March 9th, if you\u2019re interested in attending that morning event. In addition, we\u2019ll be hosting -- in addition to hosting Accelerate, we\u2019re also going to be attending the Goldman Sachs conference next week on February 10th and the Morgan Stanley conference on March 2nd. Links to those webcasts will be on our website available on the Investor Relations -- Investor Events page of our Investor Relations website. Thank you very much for your time today. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. Have a great rest of your day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ken Xie",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results. Fourth quarter billing increased 20% to $961 million. Our secure SD-WAN offering accounted for over 13% of fourth quarter billing. Product revenue accelerated quarter-over-quarter to 21%, contributing to a total revenue growth of 21%. Operating margin benefited from solid revenue performance. We achieved all-time company record non-GAAP operating margin of 29.4% for the fourth quarter. Given the many opportunities ahead, we plan to shift our focus more to growth for the at least next few quarters. Today, we announced the FortiOS 7.0 with 300 new features and updates. With this release, Fortinet is the only leading cybersecurity vendor to offer firewall-based zero trust network access enabling remote access to replace the traditional VPN. This reduces attack surface while improving the user experience. Fortinet's Zero Trust Network Access solution also simplifies management by using the same access policy, whether on or off network. Tighter integration of a SASE solution with the FortiOS 7.0 gives enterprises the flexibility they need to enable their workforce to work from home with consistent, enterprise-grade security delivered on-premise, or now, via cloud-based SASE consumption for security-as-a-service. The FortiOS 7.0 extends network connectivity and security beyond the WAN Edge with innovations in 5G and LTE that improve the wireless network performance and increase resiliency. Our 5G offering enables organizations to achieve secure, scalable and highly available network connectivity anywhere. The release of FortiOS 7.0 expands the Fortinet Security Fabric delivering on our mission to provide broad, integrated and automated security to any device, any application everywhere. Cybersecurity is at an inflection point. And increasingly, organizations are consolidating towards a platform approach and not just a separate platform for endpoint, network security or cloud security but a holistic platform that is integrated, automated across all this area. The Fortinet Security Fabric is a cyber security platform built on broad and deep set of networking security technology from endpoint to network to cloud, organically built to seamlessly communicate and operate together. This consolidation with our security-driven networking approach will be key drivers going forward. Today Fortinet is recognized in 8th Gartner Magic Quadrant. Our FortiGate product is a leader in both, SD-WAN and the Next Generation Firewall Magic Quadrant. We continue to experience excellent adoption of our secure SD-WAN and expect our unique solution to become a market share leader within a few years. In addition, for our growth drivers, we estimate our total addressable market will grow at an annual compound rate of a 10% over the next four years to reach $93 billion by 2024. The recent SolarWinds security incident and the pandemic elevated the need for a broad, integrated and automated platform. And we expect companies will raise the percentage of IT spending used for security as they work to secure their entire infrastructure across multiple edges in a zero trust environment. Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers and partners worldwide for their continuous support to manage our response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Keith? I think for NP7, it's still in the ramp-up stage. We continue to build a new our platform using NP7, it's better for the high end and middle range. The FortiOS 7.0 is also a growth driver, but we are in the beta-3 process right now this quarter. That's what's helping contribute to the additional growth, especially in the zero trust and SASE environment and also this infrastructure security later this year, but it's -- so far, I see the product growth, like 21% is a lot of contribution from whether the SD-WAN or we call security-driven networking and also in the probably like 1 to 2 years ago, when we released the SoC4. So, that's a little bit towards the low end side of the FortiGate, which you can see nicely grows over there. And also the team is doing a great job in the sales and marketing. Yes, definitely, whether from our customer or our partner is starting to get a much better, more competitive and a lot of advantage using the Fortinet product, whether the FortiGate leverage new ASIC, the new OS with much more additional function compared to competitor. So, that's where like increased gap we have ahead of competitor now. And that's actually helping to drive -- accelerate the product revenue growth. And on the other side, we have a little bit different approach for whether the SASE or cloud endpoint. So, we more emphasize, integrate together, automate together, especially in the OS level, that's -- none of our competitors has that. And also, most of this also organically internally developed, designed to work together, automate together from day one. That's also different from competitor, come from acquisition, which is more difficult to integrate and also difficult to manage long term. So, we do feel we have a more and more advantage in the marketplace right now. I'd say probably -- we do see a lot of need -- interest, especially to secure the whole infrastructure, including supply chain with all different third-party kind of product, all these things. But it's still -- I'd say it's definitely more people certainly interest in this area, but it's -- the business side is probably not changing that much yet. But, we do see going forward, probably later this year will be, because it's definitely with the security concern, like I mentioned, the security spending among our IT spending probably will keeping increase. We do see like whether some investment we made in the sales and marketing, like we said, we have increased sales capacity and also we also have a better visibility, we increased the marketing. And at the same time, from the product, from infrastructure side, we also will keeping invest, especially organic internal development, like building the new infrastructure, and where to address the cloud and the networking endpoint and also working with service provider. So, basically, we do see -- the market itself also is starting kind of accelerating, especially in some new areas, whether the security-driven networking, including both SD-WAN or 5G, and that has the new infrastructure, but also some kind of a service model, leverage the infrastructure, which we will keeping invest more in there. So, that's what we feel. So, this will give us a much more growth opportunity and both internally like whether the NP7 or the FortiOS 7.0 is timing quite well. So, it will help us drive the faster growth. Yes. The SASE approach for Fortinet is different than some other competitors. We do want to have a more integrated automated approach. And also, we are the only one in the OS level, both the SASE and also zero trust network access. So, that's making whether working with Fortinet or service provider or even customer enterprise themselves to develop their own kind of SASE approach, which will be much better fit for their own kind of privacy, whether it's GDP or some other requirement, it's much better secure compared to some other approach. So, that's where we feel -- we do have some investment, but some investments, like infrastructure, we're also working with our service provider together. I think, for our technology, we can support in both the thin branch and the thick branch office approach. And also, even for the SASE, so we leave the flexibility to enterprise, which we can whether leverage the vendor or they can leverage their service provider or carrier or they can build themselves. So, that's why we say, we put in the OS level, it's much more integrated, automated compared to some other approach, which has to let vendors infrastructure. So for us, like this OS level integration of SASE will leave a lot of flexibility and gradually for the customer to transition, whether they move service-based or they still want to like have, we call security infrastructure approach. So that's where we have the flexibility to have customers select their own approach based on own need. And at the same time, we'll make the whole infrastructure secure, like we say, whether the security-driven networking with SD-WAN, 5G or internal segmentation, whether in the data center or with the enterprise campus environment. So, that's why we feel, even we take a little bit more time to build this kind of a highly integrated OS level approach, but the result is much better and more advanced than some other loosely -- other approach. For the new rep, probably a little bit different for each second vertical, like the channel probably within a few months, like 3 months time frame, and then the enterprise probably 6 to 12 months [ph]. [Indiscernible] take like 1 to 2 years like that carry all the things. So, we're going to also like differentiate, I think based on how the pandemic, how the other progress going and also the market opportunity there. But, I'd say, we do kind of plan into increase more capacity when we see more opportunity there and try to match the investment with -- I think whether the internal, like the new product and also the market opportunities, so definitely will help us keep driving the SASE growth. Yes. The government business for Fortinet's global base, it's about 17% of our total business for us right now. And compared to like a few years ago, the carrier service provider is the number 1 is over 20%. Now, they are like 16%. For the U.S. government, we still see a lot of opportunity and the same thing for the U.S. market. And so, we're going to keep in building the team and increase capacity and to take this opportunity and grow faster and larger. What's the second question? I think, for us, we have a unique advantage of we build SD-WAN with security together, and we also leverage ASIC to like increase computing power, lower competing cost a lot. So, that's none of our competitors have not. And also the other two big leaders, they come from acquisition, that's where going forward, they probably will be slower on whether the innovation of the market change dynamic there. So, that's what you can see from the FortiOS 7.0 release. We did see the increased additional function, whether the SD-WAN, the 5G and other parts. So, we do also believe, going forward, like half or majority of the SD-WAN market will need security. So, we have a huge advantage there. So, that's where -- even have a bigger installation base, but the advantage we have from the product, from a function, from the cost side, I think will be huge, and what have us keeping driving the market share. And so far, like year-over-year, we almost doubled the SD-WAN business compared to the 2019 in the \u201820. You can see that, like we call the security fabric has a pretty nice growth, almost double compared to the FortiGate growth there. That's also because customers want to have all these whole infrastructure secure integrated automated solution. So, that's where we're continuing to see -- we're keeping gaining share there. So, that's involving probably 20, 30 different products. And on the other side, on the FortiGate part, we call the security-driven networking, that's whether the SD-WAN, the 5G and now with integrated SASE and some other part working closely with service provider carrier, we also see a lot of opportunity within the FortiGate side. So, that's where we see -- so far, we are keeping like -- if the market itself grows like 10%, we do see we can grow much faster than the market keeping gaining share. And both, on the FortiGate and also on the -- we call it, the broad fabric approach, which is involved in both the endpoint and the networking and the cloud altogether. And all this integrated together, based on the FortiOS and some under connectivity related to the FortiOS. I think we do see 5G connect a lot of devices to the Internet, which also increased a lot of security risk. We call there's a new attack service, a new edge need to be covered. So, that's where especially, we're working with a lot of service providers for the 5G service to a lot of enterprise and connect all these different devices in the OT/IoT space. So that we do see as a huge opportunity. And so, with our position with the carrier service provider and we do see the 5G can be one of the driving -- growth driving factor for us this year and it could be material towards the end of the year. Going forward, it's also huge, huge opportunity, even secure whether -- it's part of the whole infrastructure, which grow very, very fast and a lot of our carrier service providers starting to have investment in this area also. Yes. SD-WAN is a part of the SASE offering. What we do is a little bit different than competitors. We build within the FortiGate, FortiOS, which also can be offered, whether based on the physical price or the virtual software or kind of cloud delivering. And that's where the new FortiOS 7.0 gives all this flexibility and connects a lot of other part of infrastructure security service together. So, that's where we'll continue to see SD-WAN and keeping growing probably -- by much, it probably was keeping grown like 30%, 40% year-over-year this year. We do believe we're also keeping gaining market share. And at the same time, the 5G -- the other opportunities come up, we already offered in the new FortiOS 7.0, which also could be a pretty good driver for the additional growth we have. It's really dependent on customer. Some -- I have to say, the channel probably reacts a little bit faster and then there's enterprise, then the service providers sometimes take a little bit time. Because large service providers, they also have to support in some of that. But we do see this enables a lot of new opportunities. And they also like this tightly integrated approach, whether the SD-WAN, SASE, we call security driven networking, which do enable them to offer the additional service, additional kind of business and protect additional edge. That's why we say, you need to protect all different edge together and automate -- integrate together instead of have a different product, different kind of a vendor for each part, which is difficult to integrate and automate. So, that's where we see the response from like 300 new features and updates in this OS to cover quite a broad area. And that we do see customers do need some time to gradually like train, pick up on this new function. But, a lot of them, they see the huge benefit of this new function. And that's where we see, it's a huge opportunity for us. But probably towards the second half of the year, we'll see a lot of benefit of it. Also, we see a pretty nice growth in SMB, but overall, the SMBs still have very low percentage leverage, whether the network security or cybersecurity. That's where -- including retail. So that's where we see there's a -- still have a huge growth opportunity over there. I said, probably they would drive to have a more integrated and bigger infrastructure security. So, that's where probably -- definitely, it's sort of when it's more like kind of come from the network side. On the other side, they are also trying to like cover what the pandemic is, whether it's work from home, there's a lot of other like business trying to digitalize during this process, which also increased the security need. That's why I say, the security spending kind of on the overall IT spending probably will keep increasing this year, and that's what's also helping drive. The SolarWinds is just like a few years ago, there's a case where the target and other things, definitely awareness of the importance of cybersecurity. In the next few years, the network security market is still the biggest market, also probably the fast-growing market, not just because there's more connectivity, like 5G, SD-WAN and some other part, work from home, but also that's the center of the whole infrastructure security. But also, you cannot just -- to network security only, you also need to have network security working closely with endpoint, with some other infrastructure, cloud, some other parts together. That's why we call the integrated automated solution to respond to any of this quick changing dynamic industry here. That's where it's important, we keep the organic growth and we also keep -- develop the product on day one to make it integrated, automated together. It's a little bit different compared to competitor, which whether come from acquisition or some other parties is more challenging to integrate and also keep the innovation going forward. Yes. Compared to 3G, 4G is more connect people, whether the phone, whatever, together, the 5G is more connect to the device. And that's also the number of connection probably will increase as it may be 10x at least, because there's much more devices to be connected, and that also kind of more addresses a lot of industry need, whether certain smart city or auto drive or a lot of bigger infrastructure. So that's -- we do see a lot of a business opportunity, because so far, the network security will be more towards B2B towards the business side compared towards the consumer part. That's we do see huge opportunity going forward. It's just like a couple of years ago, the SD-WAN, right? So, SD-WAN can help in drive a lot of smart connection with the application and more dynamic, based on application, have a different connection there. So that's where the 5G definitely has a lot of additional opportunity but also bring a lot of risk to the business there, which need to be protected. And also service provider, we see play quite important role there, which is we have probably the best service provider carrier relation among other cybersecurity vendors there. So we do see a lot of potential in this area. I think, during the pandemic, the customer, especially enterprise customer turned to hold down to the current vendor, especially in the developed country. But it's -- but for us, like whether in the U.S. or some of these countries, we're keeping gaining market share. So, we do get into a lot of new customer, which will probably take more effort during the pandemic because it's difficult to meet people or do certain testing there. Once it's open, we do see there's more opportunity, more windows open for us, especially with the new hardware, new OS and the new infrastructure. So, that also leads us to kind of a little bit towards investing in the growth for us going forward in the next few quarters at least."

            "content": "Thank you, Ken.  Let's start the fourth quarter review with revenue. Total revenue of $748 million was up 21%. Product revenue was up 21%. Service revenue was up 21%. Product revenue of $288 million saw substantial sequential acceleration in growth relating from strong demand for fabric -- Security Fabric Platform and FortiGate across all form factors, hardware, software, and virtual machine. While secure SD-WAN use cases continued their dramatic growth, the majority of product revenue was driven by the wide range of other operating system capabilities embedded in FortiGates and their related use cases. Service revenue of $460 million benefited from strong demand for fabric and cloud security solutions. Support and professional services revenue increased 21% to $210 million. The revenue mix shift from 8x5 to 24x7 support was 12 points, with 24x7 now representing 66% of the mix. Security subscription services and cloud provider revenue increased 21% to $249 million. Moving to the mix of FortiGate and non-FortiGate revenue. Network security revenue increased 18%, driven by the high end and entry-level FortiGate product families. Non-FortiGate products and service revenue increased 29%, driven by a 34% increase in revenue for fabric and cloud security solutions. Before continuing with the fourth quarter results, I'd like to highlight our 2020 full-year revenue performance. In the midst of a pandemic induced recession, total revenue for the year grew 20% to $2.6 billion. We take great pride in our focus on organic growth. And 2020 represents the third consecutive year with revenue growth of 20%. This consistent performance speaks to our geographic and customer diversity, the continued success of the integrated platform strategy, and our proprietary ASIC advantage that enables a shared operating system across the platform, drives our cost per performance advantage, increase the capacity to add features and functions while maintaining price points. Total non-FortiGate revenue for the year grew over 25% to more than $725 million. In other words, our fabric, cloud and other security products and services are on a pace to be a $1 billion business as we exit 2021. Our non-FortiGate and FortiGate products and solutions include a complete range of form factors and delivery methods, including physical and virtual appliances, cloud, SaaS and perpetual software, as well as hosted and non-hosted solutions. Together, they provide a range of security solutions and form factors, enabling integrated protection for hybrid environments, and their expanding digital attack surface and edges. Pivoting back to our Q4 results, let's turn to revenue by geo. Our geographic revenue performance continued to align with the pandemic's economic path, and with it highlighted the geographic diversification of our business. As summarized on slide 7, revenue in Asia Pacific increased 23% as many Asian countries and economies continue to remain largely open. EMEA revenue increased 22%, and the Americas posted revenue growth of 20%. Let's shift to billings. Total fourth quarter billings were $961 million, up 20%. FortiGate billings increased 16% and accounted for 71% of total billings. As shown on slide 9, high-end and entry-level FortiGates posted strong billings growth for the quarter. Non-FortiGate billings increased 29% of total billings, driven by demand for fabric and cloud security solutions. As with revenue, geo billings performance aligns with the economic path of the pandemic. In terms of growth, APAC billings outperformed all geos, followed by Europe and the Americas. The Americas reflect the continuing impact of the pandemic and especially in Latin America. Moving to billings by customer segments. The small enterprise segment posted solid growth across all geos, illustrating the strength of our Engage channel partner program. This segment is driven by new customer acquisitions, customer security fabric expansions, solid execution by our channel partners and the large diverse makeup of this multinational customer segment. Moving to worldwide billings by industry verticals. The worldwide government sector topped all verticals at 17% of total billings and grew 28% with another strong performance from our international team. Service providers and MSSPs accounted for 16% of total billings. Retail accounted for 10% of total billings, up 2 percentage points quarter-over-quarter. And Education continued to rebound with billings growth up 26% year-over-year. Looking now at deals by dollar size. We had 68 deals over $1 million in the fourth quarter compared to 64 deals in the fourth quarter of 2019. Secure SD-WAN accounted for 16 deals over $1 million, versus 11 deals in the fourth quarter of 2019. On a full year basis, SD-WAN accounted for approximately 11% of our total billings and doubled year-over-year. Moving back to the income statement. As shown on slide 4, gross margin improved 40 basis points to 78.5%. The strong 29% quarter-over-quarter product revenue growth created a mix shift from services to product revenue. The mix shift was a headwind for quarter-over-quarter gross margin comparisons. Product gross margin improved 130 basis points to 63.2%. Product gross margin continued to benefit from a higher mix of software products and the lower direct cost of our newer generation of FortiGate products. Operating margin for the fourth quarter increased 210 basis points to 29.4%, benefiting from the gross margin improvement and continued lower travel and marketing program expenses, offset by the addition of new sales team members as we continue to prepare for additional growth. At the end of the year, the total headcount was 8,238, an increase of 16%. Moving to the statement of cash flow summarized on slides 10, 11 and 12. Cash flow for the fourth quarter came in at $264 million. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 300,000 shares of our common stock for a total cost of $34 million. For the full year, we repurchased 11.7 million shares for a total cost of $1.1 billion. At the end of the fourth quarter, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $1 billion with the authorization set to expire at the end of February in 2022. Throughout the pandemic, we have leveraged the strength of our balance sheet as a competitive advantage to support our partners and customers as they experience geo-specific economic challenges. As a result, average days sales outstanding increased 8 days to 87 days, in line with our expectations and reflecting our decision to provide geographically targeted extended payment plans. Inventory turns improved to 2.7 times from 2.1 times in the third quarter and was relatively flat year-over-year. We expect extended payment terms and higher inventory balances to be in effect as we move through at least the first half of 2021. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $32 million, including $22 million related to construction and other real estate activity. We estimate capital expenditures for the first quarter between $50 million and $60 million, and for all of 2021 to be between $150 million and $170 million. 2021 CapEx projects include expanding our data center footprint and spending that was moved from 2020 due to delays in the new campus building. The average contract term in the fourth quarter was approximately 28 months, up less than 2 months from the fourth quarter of 2019. The growth in SD-WAN and other large enterprise deals contributed to the increase. As we look forward, I'd like to review our outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2021, summarized on slide 13, which is subject to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the first quarter, we expect billings in the range of $765 million to $780 million; revenue in the range of $670 million is $685 million; non-GAAP gross margin of 78.5% to 79.5%; non-GAAP operating margin of 22.5% to 23.5%, reflecting the typical revenue seasonality associated with the first quarter; non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.70 to $0.75, which assumes a share count of between 167 million and 169 million. We expect the non-GAAP tax rate of 21%. Before providing our 2021 guidance, I'd like to congratulate every member of the Fortinet team, for the truly outstanding execution in 2020 in the face of unprecedented challenges and rapidly changing and unpredictable dynamics. The effort and results have been outstanding. And this is on top of now several years of consistent, predictable performance, and continuing improvements in key growth and profitability metrics. Today, we reported our third consecutive year of total revenue growth of 20%, while increasing our non-GAAP operating margin, an average of over 200 basis points a year for the same period. Our goal remains to balance growth and profitability within the framework we have provided. As Ken mentioned, given the many growth opportunities that lie ahead, we currently plan to tilt our bias within this framework, more towards growth for at least the next several quarters. The opportunities we see are supported by a strong pipeline heading into 2021, increased sales capacity and our development efforts, which include the NP7 chip and our new FortiOS 7.0 operating system. With that, for 2021, we expect billings in the range of $3,560 million to $3,640 million, which at the midpoint represents growth of approximately 17%; revenue in the range of $3,025 million to $3,075 million, which at the midpoint represents growth of 18%; total service revenue in the range of $2,015 million to $2,045 million, which represents growth of approximately 21% and implies product revenue growth of approximately 11% and $1 billion in product revenue for 2021, quite the milestone for Fortinet; non-GAAP gross margin of 78% to 80%; non-GAAP operating margin of 25% to 27%. When backing out the 2020 T&E benefit, the midpoint of guidance represents a 50 to 100 basis-point increase in operating margin for 2021. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.60 to $3.75, which assumes a share count of between 170 million to 172 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 21%. We expect cash taxes to be approximately $80 million. Now, with Ken, I'd like to thank our partners, customers and the Fortinet team for all their support and hard work during these difficult and unique times. I'd also like to offer a special welcome to the Panopta team. And I'll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A session. Yes. I think the guidance, the process is not so much about individual products or even in some cases, individual use cases. We identified 15 to 20 different use cases for firewalls. It's more about what we see in terms of market opportunity, what we see in pipeline than maybe by geography or deal opportunity or what have you as some of the key inputs that go into it. But, I wouldn't really think of it as -- I certainly would not want you to walk away from the conversation thinking that the guidance that we provided is dependent upon some degree of 5G or SASE or something that's above and beyond. Yes. I think, the last part is probably the headline, which is that each successive generation of the ASIC in addition to creating more speed, more capacity, if you will, more throughput. It also creates capacity to consolidate features of the BOM that were previously separate. And the success of generation has shown the benefit of that. I think over the last year or two, we've done a very good job of retaining that cost benefit in terms of the structure. You can look back and see what's happened with the gross margin, on the product gross margin line. Obviously, you do then also get the benefit in total, when you add into two-thirds of the business that are services that are coming at a much more attractive margin. So, the combination of those two, I think, is working very, very well for us as we exit 2020 and move into 2021. Yes. Tal, I'll just add to that. I think the -- sorry to interrupt you. Look, I think, we were very successful throughout 2020, even during the pandemic, maintaining our -- and growing our operating margins very dramatically, but at the same time, adding sales capacity. And I think, when we sat down to build the guidance out in the plan for 2021, coming into the year with the capacity levels that we have, together with the increase in tenure that we're seeing as well as the pipeline, I think we feel very good about this opportunity to take advantage of the growth. And I think, we're still -- I think, the margin guidance at the midpoint of 26% is very much within the framework and actually up a little bit. I think, we've talked before that the U.S. fed is low single digits of our government business -- of our business, nothing to add that. Yes. So, I think a good question, but a lot of ways, different answers. If you look at geographically, Latin America continues to be, by far, the most challenged, if you will. Canada probably did the best of the three, and I would put the U.S. right in the middle. I do think that we're very pleased with how the U.S. has come back. The second quarter, now that we all are pandemic experts about what to expect out of the business and looking at Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4. It's pretty obvious that -- and we kind of felt this coming out of the second quarter that Q2 was a low watermark, both for the Company in total, but also for the U.S. And I think you've picked up on -- since that point, there's been a steady progression of, for lack of a better term, recovery in that part of the business. Brad, I'm not quite sure I fully understand the question, but maybe I'll give it a shot and that to share one data point of coming into this year, if I look at the level of sales capacity we have versus what the plan is that we're talking about. I don't think I've -- this is as well positioned as we have been coming into a year to pivot towards this growth model that Ken has talked about. And I think that -- the pipeline feels very good. The tenure feels very good. The use cases, the TAM feels very, very good to us. The new FortiOS, the NP7 shift is coming out, the platform advantage, the cost advantage that we have for performance. I think that we are in a very good position to execute this. And again, we're maintaining it within the framework that we've talked about previously. Ken, can I jump in and answer on your behalf? I think, the reference probably is to a company that has a very, very different business model. Whether you're looking at growth rates or you're looking at product service mix or what have you. So, I don't know that that would draw that straight-line comparison. I think, the business model that we're executing here has been extremely successful, and I expect it will continue to be so. In terms of discounting, I think that there's days that I don't like carrying it, but we're view as being the price for performance leader, that our pricing is really -- we're oftentimes, I think, brought into RFPs and opportunities to set the milestone that the competitors are forced to react to as opposed to the other way around. If you go back and look at the comments that we've offered throughout 2020, even in the pandemic, more often than not, discounting, if you will, has been a tailwind for us in our ability to execute against it as opposed to a headwind. And by that, I define discounting, mean lower discounting pressure in that quarter than the prior period. So, I don't think we have the concerns that may have been described there. Yes. I think one -- which you're talking about is just a tremendous performance in the fourth quarter of 2020. I know that 20 -- fourth quarter of 2019 was a good quarter, but Q4 2020 on top of that \u201819 performance, I think is part of it. And this is typically the smallest quarter for us in the year. Historically, you've seen some sort of shift, and it's nothing new and from going from Q4 to Q1 and then you start to see the progression thereafter. No, not really. I mean, I made the point about inventory. The turns came in for us pretty strong in the fourth quarter, but I think that's a direct reflection of the success that we had in the product revenue line in the fourth quarter. So that was probably a little bit better than we expected. I do think during this pandemic era that we'll continue to maintain somewhat higher levels of inventory. I think that's in our best interest. The extended payment term program, I think that every CFO wants to wind that down as fast as possible and every distributor wants to hold on to it for life. So, that will be an ongoing battle for us throughout 2021, I think. Yes. We have such a long product list. I don't think that we really saw deferrals of refreshes, despite the asset concept. I think the -- I don't think Q4 was unusual in terms of what you normally see, with other years. And by that, I mean, I think, there was probably some element of the typical budget flush flowing through. I think, there was probably some element of salespeople working really hard to hit accelerators. And I think there was also some element of deals that simply pushed. I don't think that -- Ken kind of made a good point earlier to build on a little bit. I think, the solar wins event happened so late in the quarter, at least for us and probably for many other security companies. It seems doubtful that that activity really had much impact on the last two weeks of December in the quarter. I do think, and Ken made this point that it certainly raises awareness of security and events like that, unfortunately, for the world at large, keep focus on security that matters and the importance of it that people are going to suffer because of it. So, I don't know that in terms of learning to be cautious, if you will, going back to the beginning of your question and the guidance setting, I do think there was an element of caution, once we came out of the second quarter and saw how the dynamic impact close rates. And you saw that come through in the guidance setting process in both Q3 and Q4. Yes. I think, we had a slide in our Analyst Day in November 2019 that basically answered one-third, one-third, one-third. And then, to explain it a little bit of MSSP gets allocated between them. But, you end up with something that's very, very much like that. Small business, small enterprise, one-third; mid, one-third; enterprise, one-third. I think, the thing that has been a very pleasant surprise to us throughout 2020 in the pandemic was how well the enterprise -- the small enterprise segment of the business held up. It really did very well. Yes. I think, Ken is spot on with that. I think, quote unquote, nice thing about the pandemic is I think we have a lot of understanding about our business and what to expect in pandemic quarters. And I think that all of us here at Fortinet, and I think throughout the country are looking forward to, at some point in time, we need a vaccine and then the other gross drivers kick in, and that seems destined to be sometimes towards the second half of this year. I think, we're all very aware of some of those GDP numbers and the year-over-year swings that we're seeing from negative 3% to positive 6% or 7%. Those are pretty dramatic numbers. But, I think most people's expectations are that that's where they going to come when the economies and the countries start opening up further."

This is a live call that will be available for replay via webcast on our Investor Relations website. Ken will begin our call by providing a high-level perspective on our business. Keith will then follow that with a review of our financial and operating results for the third quarter, before providing guidance for the fourth quarter of 2020. We'll then open the call for questions. During the Q&A, we ask that you please keep your questions brief and limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question, to allow other to participate. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on today's call we will be making forward-looking statements and those forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected. Please refer to our SEC filings, in particular, the Risk Factors in our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for more information. All forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation and specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also all references to financial metrics that we make on today's call are non-GAAP, unless stated otherwise. Our GAAP results and GAAP-to-non-GAAP reconciliations is located in our earnings press release and in the presentation that accompanies today's remarks, both of which are on our Investor Relations website. Lastly, all references to growth are on a year-over-year basis, unless noted otherwise. I'll now turn the call over to Ken. \nKen Xie: Thanks, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our third quarter 2020 results. We are very pleased with our third quarter performance. Billing increased 20% to $750 million. Our SD-WAN solution more than doubled year-over-year and represent over 13% of total billings. Total revenue increased 19% to $651 million, with product revenue growth accelerating quarter-over-quarter to 14% and service revenue up 22%. Recently, Fortinet was the only vendor recognized as a leader in both the latest Gartner Magic Quadrant for WAN Edge infrastructure and Gartner Magic Quadrant for network firewalls. Fortinet's FortiGate SD-WAN is the only organically built solution that provides networking and security integrated into a single appliance that delivers leading protection, performance and cost saving for the largest customer base and fastest revenue growth among major players in the space. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated digital transformation. And organizations has to deal with new challenges to secure the whole infrastructure in the zero-trust environment, whether it's a WAN, cloud, data center, network, branch or home edge. Fortinet is helping customers solve these issues through security-driven networking and our platform approach. FortiGate Security Fabric which combine networking and security across the entire connect environment provide protection whether on-premise, virtual or cloud-based environment. Our recent Fortinet survey of cybersecurity leaders showed almost 70% of organizations have concerns about insider threat. Today, Fortinet announced a FortiGate 2600F for enterprise-level internal segmentation and hyperscale data center in multi-cloud environment. Powered by the new NP7 security processor, the FortiGate 2600F offer the highest performance with a secure computing up to 10 time higher than our competition. Gartner has stated that over the next few years, edge and immersive technologies will begin to replace cloud and mobile. The release of several new appliance called by our latest FortiASIC SPU, together with cloud and software-based virtual machine could replace security anywhere, will enable Fortinet to capitalize on this investment and will fuel our growth going forward. Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners worldwide for their continued support to manage our response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Keith?\nKeith Jensen: Thank you, Ken. Let's start the third quarter review with revenue. Total revenue of $651 million was up 19%. Product revenue of $224 million was up 14%, benefiting from strong demand for secure SD-WAN, high-end FortiGate and cloud solutions. Service revenue increased 22% to $427 million. FortiGuard service revenue increased 22% to $235 million. FortiCare service and other revenue increased 21% to $192 million. The revenue mix shift from 8x5 to 24x7 support was 11 points, with 24x7 now representing over 65% of the mix. Moving to the mix of FortiGate and non-FortiGate revenue. FortiGate product and service revenue increased 16%. Non-FortiGate products and service revenue grew 27%, driven by growth in cloud and fabric solutions. Given the continuing strong growth of our non-FortiGate or fabric platform, it's worth noting the absolute size of this business. For example, during the trailing 12-month period, ended September 30 2020, non-FortiGate products and services totaled $668 million, an increase of 26.5% when compared to the previous 12-month period. Revenues and solutions include the complete range of form factors and delivery methods including physical and virtual appliances, cloud, SaaS and perpetual software as well as hosted and non-hosted solutions. Combined with our FortiGate business, we offer our customers the needed range of security solutions and form factors enabling them to provide security across their entire IT infrastructure, whether it's at the WAN, cloud, data center, network branch or even home office edge. Our third quarter performance illustrates the benefits of our diversification across geographies, customer segments and industry verticals. Looking at revenue by Geos. As with the second quarter, our geographic revenue performance aligned with the economic impact of the pandemic and with it highlighted the geographic diversification of our business. As summarized on slide 5, revenues in Asia Pacific, increased 27.5% as many Asian countries and economies have been able to remain largely open. Revenue growth for the Americas of 13%, continue to reflect the impact of the pandemic, especially in Latin America as well as a very difficult year-over-year comparison. Revenue growth for the Americas in the third quarter of 2019 was over 24%, the highest of all three geographies. If we shift to billings, total billings increased 20% to $750 million. Looking at billings by solutions segment; FortiGate billings increased 16% and accounted for 72% of total billings. As shown on slide 6 high-end FortiGate posted strong billing growth in the quarter. Non-FortiGate billings increased 29%, with strong demand for fabric and cloud solutions. As with revenue, our billings performance by geos aligned with the economic impact of the path of the pandemic. APAC billings outperformed all geos, followed by Europe, and then the Americas, including Latin America. Now turning to billings by customer segments. As we experienced in the second quarter, we saw solid billing growth in the SMB, a large enterprise segments. SMB posted strong growth across all geos, illustrating the strength of our channel programs, the solid execution by our channel employees and partners, and the large diverse makeup of this multinational customer segment. Moving to worldwide billings by industry verticals. Our top five verticals continue to account for about two-thirds of total billings. The worldwide government sector topped all verticals at 20% of total billings and grew at over 40%. We experienced solid performance internationally and in the U.S. at the local levels. Service providers and MSSPs accounted for 16% of total billings. Financial services with 14% of total billings also had a very strong billings growth quarter at 27%. Education with 9% of total billings rebounded in the third quarter as schools prepare for secure e-learning in the fall semester. Now looking at deals by dollar size. We had 48 deals over $1 million in the third quarter, compared to 53 deals in the third quarter of 2019 and 30 deals in the third quarter of 2018. Secure SD-WAN accounted for seven of the deals over $1 million and while down from eight deals over $1 million a year ago, total SD-WAN billings more than doubled, and as Ken mentioned, accounted for approximately 13% of total billings. Moving back to the income statement. As shown on slide 4, gross margin improved 130 basis points to 79.5%. Product gross margin improved 220 basis points to 62.9%. Product gross margin continued to benefit from the lower direct cost of our newer generation of FortiGate products, offset slightly by higher indirect costs. It's worth noting that for five quarters in a row, including two pandemic quarters, product gross margin has been over 60%. Operating margin for the third quarter increased 90 basis points to 27.4%, benefiting from the improvement in gross margin and continued lower travel and marketing program expenses related to the shift towards virtual events, offset by the addition of new team members. Total head count ended the quarter at 8,075, a 23% increase driven by the increased investments we've made to grow our business. Given the strong operating income performance, net income for the third quarter was $145 million. And earnings per diluted share increased $0.21 to $0.88 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of $123 million or $0.75 per diluted share versus GAAP income of $80 million or $0.46 per diluted share a year ago. The strong performance this quarter is the result of the diversification of our business and the strategic long-term investments we've made to expand our global sales force, to invest in our channel partners and to expand our product offerings and provide a truly integrated security platform enabling automation. Moving to the statement of cash flow summarized on slide seven and eight. Free cash flow came in at $186 million. As we commented previously, we are leveraging the strength of our balance sheet as a competitive advantage to support our partners and our customers as they experience the economic challenges of the pandemic. As a result average days sales outstanding increased to 76 days, up three days sequentially and 13 days year-over-year in line with our expectations and reflecting our decision to provide geographically targeted extended payment plans. We expect extended payment terms and higher inventory balances to be in effect as we move through at least the first half of 2021. Inventory turns decreased to 2.1x as we increased our on-hand inventory to mitigate supply chain risk. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $35 million including $26 million related to construction and other real estate activity. We estimate capital expenditures for the fourth quarter to between $40 million and $50 million and for all of 2020 to between $130 million and $140 million. The lower full year CapEx range is due to utilities and other delays in the construction of our new campus building that are pushing more spending to 2021. Our move in date has moved to mid-2021. The average contract term for the third quarter was 26 months, flat year-over-year as well as sequentially. We expect full year cash taxes to be approximately $40 million and our full year non-GAAP tax rate to be 21%. As we look forward, I'd like to review our outlook for the fourth quarter summarized on slide nine which is subject to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the fourth quarter, we expect billings in the range of $890 million to $920 million. Revenue in the range of $710 million to $730 million. Non-GAAP gross margin of 78% to 80%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 27% to 29%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.95 to $0.97, which assumes a share count of between 157 million and 169 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 21%. Having said that, based on this fourth quarter guidance, we expect to achieve the rule of 40 for the full year making 2020 the third consecutive year in the ninth year of the last 11 years that we've been able to achieve this milestone. So, along with Ken, I'd like to thank our partners, our customers, and the Fortinet team for their support and hard work during these difficult and unique times. I'll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A.\nPeter Salkowski: Thank you. Operator please open the call for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Essex of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBrian Essex: Hi, good afternoon and thank you for taking our question and congrats on a nice quarter of results. I was wondering maybe if you could touch on what you're seeing in the spending environment. Particularly it sounded like you had a really nice quarter of fabric growth and SD-WAN demand. But we also picked up physical firewall strength in the quarter. So, maybe from the standpoint of what you're hearing from CIOs and what actually surprised you the most about the demand in the quarter? \nKen Xie: Yes. Brian, this is Ken. That's a good question. We also closely monitor watching the whole since change in the space. Basically so that's where we're keeping promoting we call secure-driven networking. And also that's the concept we try to the thinking we have in the last 20 years. So, you can see the definitely the SD-WAN starting -- come to the networking side and probably in the next three years can grow over $20 billion. So that will be huge. We want to be the leader number one in the space hope to target next year. And at the same time the security is at Zero Trust concept starting to get very popular. So, we need to make the whole infrastructure very secure. And also the work for home also starting changing a lot. Like in early this year once the pandemic just started and people -- enterprise just try to see how IT can supporting work from home. Now, they're starting to try to see what's the long-term solution whether some service-based SASE or some other way they call the home is the new branch right? So, that's where we can have the FortiGate installed in the home can manage much broader device. It can also like traffic shaping like many different priority for different application, different users and at the same time can secure the whole infrastructure that sometimes they also call the SD branch solution. That's where managed Wi-Fi and manage other switch other networking equipment altogether and also even the printer or the other home appliance. So, that's we're starting to see. Some -- even some big enterprise or some -- working with whatever service provider some companies started offer the employee because this is what they call the new branch. They not only give them some kind of FortiGate planning, but also including the internet access including like whether 4G, 5G, 3G, 4G, 5G or some other things altogether. It's kind of a packaged solution and to help them secure it they call them the whole infrastructure security. So, that's why we see both kind of approach. So we're closely working with service provider, whether to the service base SASE or to this kind of a whole infrastructure security approach, but the new branch \u2013 home's-the-new-branch approach. So it's definitely changing the whole environment. So the security no longer just secure the gateway the border and we expect the whole infrastructure. And at the same time, the network also need to be more application awareness, like based on application like SD-WAN, or some other based on the content like there are certain content and provider also starting to add in the security space. So that's what keep us saying the secure-driven network is starting to kind of ramp up quickly. \nBrian Essex: Got it. That's super-helpful. And maybe just a follow-up on that SASE comment. Any \u2013 and I know, I'm going to mispronounce this, but any initial traction with OPAQ or OPAQ through MSSP channel and how much progress have you made with that relationship so far?\nKen Xie: Yeah. We acquired OPAC last quarter, and we're working together to make it the whole solution for the SASe. Also, we work closely \u2013 working with a lot of service provider, because we do keep it same for a few years. The service provider has the best position to offer a lot of service. So we help them. And also FortiGate is one of the best platform they can build whether within their POP or even extend into the branch or extend to \u2013 inside the company. So it's a good change in the space.\nBrian Essex: Got it. Thank you very much.\nKen Xie: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Fatima Boolani from UBS. Your line is open. \nFatima Boolani: Thank you for taking the question. Keith, I have two for you. Just looking at your outlook and your billings guidance I wanted to unpack that a little bit and get your sense of where you are being a little bit more cautious relative to the performance quarter and how we should think about some of the puts and takes into the guidance that implies a deceleration from the third quarter performance you just put up? And I have a follow-up as well. \nKeith Jensen: Sure. Look, I think it's shown 2020 has shown to be a very interesting year for setting guidance. Q1 was very, very strong. Q2 was challenging. Q3 is a nice bounce back. It's really a function of watching media reports almost on a daily basis in terms of what's happening with the pandemic whether \u2013 what we see happening in the U.S. We can also layer into that the U.S. election, but also what we're seeing in Europe. And I think in the current environment, I think the guidance does a pretty good job of trying to reflect our current understanding of the pandemic.\nFatima Boolani: Fair enough. And just a bigger picture question for you. As I think about the complexion of your 2021 margin profile, if I look at 2020 you're head and shoulders above the sort 25% operating margin watermark that you've spoken to historically. So I'm wondering, as we think maybe longer term over the next couple of quarters what are some of the structural versus temporal impacts on the margin trajectory from here considering the pandemic trade-off and some of the acceleration you've undertaken on the sales hiring front? I would love to parse through that out with you. That would be really helpful. Thank you.\nKeith Jensen: Yeah. I think the \u2013 to kind of start top-down on that I think the product gross margin and probably why we made reference to it in the call being over 60% for I think five quarters in a row. There were some periods of time there it was probably in the higher 50s. We like very much in terms of the structure that we're seeing in terms of our pricing and our cost structure and gross margin. And even as we continue to introduce new products, hopefully, we'll be successful at that 60% gross margin number. And as you kind of move your way down to the income statement, I think it's really a sales and marketing conversation in terms of spending. Clearly, we're continuing to get the benefit of not having salespeople travel and not \u2013 the financial benefits excuse me of having salespeople not travel as well as marketing programs being virtual. And to the extent that the world stays that way we're going to continue to get that benefit. Now, obviously and I think we've talked previously that we're very committed to use this as an opportunity to bring in more salespeople. We talked about our head count growth of 23%. Hopefully, that we timed this right such that when those newer salespeople are coming online they're fully productive. It will be around the time that they're adding to the top line at the same time travel and marketing programs revert to historical norms. \nFatima Boolani: Appreciate the detail. Thank you, Keith.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shaul Eyal of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nShaul Eyal: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Congrats on the solid performance and outlook. I had a question on the SD-WAN opportunity. And given the ongoing strength you're seeing. Have you started to see some displacement opportunities given potential disruption that one of your competitor's smaller competitors in the space could be seeing given a consolidating market?\nKen Xie: This is Ken. No. We still see very strong interest and no competitor comes close to what we have. So we see that it's more than double year-over-year. And also we are the only one who has two Magic Quadrant both on SD-WAN also the network firewall come for the same appliance. And at the same time, it's 13% of last quarter's billing, but we have a huge installation base. A lot of customers even enable that one. We are not quite even confident on that one. So we believe we are a much bigger user base about like -- we call secure SD-WAN solution. And also going forward, I'd say the work-from-home also will be helping driving this whether you treat home as a new branch or whatever this kind of solution. So we feel we have a market position technology and also the only one build internal organically and also have ASIC to accelerate the performance on average about 10 times faster than any other competitor. So that's where we see is a huge opportunity. And the market grow like 50% year-over-year and we grew more than double year-over-year. It's -- we keep gaining market share. \nKeith Jensen: Yes. Shaul, it's Keith. I think Ken's spot on with that. I think if we look forward in terms of the opportunities what Ken is referring to is look I think there's still the opportunity in front of us to -- to help the service providers unpack their existing relationship with their incumbents on the SD-WAN side and that's something I think we're very focused on and as we start to see the SD-WAN is a critical component of SASE and the cloud on-ramp. So I think to Ken's point that market is going to continue to expand for us. \nShaul Eyal: Got it. Got it. No that is super helpful. And maybe a question on the Americas performance. Keith when you isolate the mixed Latin American performance and strictly focusing on the northern part of the Americas how would you characterize the performance slightly more in line with your internal expectations heading into the quarter?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think the U.S. -- well there's three components to the Americas -- Latin America which is a very difficult place currently. And we saw that in the numbers. We expect a difficult quarter of Latin America. And we've certainly got that. Canada on the other hand has actually done fairly well throughout this. It's just a different footprint in terms of the pandemic. To your specific question related to the U.S. I think the U.S. did much better in the third quarter than it did in the second quarter. But clearly I would not say that we're at pre-pandemic levels for the U.S. There's still opportunity there for us. \nShaul Eyal: Got it. Thank you so much. Good luck. Good job.\nKeith Jensen: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nBrad Zelnick: Grea. Thanks so much and congrats on the acceleration of the business. It's great to see. My first question for you Ken. I wanted to ask about the impact of 5G on your business. It seems we're approaching a tipping point in terms of broader 5G coverage. So my question is how should we think about the benefits of your business and why you feel that Fortinet is competitively advantaged as we approach this tipping point? \nKen Xie: 5G so far it is more connect to the device than connect to the people like 3G, 4G in the past. And also it depends on the vertical industry. And we're also leading a lot of our OT/IoT security. But also, like when work-from-home could be also a good back half for this like WAN access. But it's -- so we see quite a lot of successful case on international right now that seems more a little bit ahead on some of the 5G deployment and also working closely with the carrier service provider. Like I said in the last quarter earnings it's kind of growing faster than we expected and probably still on a very small base. But we do believe next year could be material the 5G contribute for our growth. \nBrad Zelnick: Great to hear. Thank you. And for Keith, last quarter you mentioned the discounting had picked up for the first time in a couple of quarters. How do you characterize discounting in Q3 at this point? Thanks.\nKeith Jensen: Flat. Consistent with what it was a year ago. Nothing to call out. So I guess the way to give that color I think we felt a little more pressure in the second quarter. We do not feel that same pressure in the third quarter. \nBrad Zelnick: Great to hear. Thank you so much for taking my questions, guys.\nKeith Jensen: Thanks, Brad.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Saket Kalia of Barclays. Your line is open. \nSaket Kalia: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Keith, maybe first for you a housekeeping question. Can you just talk about some slight changes to the deferred revenue balance historically? I know there's a footnote in the earnings slide, but maybe you could just expand on what the adjustment is and how that impacted deferred and billings just so that we're all on the same page? \nKeith Jensen: Yes. We had a little housekeeping to go through with a subset of our FortiCare contracts. Historically and this goes back many years, we probably should have been recognizing revenue a little bit sooner starting the amortization period than we had been. So there's a little bit of a pickup on quarterly FortiCare service revenue. Its range is very small. It ranges from 0.1% to about 0.5% of revenue for any particular period. When we file the 10-Q there'll be a long footnote that shows every possible period and so forth. But that's all just a little bit of housekeeping to pick up some revenue there. \nSaket Kalia: Okay. Got it. So just to be clear the billings that was reported in the quarter the $750 million that really it wouldn't have been impacted by sort of that change right? \nKeith Jensen: No, no, no. \nSaket Kalia: Okay. Got it. I understood. The follow-up for you Ken just on the product side -- I guess as OPAQ becomes a bigger part of the offering how do you think about the strength of the FortiGate line that maybe helps differentiate when you're offering a SASE solution? Does that make sense? \nKen Xie: Yes. I think, FortiGate is a very important part of SASE because they are the best firewall or SD-WAN or the other things can be positioned within the pop or sometimes we can working with service provider to use the FortiGate to be part of their service their solution there. And at the same time, we also do believe sometimes you also need to have a kind of a different approach like appliance can be in the home or can be in the branch or can be in the -- within the data center and the secure its traffic. So that's where we see FortiGate as a very good platform for keeping expanding we call the -- whether the whole infrastructure security or secure-driven networking, including both inside SASE POP all kind of secure the other part of infrastructure.\nSaket Kalia: Very helpful. Thanks guys.\nKen Xie: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, guys. This is Matt on for Sterling. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a little bit more on SD-WAN. I was wondering if you guys could give additional color on what you make of the competitive landscape currently and what you've seen on pricing on that front? Thanks.\nKen Xie : Yes. We offer the most the best pricing performance and also more functional SD-WAN than any other competitors. And SD-WAN is the probably one of the fast-growing area also one of the biggest market potential. So there's multiple research say, would be reached over $20 billion in like five to 10 years probably even bigger than the network security. And that's for us, also we want to combine these two together. So you see the same platform for both. So that's where compared to other competitor, which is only the software approach or sometimes even to weather the -- we call the universal CP or loading some other appliance. So we have this ASIC-dedicated hardware and plus like -- both in the low mid to high-end range can be within the POP or go to the home branch or go to -- within the data center inside the cloud. So that's where we see it's a huge advantage compared to other competitors. And also from the Gartner Magic Quadrant from the growth we have and we do believe we'll be the number one leader in the space.\nKeith Jensen : Yes. Matt I -- Ken's spot on with that. I think he's probably being a little bit humble, because I think really what's going on is because of the ASIC strategy and what he's built he's been able to increase the capacity in the firewall ritually each and every year. And it's a matter of how you use that capacity. Different SD-WAN vendors have different pricing methods. But for Fortinet it's embedded in the operating system and firewall. We do not charge for it separately. When you purchase a firewall you receive the SD-WAN functionality. So I don't really think that -- and certainly, we did not see anything in terms of our discount as we talked about that suggested any sort of change.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. That's very helpful. And then just one quick housekeeping question. So, going back to Saket's question on billings. If we just take the change in deferred on the balance sheet and the revenue, it seems like there's a disconnect to that and what you reported on billings. I was wondering if there was anything there to kind of unpack?\nKeith Jensen: No. I don't think so. I mean it's a pretty darn good definition. Billings is really defined as being revenue plus or minus the change in deferred revenue unless you have an acquisition or something like that. There should not be a difference there.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Thanks guys.\nKen Xie : Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\nAndrew Nowinski : Great. Thank you. Congrats on the nice quarter. So you called out strength in high-end billings this quarter, but it's actually been very strong for the last three quarters, which is somewhat surprising given that we're in the middle of a pandemic. So can you just provide any more color on what's driving that consistently strong growth in high end?\nKen Xie: There are some related to the new NP7, because -- as compared to NP6, they improve in the performance by almost 5x and also now can process like a 200-gig traffic per ship compared to the 40 gig and also more function there. So that's where we're starting to roll out the new NP7 with -- NP7 product only go to the high and middle range. And at the same time we do see certain vertical also help drive some high end like the finance service, some government sector, which they mostly buy the high end which has a less impact by the pandemic. Maybe Keith has other point.\nKeith Jensen: No. I think I would point the 1100E -- 1100F, excuse me. Yes. The product that's been out here for about a year now and it's done very, very well. It performed extremely well in the third quarter and I think it's been ramping up as we expect typically with the high-end products.\nKen Xie: Yes. Also SD-WAN in probably half or probably -- come from the high-end contribution. \nAndrew Nowinski: That makes sense. Thank you. And then why do you think you saw fewer $1 million deals this quarter given the strength in the high-end billings that we've seen?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think it's a very good question. We came into the quarter looking at the pipeline and actually had a little bit of risk, I thought because we had a larger mix of larger deals. And then when we got through the quarter, obviously, that -- the mix actually shifted on us a little bit. I mean, we've all read reports that maybe in general that deals are getting a little bit smaller and what have you and maybe that has something to do with it. But I really don't have good information in terms of why -- what ended up -- I mean what you get every quarter always differs from the pipeline. I don't know why is that particular item different this time. \nKen Xie: But the deal over $500000 has increased a lot right? And also compared to one year ago. Q3 last year we grew -- one year ago we grew $1 million deal quite a large number. So that's a very small comparison. \nKeith Jensen: Yes. And Ken makes a very good point. In fact if you look at deals of over SD-WAN deals over $250000 those were up well over 200% year-over-year. \nAndrew Nowinski: That makes sense. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Hamza Fodderwala of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nCalvin Patel: Hi, guys. This is Calvin Patel on for Hamza. Congrats on the quarter. And thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you could first comment a bit more on invoice durations and how you see that trending in your more recent conversations as we go forward. \nKeith Jensen: Invoice duration was that -- I'm sorry was that the question? \nCalvin Patel: Yes. \nKeith Jensen: Yes. We've been right at that, despite what maybe some other competitors expected to see one year 1.5 years ago. I think we've been very consistent throughout that time frame at about 25, 26 months. \nCalvin Patel: All right. Perfect. And then just as a follow-up, if you could comment a bit more on the competitive landscape in firewall this time not just on the SD-WAN segment? And if you think that there will be some level of digestion to occur over the next year or not? \nKen Xie: We're keep gaining market share quickly in the firewall market. But also I believe going forward, we keeping saying this for a long time. Almost since beginning of -- we started the company 20 years ago. So the new networking will be more secure-driven. So instead the networking routing switch all about connectivity and speed they need to make sure they can give with application. That's why SD-WAN is application based on the routing networking and also they can deal with all the content and also user device level. That's all security handling. So that's where we see probably the traditional -- whether the traditional network security which is on a security border or the traditional networking probably also need doing some transition change. So the network security is still about $20 billion market probably. And the traditional networking may be $70 billion, $80 billion market. But they probably will starting merging and transitioning change. We feel we're leading this changing. And there will be -- we're also in very good position very good technology to really address the new secure-driven networking. \nCalvin Patel: Thank you guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Owens with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nJustin Roach: Hey guys, this is Justin on for Rob. I just had a quick one on the federal government vertical strength in the quarter just how it was trending relative to your expectations? And maybe if there is anything that we could impact on what drove the strong quarter? \nKeith Jensen: Yes. It's not -- if you go back and look at the phrase very closely we're not talking about U.S. Federal. We're talking about government which for us is more international government as well as local governments. U.S. Fed is not a large part of our business. \nJustin Roach: Got you. And then also just a quick follow up maybe just on your pipeline relative to where it's sitting now relative to last year and how you feel going in the fourth quarter just given it's usually historically your biggest? \nKeith Jensen: Yes. Well pipeline is probably the biggest input to the guidance setting process right? And there's all kinds of different ways of slicing and dicing it when we go through that whether it's deal size whether it's new logo versus an existing customer whether it's a new deal versus a renewal deal or what have you. And I think that clearly the pipeline supports the guidance. \nJustin Roach: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Patrick Colville of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. \nPatrick Colville: Thank you for taking my question. And congrats on a very impressive quarter. Can we just talk about SD-WAN again? The result you guys put out was super-impressive doubling of growth year-on-year. We have been hearing the media on checks around some firms kind of closing or rationalizing their branch offices. So clearly that hasn't had any effect on your business. But can you just talk me through whether you've heard that amongst your customers, or anything related to that point would be great? \nKen Xie: Yes. Because it's a huge benefit for forward and the price of some other customers even including the home user consumer to us SD-WAN as it costs probably more than a 50% cost saving. And also they offer like how to manage multiple links among different kind of application and because the fixed connection whether the MPLS or some other one has a difficult time to manage like different application based on different cloud or kind of a different dynamic environment. So SD-WAN is the technology they can manage the traffic based on different applications even different content or some other security need as FortiGate's doing. It's a huge benefit for the user. That's driving the growth even during this pandemic. And also we believe the long-term work-from-home can also quickly expand into a lot of consumer home user base. And just try to improve in the service supporting level from that angle, we should be working with a lot of service provider or some big enterprise right now.  But as a long term we do believe they may change in the home networking space. It's just like whether you can software define or whatever application or content-based networking which can offer a lot of additional benefit compared to the fixed network kind of VPN access. So it gets a lot of customer interest. That's the reason the market grow like 50%. And I believe probably I don't know how long maybe 10 years or could be sort of longer eventually we do believe half of majority of the whole networking space mainly this kind of SD-WAN approach based on application content without the traffic. \nPatrick Colville: Great. That's very clear. I mean one of the points you made was around I guess the devices at the branch office. I mean how often does the FortiGate SD-WAN solution sits alongside a traditional router? And how often is it a replacement of the traditional router? \nKen Xie: We only need one FortiGate replace our router out of security or the Wi-Fi access controller all these kinds of thing. It's a single device as a multifunction can replace like a three, four, five device including router, including the SD-WAN and including the security gateway, VPN and then also the Wi-Fi controller. \nPatrick Colville: And just a clarification. Is your point that in most cases FortiGate is a replacement for those devices? \nKen Xie: Yes. Replaces multiple device altogether and become only device to stay there. \nPatrick Colville: Got it. Thank you so much for your time. Really appreciate it.\nKen Xie: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gray Powell of BTIG. Your line is open.\nQ \u2013 Unidentified Analyst: This is Stefan on for Gray. Thanks for taking my question. Piggybacking off the last question about the branch office. Have you seen any meaningful change in demand or mix of growth between the branch office and data center firewalls? \nKen Xie: Yes. And that's where you can see sort of vertical whether retail or whatever we still see pretty strong growth. I think I believe Keith mentioned maybe grow 40% something like that. And also the bigger potential is really the home is the new branch. So that's we're probably even bigger. But that's still in early stage because you still need help in the home user to manage some of that. I know service a lot of service providers right now are working with us, but at the same time certain enterprise also try to do that. \nQ \u2013 Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. And as a follow-up, can you just talk about the linearity that you saw in the third quarter? There was some mention of deal delays in the U.S. Did those end up landing this quarter? \nKeith Jensen: I think you're talking about deals from Q2 that delayed. Do they come in the third quarter? The answer to that would be yes. We were pleased with what we saw. Well, we were pleased with what we saw in July in terms of the start that we got in the quarter. \nQ \u2013 Unidentified Analyst: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Tindle of Raymond James. Your line is open.\nAlex Frankiewicz: This is Alex Frankiewicz on for Adam. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to touch on SD-WAN one more time. I was wondering how important is your ASIC in bake-offs? How important is that performance boost to customers and on SD-WAN? Are you finding that it's becoming more of a driving factor in purchasing decisions or do other core capabilities and functionalities come first when a customer is making a decision? \nKen Xie: Yes. The ASIC gives them like almost 10 times more computing power. So that's where they can add like a security function manage other like Wi-fi some other device and at the same time can process traffic much quicker and can also like working with service providers some other one make sure that it's a total infrastructure security solution. So that's a huge advantage compared to the other software approach which they have a limited CPU computing power to many whether security or SD-WAN or some other like the platform which can only handle single function compared we build this for the ASIC versus FortiOS can handle multifunction replace multiple device. So that's where we see as a huge advantage. \nAlex Frankiewicz: Okay. Thanks. And then just a follow-up. Looking ahead, more than just a few quarters looking kind of a couple of years out what kind of rule of 40 margin profile are you targeting? Are you focused solely on top line growth, or could you expect -- could we expect to see some margin drop-through to the bottom line? \nKeith Jensen: Yes. I'm managing Ken very closely. \nKen Xie: He's many me very closely. \nKeith Jensen: We talked about our midterm range of being we want to have 25% operating margin right? The strategy remains the same balancing growth and profitability. We started the year believing that we would tilt towards growth. As we went through the year, I think the pandemic obviously impacts the ability to grow in a couple of those quarters. But longer-term, we still believe it's a balanced strategy towards balancing profitability and growth. We do believe there is an opportunity for growth no doubt about it. \nAlex Frankiewicz: Okay. Perfect. Thank you, guys.\nKen Xie: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Fatima Boolani of UBS. Your line is open.\nFatima Boolani : Thank you, gentlemen for letting me to hop back in. I wanted to double back on the billings questions earlier on. The calculated billings based on your deferred revenue disclosure and disclosed reported revenue sum to $720 million in the quarter. And so I just wanted to appreciate that $30 million delta between what you have in the press release and in the reported numbers and calculating the billings off the balance sheet deferred revenue metrics? \nKeith Jensen: Sure. When you have some housekeeping going on Fatima, I'll jump into. This is Keith. You can have one or three things. You can have something that's so small you just run it through in the current period. You can have something so large that you restate the prior period financial statements. You can have something in the middle, which is called a little R where you're going to recast financials. That's what this is. That $30 million when you see the 10-Q will come out of the opening retained earnings back in December 31 of 2017 I believe it is. And just from that point forward that the amortization starts being corrected. So internally, we have the information for you to actually track right now with the billings recalculation of that you need to see Q2's number as recast, right? And that's not in the financials that you have, right? So $30 million came out of deferred revenue three years ago for something that's been going on for many, many years in this small transaction type. And it finally became large enough to correct, right? The number that we reported is based upon recast revenue and recast deferred revenue for billings.\nFatima Boolani: Fair enough. So it's essentially a cumulative impact that we'll see the details for -- in the filings at least?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. That's why I gave the quick sound bite earlier that the quarterly impact to revenue typically runs for each of the quarters that we looked at between 0.1 points and about 0.5 point of revenue. It's a very small item in any one quarter. \nFatima Boolani: Understood. That's very clear. Thank you. And since I have you, Ken a question for you just around the SD-WAN discussion. From a product standpoint, I think there's a debate that's brewing between the thin branch architecture versus a thick branch deployment architecture within the SASE paradigm. So I'm wondering how Fortinet is positioned in the former. So in the thin branch arena if we think about the thick branch environment may be under potential duress in an increasingly uncertain macro environment. And that's it for me. Thank you.\nKen Xie: I think both branch can fit into different environment. The thin branch sometimes it can stop certain mobile device issue. And the thick branch also can process the things locally in the real-time a lot of application need that. So the FortiGate is more like a POP in local whether in home or whatever in the office or it's in the POP and SASE environment. Which you can see how they process the traffic within the SASE infrastructure. That's how our FortiGate is the key point to really get this processed. So that's also because our -- it's an advantage. We have huge computing power advantage over other approach, which give us a kind of much better performance also lower cost. So that's where we had the flexibility converted to the appliance and on-premise or can be the virtual fit in the cloud or be part of the POP/SASE solution. So give us the flexibility and also can extend beyond some other competitor, other players can do which -- because if they're only limited for the software approach, they can only sit in certain server within the POP in the data center. So we can extend beyond that one go to the edge, go to the home and go to a lot of even other remote location. And that's also kind of using my quote from the Gartner is really -- so in the next few years that's what comes from Gartner research. They say the edge and the immersive technology will replace in the cloud and mobile. So that's where you see you need to have more computing everywhere in the real-time application environment. So that's where we developed is ASIC and all these different technology to working with our different service providers or different kind of vertical space to address this issue, especially the infrastructure keep changing with 5G with all this like. That's where the ASICs have more advantage compared to the software-only approach.\nFatima Boolani: Very clear. Thank you so much.\nKen Xie: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Patrick Colville of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nPatrick Colville: Hi, there. I'm copying Farima and hoping back in. Appreciate you letting me ask another question. How much did the Gartner's conclusion of Fortinet in the top-right corner of the SD-WAN MQ influence customer decision making? This time a year ago, you guys were just outside of the top-right corner and now you are in it. And so was that something that in your opinion might have changed the dialogue a bit and got Fortinet on more RFPs?\nKen Xie: It helps on certain enterprise, but we also have a much broader sector and also the geo diversity. It's probably now that -- depending too much on the Magic Quadrant. But it's -- and we also have a -- like because -- like the new Magic Quadrant only come on end of the quarter. It's come up in September 30, the last day of the quarter. So I don't think\u2026\nKeith Jensen: We don't close that fast.\nKen Xie: Yeah. Sorry, I don't think we can't get that much business in the last day of the quarter in Q3. But it's helped probably more going forward.\nKeith Jensen: We certainly expect it's going to be helpful and a tailwind for us going forward yes.\nPatrick Colville: Great. Thank you so much.\nKeith Jensen: Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Peter Salkowski for closing your remarks. \nPeter Salkowski: Thank you Michelle. I'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call. Fortinet will be attending conferences by the way -- attending conferences in the fourth quarter. The Credit Suisse conference is on November 13th, as well as December 2nd, Raymond James conference on December 7th, the UBS conference on December 8th, and a Barclays conference on December 9th. Events with presentations will be webcast and the links will be available on our website the Investor Relations website at Fortinet. If you have any follow-up questions please feel free to contact me. Have a great day. Thank you very much. Take care.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

            "name": "Ken Xie",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our third quarter 2020 results. We are very pleased with our third quarter performance. Billing increased 20% to $750 million. Our SD-WAN solution more than doubled year-over-year and represent over 13% of total billings. Total revenue increased 19% to $651 million, with product revenue growth accelerating quarter-over-quarter to 14% and service revenue up 22%. Recently, Fortinet was the only vendor recognized as a leader in both the latest Gartner Magic Quadrant for WAN Edge infrastructure and Gartner Magic Quadrant for network firewalls. Fortinet's FortiGate SD-WAN is the only organically built solution that provides networking and security integrated into a single appliance that delivers leading protection, performance and cost saving for the largest customer base and fastest revenue growth among major players in the space. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated digital transformation. And organizations has to deal with new challenges to secure the whole infrastructure in the zero-trust environment, whether it's a WAN, cloud, data center, network, branch or home edge. Fortinet is helping customers solve these issues through security-driven networking and our platform approach. FortiGate Security Fabric which combine networking and security across the entire connect environment provide protection whether on-premise, virtual or cloud-based environment. Our recent Fortinet survey of cybersecurity leaders showed almost 70% of organizations have concerns about insider threat. Today, Fortinet announced a FortiGate 2600F for enterprise-level internal segmentation and hyperscale data center in multi-cloud environment. Powered by the new NP7 security processor, the FortiGate 2600F offer the highest performance with a secure computing up to 10 time higher than our competition. Gartner has stated that over the next few years, edge and immersive technologies will begin to replace cloud and mobile. The release of several new appliance called by our latest FortiASIC SPU, together with cloud and software-based virtual machine could replace security anywhere, will enable Fortinet to capitalize on this investment and will fuel our growth going forward. Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners worldwide for their continued support to manage our response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Keith? Yes. Brian, this is Ken. That's a good question. We also closely monitor watching the whole since change in the space. Basically so that's where we're keeping promoting we call secure-driven networking. And also that's the concept we try to the thinking we have in the last 20 years. So, you can see the definitely the SD-WAN starting -- come to the networking side and probably in the next three years can grow over $20 billion. So that will be huge. We want to be the leader number one in the space hope to target next year. And at the same time the security is at Zero Trust concept starting to get very popular. So, we need to make the whole infrastructure very secure. And also the work for home also starting changing a lot. Like in early this year once the pandemic just started and people -- enterprise just try to see how IT can supporting work from home. Now, they're starting to try to see what's the long-term solution whether some service-based SASE or some other way they call the home is the new branch right? So, that's where we can have the FortiGate installed in the home can manage much broader device. It can also like traffic shaping like many different priority for different application, different users and at the same time can secure the whole infrastructure that sometimes they also call the SD branch solution. That's where managed Wi-Fi and manage other switch other networking equipment altogether and also even the printer or the other home appliance. So, that's we're starting to see. Some -- even some big enterprise or some -- working with whatever service provider some companies started offer the employee because this is what they call the new branch. They not only give them some kind of FortiGate planning, but also including the internet access including like whether 4G, 5G, 3G, 4G, 5G or some other things altogether. It's kind of a packaged solution and to help them secure it they call them the whole infrastructure security. So, that's why we see both kind of approach. So we're closely working with service provider, whether to the service base SASE or to this kind of a whole infrastructure security approach, but the new branch \u2013 home's-the-new-branch approach. So it's definitely changing the whole environment. So the security no longer just secure the gateway the border and we expect the whole infrastructure. And at the same time, the network also need to be more application awareness, like based on application like SD-WAN, or some other based on the content like there are certain content and provider also starting to add in the security space. So that's what keep us saying the secure-driven network is starting to kind of ramp up quickly. Yeah. We acquired OPAC last quarter, and we're working together to make it the whole solution for the SASe. Also, we work closely \u2013 working with a lot of service provider, because we do keep it same for a few years. The service provider has the best position to offer a lot of service. So we help them. And also FortiGate is one of the best platform they can build whether within their POP or even extend into the branch or extend to \u2013 inside the company. So it's a good change in the space. Thank you. This is Ken. No. We still see very strong interest and no competitor comes close to what we have. So we see that it's more than double year-over-year. And also we are the only one who has two Magic Quadrant both on SD-WAN also the network firewall come for the same appliance. And at the same time, it's 13% of last quarter's billing, but we have a huge installation base. A lot of customers even enable that one. We are not quite even confident on that one. So we believe we are a much bigger user base about like -- we call secure SD-WAN solution. And also going forward, I'd say the work-from-home also will be helping driving this whether you treat home as a new branch or whatever this kind of solution. So we feel we have a market position technology and also the only one build internal organically and also have ASIC to accelerate the performance on average about 10 times faster than any other competitor. So that's where we see is a huge opportunity. And the market grow like 50% year-over-year and we grew more than double year-over-year. It's -- we keep gaining market share. 5G so far it is more connect to the device than connect to the people like 3G, 4G in the past. And also it depends on the vertical industry. And we're also leading a lot of our OT/IoT security. But also, like when work-from-home could be also a good back half for this like WAN access. But it's -- so we see quite a lot of successful case on international right now that seems more a little bit ahead on some of the 5G deployment and also working closely with the carrier service provider. Like I said in the last quarter earnings it's kind of growing faster than we expected and probably still on a very small base. But we do believe next year could be material the 5G contribute for our growth. Yes. I think, FortiGate is a very important part of SASE because they are the best firewall or SD-WAN or the other things can be positioned within the pop or sometimes we can working with service provider to use the FortiGate to be part of their service their solution there. And at the same time, we also do believe sometimes you also need to have a kind of a different approach like appliance can be in the home or can be in the branch or can be in the -- within the data center and the secure its traffic. So that's where we see FortiGate as a very good platform for keeping expanding we call the -- whether the whole infrastructure security or secure-driven networking, including both inside SASE POP all kind of secure the other part of infrastructure. Thank you. Yes. We offer the most the best pricing performance and also more functional SD-WAN than any other competitors. And SD-WAN is the probably one of the fast-growing area also one of the biggest market potential. So there's multiple research say, would be reached over $20 billion in like five to 10 years probably even bigger than the network security. And that's for us, also we want to combine these two together. So you see the same platform for both. So that's where compared to other competitor, which is only the software approach or sometimes even to weather the -- we call the universal CP or loading some other appliance. So we have this ASIC-dedicated hardware and plus like -- both in the low mid to high-end range can be within the POP or go to the home branch or go to -- within the data center inside the cloud. So that's where we see it's a huge advantage compared to other competitors. And also from the Gartner Magic Quadrant from the growth we have and we do believe we'll be the number one leader in the space. Yeah. Thank you. There are some related to the new NP7, because -- as compared to NP6, they improve in the performance by almost 5x and also now can process like a 200-gig traffic per ship compared to the 40 gig and also more function there. So that's where we're starting to roll out the new NP7 with -- NP7 product only go to the high and middle range. And at the same time we do see certain vertical also help drive some high end like the finance service, some government sector, which they mostly buy the high end which has a less impact by the pandemic. Maybe Keith has other point. Yes. Also SD-WAN in probably half or probably -- come from the high-end contribution. But the deal over $500000 has increased a lot right? And also compared to one year ago. Q3 last year we grew -- one year ago we grew $1 million deal quite a large number. So that's a very small comparison. We're keep gaining market share quickly in the firewall market. But also I believe going forward, we keeping saying this for a long time. Almost since beginning of -- we started the company 20 years ago. So the new networking will be more secure-driven. So instead the networking routing switch all about connectivity and speed they need to make sure they can give with application. That's why SD-WAN is application based on the routing networking and also they can deal with all the content and also user device level. That's all security handling. So that's where we see probably the traditional -- whether the traditional network security which is on a security border or the traditional networking probably also need doing some transition change. So the network security is still about $20 billion market probably. And the traditional networking may be $70 billion, $80 billion market. But they probably will starting merging and transitioning change. We feel we're leading this changing. And there will be -- we're also in very good position very good technology to really address the new secure-driven networking. Yes. Because it's a huge benefit for forward and the price of some other customers even including the home user consumer to us SD-WAN as it costs probably more than a 50% cost saving. And also they offer like how to manage multiple links among different kind of application and because the fixed connection whether the MPLS or some other one has a difficult time to manage like different application based on different cloud or kind of a different dynamic environment. So SD-WAN is the technology they can manage the traffic based on different applications even different content or some other security need as FortiGate's doing. It's a huge benefit for the user. That's driving the growth even during this pandemic. And also we believe the long-term work-from-home can also quickly expand into a lot of consumer home user base. And just try to improve in the service supporting level from that angle, we should be working with a lot of service provider or some big enterprise right now.  But as a long term we do believe they may change in the home networking space. It's just like whether you can software define or whatever application or content-based networking which can offer a lot of additional benefit compared to the fixed network kind of VPN access. So it gets a lot of customer interest. That's the reason the market grow like 50%. And I believe probably I don't know how long maybe 10 years or could be sort of longer eventually we do believe half of majority of the whole networking space mainly this kind of SD-WAN approach based on application content without the traffic. We only need one FortiGate replace our router out of security or the Wi-Fi access controller all these kinds of thing. It's a single device as a multifunction can replace like a three, four, five device including router, including the SD-WAN and including the security gateway, VPN and then also the Wi-Fi controller. Yes. Replaces multiple device altogether and become only device to stay there. Thank you. Yes. And that's where you can see sort of vertical whether retail or whatever we still see pretty strong growth. I think I believe Keith mentioned maybe grow 40% something like that. And also the bigger potential is really the home is the new branch. So that's we're probably even bigger. But that's still in early stage because you still need help in the home user to manage some of that. I know service a lot of service providers right now are working with us, but at the same time certain enterprise also try to do that. \nQ \u2013 Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. And as a follow-up, can you just talk about the linearity that you saw in the third quarter? There was some mention of deal delays in the U.S. Did those end up landing this quarter? Yes. The ASIC gives them like almost 10 times more computing power. So that's where they can add like a security function manage other like Wi-fi some other device and at the same time can process traffic much quicker and can also like working with service providers some other one make sure that it's a total infrastructure security solution.

So that's where we see as a huge advantage. He's many me very closely. Thank you. I think both branch can fit into different environment. The thin branch sometimes it can stop certain mobile device issue. And the thick branch also can process the things locally in the real-time a lot of application need that. So the FortiGate is more like a POP in local whether in home or whatever in the office or it's in the POP and SASE environment.

It's come up in September 30, the last day of the quarter. So I don't think... Yeah. Sorry, I don't think we can't get that much business in the last day of the quarter in Q3. But it's helped probably more going forward."

            "content": "Thank you, Ken. Let's start the third quarter review with revenue. Total revenue of $651 million was up 19%. Product revenue of $224 million was up 14%, benefiting from strong demand for secure SD-WAN, high-end FortiGate and cloud solutions. Service revenue increased 22% to $427 million. FortiGuard service revenue increased 22% to $235 million. FortiCare service and other revenue increased 21% to $192 million. The revenue mix shift from 8x5 to 24x7 support was 11 points, with 24x7 now representing over 65% of the mix. Moving to the mix of FortiGate and non-FortiGate revenue. FortiGate product and service revenue increased 16%. Non-FortiGate products and service revenue grew 27%, driven by growth in cloud and fabric solutions. Given the continuing strong growth of our non-FortiGate or fabric platform, it's worth noting the absolute size of this business. For example, during the trailing 12-month period, ended September 30 2020, non-FortiGate products and services totaled $668 million, an increase of 26.5% when compared to the previous 12-month period. Revenues and solutions include the complete range of form factors and delivery methods including physical and virtual appliances, cloud, SaaS and perpetual software as well as hosted and non-hosted solutions. Combined with our FortiGate business, we offer our customers the needed range of security solutions and form factors enabling them to provide security across their entire IT infrastructure, whether it's at the WAN, cloud, data center, network branch or even home office edge. Our third quarter performance illustrates the benefits of our diversification across geographies, customer segments and industry verticals. Looking at revenue by Geos. As with the second quarter, our geographic revenue performance aligned with the economic impact of the pandemic and with it highlighted the geographic diversification of our business. As summarized on slide 5, revenues in Asia Pacific, increased 27.5% as many Asian countries and economies have been able to remain largely open. Revenue growth for the Americas of 13%, continue to reflect the impact of the pandemic, especially in Latin America as well as a very difficult year-over-year comparison. Revenue growth for the Americas in the third quarter of 2019 was over 24%, the highest of all three geographies. If we shift to billings, total billings increased 20% to $750 million. Looking at billings by solutions segment; FortiGate billings increased 16% and accounted for 72% of total billings. As shown on slide 6 high-end FortiGate posted strong billing growth in the quarter. Non-FortiGate billings increased 29%, with strong demand for fabric and cloud solutions. As with revenue, our billings performance by geos aligned with the economic impact of the path of the pandemic. APAC billings outperformed all geos, followed by Europe, and then the Americas, including Latin America. Now turning to billings by customer segments. As we experienced in the second quarter, we saw solid billing growth in the SMB, a large enterprise segments. SMB posted strong growth across all geos, illustrating the strength of our channel programs, the solid execution by our channel employees and partners, and the large diverse makeup of this multinational customer segment. Moving to worldwide billings by industry verticals. Our top five verticals continue to account for about two-thirds of total billings. The worldwide government sector topped all verticals at 20% of total billings and grew at over 40%. We experienced solid performance internationally and in the U.S. at the local levels. Service providers and MSSPs accounted for 16% of total billings. Financial services with 14% of total billings also had a very strong billings growth quarter at 27%. Education with 9% of total billings rebounded in the third quarter as schools prepare for secure e-learning in the fall semester. Now looking at deals by dollar size. We had 48 deals over $1 million in the third quarter, compared to 53 deals in the third quarter of 2019 and 30 deals in the third quarter of 2018. Secure SD-WAN accounted for seven of the deals over $1 million and while down from eight deals over $1 million a year ago, total SD-WAN billings more than doubled, and as Ken mentioned, accounted for approximately 13% of total billings. Moving back to the income statement. As shown on slide 4, gross margin improved 130 basis points to 79.5%. Product gross margin improved 220 basis points to 62.9%. Product gross margin continued to benefit from the lower direct cost of our newer generation of FortiGate products, offset slightly by higher indirect costs. It's worth noting that for five quarters in a row, including two pandemic quarters, product gross margin has been over 60%. Operating margin for the third quarter increased 90 basis points to 27.4%, benefiting from the improvement in gross margin and continued lower travel and marketing program expenses related to the shift towards virtual events, offset by the addition of new team members. Total head count ended the quarter at 8,075, a 23% increase driven by the increased investments we've made to grow our business. Given the strong operating income performance, net income for the third quarter was $145 million. And earnings per diluted share increased $0.21 to $0.88 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of $123 million or $0.75 per diluted share versus GAAP income of $80 million or $0.46 per diluted share a year ago. The strong performance this quarter is the result of the diversification of our business and the strategic long-term investments we've made to expand our global sales force, to invest in our channel partners and to expand our product offerings and provide a truly integrated security platform enabling automation. Moving to the statement of cash flow summarized on slide seven and eight. Free cash flow came in at $186 million. As we commented previously, we are leveraging the strength of our balance sheet as a competitive advantage to support our partners and our customers as they experience the economic challenges of the pandemic. As a result average days sales outstanding increased to 76 days, up three days sequentially and 13 days year-over-year in line with our expectations and reflecting our decision to provide geographically targeted extended payment plans. We expect extended payment terms and higher inventory balances to be in effect as we move through at least the first half of 2021. Inventory turns decreased to 2.1x as we increased our on-hand inventory to mitigate supply chain risk. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $35 million including $26 million related to construction and other real estate activity. We estimate capital expenditures for the fourth quarter to between $40 million and $50 million and for all of 2020 to between $130 million and $140 million. The lower full year CapEx range is due to utilities and other delays in the construction of our new campus building that are pushing more spending to 2021. Our move in date has moved to mid-2021. The average contract term for the third quarter was 26 months, flat year-over-year as well as sequentially. We expect full year cash taxes to be approximately $40 million and our full year non-GAAP tax rate to be 21%. As we look forward, I'd like to review our outlook for the fourth quarter summarized on slide nine which is subject to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the fourth quarter, we expect billings in the range of $890 million to $920 million. Revenue in the range of $710 million to $730 million. Non-GAAP gross margin of 78% to 80%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 27% to 29%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.95 to $0.97, which assumes a share count of between 157 million and 169 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 21%. Having said that, based on this fourth quarter guidance, we expect to achieve the rule of 40 for the full year making 2020 the third consecutive year in the ninth year of the last 11 years that we've been able to achieve this milestone. So, along with Ken, I'd like to thank our partners, our customers, and the Fortinet team for their support and hard work during these difficult and unique times. I'll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A. Sure. Look, I think it's shown 2020 has shown to be a very interesting year for setting guidance. Q1 was very, very strong. Q2 was challenging. Q3 is a nice bounce back. It's really a function of watching media reports almost on a daily basis in terms of what's happening with the pandemic whether \u2013 what we see happening in the U.S. We can also layer into that the U.S. election, but also what we're seeing in Europe. And I think in the current environment, I think the guidance does a pretty good job of trying to reflect our current understanding of the pandemic. Yeah. I think the \u2013 to kind of start top-down on that I think the product gross margin and probably why we made reference to it in the call being over 60% for I think five quarters in a row. There were some periods of time there it was probably in the higher 50s. We like very much in terms of the structure that we're seeing in terms of our pricing and our cost structure and gross margin. And even as we continue to introduce new products, hopefully, we'll be successful at that 60% gross margin number. And as you kind of move your way down to the income statement, I think it's really a sales and marketing conversation in terms of spending. Clearly, we're continuing to get the benefit of not having salespeople travel and not \u2013 the financial benefits excuse me of having salespeople not travel as well as marketing programs being virtual. And to the extent that the world stays that way we're going to continue to get that benefit. Now, obviously and I think we've talked previously that we're very committed to use this as an opportunity to bring in more salespeople. We talked about our head count growth of 23%. Hopefully, that we timed this right such that when those newer salespeople are coming online they're fully productive. It will be around the time that they're adding to the top line at the same time travel and marketing programs revert to historical norms. Yes. Shaul, it's Keith. I think Ken's spot on with that. I think if we look forward in terms of the opportunities what Ken is referring to is look I think there's still the opportunity in front of us to -- to help the service providers unpack their existing relationship with their incumbents on the SD-WAN side and that's something I think we're very focused on and as we start to see the SD-WAN is a critical component of SASE and the cloud on-ramp. So I think to Ken's point that market is going to continue to expand for us. Yes. I think the U.S. -- well there's three components to the Americas -- Latin America which is a very difficult place currently. And we saw that in the numbers. We expect a difficult quarter of Latin America. And we've certainly got that. Canada on the other hand has actually done fairly well throughout this. It's just a different footprint in terms of the pandemic. To your specific question related to the U.S. I think the U.S. did much better in the third quarter than it did in the second quarter. But clearly I would not say that we're at pre-pandemic levels for the U.S. There's still opportunity there for us. Thank you. Flat. Consistent with what it was a year ago. Nothing to call out. So I guess the way to give that color I think we felt a little more pressure in the second quarter. We do not feel that same pressure in the third quarter. Thanks, Brad. Yes. We had a little housekeeping to go through with a subset of our FortiCare contracts. Historically and this goes back many years, we probably should have been recognizing revenue a little bit sooner starting the amortization period than we had been. So there's a little bit of a pickup on quarterly FortiCare service revenue. Its range is very small. It ranges from 0.1% to about 0.5% of revenue for any particular period. When we file the 10-Q there'll be a long footnote that shows every possible period and so forth. But that's all just a little bit of housekeeping to pick up some revenue there. No, no, no. Yes. Matt I -- Ken's spot on with that. I think he's probably being a little bit humble, because I think really what's going on is because of the ASIC strategy and what he's built he's been able to increase the capacity in the firewall ritually each and every year. And it's a matter of how you use that capacity. Different SD-WAN vendors have different pricing methods. But for Fortinet it's embedded in the operating system and firewall. We do not charge for it separately. When you purchase a firewall you receive the SD-WAN functionality. So I don't really think that -- and certainly, we did not see anything in terms of our discount as we talked about that suggested any sort of change. No. I don't think so. I mean it's a pretty darn good definition. Billings is really defined as being revenue plus or minus the change in deferred revenue unless you have an acquisition or something like that. There should not be a difference there. No. I think I would point the 1100E -- 1100F, excuse me. Yes. The product that's been out here for about a year now and it's done very, very well. It performed extremely well in the third quarter and I think it's been ramping up as we expect typically with the high-end products. Yes. I think it's a very good question. We came into the quarter looking at the pipeline and actually had a little bit of risk, I thought because we had a larger mix of larger deals. And then when we got through the quarter, obviously, that -- the mix actually shifted on us a little bit. I mean, we've all read reports that maybe in general that deals are getting a little bit smaller and what have you and maybe that has something to do with it. But I really don't have good information in terms of why -- what ended up -- I mean what you get every quarter always differs from the pipeline. I don't know why is that particular item different this time. Yes. And Ken makes a very good point. In fact if you look at deals of over SD-WAN deals over $250000 those were up well over 200% year-over-year. Invoice duration was that -- I'm sorry was that the question? Yes. We've been right at that, despite what maybe some other competitors expected to see one year 1.5 years ago. I think we've been very consistent throughout that time frame at about 25, 26 months. Yes. It's not -- if you go back and look at the phrase very closely we're not talking about U.S. Federal. We're talking about government which for us is more international government as well as local governments. U.S. Fed is not a large part of our business. Yes. Well pipeline is probably the biggest input to the guidance setting process right? And there's all kinds of different ways of slicing and dicing it when we go through that whether it's deal size whether it's new logo versus an existing customer whether it's a new deal versus a renewal deal or what have you. And I think that clearly the pipeline supports the guidance. I think you're talking about deals from Q2 that delayed. Do they come in the third quarter? The answer to that would be yes. We were pleased with what we saw. Well, we were pleased with what we saw in July in terms of the start that we got in the quarter. \nQ \u2013 Unidentified Analyst: All right. Thank you. Yes. I'm managing Ken very closely. We talked about our midterm range of being we want to have 25% operating margin right? The strategy remains the same balancing growth and profitability. We started the year believing that we would tilt towards growth. As we went through the year, I think the pandemic obviously impacts the ability to grow in a couple of those quarters. But longer-term, we still believe it's a balanced strategy towards balancing profitability and growth. We do believe there is an opportunity for growth no doubt about it. Sure. When you have some housekeeping going on Fatima, I'll jump into. This is Keith. You can have one or three things. You can have something that's so small you just run it through in the current period. You can have something so large that you restate the prior period financial statements. You can have something in the middle, which is called a little R where you're going to recast financials. That's what this is. That $30 million when you see the 10-Q will come out of the opening retained earnings back in December 31 of 2017 I believe it is. And just from that point forward that the amortization starts being corrected. So internally, we have the information for you to actually track right now with the billings recalculation of that you need to see Q2's number as recast, right? And that's not in the financials that you have, right? So $30 million came out of deferred revenue three years ago for something that's been going on for many, many years in this small transaction type. And it finally became large enough to correct, right? The number that we reported is based upon recast revenue and recast deferred revenue for billings. Yes. That's why I gave the quick sound bite earlier that the quarterly impact to revenue typically runs for each of the quarters that we looked at between 0.1 points and about 0.5 point of revenue. It's a very small item in any one quarter. We don't close that fast. We certainly expect it's going to be helpful and a tailwind for us going forward yes. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Peter Salkowski. Thank you, and please go ahead, sir.\nPeter Salkowski: Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Peter Salkowski, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fortinet, and I am pleased to welcome everyone to our call to discuss Fortinet's financial results for the second quarter of 2020. Speakers on today's call are Ken Xie, Fortinet's Founder, Chairman and CEO; and Keith Jensen, our Chief Financial Officer. This is a live call that will be available for replay via webcast on our Investor Relations website. Ken will begin our call today by providing a high-level perspective on our business. Keith will then review our financial and operating results for the second quarter, provide some additional details regarding our second quarter performance and some insights into how July performed before providing guidance for the third quarter of 2020. We'll then open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, and these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Please refer to our SEC filings, in particular, the risk factors in our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for more information. All forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation and specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also, all references to financial metrics that we make on today's call are non-GAAP, unless otherwise stated. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations is located in our earnings press release and in the presentation that accompanies today's remarks, both of which are posted on our Investor Relations website. Lastly, all references to growth are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. I will now turn the call over to Ken.\nKen Xie: Thanks, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our second quarter 2020 results. We are very pleased with the solid second quarter performance. Revenue increased 18% to $616 million, with product revenue up 12% and service revenue up 22%. Secure SD-WAN climbed to 12% of total second quarter billings, the first time it's been over 10%. In today's environment, enterprise are focused on effectively and cost efficiently deploying security across their physical and digital network. To meet these challenges, Fortinet was founded on the vision of bringing security and networking together in what we refer to as security-driven networking. Gartner supports a similar concept, which they call Secure Access Service Edge or SASE. Fortinet is an industry leader in building, integrating and automating security product and service into Fortinet Security Fabric, including FortiSASE. With the recent acquisition of OPAQ Networks, Fortinet has enhanced its FortiSASE solution with expanded cloud delivery, including firewall as a service and Zero-Trust Network Access. Additionally, FortiSASE was built to be partner-friendly empowering MSPs and big global customers to easily integrate or build FortiSASE platform into their own offerings. A critical component of Fortinet Security Fabric platform is SD-WAN. We recently announced the new FortiGate 80F, which expand our SD-WAN portfolio for branch offices and work-from-home. The FortiGate 80F is powered by the latest FortiSPU SoC4 can deliver Security Compute Rating as much as 25x higher than industry average appliance using generic CPUs. According to Gartner, worldwide SD-WAN equipment market data for the first quarter of 2020, Fortinet has the highest revenue growth and was the top 3 for market share. We attribute this growth to our ability to deliver secure, high-performance SD-WAN anywhere from home to the branch to the cloud. Security investment remains a priority for enterprise and service providers, demonstrated by the strong growth of our high-end FortiGate appliance during the last quarter. Today, we released the FortiGate 4400F, the only firewall in the industry capable of securing hyperscale data center and 5G networks. Powered by the NP7 network processor, the 4400F delivers the highest performance with Security Compute Rating of up to 13x higher than our competition. The release of several new appliance powered by our latest FortiASIC SPU, together with cloud and software-based virtual machine to deploy security anywhere, we are able for Fortinet to capitalize on this investment and put us in a strong position going forward. Before turning the call over to Keith for a closer look at our second quarter performance and our guidance, I would like to take a moment to welcome the over 400 people who joined Fortinet during the second quarter as well as welcome OPAQ team who recently joined, and to thank our employees, customers and partners worldwide for their continued support to manage our response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Keith?\nKeith Jensen: Thank you, Ken. Let's start the second quarter review with revenue. Total revenue of $616 million was up 18%, driven by non-FortiGate products and service revenue growth of 25%. Non-FortiGate revenue growth benefited from very strong demand for virtual machines and our work-from-home solutions. FortiGate product and service revenue growth was 16% and benefited from record levels of billings for our secure SD-WAN solution. To a large extent, our second quarter revenue growth, together with the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, affirms the benefits of our diversification across geographies, customer segments and industry verticals. At the same time, it illustrates the level of revenue predictability in our business model. Our continued growth in this environment is a result of our strategic internal investments made to expand our global sales force, invest in our channel partners and extend our cost per performance advantage as we update our product offerings and penetrate adjacent security markets. Product revenue grew 12% to $212 million -- excuse me, $212 million, benefiting from strong demand for secure SD-WAN, high-end FortiGates and FortiGate virtual machines. Our work-from-home solutions continue to provide a tailwind to growth. Our growth rates and industry reports suggest we continue to take market share in both the firewall and SD-WAN markets, markets where we have contributed leadership and innovation.  Moving to service revenue. Service revenue grew 22% to $404 million, representing 66% of total revenue. Over 90% of service revenue was from deferred revenue at the beginning of the quarter and continues to support our revenue growth and predictability. FortiGuard security subscriptions revenue increased 22% to $223 million. FortiCare technical support revenue increased 22% to $181 million. The revenue mix shift from 8/5 support to our higher-priced 24/7 support was 9 points, with 24/7 support now representing 64% of the mix.  Let's shift to billings. Total billings increased 14% to $711 million. The total billing growth was negatively impacted by approximately 2 points by training and professional services and other miscellaneous products, which are products not classified as FortiGate, fabric or cloud. Earlier this year, we announced our decision to make our network security expert, or NSE, online training and certification program free to the public. While this decision resulted in a reduction in training billings and training revenue, we're very excited about the demand we are seeing with our NSE training. As of this week, the number of NSE registrations for 2020 is well over 500,000. And the number of NSE certifications issued is up over 200% to nearly 200,000.  Looking at billings by product segment. FortiGate billings increased 14% and accounted for 73% of total billings. FortiGate billings include our secure SD-WAN solutions. And as Ken mentioned a moment ago, SD-WAN passed over the 10% threshold for the first time ever, representing 12% of total billings. Non-FortiGate billings also increased 14%, with strong demand from our virtual and work-from-home solutions, offset by smaller contributions from switches and access points. And as I mentioned, billing declines for professional services, training and other miscellaneous products. Our geographic performance aligned with a path of the pandemic. And with it, highlighted the geographic diversification of our business, APAC being further along, outperformed all geos, followed by Europe while North America was impacted more. Our North America results include the United States, where we saw headwinds from the education and local government verticals where the COVID-19 pandemic remained an issue. By comparison, the retail segment was by far and away the strongest-performing U.S. vertical with growth well over 40% as we saw the continued expansion of the SD-WAN solution. The U.S. SMB segment provided strong growth, illustrating the strength of our U.S. channel programs, the remaining opportunity in this market and solid execution by our channel partners and the Fortinet channel team. Looking more at the Americas, our analysis and discussions with our channel partners suggest that certain transactions were delayed into the second half of this year as these companies focused on their capital structure and other immediate priorities.  Moving now to worldwide billings by industry verticals. The diversification of our business model was again on display with our top 5 verticals continue to account for about 2/3 of total billings. Worldwide government sector topped all verticals with 19% of total billings. Service providers and MSSPs accounted for 15% of total billings. Financial services with 14% of total billings had a very strong quarter with billings growth of 33%. And despite COVID-related concerns, the retail vertical posted worldwide billings growth of 27%, accounting for 10% of billings as it continued to benefit from SD-WAN and the strong U.S. performance I mentioned a moment ago. We saw strong growth in retail sub-verticals, such as drug stores, groceries and portions of the wholesale industry. At the end of the second quarter, total deferred revenue increased 24% to $2.3 billion. Short-term deferred revenue increased 24% to $1.3 billion.  Looking now at deals by dollar size. The number of deals over $1 million increased 28% to 59%. Secure SD-WAN accounted for 13 of these deals over $1 million. This performance illustrates our continued ability to move upmarket into the enterprise segment and the continued acceptance of our differentiated single unit, secure SD-WAN offering. Moving back to the income statement. As shown on Slide 4, gross margin improved 260 basis points to 79%. Product gross margin improved 340 basis points to 61%. Product gross margin continued to benefit from the lower cost structure of our newer generation of FortiGate products and over 40% growth in software products. Services gross margin increased 120 basis points to 88.5%, reflecting the benefit of the FortiCare revenue mix shift to 24/7 support. Operating margin for the second quarter increased 370 basis points to 27.3%, benefiting from the improvement in gross margin and lower employee travel and marketing program expenses related to the shift towards virtual events.  Total head count ended the quarter at 7,756, an increase of 23%, driven by the increased investments we've made to grow our business and reflecting a continued decline in sales and other attrition rates. With our continued growth, strong operating margins and free cash flow, we do not anticipate any COVID-19-related layoffs in the foreseeable future. In fact, we plan to capitalize on our many opportunities by continuing to hire and invest in our balanced growth strategy. Given the strong operating income performance, net income for the second quarter was $135 million. Our earnings per diluted share increased $0.24 to $0.82 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of $112 million or $0.68 per diluted share versus GAAP income of $73 million or $0.42 per diluted share a year ago.  Moving to the statement of cash flow summarized on Slide 7 and 8. Free cash flow increased 21.5% to $216 million. The average contract term in the second quarter continued to be within the range we provided at the Analyst Day, declining 1 month year-over-year to 26 months and moving up 1 month sequentially. As we stated on the first quarter call, we expected to leverage the strength of our balance sheet as a competitive advantage to support our partners and our customers. Average contractual payment terms increased to 62 days or 17% sequentially, in line with our expectations and reflecting our decision to provide geographically targeted extended payment term plans. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $31 million, including $21 million related to construction and other real estate activity. We estimate capital expenditures for the third quarter to be between $50 million and $60 million and for all of 2020 to be between $165 million and $185 million. Delays related to the new campus building have moved a portion of the previously expected 2020 CapEx spending into the first half of 2021. We expect full year cash taxes to be approximately $40 million, and our full year non-GAAP tax rate to be 22%. In the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $146 million. In July, the Board authorized an additional $500 million for our share repurchase authorization and extended the term to February 2022. As of today, the remaining share buyback authorization is approximately $1 billion.  Before moving to guidance, we wanted to offer some additional thoughts related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We have and we plan to continue leveraging the strength of our balance sheet, which may increase DSOs and inventory levels. The economic and business impact of the pandemic seems in line with the ability of different countries and geographies to reopen and avoid temporary shutdowns and uncertainty. For example, after strong billings growth in April, we saw slower growth as we completed May, then followed by a bounce back to strong growth in June and again strong in July. At the same time, the remaining Q3 pipeline points to a good level of improvement in both the U.S. and worldwide. In the second quarter, our channel partners reported some deals being delayed into the second half of the year. The concept was delayed, not lost, seems supported by the increases in our pipeline as well as with July selling activity. Clearly, there remains an elevated level of uncertainty about future -- about future pandemic events and economic conditions.  As we look forward, I'd like to review our outlook for the third quarter, summarized on Slide 9, which is subject to the disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. In the third quarter, we expect billings in the range of $705 million to $730 million; revenue in the range of $630 million to $645 million; non-GAAP gross margin of 78% to 79%; non-GAAP operating margin of 25.5% to 26.5%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.76 to $0.78, which assumes a share count of between 168 million and 170 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 22%. For 2020, due to the continued uncertainty associated with the economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, we are not issuing full year guidance at this time.  And finally, along with Ken, I'd like to welcome all the team members who have joined us, including the OPAQ team. I'd also like to thank our partners, customers and the Fortinet team for all their support and hard work during these difficult and unique times. I'll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A.\nPeter Salkowski: Thank you, Keith. Chris, we would like to open the line for questions, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Rob Owens with Piper Sandler.\nRobbie Owens: I want to start on the SD-WAN side of things and the success that you're obviously seeing there through the metrics now over 10% of billings. But just what that pipeline looks like. Have you seen more of a rush given COVID work-from-home and the opportunity to replace a lot of these conditions relative to branch types of solutions? Or are you seeing as much of robust demand, I guess, in that forward pipe?\nKen Xie: I think it's SD-WAN is a long-term benefit for both enterprise and also SMB and because it's also lower the cost of connect to the Internet. At the same time, make it more efficient. And for us, also building with ASIC security together, so they can also have additional secured additional benefit and cost much lower compared to some other competitors. So the market grew about 50% year-over-year. So we see a lot of potential, a lot of pipeline. We do believe we're keep on gaining market share because our solution is a very unique, huge advantage compared to other competitors. And with additional sales capacity we added, like we add head count, 23%. Even during the pandemic, take a little bit more time to train the new sales people, and then they maybe take a little bit more time to gain a new customer, but we do see a huge potential going forward.\nRobbie Owens: And then secondarily, I guess, focusing on the SASE opportunity and some of the dialogues on previous calls, maybe you could touch on the OPAQ acquisition. Was this customer driven? Was this opportunistic from your perspective, offensive, defensive?\nKen Xie: We have this FortiSASE, like I mentioned, even in the last time earnings call, and we do believe it's a part of the whole infrastructure. So as the cloud delivery, we already have some other cloud delivery, but OPAQ definitely keep enhances, and we're making more broad, more flexible for customer, for the partner to leverage the product infrastructure we're building. And so we do see this already and hence, the offer we have. And at the same time, we do have the broadest offering both on the platform and also on the function and also on kind of different form of deployment compared to other competitors we see is keeping ahead our position.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani with UBS.\nFatima Boolani: Maybe a bigger picture question for you. The combination of SD-WAN adoption in a more durable work-from-home environment -- maybe as giving investors the sense and perhaps it's misplaced. But giving investors a sense that the traditional enterprise branch office is potentially at risk from either a refreshed footprint perspective and a cannibalization perspective. So I'm wondering if you can help us parse through sort of some of the puts and takes as to what happens to your branch office footprint and what some of those misconceptions might be as customers adopt SD-WAN and or stay at home more permanently in shelter in place situation? And then I have a follow-up for Keith.\nKen Xie: The enterprise also, including some branch profits we do see some slowdown especially in the U.S. But it's -- on the other side, if you look at our product, which come out like the SoC4 come out 1 years ago, we started building a product like from 100F to 60F for the 40F, then we just announced 80F last week. So we can see the ramp-up, especially in the SMB, including the U.S., as it go up like over 40%. It's very, very strong. Internationally, we're a little bit behind on the U.S. to adopt some new products, including some -- both the low end using SoC4 and also the high end NP7, which is starting to release about like early this year and so starting to ramp up. So that's why we see the benefit of the new product, which easily have a performance like 4x, 5x better than the same cost, which we use in the - - we call security compute rating to benchmark compared to the other competitor is a huge advantage. So we see -- when we have the new product growth that come up very quickly after the testing evaluate on top of the product. But on the other side, the SD-WAN also gave the additional cost benefit, together with the new product cost performance benefit. So that's what helping driving the SMBs. We see it starting growing quite well. Also last quarter, after we announced the high end product, like 1 to 2 quarter, we starting to see the high end also starting to ramp up leverage NP7. So that's the trend. And I do believe sometime enterprise takes a little bit more time during this pandemic to do some deployment. But we do see a lot of evaluation going on. We do see some other interest, including combined, we call security networking together, we call secure-driven networking set the whole infrastructure. That's why the sales probably were more engage into the networking team. And also traditionally, more sales to security. Now as the networking team also starting engaged together with us to call secure-driven networking. So as we see the trend going on quite well. And also, like Keith mentioned, it's region by region, right? So it's a APAC staring to grow more very quickly, over 20%. And simply the pandemic kind of the situation maybe better recover a little bit better. And then we also see Europe probably also growing over 10%. The U.S. is a little bit slow, but we do believe later this year, next year that vaccines over, with the new product lineup, with the additional sales capacity we build, which we'll continue to invest, where we see very, very strong potential going forward.\nKeith Jensen: Yes, Fatima This is Keith. I think Ken does a great job of covering off some of the diversification considerations, whether it's by geographies and where different geographies may be and also by verticals. But it's also important to note that SD-WAN is also a significant component of SASE also for work-from-home solutions.\nFatima Boolani: Fair enough. And Keith, since I have you, any comments on the billings performance, specifically this quarter? And just double-clicking in Q4 to get gate billings because that includes both your traditional sort of network security perimeter security and the secure SD-WAN piece. I'm wondering if you can kind of qualitatively talk to sort of what drove the bus this quarter and how you're thinking about the secure SD-WAN versus non-secure SD-WAN, Fortigate pipeline for the remainder of the year and what's baked into your 3Q guidance? And that's it for me.\nKeith Jensen: A lot of topics, Fatima. Maybe I'll start with the last one in.\nFatima Boolani: I tried.\nKeith Jensen: I know you do a good job. Look, I think when we look at the pipeline for Q3, which is what we've guided to, I think we feel very good about the SD-WAN opportunity. Clearly, we saw it perhaps, in the U.S. in the month of May a bit of a pause, maybe some projects that were -- as we got towards the end of May. But clearly, as we exited Q2 and we've moved into Q3, we can see that our customers are making plans to continue moving forward their SD-WAN build-outs. And the additional opportunities that we see in the pipeline made us, let's just say, comfortable talking about crossing over that 10% threshold for the first time. Now we'll see how it actually comes into play. And I think I lost track of some of your earlier comments, I'm sorry.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer.\nShaul Eyal: Congrats on the quarter. Keith or Ken. So U.S. was the fastest region this quarter. Next week, we'll mark the middle of the quarter, the third quarter. Can you talk to us about the performance so far within the U.S.? What's the pipeline is looking like?\nKen Xie: We do see some enterprise customer has a good interest about SASE and just like some other cloud or some other platform of deployment infrastructure. So that when we make it as the whole infrastructure security offering. And the dollar or the amount of revenue are still relatively small, which may not impact much of the total billing of revenue there, but there's an interest about this and make it -- so customer want us make sure has some kind of flexibility and also broad offering. So that's where we see the OPAQ acquisition keep enhance what we have on the FortiSASE and also offer more broad, both on the product and the deployment on the infrastructure side to meet customer demand.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. And I would add to Ken's comment. Just pulling back and looking at it even maybe a little more broadly and to the comments that were made in the prepared remarks, we were very pleased with what we saw in terms of July selling activity and the pipeline build worldwide as well as in the U.S.\nKen Xie: Yes. At the same time, like we said, we're also keep on supporting our partner, including the service provider and even some big global customers, they also want to build in their own SASE to just like the cloud. Sometimes they have the private cloud or the leverage public cloud or the hybrid cloud. So it's a similar thing we're seeing here in SASE, which we're also supporting the partner, the customer try to have their own version of SASE, which is based on the service of zero-trust infrastructure to deploy some security function.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.\nSterling Auty: You mentioned continued tailwinds from work-from-home, but we have seen the growth rate on the product side and to a certain extent, the billings ex the adjustments you mentioned start to fade. So I guess my question is, do you expect that those trends can continue on for multiple more quarters? Or do we face further deceleration in the back half as some of the work-from-home tailwinds fade further?\nKen Xie: We do see the enterprise service provider, the high end continue to grow maybe because the new product is announced early this year. And also some SMB, some other part also have very healthy growth. And also, even some of the product target for work-from-home continue to grow in, like we mentioned, FortiToken, FortiAuthenticator and some other products. So it's probably not as a rush buy like we're experiencing some back in March, but it's still pretty strong above the total network security growth.\nSterling Auty: Okay. And then one follow-up. We've heard from multiple companies about accelerating digital transformations. How did the digital transformations and shift to the cloud impact your business either positively or otherwise?\nKen Xie: Yes, we see pretty strong in the retail, right? So if retail, they can order online, they can do whatever deliver or some other -- definitely, they have a lot of benefit. So that's where we see very strong growth in retail, probably benefit from the digitalization and some other vertical or even some other regions have a sort of similar sense. And especially, we said that's what we call the security-driven networking, its combined security networking together. And even the sales, traditionally, they're more engaged with the security team. Now they see a lot of interest from the networking team, partially because SD-WAN is part of FortiGate function, but other party do see it needs to into the networking and security working together, whether the [indiscernible] or the SoC combined together, is also a trend there. So that's where we see quite a good progress combined the security network together, which we designed from our beginning, not just SD-WAN, including Wi-Fi. But Wi-Fi a little bit slow right now because especially enterprise offered in the office, not many people work in the office, but we do see a lot of interest continuing in that direction. And also the 5G, we see very, strong increase in ramp up.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Goldman Sachs.\nBrian Essex: Keith, I was wondering maybe if you could hit a little bit more on billings, maybe a little bit softer than we had expected in the quarter and then kind of a nice guidance for next quarter. Maybe some of the dynamics behind that. And in particular, I'm interested in large deal dynamics, particularly U.S. financial services, where we've heard about some weakness in the quarter. I understand retail is really strong, but maybe a little bit more color on that and how it might impact billings.\nKeith Jensen: I think the financial services strength that we saw in the quarter was outside of the U.S. Obviously, New York got hit. Northeast got hit pretty hard with the pandemic in the second quarter. And so that financial services growth number that we gave on billings, I think, it was 33%. That's really an international growth number, and it kind of speaks to the diversification of the business. And we've talked before about our diversification that the U.S. represents maybe 25% to 30%. Obviously, our largest country, but not a majority as it is with some other businesses. So we did feel the effect, particularly towards the middle part of the quarter there with some of the things that were happening and the uncertainty in the U.S. on our total numbers, but we are very pleased with what we saw, as I said earlier, related to Asia Pacific and the rest of the world.\nKen Xie: Yes. The other part, really, starting to make the second half of last year, we started in May, the second half of last year we started to ramp up the high-end ad sales capacity, additional market in lead gen -- and then the pandemic actually slowed down some of the new sales, I mean, become like more productive or whatever reach the productivity level for what we expect. At the same time, some of them maybe take a little bit longer time to reach the new customer, especially in the U.S., we do have quite some sales capacity. That's actually the pandemic slow since down a little bit, but with the additional hiring, with additional new product position we have, we do believe once the pandemic starting to get better, especially in the U.S., we will see very strong growth potential.\nBrian Essex: Got it. Maybe, Keith, just a quick follow-up quickly. Nice cut in cash flow in the quarter, better than we thought. Maybe some of the puts and takes outside of billings and change in deferred that drove that and outlook for the rest of the year from -- particularly from a working capital perspective.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think the other part of it is that collections are very strong, and I applaud the collections team for the great job that they did, working with our channel partners to bring the cash in. I think we were perhaps a little more successful in that than we planned. Yes. I think when you look at our free cash flow numbers, you're going to get from quarter-to-quarter a little bit of volatility because we try not to over manage the timing of payments and things of that nature. So it's probably better to look at a couple of quarters stringing those together to look at terms. But in terms of the key drivers, yes, it's billings. You can get something with inventory and payables. But I think the margin part of that really is a large driver. That outperformance on the margin line really manifests itself in many ways, one of which is in the free cash flow.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Hamza Fodderwala with Morgan Stanley.\nHamza Fodderwala: Keith, I just wanted to dig in a little bit on the comments that you made around some of the sales cycles towards the end of the quarter. I'm wondering if how did those deal cycles progress toward late in Q2. What, if any, deals sort of had slipped out in Q3? And whether or not those have been closed so far in July?\nKeith Jensen: Yes, fair question. And I think the thing that we've seen with the pandemic, and I'll pull this up a little bit, if you go through the guidance setting process, obviously, you'll start with the pipeline, and then you start making certain assumptions about the close rate. And while we felt good, I felt good about what I was seeing in April, nonetheless, we made some adjustments to our expected close rate in the quarter for the second quarter. And as we got to kind of leading to your question, the last week of the quarter, I think we saw perhaps a few more deals that did not get the final signature that we expected them to get. And then your follow-on part of your question is, what are we seeing in July, and that's why I'm making the point that I think I'm very -- we're very pleased with what we're seeing in terms of July of sales activity, whether you measure it base on growth or linearity against our target as well as the pipeline and as well as considering what we might call pandemic-related close rates.\nHamza Fodderwala: Got it. Got it. And just a follow-up question, if I may. On the government vertical, obviously, that's a big one for you. Could you comment a little bit about on how that grew from a year-on-year perspective? And what you see in the pipeline, especially with the U.S. federal close coming up?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. So keep in mind, our U.S. Federal business -- our federal business is -- our government business, excuse me, it has 3 components. It has a U.S. Fed, it has international governments and it has state and local governments. And I would say that the performance was strong across at about 26% growth, 25% growth, but that was not driven by state and local government. State and local government suffered. And then the U.S. Fed part of our business is not a huge part of our business. So you're really looking at, while the U.S. Fed did well, we had nice, very attractive growth internationally with our government segment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nBrad Zelnick: You guys continue to execute well, putting up better results than your nearest competitors. And the diversification of your business is on full display this quarter, which is great to see. Can you comment at all just in terms of the competitive dynamic that you're seeing out there? And maybe anything that you can share in terms of the pricing dynamic as well?\nKen Xie: Yes. I think with the -- like a 73% business come from FortiGate. So with the new release of like today, the high-end and most high-end product to support hyperscale. So we see the performance that keep increased as we are getting much better, better and at the same time, in the last few quarters, the SoC4-based like from 60F to 80F to 100F 40F, we're also starting to see huge investment of growth in the field, especially, you can see the SMB, they usually buy this low-end SoC-based product also is growing quite well. So that's where from the product we see because we're keeping investment high in this ASIC, which has a much better computing power and a security function compared to the general purpose CPU, so the recorded security compute rating come from like 25x better to like today's products like 13x better than the competitor. It's a huge advantage and plus additional function like SD-WANs and other parts. So we see a quite a huge advantage and more gap compared with competitor. They probably will keep on pushing some software or some other form of deployment, which because it did have a difficult time competing with us into this appliance or some other base. But for us, also, we're positioned to have the whole infrastructure solution, not just the appliance base, but also in the cloud and in the software base, and then also offer different kind of deployment, different kind of service. We also see quite good healthy growth from that angle. And that's where the -- we call the fabric approach, the fabric solution. Amount of revenue is still like almost double compared to FortiGate growth. So we still see pretty healthy like once you get in leverage of FortiGate, then we can more easy to expand into the other non-FortiGate growth. So that benefit the fabric advantage still keeping help us grow faster above-average because it's really -- the consolidation is still the -- still is the trend in the whole industry there. So customers want to reduce the management cost. They prefer to consolidate some of the vendors, which we started to see more benefit for us because most product function, we do develop in-house, which make it integrate and automate on day 1 compared to some other competitive dependent acquisitions, more difficult to integrate and automate. So that's what we see is we continue to invest long term both on the product technology infrastructure side, and we do believe it's a long-term gain. And so that's where so we're keeping gaining market share. And we do see the gap bigger, and we have more advantage right now.\nKeith Jensen: Yes, Brad, it's Keith. I would continue on what Ken's comments there a little bit. And keeping in mind, I made a reference to it in the text that we're seeing a new cost advantage evolved within the E-Series, and we expect it to continue with the F-Series. I mean I think that the company can has done a tremendous job with the ASIC Advantage of driving down the cost in subsequent generations of the chip at the same time, driving up the performance. That gross margin performance that I mentioned earlier in the script, that actually came with it with just a small headwind with discounting for the first time. And you may have been asking a discounting question. Discounting is the first time we've seen that in several quarters, about 0.5 point, if you will, perhaps increase in discounting. But that cost structure that's coming with the ASIC Advantage that I made reference to is more than enough to outweigh that.\nBrad Zelnick: Thank you both so much for the very thorough answers. And I would just say that the competitive differentiation of your strategy continues to shine through. Congrats.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard.\nWalter Pritchard: Two product questions. First, just on the -- I think last quarter, you had some real strength in the remote access, things like authenticators and tokens. Just curious how that continued into this quarter. And then also on the SASE side, when are you talking about having an integrated SASE SD-WAN product in the market?\nKeith Jensen: I'll take the first one. In very round numbers, I would say, if I got a benefit of, call it, very round numbers, $10 million in the first quarter. I probably got half that benefit in the second quarter on those 3 work-from-home products.\nKen Xie: Okay. The SASE we're offering them to the customer to the partner this quarter, and it's part of what we call the fabric FortiSASE solution. And we do see the interest both from the existing customers, from new customers. And at the same time, a lot of our service provider partners are also very interested in this. And even some global customers, they also want to build their own version of SASE, which we are also supporting them behind.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America.\nTal Liani: My question is more general about the market. The data shows that the firewall market has been slowing down tremendously in the last few quarters, 6 or 7 quarters of decline. What is your experience with the market? I'm trying to understand if your continued growth is a question of continued share gain or new products that are compensating for firewall weaknesses. So what's your view of the overall market and the drivers for firewall demand in the market?\nKen Xie: Yes, the traditional firewall, they're more secured, we called the border [ph], which is positioned between the internal network LAN and also the Internet. That part is, like I say, there's a -- no longer enough. There's a multiple way you can bypass that and also a lot of application, a lot of -- since also go beyond the company network, they go to the cloud. They go to some other part like mobile access. So that's where the traditional firewall where we do see the growth slowdown. That's where we keep expanding beyond like we expand the WAN and that's we call security-driven network in that space and even building of the FortiGate and make it part of the WAN solution and also part of cloud solution. At the same time, internally also expand total internal segmentation, like with the switch, with Wi-Fi access point. That part is also growing very, very well and quite strong. And so like I said is we keep in saying now, we say it's a third-generation of network of security infrastructure from the traditional connection base to when we formed Fortinet. We called it content application-based security. And now it's more like the whole infrastructure security including both the traditional gateway and also go to the Internet and the WAN connection, cloud solution and the SASE, at the same we can go internal for the segmentation for the switch for the Wi-Fi, it's the whole new enterprise, the end point of different application. So it's the whole infrastructure security, we feel is a new trend, which we prepare all this using the fabric, using ASIC, increase the computing power to address the network speed issue. We keep in doing this in the -- for about 20 years since we found the company. So we're starting to see the investment we made, whether from ASIC, from the technology from the product side, from the infrastructure side, starting more benefit us and differentiate Fortinet compared to some other competitors, still relatively. It's the same approach compared to the early day of network security. So that's what we see as a gap and the advantage we have is kind of bigger and bigger going forward.\nTal Liani: Got it. And the migration to SASE, isn't it going against your core offering?\nKen Xie: No. It's a part of the whole infrastructure security and like SD-WAN because for the SASE is really, you need the access to it, right? So that's where SD-WANs and other parts really have a good way to access that. So we are built in into the FortiGate and has huge performance and functional advantage. And at the same time, the service model leverage, the infrastructure we have, the customer base we have, that's where the OPAQ acquisition keeping enhanced this part. So that's what we address some of the new things the customer need. And at the same time, the partner also see how we can like working closely with them to supporting the customer better, give them the additional flexibility no matter what kind of format of security form that they want.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore.\nAmit Daryanani: I guess first one, you guys mentioned a couple of times about certain deals just getting pushed out from June into the September quarter. Any sense you could give in terms of the deal size or the verticals where you saw this happening? And I guess if you didn't have any of these issues, what would the June quarter revenue look like?\nKeith Jensen: I don't know if there was a common -- well, first of all, large deals for us, it would be $1 million, right? They're not $10 million, $20 million or $30 million deals. So you're probably looking at some number of those transactions that moved. I don't know that there was a common theme in terms of verticals, if you will. I do think that it was a bit more of a challenge in the U.S. than it was in other geographies on that close rate for the last week of the month -- or the last week of the quarter.\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. And I guess, last quarter on this one, you've talked some amount about perhaps using your financial strength as a way to essentially accelerate your share gains. Could you just touch on what impact would that have in your free cash flow or even your margins perhaps? Just want a sense -- just trying to get a sense of how much are you willing to flex your model? And what sort of share gain aspirations would you have from these dynamics that you would take on?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. There's probably 3 places that you could see. One is looking at the inventory because we're -- in this environment, we'd like to keep a little more inventory on hand. And so when you look at the inventory turns, I think the number was 2.2 in the quarter, and that's probably down about 1. And so you can do some math there and quantify it. You can also look -- the second place you would see it is on the extended payment terms. We provide the metric of what our contractual payment terms were as of at the end of the quarter, which I think was 67 days, and that's up 17%. The third place that we can flex a little bit is on discounting, and I kind of covered that a moment ago. That while discounting in the current economic environment is a fact of life, and we did have a slight increase in discounting, for us, it was outweighed by the structural difference in our cost structure, which more than outweigh it.  So, in terms of flexing our balance sheet and looking at the cash flow model, if you will, I think the key place for inventory and then looking at the collections.\nPeter Salkowski: And just one correction on the contractual payment terms, it was 62 days.\nKeith Jensen: I'm sorry. I'm happy. I'm happy it's only 62.\nOperator: And this does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Peter Salkowski for closing remarks.\nPeter Salkowski: Thank you, Chris. I'd like to thank everyone for joining on today's call. Fortinet will be attending the following virtual investor conferences during the third quarter. We'll be doing the Oppenheimer conference next week on August 11; the Citibank conference on September 9; and the Colliers Securities conference on September 10. Event presentations will be webcast and links from these webcasts will be available on the Investor Relations website of the Fortinet IR site. If there are any follow-up questions, please feel free to contact me. Have a great rest of your day. Thank you very much. Have a good day. Take care. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ken Xie",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our second quarter 2020 results. We are very pleased with the solid second quarter performance. Revenue increased 18% to $616 million, with product revenue up 12% and service revenue up 22%. Secure SD-WAN climbed to 12% of total second quarter billings, the first time it's been over 10%. In today's environment, enterprise are focused on effectively and cost efficiently deploying security across their physical and digital network. To meet these challenges, Fortinet was founded on the vision of bringing security and networking together in what we refer to as security-driven networking. Gartner supports a similar concept, which they call Secure Access Service Edge or SASE. Fortinet is an industry leader in building, integrating and automating security product and service into Fortinet Security Fabric, including FortiSASE. With the recent acquisition of OPAQ Networks, Fortinet has enhanced its FortiSASE solution with expanded cloud delivery, including firewall as a service and Zero-Trust Network Access. Additionally, FortiSASE was built to be partner-friendly empowering MSPs and big global customers to easily integrate or build FortiSASE platform into their own offerings. A critical component of Fortinet Security Fabric platform is SD-WAN. We recently announced the new FortiGate 80F, which expand our SD-WAN portfolio for branch offices and work-from-home. The FortiGate 80F is powered by the latest FortiSPU SoC4 can deliver Security Compute Rating as much as 25x higher than industry average appliance using generic CPUs. According to Gartner, worldwide SD-WAN equipment market data for the first quarter of 2020, Fortinet has the highest revenue growth and was the top 3 for market share. We attribute this growth to our ability to deliver secure, high-performance SD-WAN anywhere from home to the branch to the cloud. Security investment remains a priority for enterprise and service providers, demonstrated by the strong growth of our high-end FortiGate appliance during the last quarter. Today, we released the FortiGate 4400F, the only firewall in the industry capable of securing hyperscale data center and 5G networks. Powered by the NP7 network processor, the 4400F delivers the highest performance with Security Compute Rating of up to 13x higher than our competition. The release of several new appliance powered by our latest FortiASIC SPU, together with cloud and software-based virtual machine to deploy security anywhere, we are able for Fortinet to capitalize on this investment and put us in a strong position going forward. Before turning the call over to Keith for a closer look at our second quarter performance and our guidance, I would like to take a moment to welcome the over 400 people who joined Fortinet during the second quarter as well as welcome OPAQ team who recently joined, and to thank our employees, customers and partners worldwide for their continued support to manage our response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Keith? I think it's SD-WAN is a long-term benefit for both enterprise and also SMB and because it's also lower the cost of connect to the Internet. At the same time, make it more efficient. And for us, also building with ASIC security together, so they can also have additional secured additional benefit and cost much lower compared to some other competitors. So the market grew about 50% year-over-year. So we see a lot of potential, a lot of pipeline. We do believe we're keep on gaining market share because our solution is a very unique, huge advantage compared to other competitors. And with additional sales capacity we added, like we add head count, 23%. Even during the pandemic, take a little bit more time to train the new sales people, and then they maybe take a little bit more time to gain a new customer, but we do see a huge potential going forward. We have this FortiSASE, like I mentioned, even in the last time earnings call, and we do believe it's a part of the whole infrastructure. So as the cloud delivery, we already have some other cloud delivery, but OPAQ definitely keep enhances, and we're making more broad, more flexible for customer, for the partner to leverage the product infrastructure we're building. And so we do see this already and hence, the offer we have. And at the same time, we do have the broadest offering both on the platform and also on the function and also on kind of different form of deployment compared to other competitors we see is keeping ahead our position. The enterprise also, including some branch profits we do see some slowdown especially in the U.S. But it's -- on the other side, if you look at our product, which come out like the SoC4 come out 1 years ago, we started building a product like from 100F to 60F for the 40F, then we just announced 80F last week. So we can see the ramp-up, especially in the SMB, including the U.S., as it go up like over 40%. It's very, very strong. Internationally, we're a little bit behind on the U.S. to adopt some new products, including some -- both the low end using SoC4 and also the high end NP7, which is starting to release about like early this year and so starting to ramp up. So that's why we see the benefit of the new product, which easily have a performance like 4x, 5x better than the same cost, which we use in the - - we call security compute rating to benchmark compared to the other competitor is a huge advantage. So we see -- when we have the new product growth that come up very quickly after the testing evaluate on top of the product. But on the other side, the SD-WAN also gave the additional cost benefit, together with the new product cost performance benefit. So that's what helping driving the SMBs. We see it starting growing quite well. Also last quarter, after we announced the high end product, like 1 to 2 quarter, we starting to see the high end also starting to ramp up leverage NP7. So that's the trend. And I do believe sometime enterprise takes a little bit more time during this pandemic to do some deployment. But we do see a lot of evaluation going on. We do see some other interest, including combined, we call security networking together, we call secure-driven networking set the whole infrastructure. That's why the sales probably were more engage into the networking team. And also traditionally, more sales to security. Now as the networking team also starting engaged together with us to call secure-driven networking. So as we see the trend going on quite well. And also, like Keith mentioned, it's region by region, right? So it's a APAC staring to grow more very quickly, over 20%. And simply the pandemic kind of the situation maybe better recover a little bit better. And then we also see Europe probably also growing over 10%. The U.S. is a little bit slow, but we do believe later this year, next year that vaccines over, with the new product lineup, with the additional sales capacity we build, which we'll continue to invest, where we see very, very strong potential going forward. We do see some enterprise customer has a good interest about SASE and just like some other cloud or some other platform of deployment infrastructure. So that when we make it as the whole infrastructure security offering. And the dollar or the amount of revenue are still relatively small, which may not impact much of the total billing of revenue there, but there's an interest about this and make it -- so customer want us make sure has some kind of flexibility and also broad offering. So that's where we see the OPAQ acquisition keep enhance what we have on the FortiSASE and also offer more broad, both on the product and the deployment on the infrastructure side to meet customer demand. Yes. At the same time, like we said, we're also keep on supporting our partner, including the service provider and even some big global customers, they also want to build in their own SASE to just like the cloud. Sometimes they have the private cloud or the leverage public cloud or the hybrid cloud. So it's a similar thing we're seeing here in SASE, which we're also supporting the partner, the customer try to have their own version of SASE, which is based on the service of zero-trust infrastructure to deploy some security function. We do see the enterprise service provider, the high end continue to grow maybe because the new product is announced early this year. And also some SMB, some other part also have very healthy growth. And also, even some of the product target for work-from-home continue to grow in, like we mentioned, FortiToken, FortiAuthenticator and some other products. So it's probably not as a rush buy like we're experiencing some back in March, but it's still pretty strong above the total network security growth. Yes, we see pretty strong in the retail, right? So if retail, they can order online, they can do whatever deliver or some other -- definitely, they have a lot of benefit. So that's where we see very strong growth in retail, probably benefit from the digitalization and some other vertical or even some other regions have a sort of similar sense. And especially, we said that's what we call the security-driven networking, its combined security networking together. And even the sales, traditionally, they're more engaged with the security team. Now they see a lot of interest from the networking team, partially because SD-WAN is part of FortiGate function, but other party do see it needs to into the networking and security working together, whether the [indiscernible] or the SoC combined together, is also a trend there. So that's where we see quite a good progress combined the security network together, which we designed from our beginning, not just SD-WAN, including Wi-Fi. But Wi-Fi a little bit slow right now because especially enterprise offered in the office, not many people work in the office, but we do see a lot of interest continuing in that direction. And also the 5G, we see very, strong increase in ramp up. Yes. The other part, really, starting to make the second half of last year, we started in May, the second half of last year we started to ramp up the high-end ad sales capacity, additional market in lead gen -- and then the pandemic actually slowed down some of the new sales, I mean, become like more productive or whatever reach the productivity level for what we expect. At the same time, some of them maybe take a little bit longer time to reach the new customer, especially in the U.S., we do have quite some sales capacity. That's actually the pandemic slow since down a little bit, but with the additional hiring, with additional new product position we have, we do believe once the pandemic starting to get better, especially in the U.S., we will see very strong growth potential. Yes. I think with the -- like a 73% business come from FortiGate. So with the new release of like today, the high-end and most high-end product to support hyperscale. So we see the performance that keep increased as we are getting much better, better and at the same time, in the last few quarters, the SoC4-based like from 60F to 80F to 100F 40F, we're also starting to see huge investment of growth in the field, especially, you can see the SMB, they usually buy this low-end SoC-based product also is growing quite well. So that's where from the product we see because we're keeping investment high in this ASIC, which has a much better computing power and a security function compared to the general purpose CPU, so the recorded security compute rating come from like 25x better to like today's products like 13x better than the competitor. It's a huge advantage and plus additional function like SD-WANs and other parts. So we see a quite a huge advantage and more gap compared with competitor. They probably will keep on pushing some software or some other form of deployment, which because it did have a difficult time competing with us into this appliance or some other base. But for us, also, we're positioned to have the whole infrastructure solution, not just the appliance base, but also in the cloud and in the software base, and then also offer different kind of deployment, different kind of service. We also see quite good healthy growth from that angle. And that's where the -- we call the fabric approach, the fabric solution. Amount of revenue is still like almost double compared to FortiGate growth. So we still see pretty healthy like once you get in leverage of FortiGate, then we can more easy to expand into the other non-FortiGate growth. So that benefit the fabric advantage still keeping help us grow faster above-average because it's really -- the consolidation is still the -- still is the trend in the whole industry there. So customers want to reduce the management cost. They prefer to consolidate some of the vendors, which we started to see more benefit for us because most product function, we do develop in-house, which make it integrate and automate on day 1 compared to some other competitive dependent acquisitions, more difficult to integrate and automate. So that's what we see is we continue to invest long term both on the product technology infrastructure side, and we do believe it's a long-term gain. And so that's where so we're keeping gaining market share. And we do see the gap bigger, and we have more advantage right now. Okay. The SASE we're offering them to the customer to the partner this quarter, and it's part of what we call the fabric FortiSASE solution. And we do see the interest both from the existing customers, from new customers. And at the same time, a lot of our service provider partners are also very interested in this. And even some global customers, they also want to build their own version of SASE, which we are also supporting them behind. Yes, the traditional firewall, they're more secured, we called the border [ph], which is positioned between the internal network LAN and also the Internet. That part is, like I say, there's a -- no longer enough. There's a multiple way you can bypass that and also a lot of application, a lot of -- since also go beyond the company network, they go to the cloud. They go to some other part like mobile access. So that's where the traditional firewall where we do see the growth slowdown. That's where we keep expanding beyond like we expand the WAN and that's we call security-driven network in that space and even building of the FortiGate and make it part of the WAN solution and also part of cloud solution. At the same time, internally also expand total internal segmentation, like with the switch, with Wi-Fi access point. That part is also growing very, very well and quite strong. And so like I said is we keep in saying now, we say it's a third-generation of network of security infrastructure from the traditional connection base to when we formed Fortinet. We called it content application-based security. And now it's more like the whole infrastructure security including both the traditional gateway and also go to the Internet and the WAN connection, cloud solution and the SASE, at the same we can go internal for the segmentation for the switch for the Wi-Fi, it's the whole new enterprise, the end point of different application. So it's the whole infrastructure security, we feel is a new trend, which we prepare all this using the fabric, using ASIC, increase the computing power to address the network speed issue. We keep in doing this in the -- for about 20 years since we found the company. So we're starting to see the investment we made, whether from ASIC, from the technology from the product side, from the infrastructure side, starting more benefit us and differentiate Fortinet compared to some other competitors, still relatively. It's the same approach compared to the early day of network security. So that's what we see as a gap and the advantage we have is kind of bigger and bigger going forward. No. It's a part of the whole infrastructure security and like SD-WAN because for the SASE is really, you need the access to it, right? So that's where SD-WANs and other parts really have a good way to access that. So we are built in into the FortiGate and has huge performance and functional advantage. And at the same time, the service model leverage, the infrastructure we have, the customer base we have, that's where the OPAQ acquisition keeping enhanced this part. So that's what we address some of the new things the customer need. And at the same time, the partner also see how we can like working closely with them to supporting the customer better, give them the additional flexibility no matter what kind of format of security form that they want."

            "content": "Thank you, Ken. Let's start the second quarter review with revenue. Total revenue of $616 million was up 18%, driven by non-FortiGate products and service revenue growth of 25%. Non-FortiGate revenue growth benefited from very strong demand for virtual machines and our work-from-home solutions. FortiGate product and service revenue growth was 16% and benefited from record levels of billings for our secure SD-WAN solution. To a large extent, our second quarter revenue growth, together with the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, affirms the benefits of our diversification across geographies, customer segments and industry verticals. At the same time, it illustrates the level of revenue predictability in our business model. Our continued growth in this environment is a result of our strategic internal investments made to expand our global sales force, invest in our channel partners and extend our cost per performance advantage as we update our product offerings and penetrate adjacent security markets. Product revenue grew 12% to $212 million -- excuse me, $212 million, benefiting from strong demand for secure SD-WAN, high-end FortiGates and FortiGate virtual machines. Our work-from-home solutions continue to provide a tailwind to growth. Our growth rates and industry reports suggest we continue to take market share in both the firewall and SD-WAN markets, markets where we have contributed leadership and innovation.  Moving to service revenue. Service revenue grew 22% to $404 million, representing 66% of total revenue. Over 90% of service revenue was from deferred revenue at the beginning of the quarter and continues to support our revenue growth and predictability. FortiGuard security subscriptions revenue increased 22% to $223 million. FortiCare technical support revenue increased 22% to $181 million. The revenue mix shift from 8/5 support to our higher-priced 24/7 support was 9 points, with 24/7 support now representing 64% of the mix.  Let's shift to billings. Total billings increased 14% to $711 million. The total billing growth was negatively impacted by approximately 2 points by training and professional services and other miscellaneous products, which are products not classified as FortiGate, fabric or cloud. Earlier this year, we announced our decision to make our network security expert, or NSE, online training and certification program free to the public. While this decision resulted in a reduction in training billings and training revenue, we're very excited about the demand we are seeing with our NSE training. As of this week, the number of NSE registrations for 2020 is well over 500,000. And the number of NSE certifications issued is up over 200% to nearly 200,000.  Looking at billings by product segment. FortiGate billings increased 14% and accounted for 73% of total billings. FortiGate billings include our secure SD-WAN solutions. And as Ken mentioned a moment ago, SD-WAN passed over the 10% threshold for the first time ever, representing 12% of total billings. Non-FortiGate billings also increased 14%, with strong demand from our virtual and work-from-home solutions, offset by smaller contributions from switches and access points. And as I mentioned, billing declines for professional services, training and other miscellaneous products. Our geographic performance aligned with a path of the pandemic. And with it, highlighted the geographic diversification of our business, APAC being further along, outperformed all geos, followed by Europe while North America was impacted more. Our North America results include the United States, where we saw headwinds from the education and local government verticals where the COVID-19 pandemic remained an issue. By comparison, the retail segment was by far and away the strongest-performing U.S. vertical with growth well over 40% as we saw the continued expansion of the SD-WAN solution. The U.S. SMB segment provided strong growth, illustrating the strength of our U.S. channel programs, the remaining opportunity in this market and solid execution by our channel partners and the Fortinet channel team. Looking more at the Americas, our analysis and discussions with our channel partners suggest that certain transactions were delayed into the second half of this year as these companies focused on their capital structure and other immediate priorities.  Moving now to worldwide billings by industry verticals. The diversification of our business model was again on display with our top 5 verticals continue to account for about 2/3 of total billings. Worldwide government sector topped all verticals with 19% of total billings. Service providers and MSSPs accounted for 15% of total billings. Financial services with 14% of total billings had a very strong quarter with billings growth of 33%. And despite COVID-related concerns, the retail vertical posted worldwide billings growth of 27%, accounting for 10% of billings as it continued to benefit from SD-WAN and the strong U.S. performance I mentioned a moment ago. We saw strong growth in retail sub-verticals, such as drug stores, groceries and portions of the wholesale industry. At the end of the second quarter, total deferred revenue increased 24% to $2.3 billion. Short-term deferred revenue increased 24% to $1.3 billion.  Looking now at deals by dollar size. The number of deals over $1 million increased 28% to 59%. Secure SD-WAN accounted for 13 of these deals over $1 million. This performance illustrates our continued ability to move upmarket into the enterprise segment and the continued acceptance of our differentiated single unit, secure SD-WAN offering. Moving back to the income statement. As shown on Slide 4, gross margin improved 260 basis points to 79%. Product gross margin improved 340 basis points to 61%. Product gross margin continued to benefit from the lower cost structure of our newer generation of FortiGate products and over 40% growth in software products. Services gross margin increased 120 basis points to 88.5%, reflecting the benefit of the FortiCare revenue mix shift to 24/7 support. Operating margin for the second quarter increased 370 basis points to 27.3%, benefiting from the improvement in gross margin and lower employee travel and marketing program expenses related to the shift towards virtual events.  Total head count ended the quarter at 7,756, an increase of 23%, driven by the increased investments we've made to grow our business and reflecting a continued decline in sales and other attrition rates. With our continued growth, strong operating margins and free cash flow, we do not anticipate any COVID-19-related layoffs in the foreseeable future. In fact, we plan to capitalize on our many opportunities by continuing to hire and invest in our balanced growth strategy. Given the strong operating income performance, net income for the second quarter was $135 million. Our earnings per diluted share increased $0.24 to $0.82 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of $112 million or $0.68 per diluted share versus GAAP income of $73 million or $0.42 per diluted share a year ago.  Moving to the statement of cash flow summarized on Slide 7 and 8. Free cash flow increased 21.5% to $216 million. The average contract term in the second quarter continued to be within the range we provided at the Analyst Day, declining 1 month year-over-year to 26 months and moving up 1 month sequentially. As we stated on the first quarter call, we expected to leverage the strength of our balance sheet as a competitive advantage to support our partners and our customers. Average contractual payment terms increased to 62 days or 17% sequentially, in line with our expectations and reflecting our decision to provide geographically targeted extended payment term plans. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $31 million, including $21 million related to construction and other real estate activity. We estimate capital expenditures for the third quarter to be between $50 million and $60 million and for all of 2020 to be between $165 million and $185 million. Delays related to the new campus building have moved a portion of the previously expected 2020 CapEx spending into the first half of 2021. We expect full year cash taxes to be approximately $40 million, and our full year non-GAAP tax rate to be 22%. In the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $146 million. In July, the Board authorized an additional $500 million for our share repurchase authorization and extended the term to February 2022. As of today, the remaining share buyback authorization is approximately $1 billion.  Before moving to guidance, we wanted to offer some additional thoughts related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We have and we plan to continue leveraging the strength of our balance sheet, which may increase DSOs and inventory levels. The economic and business impact of the pandemic seems in line with the ability of different countries and geographies to reopen and avoid temporary shutdowns and uncertainty. For example, after strong billings growth in April, we saw slower growth as we completed May, then followed by a bounce back to strong growth in June and again strong in July. At the same time, the remaining Q3 pipeline points to a good level of improvement in both the U.S. and worldwide. In the second quarter, our channel partners reported some deals being delayed into the second half of the year. The concept was delayed, not lost, seems supported by the increases in our pipeline as well as with July selling activity. Clearly, there remains an elevated level of uncertainty about future -- about future pandemic events and economic conditions.  As we look forward, I'd like to review our outlook for the third quarter, summarized on Slide 9, which is subject to the disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. In the third quarter, we expect billings in the range of $705 million to $730 million; revenue in the range of $630 million to $645 million; non-GAAP gross margin of 78% to 79%; non-GAAP operating margin of 25.5% to 26.5%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.76 to $0.78, which assumes a share count of between 168 million and 170 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 22%. For 2020, due to the continued uncertainty associated with the economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, we are not issuing full year guidance at this time.  And finally, along with Ken, I'd like to welcome all the team members who have joined us, including the OPAQ team. I'd also like to thank our partners, customers and the Fortinet team for all their support and hard work during these difficult and unique times. I'll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A. Yes, Fatima This is Keith. I think Ken does a great job of covering off some of the diversification considerations, whether it's by geographies and where different geographies may be and also by verticals. But it's also important to note that SD-WAN is also a significant component of SASE also for work-from-home solutions. A lot of topics, Fatima. Maybe I'll start with the last one in. I know you do a good job. Look, I think when we look at the pipeline for Q3, which is what we've guided to, I think we feel very good about the SD-WAN opportunity. Clearly, we saw it perhaps, in the U.S. in the month of May a bit of a pause, maybe some projects that were -- as we got towards the end of May. But clearly, as we exited Q2 and we've moved into Q3, we can see that our customers are making plans to continue moving forward their SD-WAN build-outs. And the additional opportunities that we see in the pipeline made us, let's just say, comfortable talking about crossing over that 10% threshold for the first time. Now we'll see how it actually comes into play. And I think I lost track of some of your earlier comments, I'm sorry. Yes. And I would add to Ken's comment. Just pulling back and looking at it even maybe a little more broadly and to the comments that were made in the prepared remarks, we were very pleased with what we saw in terms of July selling activity and the pipeline build worldwide as well as in the U.S. I think the financial services strength that we saw in the quarter was outside of the U.S. Obviously, New York got hit. Northeast got hit pretty hard with the pandemic in the second quarter. And so that financial services growth number that we gave on billings, I think, it was 33%. That's really an international growth number, and it kind of speaks to the diversification of the business. And we've talked before about our diversification that the U.S. represents maybe 25% to 30%. Obviously, our largest country, but not a majority as it is with some other businesses. So we did feel the effect, particularly towards the middle part of the quarter there with some of the things that were happening and the uncertainty in the U.S. on our total numbers, but we are very pleased with what we saw, as I said earlier, related to Asia Pacific and the rest of the world. Yes. I think the other part of it is that collections are very strong, and I applaud the collections team for the great job that they did, working with our channel partners to bring the cash in. I think we were perhaps a little more successful in that than we planned. Yes. I think when you look at our free cash flow numbers, you're going to get from quarter-to-quarter a little bit of volatility because we try not to over manage the timing of payments and things of that nature. So it's probably better to look at a couple of quarters stringing those together to look at terms. But in terms of the key drivers, yes, it's billings. You can get something with inventory and payables. But I think the margin part of that really is a large driver. That outperformance on the margin line really manifests itself in many ways, one of which is in the free cash flow. Yes, fair question. And I think the thing that we've seen with the pandemic, and I'll pull this up a little bit, if you go through the guidance setting process, obviously, you'll start with the pipeline, and then you start making certain assumptions about the close rate. And while we felt good, I felt good about what I was seeing in April, nonetheless, we made some adjustments to our expected close rate in the quarter for the second quarter. And as we got to kind of leading to your question, the last week of the quarter, I think we saw perhaps a few more deals that did not get the final signature that we expected them to get. And then your follow-on part of your question is, what are we seeing in July, and that's why I'm making the point that I think I'm very -- we're very pleased with what we're seeing in terms of July of sales activity, whether you measure it base on growth or linearity against our target as well as the pipeline and as well as considering what we might call pandemic-related close rates. Yes. So keep in mind, our U.S. Federal business -- our federal business is -- our government business, excuse me, it has 3 components. It has a U.S. Fed, it has international governments and it has state and local governments. And I would say that the performance was strong across at about 26% growth, 25% growth, but that was not driven by state and local government. State and local government suffered. And then the U.S. Fed part of our business is not a huge part of our business. So you're really looking at, while the U.S. Fed did well, we had nice, very attractive growth internationally with our government segment. Yes, Brad, it's Keith. I would continue on what Ken's comments there a little bit. And keeping in mind, I made a reference to it in the text that we're seeing a new cost advantage evolved within the E-Series, and we expect it to continue with the F-Series. I mean I think that the company can has done a tremendous job with the ASIC Advantage of driving down the cost in subsequent generations of the chip at the same time, driving up the performance. That gross margin performance that I mentioned earlier in the script, that actually came with it with just a small headwind with discounting for the first time. And you may have been asking a discounting question. Discounting is the first time we've seen that in several quarters, about 0.5 point, if you will, perhaps increase in discounting. But that cost structure that's coming with the ASIC Advantage that I made reference to is more than enough to outweigh that. I'll take the first one. In very round numbers, I would say, if I got a benefit of, call it, very round numbers, $10 million in the first quarter. I probably got half that benefit in the second quarter on those 3 work-from-home products. I don't know if there was a common -- well, first of all, large deals for us, it would be $1 million, right? They're not $10 million, $20 million or $30 million deals. So you're probably looking at some number of those transactions that moved. I don't know that there was a common theme in terms of verticals, if you will. I do think that it was a bit more of a challenge in the U.S. than it was in other geographies on that close rate for the last week of the month -- or the last week of the quarter. Yes. There's probably 3 places that you could see. One is looking at the inventory because we're -- in this environment, we'd like to keep a little more inventory on hand. And so when you look at the inventory turns, I think the number was 2.2 in the quarter, and that's probably down about 1. And so you can do some math there and quantify it. You can also look -- the second place you would see it is on the extended payment terms. We provide the metric of what our contractual payment terms were as of at the end of the quarter, which I think was 67 days, and that's up 17%. The third place that we can flex a little bit is on discounting, and I kind of covered that a moment ago. That while discounting in the current economic environment is a fact of life, and we did have a slight increase in discounting, for us, it was outweighed by the structural difference in our cost structure, which more than outweigh it.  So, in terms of flexing our balance sheet and looking at the cash flow model, if you will, I think the key place for inventory and then looking at the collections. I'm sorry. I'm happy. I'm happy it's only 62."

Lastly, all references to growth are on a year-over-year basis unless noted otherwise. I would like to now turn the call over to Ken.\nKen Xie: Thank you. Thank you, Peter. And thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our first quarter 2020 results. And we'd like to thank our employees, customers, partners, suppliers worldwide for their commitment to manage our response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  We are very pleased with our strong first quarter performance. Billings increased 21% to $668 million, driven by solid execution and across all three major regions. Revenue increased 22% to $577 million. The solid performance of our core firewall, security fabric, SD-WAN and work from home solution resulted in an 18% increase in product revenue and a 24% increase in service revenue.  Shipment of FortiGate unit increased 30% in the first quarter, driven by our home secure VPN and secure SD-WAN product, built with our ASIC-powered appliance. In addition, demand for broad integrated automated security fabric platform, especially the FortiClient, FortiAuthenticator and FortiToken was very strong. Our ability to directly manage our supply chain and shipping logistics allowed us to quickly adjust to the current dynamic environment. Today, Fortinet released a FortiGate 4200F, another milestone in our ability to deliver the industry highest performance and the most cost efficient secure solution on the market. Powered by the new NP7, the 4200F is engineered to meet the scale and performance demand of today's enterprise and service provider companies.  With 10x the VPN performance over competitors, its ability to scale teleworker solution will be a key competitive advantage for Fortinet as enterprise looks for cost efficient way to support our large, remote workforce.  During the quarter, we released the FortiOS 6.4 with over 350 new features, including new automation, scalability, performance and AI capability, providing for protection across entire digital infrastructure.  Included in the FortiOS 6.4 are several enhancements to our secure SD-WAN offerings. Fortinet is one of the fastest growing SD-WAN providers and the only major player in this market with the internally developed offering that provides security and SD-WAN networking in a single solution. We believe we'll continue to gain SD-WAN market share in 2020. Fortinet is an important strategic partner, especially as company looks to efficiently deploy their security budget, our industry-validated work from home and a secure SD-WAN offering, along with our SPU-driven FortiGates, Security Fabric platform and hybrid-cloud offerings, provide the best security with the most cost-efficient solution for companies across their entire digital infrastructure. I would now like to turn the call over to Keith for a closer look and our first quarter performance and our guidance. \nKeith Jensen : Thank you, Ken. Let me first note, I would like to join Ken in wholeheartedly thanking our employees and their families, and our customers, partners and suppliers for their outstanding support in managing our response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  With that in mind, let's start the first quarter review with revenue. Total revenue of $577 million was up 22%. The fabric and cloud segment revenue growth was over 24%. The FortiGate network security revenue growth was 21%. Both our Fabric and FortiGate network security segments growth continued to benefit from our secure SD-WAN solutions.  The strong first quarter revenue growth once again illustrates the benefit of our diversification across geographies, customer segments, and industry verticals. The momentum our business has experienced is the result of our strategic internal investments made to broaden our product offerings, penetrate adjacent security markets, expand our global sales force and invest in our channel partners.  Product revenue grew 18% to $192 million, benefiting from strong demand for our FortiGate appliances, secure SD-WAN offering, integrated Fabric platform appliance and software solutions, as well as our embedded and standalone work from home security solutions.  Our growth rates and industry reports suggest we continue to take market share in both the firewall and SD-WAN markets, markets where we'd have contributed leadership and innovation.  Moving to service revenue, service revenue grew 24% to $385 million, representing 67% of total revenue. Over 90% of service revenue was from deferred revenue at the beginning of the quarter and continues to provide an increased level of revenue predictability.  FortiGuard security subscription revenue increased 25% to $211 million. FortiCare technical support and other service revenue increased 23% to $173 million.  The mix shift from 8/5 to our higher price 24/7 support was 6 points. And 24/7 support now represents just over 60% of this mix.  Let's shift to billings. Total billings increased 21% to $668 million. FortiGate network security billings increased 21% and accounted for 75% of total billings. Fabric and cloud billings combined increased 32%, driven by our secure access and our work from home related offerings, including FortiToken FortiAuthenticator and FortiClient.  Once again, the diversification of our business model by industry vertical was on display in the first quarter, with our top five verticals continuing to account for about two-thirds of our total billings. Service providers and MSSPs, which we believe serve a large portion of the SMB market, topped all verticals with 19% of total billings, representing its highest percent of total billings in five quarters.  Financial services had a very strong quarter, with billings growth of over 40% and represented 14% of total billings.  At the end of the first quarter, total deferred revenue increased 26% to $2.2 billion. Short-term deferred revenue increased 24% to $1.2 billion.  Looking at deals by dollar size. For deals over $250,000 and $500,000, the billings value increased 22% and 20% respectively. The dollar value of deals over $1 million increased 27%, illustrating our continued ability to move up market into the enterprise segment.  Moving back to the income statement, as shown on slide 4, gross margin improved 150 basis points to 78.7%. Product gross margin improved 300 basis points to 61.4%. Product gross margin benefited from over 40% growth in software products and lower indirect cost. Services gross margin increased 30 basis points to 87.4%.  Operating margin for the first quarter increased 190 basis points to 22.3%, benefitting from the improvement in gross margin and lower employee travel expenses related to the shift towards work from home.  During the quarter, we entered into a seven-year mutual covenant not to sue agreement with a competitor related to our patent portfolio in return for a $50 million cash payment to Fortinet.  We recognized a GAAP gain of $36.8 million as a credit to operating expenses, and we'll recognize the remainder over the term of the agreement.  We have excluded the $50 million cash receipt from our free cash flow and the $36.8 million gain from our non-GAAP margins and other results.  Total headcount ended the quarter at 7,448, an increase of 24%, driven by increased investments we made to leverage the positive momentum in our business, while seeing improving attrition rates over the last few quarters.  We do not anticipate any COVID-19-related layoffs for the foreseeable future.  Given our strong operating income performance, net income for the first quarter was $104.4 million. Our earnings per diluted share increased $0.14 to $0.60 per diluted share.  On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of $104 million or $0.60 per diluted share. Including the patent-related gain noted above, GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.44 or an increase of 29%.  Moving to the statement of cash flow summarized on slide 7 and 8. Free cash flow increased 27% to $242 million. Due to the shelter in place orders, construction was halted on the new campus building in mid-March and resumed this week.  Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $28 million, including $20 million related to construction and other real estate activity. We estimate capital expenditures for the second quarter to between $40 million and $50 million. And for all of 2020 to between $200 million and $220 million.  We expect full-year cash taxes to be approximately $40 million and our full-year non-GAAP tax rate to be 22%.  In the first quarter, we utilized a portion of our cash and investments to repurchase approximately 10 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $900 million. At the end of first quarter, the remaining share buyback authorization was $693 million.  In light of the buyback activity, together with a lower interest rate environment, let me offer two modeling insights. First, the full year share count should be 10 million shares lower than previously guided.  Second, interest income will likely be insignificant for the remainder of 2020.  Before moving to guidance, we wanted to offer some thoughts in two areas related to COVID-19, including steps that we have taken to contribute and certain observations about our business in Q1 and early Q2.  First, in response to the pandemic, we've taken a number of steps, including, one, substantially increasing our employee charitable match program for COVID-19 related donations to a total of $2 million.  And secondly, expanding our free to the public network security expert program, or what we call NSE. Last week, we further expanded the free NSE program from the first three levels to all eight levels. NSE is a self-paced online security training and certification program. By making this program free and more advanced, we hope to narrow the shortage of security skilled workers around the world and position people to emerge from COVID-19 with new and very marketable skills. In the first week, we've had over 50,000 registrations from over 5,000 different organizations.  And I'd like to share some observations about our business in Q1 and early Q2. We don't anticipate that these observations will continue in future quarters. However, in light of COVID-19, we thought they might be helpful and informative.  Looking at linearity, monthly linearity for the first quarter was consistent with prior quarters at around 50% through the first two months. While March linearity was typical, we did see an elevated level of buying during the middle two weeks of the month.  As for April linearity, it was slightly better than our first month performance for any second quarter in the last three years.  Turning the contract length and payment terms. In Q1, the average contract length remained flat at 25 months year-over-year. And average contractual payment terms increased, but less than 15%.  In terms of supply chain concerns, our product backlog was in line with historical averages and our suppliers delivered over 90% of their commitment to us. To offer some context on the puts and takes in Q1 billings, three of our Fabric platform products, FortiToken, FortiAuthenticator and FortiClient benefited from their increased value in securing organizations' employees in the shift towards work from home. Combined billings for these three products were about $10 million above expectations. In April, we saw these billings again significantly outperform expectations.  Looking at channel inventory, the total balance was flat quarter-over-quarter and up slightly year-over-year, which may relate to a small level of early buying by our customers.  Regarding SD-WAN solutions, secure SD-WAN billings for the quarter were a high single-digit percentage of total billings. April billings continued this trend and the Q2 pipeline for secure SD-WAN is strong.  And then, looking to customer segments, our G2000 billings increased 25%. SMB billings as a percentage of total billings increased slightly. Renewal rates remain within the guardrails that we provided at the Analyst Day.  And as a percentage of total billings, the worldwide retail segment remains one of our top 5 verticals and, as a percentage of total billings, remained unchanged year-over-year.  As our performance indicates, we did not see a material impact due to COVID-19 for the first quarter, and the second quarter is starting well. That said, there is a lot of uncertainty about future economic conditions.  Finally, I'd like to review our outlook for the second quarter summarized on slide 9, which is subject to the disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call.  For the second quarter, we expect billings in the range of $700 million to $725 million, revenue in the range of $590 million to $605 million, non-GAAP gross margin of 77.5% to 78.5%, non-GAAP operating margin of 23% to 24%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.64 to $0.66 which assumes a share count of between 165 million and 167 million. We expected non-GAAP tax rate of 22%.  For 2020, due to the increased uncertainty associated with the economic impact from COVID-19, we believe the prudent thing to do is to withdraw our previously issued full-year guidance.  Along with Ken, I would like to thank our partners, customers and the Fortinet team for all their support and hard work during these difficult and unique times.  Lastly, I also would like to invite all of you to listen to the management keynote presentations at our virtual Accelerate being held on May 12. You can contact Peter for registration link.  And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Peter. \nPeter Salkowski: Thank you, Keith. Michelle, we're ready to do the Q&A if you can open up the lines for questions, please. Operator, are you there? \nOperator:  [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from Sterling Auty from JP Morgan. \nSterling Auty: Yeah, thanks. Hi, guys. You mentioned that the June quarter \u2013 so, April is off to a fast start. Wondering, are you seeing the same products in high demand in April that you did in March? And do you think that that demand actually can continue perhaps into the back half or is this a temporary lift that you're saying? \nKen Xie: I think pretty similar. Like we mentioned, we do see Fabric continue, especially work from home related, some are lower end. And also, like a FortiClient, Authenticator, FortiToken, still very strong. But, overall, I think it's the same. And also, the new product we introduced, both in the last quarter, the 1800F and also introduced the 4200F, see a very strong interest. I think so far we see pretty similar demand. \nKeith Jensen: Yeah. Sterling, I'd probably frame a response to add on to what Ken said by saying, obviously, we gave some insights in terms of what we were seeing in April. And as part of the guidance setting process, we would obviously normally look at what's your month one activity, what does your pipeline look for month two, and what does your pipeline look like in month three. So, I think you can assume that we've looked at those factors as part of setting the guidance for the second quarter. \nKen Xie: Yeah. Also, a lot of feedback is really because our product has a good reputation. It's very cost efficient. The new one we announced and also the last few quarter, so have average VPN performance 10 times faster and had more capability compared to any other competitor that will be the secure competitor [indiscernible]. So, that's actually \u2013 a lot of company \u2013 a lot of enterprise, they usually have a work from home population, probably less than 10%. Now, they jumped over 90%. So, that's a huge demand for both headquarter, for office and also for some other work for home solution. So, that's where VPNs are very, very critical for all these enterprise. So, we see a lot of need for customer required solution compared to the other competitors. \nSterling Auty: That makes sense. And then, the one follow-up would be, you mentioned 19% of revenue from the MSSP channel. I think investors always worried about that SMB exposure. Can you give us a sense of what you saw in terms of renewal rates in March and April, as well as just the demand pipeline from that segment? \nKen Xie: Not actually. It's a very interesting area. We're also kind of a little bit surprised. Our overall SMB as a percentage of our business actually increased 1% to 2%, and that's where they grow faster than average. So, we kind of did some research. Probably there's two, three reasons. The first, whether the SMB or the work from home using network security as an endpoint seeing very, very low percentage, probably average only about like 5% or even low single digit. So, it's a very small percentage SMB work from home as a network security solution. So, that's where they may take this kind of opportunity to starting to kind of implement more work from home SMB solution.  The second one, we also believe whether \u2013 because SD-WAN or some other solution combined with both SD-WAN and Wi-Fi can also save a lot of cost, so we're cost efficient. So, that's where probably also the chance for customers to also using the new product.  And the third one, we do believe, if you look in last few quarters, we refreshed the low end first with all the F model. So, from like an 80F first almost three quarters ago, then 60F and then 40F we announced. It's all helping driving the SMB or work from home solution. So, maybe these two, three factors contribute SMB actually even grow faster than average.\nSterling Auty: Got it. Thank you, guys.\nKen Xie: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani from UBS.\nFatima Boolani: Thank you for taking the questions. Ken, maybe to start with you, just on the SD-WAN momentum you're seeing, I think there's some confusion around how SD-WAN conflicts or is accretive to your branch office business. I'm wondering if you can just give us a sense of how SD-WAN is accretive to the overall branch footprint that you have. And as you think about the next 12 to 24 months, as branch office architectures do change, how do you think that would impact the lower-end SKUs you have in your portfolio? And then, I have a follow-up for Keith.\nKen Xie: Yeah. Like I said in the script, so we are the only company internally developed SD-WAN and also built with security from very beginning. So, it's very cost-efficient and also combine multiple function together. So, that's where the customers see a lot of value.  At the same time, like I said, somehow SMB or some other work from home still a low percentage of \u2013 that SMB also helping because the overall SD-WAN is still a relatively small market and grow very fast. So, we already become a top three and also grow the farthest one.  And then also, it's a little bit different offer than the other. Other probably only SD-WAN function, but we do company security with a lot of other functions inside our offering. At the same time, performance is much better because our own ASIC has a huge computing power advantage, handle multiple function at the same time.  I think, overall, these all contribute both SMB and also \u2013 in fact, the FortiGate unit shipment grow 30%. That's also the highest one we see in the last few years. That's also probably \u2013 whether contribute to SD-WAN or contribute to work from home or SMB, it's pretty interesting and we still continue to see that in April. And so, we're still closely watching and also try to address any requirement from the customer to react quickly, both in SD-WAN and also for the SMB work from home solution.  Like I said, because we develop internally all this solution product, we can react much quicker compared with other competitors. They have to find a way to integrate, they have to \u2013 they have different SD-WAN, then the security, all the others. I think that gave us quite some advantage compared to other competitors.\nFatima Boolani: That's super helpful. And, Keith, just for you, appreciate that color on the shipment volume and shipment trends in the quarter and in April. I'm wondering if you can characterize for us how much of that is maybe pulled-forward activity. If you can contextualize that with the pipeline for the rest of the year. Just wanted to get a sense of if there was actually rush buying or any accelerated buying activity. And that's it for me. Thank you.\nKeith Jensen: Yeah. I think any quarter, you've got puts and takes and that's kind of why we titled that section that way. There's some things that come in that maybe weren't in your commit to begin with that you weren't expecting, and there are some things that push out. I don't think that Q1 was really any different in any other way.  I think in terms of how we're looking at it in that regard, the purpose of providing some commentary about what we saw in April, which seemed to be contradictory to a thought that there was a bunch of pull-forward from Q2 into Q1 because April \u2013 we're happy with April.\nFatima Boolani: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Goldman Sachs.\nBrian Essex: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. And congratulations on the results in some pretty challenging economic times. I guess the first question, maybe for Ken, if I heard that right, you had some pretty strong financial services billings growth. Can you maybe comment on growth by vertical, where you saw maybe better strength in the quarter versus maybe some weakness? And it also seemed as though you actually did pretty well, surprising at the mid and entry-level range of your product spectrum. Any change anticipated for the rest of the year in terms of product release-driven activity versus maybe what might be more near-term work from home-driven expansion type sales?\nKen Xie: Yeah. First the vertical \u2013 probably Keith later can help answer \u2013 is we still see service provider starting pretty strong and probably the fast-growing in the last few quarters, even few years. And also, the finance service, some governments actually also pretty strong. Retail, a little bit weak, but it's just a little bit. It's not as \u2013 I think it's still among the top five. Enterprise is probably still pretty okay. Especially the big enterprise, we see grow faster than the overall growth. It grew 25% for the top 2,000 enterprise.  I think, going forward, we do see the new NP7 provide a lot of interest for big enterprise, especially work from home. They found out, suddenly, the workload, especially VPN, need almost 10x compared to before the pandemic. And a lot of competitor products cannot handle it anymore. So, we get a lot of requests from this enterprise IT, starting to see the advantage of our solution because we accelerate the VPN using ASIC, which on average, 10x better performance. So, that's actually \u2013 before maybe they not need that much VPN, but now they're starting to see, oh, that's a huge advantage which competitors cannot handle. So, we see very strong demand. And that's where the product we released today, the 4200F, and also last quarter 1800F, and also the previous middle high end, we're also starting to see pretty strong growth now.\nKeith Jensen: Yeah. I think Ken did a very good job recapping the verticals. Just to kind of put a little more color on it, I think the government vertical, which for us is largely international, state and local, performed very well. We didn't need to call it out in the script, but it was clearly in the top three MSSPs. We talked about financial services. We talked about \u2013 as Ken indicated, retail was flattish year-over-year in terms of, I guess, percentage of billing. Tech had a pretty good quarter as well, but not enough to get it in the top five.\nBrian Essex: Got it. That's helpful. Maybe if I could hit one more quick one on SD-WAN. I had a lot of questions this quarter from investors just concerned about potential branch office closures. Did you see any change in the deployment of \u2013 within the branch office environment due to closures or maybe was it accelerated because of the closures and maybe better access to networks as a result? Maybe just a little quick color there would be helpful.\nKen Xie: Yeah. I think we have a deployment we call a zero-touch deployment, and probably some IT, they leverage this opportunity to upgrade some infrastructure, whether at the branch office or \u2013 we don't see slowdown likely. We even see this accelerate a little bit.\nBrian Essex: Super helpful. Thank you so much. \nKen Xie: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse.\nBrad Zelnick: Excellent. Thank you so much. And congrats to you all for the strong momentum and being there for all of your constituents during these crazy times. Ken, I've got another SD-WAN question for you. One of your competitors recently made an acquisition in the SD-WAN space with plans to leverage their technology in a thin branch architecture. Can you maybe just help us by comparing and contrasting your approach to SD-WAN and whether one solution is inherently more cost-effective or has more efficacy? Thanks.\nKen Xie: Yeah. We already spent like quite a long time developing SD-WAN, like 5 to 10 years. And so, from very beginning, combine that with the security together, so it can be used in security to decide how the SD-WAN function can be routed. So, that's very different than all the other major competitor, whether in the networking side or in the security side. They have to come from acquisition, which they have a lot of limitation, whether on a performance or combined networking function, security function together. So, that's the huge advantage we continue to enjoy.  At the same time, all this function is also ASIC accelerated, which kind of gave a 10x performance boost and also much lower total cost of ownership. So, that's how we see the benefit kind of more and more.  And on the other side, SD-WAN can be part of the total solution, whether the cloud or infrastructure or the other part. Combined security SD-WAN together definitely have a huge advantage, whether easy to deploy or easy to manage a single pack solution. And at the same time, we also balance among how the cloud and how the edge computing working together, but some function needs to be processed in the cloud. That's also working well with a hybrid cloud approach. And also combined headquarter, the branch office, work from home, we found out is \u2013 that's also the Fabric keeping growth faster. And even a lot of product within the Fabric are suddenly double, triple than the previous quarter, like we mentioned about the FortiClient, FortiAuthenticator or FortiToken, it's all related to the work from home products suddenly see a huge increase. And so, the Fabric approach also we benefit a lot from that.\nBrad Zelnick: Thank you, Ken. That makes a lot of sense. And if I can just follow-up with you, Keith, how are you thinking about your hiring plans in light of the limited visibility you have? It actually seems like you're off to a pretty strong start in Q1.\nKeith Jensen: Yeah. I think the hiring has been \u2013 we talked about this in the context over the last couple of quarters and the quarter, that within this balanced framework of profitability and growth that we're executing against, we thought coming into 2020 that we were going to tilt towards growth. And we think we saw that with some of the investments we made towards the end of last year, and we continue those hiring investments throughout the first quarter of this year. I think we'll start to lap some of those higher hiring percentages or growth in Q3 or Q4. And so, at that point in time, we'll start moving back in line with what we've seen historically.\nBrad Zelnick: Awesome. Thanks so much, guys.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal from Oppenheimer.\nShaul Eyal: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Congrats on the ongoing strong performance. You had a very solid European performance over the past few quarters. But I think specifically in the first quarter, some other companies have been reporting mixed-use mix outlook with respect to the European performance. What are you doing different or is it also driven by your strong partner relations in that region?\nKeith Jensen : Yeah. I probably look at this way. I think that when we say Europe, it also includes our emerging part of the business as well, emerging, meaning everything from Southern Africa up to the Middle East and into Eastern Europe. I think that latter component has been strong now for many quarters in a row. And yes, I do think that, one, it's great execution by that team. And I think also they do a very good job of how they, in some ways, are forced to go to market with that.  I think if you look at the quarter overall, we probably saw, as you would kind of expect with a pandemic, the US and the Americas probably outperformed Europe, Continental Europe a little bit more during the quarter, and that's kind of consistent with what we saw with the pandemic.\nShaul Eyal: Got it. And Keith, while we have you, gross margins, also probably highest in recent quarters. What should we be expecting going forward? And what's been driving that little bit of an uptick that we had seen with gross margins, specifically for the company, which is slightly more appliance-driven?\nKeith Jensen: I think the guidance that we provided for gross margin is good for the quarter. I feel comfortable with that. I do think that we're benefiting as our cost structure changed a little bit with some of our newer products. And I think that we're partnering perhaps a little bit more effectively with our channel partners over the last couple of years than we had in the past.\nShaul Eyal: Good job. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Melissa Franchi from Morgan Stanley.\nMelissa Franchi: Thank you very much for taking my question. I want to go back to the discussion on the branch business. I think investors are trying to understand what the trajectory looks like for the branch, just given some exposure to economically-sensitive verticals like retail. So, I know that it's probably pretty early, but as you look into your pipeline, are you anticipating any change in terms of renewal rates for the branch? And I know that April is shaping up to be pretty well, but what should we expect for the second half of the year?\nKeith Jensen: So, we didn't guide to the second half of the year. And we don't give a lot of specifics on renewal rates, but I think I made a comment that what we saw in the first quarter was that renewal rates were within that band that we provided at the Analyst Day. And I really don't see that changing based upon what I'm seeing.  I think it's probably helpful to kind of consider the context of our diversification. And I kind of made reference to it just a moment ago when I talked about the US performed very strongly and Europe was probably hit by the pandemic a little bit harder.  You're talking about a company now that's less than 30% of its business is in the US and there may be a lot of focus on retail headlines in the US, but it's probably passing over perhaps the recovery that's already started in Europe and the impact from Latin America and other geographies.\nMelissa Franchi: Okay, that's very helpful. And just following up with you, Keith. I'm wondering if you could just maybe give a little bit more color on some of your underlying assumptions for the Q2 guide. I know April seems to be pretty healthy so far, but are you assuming that continues through the rest of the quarter or are you expecting a more challenging close? Thank you.\nKeith Jensen: I think we feel very good about the business, about the products, about the strategy that we're executing, about the sales team's ability to execute, about our ability to support our customers and the ability to support our partners.  And with that in mind, I'm looking at the pipeline, I'm looking at the slicing and the dicing of the pipeline. As I kind of made reference a moment ago, I'm looking at different assumptions for different geographies based upon the status of the pandemic in those geographies. We're looking at deal sizes. Larger deals have typically more risk than smaller deals do as part of our assessment. We look at whether or not it's a new logo or an existing customer or a renewal. So, all those things go into the mix in terms of setting the guidance for the quarter.\nMelissa Franchi: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays.\nSaket Kalia: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Hey, Ken. Maybe first for you, a lot of questions on the branch and understandably so, but maybe even just thinking about the enterprise, how do you think your enterprise customers are thinking about their VPN strategies longer-term and how do you sort of expect Fortinet to play into that?\nKen Xie: I think this pandemic probably changing some of the working patterns. Like I said before, there is probably less than 10% people work remotely, access on VPN. Now due to this lockdown, probably, we see over 90%. Maybe if even we go back, reopen, whatever, maybe still 30%, 50% and it all depends on the vertical. So, that's making this remote access work from home starting to get more and more important, and especially the networking need to be combined with endpoint. Endpoint sometimes, you can address certain device. But if you are on the network side, you can actually secure the whole branch or the whole home and whatever that was there. And even different like, with Wi-Fi, [indiscernible] like different member of the family can kind of manage all these different bandwidths. We see this enterprise headquarter office VPN starting to have a pretty strong demand there. And some other like authenticated products, some other products \u2013 Fabric, we also see pretty good growth. Actually, even double, triple some of these different component of Fabric.\nSaket Kalia: Got it. That's very helpful. Maybe as my follow-up for you, Keith. Or maybe can you comment on any trends in the FortiGuard bundles as a result of increased work from home? I know you talked about some of the trends in FortiCare with that nice uptick in customers opting for 24/7. But curious if you've seen any material shifts in the makeup of FortiGuard subscription with the different bundles that you have as a result of work from home?\nKeith Jensen: No, no. Not really.\nSaket Kalia: Okay, got it. Very helpful. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Rob Owens with Piper Sandler.\nKeith Jensen : Rob, are you there?\nSaket Kalia: Hi. Can you hear me?\nKeith Jensen: We can.\nSaket Kalia: Okay. Sorry about that. You mentioned in your prepared remarks, your ability to directly manage supply chain and shipping logistics. And I'm curious, as you look forward towards the second quarter and should you still see strong surge in demand around the FortiGate solutions, any supply chain concerns or are those all relatively put to bed at this time?\nKeith Jensen: I think I feel good about it, but the head of manufacturing has some work to do.\nKen Xie: Again, so far, we don't see any issue. We see it pretty good. They also would recover pretty quick in not only the supply chain, but also we manage our own shipment, shipping logistics and also our own supporting. So, we're not outsourcing any shipment or customer supporting. That's also with all these facility, with all the team, we can quickly address why and can make it more like redundant or whatever, resistant to any kind of downside to adopt quickly.\nKeith Jensen: We still have a spot or two of components that may be lined up in Japan or the Philippines or Malaysia or something like that on an individual component. But keep in mind, part of our business model is looking at our inventory turns, which have been less than 3 recently. So, really, that means we're carrying about four months of inventory at any point in time.  And even at that level, we weren't at 100% execution, even though the backlog was consistent with other quarters. And so, probably, we're looking at our inventory level and thinking maybe as we go through the next quarter or two to move that up just ever so slightly as we start transitioning to further guard against this possible risk for pandemic.\nSaket Kalia: I appreciate the color. And then, just briefly, if I may, I know there's been a lot of discussions around work from home, branch office, but where do you guys come down as you're talking to customers on kind of that cloud, SASE arguments? And strategically, as people are considering work from home, what's kind of been the response of customers as they're looking at your solution versus others?\nKen Xie: Like I said a few weeks ago, we feel the SASE, the best model is really working with a service provider. Like today, this morning, we also announced a partnership with NTT West, offer all these like whether work from home or kind of a [indiscernible] service provider solution for both SD-WAN and also security. And even ourselves, we do have the technology, but we do believe this cloud approach need to be working with edge and on-premise together. So, we have the structure. It's all in the testing and also working with a lot of service provider right now, because the Forti SASE approach is a little bit different than the traditional SASE approach, which they forward all the traffic, whether from endpoint to your device from home and also in the office to the cloud.  So, we believe the better approach for the SASE, we call Forti SASE, is for the endpoint of some work from home, your mobile device maybe makes sense to forward to the cloud to process, which we have all the solution. But when in the office, your forward office traffic to the cloud does not quite make sense. It's not very secure, because when you forward, it's not quite encrypted. And also, it increases a lot of network traffic and much high latency, much slow.  And most of these SASE companies, very interestingly, more leveraged, like whether open source of freeware to do the security. So, when you do the testing of the security, their security [indiscernible] not as good as some other dedicated security company because we have a few hundred people just doing all this intelligent research and has done this for 20 years. So, that's where from better security, better networking latency and better like cost-wise.  Some offers, probably if you using on-site premise, more like [indiscernible] solution to process a lot of traffic locally will be much better than forward all this office traffic to the cloud. So, that's where we have \u2013 it's a Forti SASE, but a little bit different. And also, when we're working with service providers, we also make \u2013 it's a profit model compared to a lot of other SASE company. They have to invest a lot of proper data center, which is making them keeping losing money. Eventually, all this service provider, they do have their own kind of own infrastructure. So, with their current infrastructure, they leverage what they can process on-site and in office will be much more secure and cost effectively to solve this issue, right, whether it is management or manage all this mobile security solution. So, that's where we have a little bit different approach. More leverage of service provider and also leverage both on the cloud and also on-premise on edge solutions.  So, I think that's kind of very, very good feedback from all this, both in the enterprise side, in the service provider, also in the customer. So, we feel that will be the right approach.\nSaket Kalia: Thanks for the color.\nKen Xie: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits from Raymond James.\nMichael Turits: You commented that, in the quarter, you got strong demand for VPN, authentication, token, endpoint, all clearly work from home driven, and you are seeing those same trends so far into April. The question is, do you have some feel for where we are in terms of customers getting up to the level of capacity they need in terms of that product? Is that a 2Q finish or does it extend further?\nMichael Turits: Well, like I said, whether the SMB or work for home, still very low percentage. Probably US, maybe around 5%. Some other region, country, even lower than that. So, it's still huge potential on whether SMB or work or home. And then, when you try to access to home, to the office, suddenly, you need a huge increase, almost 10x increase on the headquarter or whatever the office VPN need supporting all this home worker, remote worker.  And then, at the same time, you also need a secure solution in the other side, whether from home or the device level authenticator. So, that's where we see quite strong demand there.\nMichael Turits: Keith, I don't know if you have anything to add to that, but my follow-up question for you is about payment terms. I think you commented that duration was about 25 months on invoicing. Just remind us where it was and if you have any concern about that shortening. And you talked about 15% extension in payment terms. Again, any concern about that in terms of your need to help out customers and the impact of either one of those on cash flow.\nKeith Jensen: Well, look, I think the headline would be that we have a strong balance sheet and we're certainly going to leverage our balance sheet where there's opportunities to gain market share and to support our customers and our channel partners. There's no real doubt about that in my mind. We don't guide to free cash flow, but there's probably some adjustment that you want to make to your free cash flow model for the second quarter because I do think that Fortinet is in a position to help others. And I expect us to use our balance sheet to do that on a case-by-case basis.\nMichael Turits: Okay. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citi.\nWalter Pritchard: Thanks. Two questions. One, I guess, for Ken. Just around the low end of the product line looked pretty strong. I'm wondering how strong of a trend it was that you saw actual work from home customers taking low end boxes and that being part of what you shipped, understanding that FortiClient was strong and the Token, Authenticator products and so forth. Just wondering how much that contributed on the appliance side.\nKen Xie: I think they're both pretty strong. The FortiClient probably even double, triple, but come from relatively small base. And then, the appliance, the low end, whether SMB or some work from home, also pretty strong. Like, if you see, the unit shipment increased 30%. That's mostly contributed from the low end because the high end, middle range will not impact that much of the unit shipment. I think the trend still, like I said, is still in the \u2013 we still get a lot of enterprise and also they see \u2013 the current, whether the competitor's product cannot handle suddenly the huge increase of the VPN or some other work-for-home solution. So we get a lot of interest. And so, IT guy also super busy, try to \u2013 whether do the deployment or whatever. And at the same time, we also try to help them supporting them and we have this called zero-touch deployment, help them to deploy whether the branch or some other headquarter solution quickly to meet all this strong demand. I don't see the trend slow down yet. But even after the pandemic, we do see the percentage of people starting work from home probably will be higher, maybe like a few times higher compared to before the pandemic.\nKeith Jensen: It's Keith. I'll just to add to that. I think the model, so to speak, that you're more likely to see is that when people start working from home, it's not that they're going home and taking a firewall with them. I think they're installing FortiClients on their laptop. So, that's probably really not going to drive a low end business by itself.  On the other side of the corporate IT organization, now they're trying to \u2013 they need greater throughput and greater capacity because of things like VPN and authentication and so forth. And so, you may see the corporate buyer is actually moving up, if you will, in terms of what they're buying. But, again, it's not firewall for the home.  I think the other aspect of it is, we have a new product called the 60F, which was a real beast in the quarter just in terms of the volumes that it produced. And then, in our favor, it has a little bit different cost structure than its predecessor. So, it's giving us a little bit of lift on margins.\nKen Xie: I think it's also interesting really, the FortiClient probably can load on your laptop or your mobile, but that only secure one device. So, when you work from home, you're also probably competing with your kids for the bandwidth and then also some other things you need to manage together, some other appliance, could be like how this remote monitor device, all these things. That's where the FortiGate come in. It's very, very handy. Very, very good solution. So, they can manage different device from different load of bandwidths, secure Wi-Fi together and even some \u2013 I'm not sure how much use total SD-WAN, but it's still \u2013 but it's really the product offers so much function. They can have the whole house being managed much better secure, much better compared to one device. So, that's making them work from home as a much better security and also can kind of \u2013 it's much better than just one device.\nWalter Pritchard: And then, Keith, just on the guidance, understanding we're seeing lots of companies pull the guidance because of the unprecedented times. I'm just wondering, if you look at your forecast and think about 90 days from now, what sort of things are you looking for in your forecasting to be able to get back to giving annual guidance? Specifically, what sort of things are unstable there or sort of too wide of a range to be able to call at this point that you'll be watching?\nKeith Jensen: Like everybody else, I think our concerns or our interests are, is there going to be a second wave? What's the severity of the second wave going to be? What geography is it going to hit? And when is it going to hit in those geographies? And really, ultimately, what economy are you trying to provide guidance into? And that's just the unknown right now in the second half of the year.\nWalter Pritchard: Okay, thank you. Understandable.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Tal Liani from Bank of America.\nDaniel Bartus: This is Dan Bartus on for Tal. I was just wondering if you can share some thoughts on overall security budgets and how you think they might trend this year. Curious if you're hearing from any customers that they're looking to already cut back maybe in 2Q or second half.  And then, just a quick follow-up for Keith, probably. Can you just help us think about how much of your SD-WAN business is driven by MSPs and MSSPs?\nKen Xie: I think from the [indiscernible] 2007, 2008, security budgets hold pretty well during this recession. But this time it's different. And that's where we also try to be very careful for any guidance. And so far, we see in the first quarter, also in April, we see pretty good and low impact, no any material impact. And if since not get worse, we feel pretty comfortable. But like Keith said, these times are different. We try to be very careful. \nKeith Jensen: I think in terms of the SD-WAN and the MSSPs, I would characterize that as being a market that we're very interested in because it's a very large market. Obviously, the MSSPs have already come to it with an incumbent that we're trying to displace. But that opportunity, without quantifying it, if you will, is something that I would say we're very focused on internally.\nDaniel Bartus: Great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from Evercore.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my question, guys. I have a question and a follow-up as well. I guess, first off, you guys have seen fairly impressive share gains over the last couple of years. I'm wondering how do you think the share gains stack up over the next few years as we go through a recession effectively. Do you think share gains can actually accelerate given the TCO proposition that you guys have in enterprises or is that unlikely to happen given no one probably wants to replace legacy gear at this point?\nKen Xie: We probably continue to leverage the strong technology product, whether leverage, we call the SPU, security process unit, and ASIC which gave a huge performance advantage and is a VPN function or quite a broad function and also the fabric approach, which is already 20, 30 product or most internally developed, working, integrate, automate together, which not a competitor have this advantage.  And at the same time, we'll continue to invest. We're continuing to hire, but also we found that it's more easy to hire some high-quality people and we will continue to \u2013 and the other part also, we found we probably have the biggest training program in this whole cybersecurity industry. And we started to open up outlets for free. And not only are we working with a few hundred university to train out the student, but also a lot of big enterprise, a lot of service provider, a lot of our work on home user, all starting see a huge need for the training.  Actually, we found that we set a new registration every few second. So, every few seconds, we get a new registration set up for the training and it's a huge benefit because, in this security space, it's \u2013 last year, there's a 3.5 million shortage of trained people to help in handle the security. So, that's also the opportunity we found out to train people and then recruit them also quickly and help us solve the whole industry problem.  So, we see this as a huge opportunity for us based on the big investment we made before and also where we continued working very hard with all the team and all the partners, all the customers try to make the whole Internet more secure.\nKeith Jensen: I think there's three things that Ken's making a point or making reference of, and I'd probably summarize them this way. I think these three things are working in our favor at the moment. One is our fabric product set has continued to expand and has continued to mature and become even more competitive, if you will, in terms of features and functions with some of the best of breed.  You are seeing more and more customers, at least those that I'm talking to, and prospects, much more interested now in a platform approach that enables automation and integration and moving away from a best-of-breed solution for every aspect of the security platform.  And then, the third aspect of it, we are probably moving into an environment where cost effectiveness is a premium in your go-to-market messaging. By that, if you can argue that successfully and produce that and deliver that lower cost, more cost-effective option, you can be successful in this market.\nAmit Daryanani: That's really helpful, guys. And then, Keith, a quick one for you. You talked about average contractual terms pushing out about 15%. What's the impact of that and what's the best way for us to read that statement?\nKeith Jensen: It's payment terms, not the length of the contract, right? And I mentioned that it was slightly less than 15% increase, if you will. And I would probably think you just want to take a little bit of second looking at what your cash collection assumptions are in your free cash flow model for Q2.\nAmit Daryanani: Got it, thank you.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the conference back over to Peter Salkowski, Vice President, Investor Relations.\nPeter Salkowski: Thank you, Michelle. I'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call and extend an invitation to listen to the management keynote presentations at the Americas Virtual Accelerate event on May 12.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ken Xie",
            "content": "Thank you. Thank you, Peter. And thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our first quarter 2020 results. And we'd like to thank our employees, customers, partners, suppliers worldwide for their commitment to manage our response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  We are very pleased with our strong first quarter performance. Billings increased 21% to $668 million, driven by solid execution and across all three major regions. Revenue increased 22% to $577 million. The solid performance of our core firewall, security fabric, SD-WAN and work from home solution resulted in an 18% increase in product revenue and a 24% increase in service revenue.  Shipment of FortiGate unit increased 30% in the first quarter, driven by our home secure VPN and secure SD-WAN product, built with our ASIC-powered appliance. In addition, demand for broad integrated automated security fabric platform, especially the FortiClient, FortiAuthenticator and FortiToken was very strong. Our ability to directly manage our supply chain and shipping logistics allowed us to quickly adjust to the current dynamic environment. Today, Fortinet released a FortiGate 4200F, another milestone in our ability to deliver the industry highest performance and the most cost efficient secure solution on the market. Powered by the new NP7, the 4200F is engineered to meet the scale and performance demand of today's enterprise and service provider companies.  With 10x the VPN performance over competitors, its ability to scale teleworker solution will be a key competitive advantage for Fortinet as enterprise looks for cost efficient way to support our large, remote workforce.  During the quarter, we released the FortiOS 6.4 with over 350 new features, including new automation, scalability, performance and AI capability, providing for protection across entire digital infrastructure.  Included in the FortiOS 6.4 are several enhancements to our secure SD-WAN offerings. Fortinet is one of the fastest growing SD-WAN providers and the only major player in this market with the internally developed offering that provides security and SD-WAN networking in a single solution. We believe we'll continue to gain SD-WAN market share in 2020. Fortinet is an important strategic partner, especially as company looks to efficiently deploy their security budget, our industry-validated work from home and a secure SD-WAN offering, along with our SPU-driven FortiGates, Security Fabric platform and hybrid-cloud offerings, provide the best security with the most cost-efficient solution for companies across their entire digital infrastructure. I would now like to turn the call over to Keith for a closer look and our first quarter performance and our guidance. I think pretty similar. Like we mentioned, we do see Fabric continue, especially work from home related, some are lower end. And also, like a FortiClient, Authenticator, FortiToken, still very strong. But, overall, I think it's the same. And also, the new product we introduced, both in the last quarter, the 1800F and also introduced the 4200F, see a very strong interest. I think so far we see pretty similar demand. Yeah. Also, a lot of feedback is really because our product has a good reputation. It's very cost efficient. The new one we announced and also the last few quarter, so have average VPN performance 10 times faster and had more capability compared to any other competitor that will be the secure competitor [indiscernible]. So, that's actually \u2013 a lot of company \u2013 a lot of enterprise, they usually have a work from home population, probably less than 10%. Now, they jumped over 90%. So, that's a huge demand for both headquarter, for office and also for some other work for home solution. So, that's where VPNs are very, very critical for all these enterprise. So, we see a lot of need for customer required solution compared to the other competitors. Not actually. It's a very interesting area. We're also kind of a little bit surprised. Our overall SMB as a percentage of our business actually increased 1% to 2%, and that's where they grow faster than average. So, we kind of did some research. Probably there's two, three reasons. The first, whether the SMB or the work from home using network security as an endpoint seeing very, very low percentage, probably average only about like 5% or even low single digit. So, it's a very small percentage SMB work from home as a network security solution. So, that's where they may take this kind of opportunity to starting to kind of implement more work from home SMB solution.  The second one, we also believe whether \u2013 because SD-WAN or some other solution combined with both SD-WAN and Wi-Fi can also save a lot of cost, so we're cost efficient. So, that's where probably also the chance for customers to also using the new product.  And the third one, we do believe, if you look in last few quarters, we refreshed the low end first with all the F model. So, from like an 80F first almost three quarters ago, then 60F and then 40F we announced. It's all helping driving the SMB or work from home solution. So, maybe these two, three factors contribute SMB actually even grow faster than average. Thank you. Yeah. Like I said in the script, so we are the only company internally developed SD-WAN and also built with security from very beginning. So, it's very cost-efficient and also combine multiple function together. So, that's where the customers see a lot of value.  At the same time, like I said, somehow SMB or some other work from home still a low percentage of \u2013 that SMB also helping because the overall SD-WAN is still a relatively small market and grow very fast. So, we already become a top three and also grow the farthest one.  And then also, it's a little bit different offer than the other. Other probably only SD-WAN function, but we do company security with a lot of other functions inside our offering. At the same time, performance is much better because our own ASIC has a huge computing power advantage, handle multiple function at the same time.  I think, overall, these all contribute both SMB and also \u2013 in fact, the FortiGate unit shipment grow 30%. That's also the highest one we see in the last few years. That's also probably \u2013 whether contribute to SD-WAN or contribute to work from home or SMB, it's pretty interesting and we still continue to see that in April. And so, we're still closely watching and also try to address any requirement from the customer to react quickly, both in SD-WAN and also for the SMB work from home solution.  Like I said, because we develop internally all this solution product, we can react much quicker compared with other competitors. They have to find a way to integrate, they have to \u2013 they have different SD-WAN, then the security, all the others. I think that gave us quite some advantage compared to other competitors. Yeah. First the vertical \u2013 probably Keith later can help answer \u2013 is we still see service provider starting pretty strong and probably the fast-growing in the last few quarters, even few years. And also, the finance service, some governments actually also pretty strong. Retail, a little bit weak, but it's just a little bit. It's not as \u2013 I think it's still among the top five. Enterprise is probably still pretty okay. Especially the big enterprise, we see grow faster than the overall growth. It grew 25% for the top 2,000 enterprise.  I think, going forward, we do see the new NP7 provide a lot of interest for big enterprise, especially work from home. They found out, suddenly, the workload, especially VPN, need almost 10x compared to before the pandemic. And a lot of competitor products cannot handle it anymore. So, we get a lot of requests from this enterprise IT, starting to see the advantage of our solution because we accelerate the VPN using ASIC, which on average, 10x better performance. So, that's actually \u2013 before maybe they not need that much VPN, but now they're starting to see, oh, that's a huge advantage which competitors cannot handle. So, we see very strong demand. And that's where the product we released today, the 4200F, and also last quarter 1800F, and also the previous middle high end, we're also starting to see pretty strong growth now. Yeah. I think we have a deployment we call a zero-touch deployment, and probably some IT, they leverage this opportunity to upgrade some infrastructure, whether at the branch office or \u2013 we don't see slowdown likely. We even see this accelerate a little bit. Thank you. Yeah. We already spent like quite a long time developing SD-WAN, like 5 to 10 years. And so, from very beginning, combine that with the security together, so it can be used in security to decide how the SD-WAN function can be routed. So, that's very different than all the other major competitor, whether in the networking side or in the security side. They have to come from acquisition, which they have a lot of limitation, whether on a performance or combined networking function, security function together. So, that's the huge advantage we continue to enjoy.  At the same time, all this function is also ASIC accelerated, which kind of gave a 10x performance boost and also much lower total cost of ownership. So, that's how we see the benefit kind of more and more.  And on the other side, SD-WAN can be part of the total solution, whether the cloud or infrastructure or the other part. Combined security SD-WAN together definitely have a huge advantage, whether easy to deploy or easy to manage a single pack solution. And at the same time, we also balance among how the cloud and how the edge computing working together, but some function needs to be processed in the cloud. That's also working well with a hybrid cloud approach. And also combined headquarter, the branch office, work from home, we found out is \u2013 that's also the Fabric keeping growth faster. And even a lot of product within the Fabric are suddenly double, triple than the previous quarter, like we mentioned about the FortiClient, FortiAuthenticator or FortiToken, it's all related to the work from home products suddenly see a huge increase. And so, the Fabric approach also we benefit a lot from that. I think this pandemic probably changing some of the working patterns. Like I said before, there is probably less than 10% people work remotely, access on VPN. Now due to this lockdown, probably, we see over 90%. Maybe if even we go back, reopen, whatever, maybe still 30%, 50% and it all depends on the vertical. So, that's making this remote access work from home starting to get more and more important, and especially the networking need to be combined with endpoint. Endpoint sometimes, you can address certain device. But if you are on the network side, you can actually secure the whole branch or the whole home and whatever that was there. And even different like, with Wi-Fi, [indiscernible] like different member of the family can kind of manage all these different bandwidths. We see this enterprise headquarter office VPN starting to have a pretty strong demand there. And some other like authenticated products, some other products \u2013 Fabric, we also see pretty good growth. Actually, even double, triple some of these different component of Fabric. Again, so far, we don't see any issue. We see it pretty good. They also would recover pretty quick in not only the supply chain, but also we manage our own shipment, shipping logistics and also our own supporting. So, we're not outsourcing any shipment or customer supporting. That's also with all these facility, with all the team, we can quickly address why and can make it more like redundant or whatever, resistant to any kind of downside to adopt quickly. Like I said a few weeks ago, we feel the SASE, the best model is really working with a service provider. Like today, this morning, we also announced a partnership with NTT West, offer all these like whether work from home or kind of a [indiscernible] service provider solution for both SD-WAN and also security. And even ourselves, we do have the technology, but we do believe this cloud approach need to be working with edge and on-premise together. So, we have the structure. It's all in the testing and also working with a lot of service provider right now, because the Forti SASE approach is a little bit different than the traditional SASE approach, which they forward all the traffic, whether from endpoint to your device from home and also in the office to the cloud.  So, we believe the better approach for the SASE, we call Forti SASE, is for the endpoint of some work from home, your mobile device maybe makes sense to forward to the cloud to process, which we have all the solution. But when in the office, your forward office traffic to the cloud does not quite make sense. It's not very secure, because when you forward, it's not quite encrypted. And also, it increases a lot of network traffic and much high latency, much slow.  And most of these SASE companies, very interestingly, more leveraged, like whether open source of freeware to do the security. So, when you do the testing of the security, their security [indiscernible] not as good as some other dedicated security company because we have a few hundred people just doing all this intelligent research and has done this for 20 years. So, that's where from better security, better networking latency and better like cost-wise.  Some offers, probably if you using on-site premise, more like [indiscernible] solution to process a lot of traffic locally will be much better than forward all this office traffic to the cloud. So, that's where we have \u2013 it's a Forti SASE, but a little bit different. And also, when we're working with service providers, we also make \u2013 it's a profit model compared to a lot of other SASE company. They have to invest a lot of proper data center, which is making them keeping losing money. Eventually, all this service provider, they do have their own kind of own infrastructure. So, with their current infrastructure, they leverage what they can process on-site and in office will be much more secure and cost effectively to solve this issue, right, whether it is management or manage all this mobile security solution. So, that's where we have a little bit different approach. More leverage of service provider and also leverage both on the cloud and also on-premise on edge solutions.  So, I think that's kind of very, very good feedback from all this, both in the enterprise side, in the service provider, also in the customer. So, we feel that will be the right approach. Thank you. I think they're both pretty strong. The FortiClient probably even double, triple, but come from relatively small base. And then, the appliance, the low end, whether SMB or some work from home, also pretty strong. Like, if you see, the unit shipment increased 30%. That's mostly contributed from the low end because the high end, middle range will not impact that much of the unit shipment. I think the trend still, like I said, is still in the \u2013 we still get a lot of enterprise and also they see \u2013 the current, whether the competitor's product cannot handle suddenly the huge increase of the VPN or some other work-for-home solution. So we get a lot of interest. And so, IT guy also super busy, try to \u2013 whether do the deployment or whatever. And at the same time, we also try to help them supporting them and we have this called zero-touch deployment, help them to deploy whether the branch or some other headquarter solution quickly to meet all this strong demand. I don't see the trend slow down yet. But even after the pandemic, we do see the percentage of people starting work from home probably will be higher, maybe like a few times higher compared to before the pandemic. I think it's also interesting really, the FortiClient probably can load on your laptop or your mobile, but that only secure one device. So, when you work from home, you're also probably competing with your kids for the bandwidth and then also some other things you need to manage together, some other appliance, could be like how this remote monitor device, all these things. That's where the FortiGate come in. It's very, very handy. Very, very good solution. So, they can manage different device from different load of bandwidths, secure Wi-Fi together and even some \u2013 I'm not sure how much use total SD-WAN, but it's still \u2013 but it's really the product offers so much function. They can have the whole house being managed much better secure, much better compared to one device. So, that's making them work from home as a much better security and also can kind of \u2013 it's much better than just one device. I think from the [indiscernible] 2007, 2008, security budgets hold pretty well during this recession. But this time it's different. And that's where we also try to be very careful for any guidance. And so far, we see in the first quarter, also in April, we see pretty good and low impact, no any material impact. And if since not get worse, we feel pretty comfortable. But like Keith said, these times are different. We try to be very careful. We probably continue to leverage the strong technology product, whether leverage, we call the SPU, security process unit, and ASIC which gave a huge performance advantage and is a VPN function or quite a broad function and also the fabric approach, which is already 20, 30 product or most internally developed, working, integrate, automate together, which not a competitor have this advantage.  And at the same time, we'll continue to invest. We're continuing to hire, but also we found that it's more easy to hire some high-quality people and we will continue to \u2013 and the other part also, we found we probably have the biggest training program in this whole cybersecurity industry. And we started to open up outlets for free. And not only are we working with a few hundred university to train out the student, but also a lot of big enterprise, a lot of service provider, a lot of our work on home user, all starting see a huge need for the training.  Actually, we found that we set a new registration every few second. So, every few seconds, we get a new registration set up for the training and it's a huge benefit because, in this security space, it's \u2013 last year, there's a 3.5 million shortage of trained people to help in handle the security. So, that's also the opportunity we found out to train people and then recruit them also quickly and help us solve the whole industry problem.  So, we see this as a huge opportunity for us based on the big investment we made before and also where we continued working very hard with all the team and all the partners, all the customers try to make the whole Internet more secure."

            "content": "Thank you, Ken. Let me first note, I would like to join Ken in wholeheartedly thanking our employees and their families, and our customers, partners and suppliers for their outstanding support in managing our response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  With that in mind, let's start the first quarter review with revenue. Total revenue of $577 million was up 22%. The fabric and cloud segment revenue growth was over 24%. The FortiGate network security revenue growth was 21%. Both our Fabric and FortiGate network security segments growth continued to benefit from our secure SD-WAN solutions.  The strong first quarter revenue growth once again illustrates the benefit of our diversification across geographies, customer segments, and industry verticals. The momentum our business has experienced is the result of our strategic internal investments made to broaden our product offerings, penetrate adjacent security markets, expand our global sales force and invest in our channel partners.  Product revenue grew 18% to $192 million, benefiting from strong demand for our FortiGate appliances, secure SD-WAN offering, integrated Fabric platform appliance and software solutions, as well as our embedded and standalone work from home security solutions.  Our growth rates and industry reports suggest we continue to take market share in both the firewall and SD-WAN markets, markets where we'd have contributed leadership and innovation.  Moving to service revenue, service revenue grew 24% to $385 million, representing 67% of total revenue. Over 90% of service revenue was from deferred revenue at the beginning of the quarter and continues to provide an increased level of revenue predictability.  FortiGuard security subscription revenue increased 25% to $211 million. FortiCare technical support and other service revenue increased 23% to $173 million.  The mix shift from 8/5 to our higher price 24/7 support was 6 points. And 24/7 support now represents just over 60% of this mix.  Let's shift to billings. Total billings increased 21% to $668 million. FortiGate network security billings increased 21% and accounted for 75% of total billings. Fabric and cloud billings combined increased 32%, driven by our secure access and our work from home related offerings, including FortiToken FortiAuthenticator and FortiClient.  Once again, the diversification of our business model by industry vertical was on display in the first quarter, with our top five verticals continuing to account for about two-thirds of our total billings. Service providers and MSSPs, which we believe serve a large portion of the SMB market, topped all verticals with 19% of total billings, representing its highest percent of total billings in five quarters.  Financial services had a very strong quarter, with billings growth of over 40% and represented 14% of total billings.  At the end of the first quarter, total deferred revenue increased 26% to $2.2 billion. Short-term deferred revenue increased 24% to $1.2 billion.  Looking at deals by dollar size. For deals over $250,000 and $500,000, the billings value increased 22% and 20% respectively. The dollar value of deals over $1 million increased 27%, illustrating our continued ability to move up market into the enterprise segment.  Moving back to the income statement, as shown on slide 4, gross margin improved 150 basis points to 78.7%. Product gross margin improved 300 basis points to 61.4%. Product gross margin benefited from over 40% growth in software products and lower indirect cost. Services gross margin increased 30 basis points to 87.4%.  Operating margin for the first quarter increased 190 basis points to 22.3%, benefitting from the improvement in gross margin and lower employee travel expenses related to the shift towards work from home.  During the quarter, we entered into a seven-year mutual covenant not to sue agreement with a competitor related to our patent portfolio in return for a $50 million cash payment to Fortinet.  We recognized a GAAP gain of $36.8 million as a credit to operating expenses, and we'll recognize the remainder over the term of the agreement.  We have excluded the $50 million cash receipt from our free cash flow and the $36.8 million gain from our non-GAAP margins and other results.  Total headcount ended the quarter at 7,448, an increase of 24%, driven by increased investments we made to leverage the positive momentum in our business, while seeing improving attrition rates over the last few quarters.  We do not anticipate any COVID-19-related layoffs for the foreseeable future.  Given our strong operating income performance, net income for the first quarter was $104.4 million. Our earnings per diluted share increased $0.14 to $0.60 per diluted share.  On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of $104 million or $0.60 per diluted share. Including the patent-related gain noted above, GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.44 or an increase of 29%.  Moving to the statement of cash flow summarized on slide 7 and 8. Free cash flow increased 27% to $242 million. Due to the shelter in place orders, construction was halted on the new campus building in mid-March and resumed this week.  Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $28 million, including $20 million related to construction and other real estate activity. We estimate capital expenditures for the second quarter to between $40 million and $50 million. And for all of 2020 to between $200 million and $220 million.  We expect full-year cash taxes to be approximately $40 million and our full-year non-GAAP tax rate to be 22%.  In the first quarter, we utilized a portion of our cash and investments to repurchase approximately 10 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $900 million. At the end of first quarter, the remaining share buyback authorization was $693 million.  In light of the buyback activity, together with a lower interest rate environment, let me offer two modeling insights. First, the full year share count should be 10 million shares lower than previously guided.  Second, interest income will likely be insignificant for the remainder of 2020.  Before moving to guidance, we wanted to offer some thoughts in two areas related to COVID-19, including steps that we have taken to contribute and certain observations about our business in Q1 and early Q2.  First, in response to the pandemic, we've taken a number of steps, including, one, substantially increasing our employee charitable match program for COVID-19 related donations to a total of $2 million.  And secondly, expanding our free to the public network security expert program, or what we call NSE. Last week, we further expanded the free NSE program from the first three levels to all eight levels. NSE is a self-paced online security training and certification program. By making this program free and more advanced, we hope to narrow the shortage of security skilled workers around the world and position people to emerge from COVID-19 with new and very marketable skills. In the first week, we've had over 50,000 registrations from over 5,000 different organizations.  And I'd like to share some observations about our business in Q1 and early Q2. We don't anticipate that these observations will continue in future quarters. However, in light of COVID-19, we thought they might be helpful and informative.  Looking at linearity, monthly linearity for the first quarter was consistent with prior quarters at around 50% through the first two months. While March linearity was typical, we did see an elevated level of buying during the middle two weeks of the month.  As for April linearity, it was slightly better than our first month performance for any second quarter in the last three years.  Turning the contract length and payment terms. In Q1, the average contract length remained flat at 25 months year-over-year. And average contractual payment terms increased, but less than 15%.  In terms of supply chain concerns, our product backlog was in line with historical averages and our suppliers delivered over 90% of their commitment to us. To offer some context on the puts and takes in Q1 billings, three of our Fabric platform products, FortiToken, FortiAuthenticator and FortiClient benefited from their increased value in securing organizations' employees in the shift towards work from home. Combined billings for these three products were about $10 million above expectations. In April, we saw these billings again significantly outperform expectations.  Looking at channel inventory, the total balance was flat quarter-over-quarter and up slightly year-over-year, which may relate to a small level of early buying by our customers.  Regarding SD-WAN solutions, secure SD-WAN billings for the quarter were a high single-digit percentage of total billings. April billings continued this trend and the Q2 pipeline for secure SD-WAN is strong.  And then, looking to customer segments, our G2000 billings increased 25%. SMB billings as a percentage of total billings increased slightly. Renewal rates remain within the guardrails that we provided at the Analyst Day.  And as a percentage of total billings, the worldwide retail segment remains one of our top 5 verticals and, as a percentage of total billings, remained unchanged year-over-year.  As our performance indicates, we did not see a material impact due to COVID-19 for the first quarter, and the second quarter is starting well. That said, there is a lot of uncertainty about future economic conditions.  Finally, I'd like to review our outlook for the second quarter summarized on slide 9, which is subject to the disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call.  For the second quarter, we expect billings in the range of $700 million to $725 million, revenue in the range of $590 million to $605 million, non-GAAP gross margin of 77.5% to 78.5%, non-GAAP operating margin of 23% to 24%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.64 to $0.66 which assumes a share count of between 165 million and 167 million. We expected non-GAAP tax rate of 22%.  For 2020, due to the increased uncertainty associated with the economic impact from COVID-19, we believe the prudent thing to do is to withdraw our previously issued full-year guidance.  Along with Ken, I would like to thank our partners, customers and the Fortinet team for all their support and hard work during these difficult and unique times.  Lastly, I also would like to invite all of you to listen to the management keynote presentations at our virtual Accelerate being held on May 12. You can contact Peter for registration link.  And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Peter. Yeah. Sterling, I'd probably frame a response to add on to what Ken said by saying, obviously, we gave some insights in terms of what we were seeing in April. And as part of the guidance setting process, we would obviously normally look at what's your month one activity, what does your pipeline look for month two, and what does your pipeline look like in month three. So, I think you can assume that we've looked at those factors as part of setting the guidance for the second quarter. Yeah. I think any quarter, you've got puts and takes and that's kind of why we titled that section that way. There's some things that come in that maybe weren't in your commit to begin with that you weren't expecting, and there are some things that push out. I don't think that Q1 was really any different in any other way.  I think in terms of how we're looking at it in that regard, the purpose of providing some commentary about what we saw in April, which seemed to be contradictory to a thought that there was a bunch of pull-forward from Q2 into Q1 because April \u2013 we're happy with April. Yeah. I think Ken did a very good job recapping the verticals. Just to kind of put a little more color on it, I think the government vertical, which for us is largely international, state and local, performed very well. We didn't need to call it out in the script, but it was clearly in the top three MSSPs. We talked about financial services. We talked about \u2013 as Ken indicated, retail was flattish year-over-year in terms of, I guess, percentage of billing. Tech had a pretty good quarter as well, but not enough to get it in the top five. Yeah. I think the hiring has been \u2013 we talked about this in the context over the last couple of quarters and the quarter, that within this balanced framework of profitability and growth that we're executing against, we thought coming into 2020 that we were going to tilt towards growth. And we think we saw that with some of the investments we made towards the end of last year, and we continue those hiring investments throughout the first quarter of this year. I think we'll start to lap some of those higher hiring percentages or growth in Q3 or Q4. And so, at that point in time, we'll start moving back in line with what we've seen historically. Yeah. I probably look at this way. I think that when we say Europe, it also includes our emerging part of the business as well, emerging, meaning everything from Southern Africa up to the Middle East and into Eastern Europe. I think that latter component has been strong now for many quarters in a row. And yes, I do think that, one, it's great execution by that team. And I think also they do a very good job of how they, in some ways, are forced to go to market with that.  I think if you look at the quarter overall, we probably saw, as you would kind of expect with a pandemic, the US and the Americas probably outperformed Europe, Continental Europe a little bit more during the quarter, and that's kind of consistent with what we saw with the pandemic. I think the guidance that we provided for gross margin is good for the quarter. I feel comfortable with that. I do think that we're benefiting as our cost structure changed a little bit with some of our newer products. And I think that we're partnering perhaps a little bit more effectively with our channel partners over the last couple of years than we had in the past. So, we didn't guide to the second half of the year. And we don't give a lot of specifics on renewal rates, but I think I made a comment that what we saw in the first quarter was that renewal rates were within that band that we provided at the Analyst Day. And I really don't see that changing based upon what I'm seeing.  I think it's probably helpful to kind of consider the context of our diversification. And I kind of made reference to it just a moment ago when I talked about the US performed very strongly and Europe was probably hit by the pandemic a little bit harder.  You're talking about a company now that's less than 30% of its business is in the US and there may be a lot of focus on retail headlines in the US, but it's probably passing over perhaps the recovery that's already started in Europe and the impact from Latin America and other geographies. I think we feel very good about the business, about the products, about the strategy that we're executing, about the sales team's ability to execute, about our ability to support our customers and the ability to support our partners.  And with that in mind, I'm looking at the pipeline, I'm looking at the slicing and the dicing of the pipeline. As I kind of made reference a moment ago, I'm looking at different assumptions for different geographies based upon the status of the pandemic in those geographies. We're looking at deal sizes. Larger deals have typically more risk than smaller deals do as part of our assessment. We look at whether or not it's a new logo or an existing customer or a renewal. So, all those things go into the mix in terms of setting the guidance for the quarter. No, no. Not really. Rob, are you there? We can. I think I feel good about it, but the head of manufacturing has some work to do. We still have a spot or two of components that may be lined up in Japan or the Philippines or Malaysia or something like that on an individual component. But keep in mind, part of our business model is looking at our inventory turns, which have been less than 3 recently. So, really, that means we're carrying about four months of inventory at any point in time.  And even at that level, we weren't at 100% execution, even though the backlog was consistent with other quarters. And so, probably, we're looking at our inventory level and thinking maybe as we go through the next quarter or two to move that up just ever so slightly as we start transitioning to further guard against this possible risk for pandemic. Well, look, I think the headline would be that we have a strong balance sheet and we're certainly going to leverage our balance sheet where there's opportunities to gain market share and to support our customers and our channel partners. There's no real doubt about that in my mind. We don't guide to free cash flow, but there's probably some adjustment that you want to make to your free cash flow model for the second quarter because I do think that Fortinet is in a position to help others. And I expect us to use our balance sheet to do that on a case-by-case basis. It's Keith. I'll just to add to that. I think the model, so to speak, that you're more likely to see is that when people start working from home, it's not that they're going home and taking a firewall with them. I think they're installing FortiClients on their laptop. So, that's probably really not going to drive a low end business by itself.  On the other side of the corporate IT organization, now they're trying to \u2013 they need greater throughput and greater capacity because of things like VPN and authentication and so forth. And so, you may see the corporate buyer is actually moving up, if you will, in terms of what they're buying. But, again, it's not firewall for the home.  I think the other aspect of it is, we have a new product called the 60F, which was a real beast in the quarter just in terms of the volumes that it produced. And then, in our favor, it has a little bit different cost structure than its predecessor. So, it's giving us a little bit of lift on margins. Like everybody else, I think our concerns or our interests are, is there going to be a second wave? What's the severity of the second wave going to be? What geography is it going to hit? And when is it going to hit in those geographies? And really, ultimately, what economy are you trying to provide guidance into? And that's just the unknown right now in the second half of the year. I think in terms of the SD-WAN and the MSSPs, I would characterize that as being a market that we're very interested in because it's a very large market. Obviously, the MSSPs have already come to it with an incumbent that we're trying to displace. But that opportunity, without quantifying it, if you will, is something that I would say we're very focused on internally. I think there's three things that Ken's making a point or making reference of, and I'd probably summarize them this way. I think these three things are working in our favor at the moment. One is our fabric product set has continued to expand and has continued to mature and become even more competitive, if you will, in terms of features and functions with some of the best of breed.  You are seeing more and more customers, at least those that I'm talking to, and prospects, much more interested now in a platform approach that enables automation and integration and moving away from a best-of-breed solution for every aspect of the security platform.  And then, the third aspect of it, we are probably moving into an environment where cost effectiveness is a premium in your go-to-market messaging. By that, if you can argue that successfully and produce that and deliver that lower cost, more cost-effective option, you can be successful in this market. It's payment terms, not the length of the contract, right? And I mentioned that it was slightly less than 15% increase, if you will. And I would probably think you just want to take a little bit of second looking at what your cash collection assumptions are in your free cash flow model for Q2."

All forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation and specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also, all references to financial metrics that we make on today\u2019s call are non-GAAP, unless stated otherwise. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations is located in our earnings press release and in the presentation that accompany today\u2019s remarks, both of which are posted on the Investor Relations website. Lastly, all references to growth are on a year-over-year basis unless noted otherwise. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ken.\nKen Xie: Thanks, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our outstanding fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. For the fourth quarter, bookings increased 49% to $1.420 billion. Billings increased 36% to $1.306 billion. Global G2000 billings growth accelerated to over 90%. Q-on-Q billings was up 67%, accounting for 16% of total billings. Total revenue growth, 29% to $964 million with product revenue up 31%. Our team navigated well through a challenging supply chain environment to deliver outstanding results. For the full year, revenue was $3.3 billion and GAAP operation margin was 20%. We generated a record of $1.2 billion of free cash flow, and we recorded our 13th consecutive year of GAAP profitability. Three growth drivers, convergence of security and networking, vendor consolidation with a security fabric match platform and an elevated threat environment are driving our strong financial results and market share gains. The move to Work from Anywhere has rapidly expanded the attack surface, which traditionally network security found hard to protect. Fortinet Security driven networking approach converges networking of security, including next-generation firewall, SD-WAN, 5G,  and OT to reduce capacity, while securing and connecting remote user to advance security and performance and a networking speed -- are increasingly consolidating to a cybersecurity match approach. Fortinet Security Fabric platform delivers unparalleled protection through a cybersecurity match architecture that provide broad, integrated and ultimate protection across multiple edge from endpoint to data center and hybrid cloud environment. Today, we announced a FortiGate 2000, the latest FortiGate next changing firewall, powered by Fortinet basic NP7 SPU to deliver sustainable, high-performance convergence of networking and security for zero trust edge and core network. The FortiGate 2009 secure computing routing offers an average 5x better performance than competitive offerings. Fortinet recently stood out amongst 19 network firewall vendors into a critical capability for network firewall. We evaluated the performance across non-critical capability. Fortinet FortiGate solution received overall high score in the enterprise data center, distributed enterprise edge and SMB use case and the second highest score in public cloud use case. Our FortiGate product is the only leader in both Gartner Magic Quadrant for network firewall and SD-WAN. Over the last several years, Fortinet's industry-leading innovation has transformed our company into one of the most influential and fastest-growing cybersecurity leaders. This, in addition to our growth drivers, strongly position us to capture market share and move to the next level of growth. Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners and suppliers worldwide for their continued support and hard work, and we especially like to send our operations team for doing a great job supporting Fortinet fast growth. Keith?\nKeith Jensen: Thank you, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a summary of our very strong 2021 performance. Customer demand was strong and broad-based across geographies, customer sizes, industries, use cases and security solutions, reflecting the three key demand drivers that Ken mentioned, convergence of security and networking, vendor consolidation on our Security Fabric mesh platform and the elevated threat environment. Convergence or security-driven networking requires integrated security solutions to be delivered at networking speeds across the company's entire threat landscape of edges, including data centers, endpoints, work from anywhere and clouds, as well as across multiple use cases such as secure SD-WAN, WiFi, switching, 5G and OT. The networking speed and computing capabilities of our ASIC-powered for gates can be 5 to 10 times more than competitor firewalls with their off-the-shelf silicon products. Vendor consolidation is driven by customer focus on security effectiveness, performance and cost management. We deliver vendor consolidation through our Security Fabric platform and its broad range of products integrated with a single operating system, offering increased automation. As we saw in 2021, we expect strong customer demand fueled by these key drivers to continue. And turning to our 2021 performance, billings growth accelerated to 35% or $4.2 billion, representing our highest annual billings growth rate in six years. Revenue growth also accelerated coming in at 29%, representing the fourth consecutive year of revenue growth of 20% or more. And despite the supply chain environment, product revenue growth came in 37% growth, our highest annual product revenue growth rate in 10 years. Driven by strong demand for our fabric and cloud security solutions, non-FortiGate billings and revenue each exceeded $1 billion for the first time in our history. Non-FortiGate billings increased 46% to $1.25 billion, and non-FortiGate revenue increased 42% to $1.1 billion. Gross margin was 77.5% and operating margin was 26.2%. Our GAAP operating margin was 19.5%. It's one of the highest in the industry. Our near GAAP profitable, as Ken mentioned, for 13 consecutive years. Free cash flow was a record $1.2 billion, exceeding $1 billion for the first time in our history. Free cash flow margin was 36%. And when adjusted for real estate investments came in at 43%. Total deferred revenue increased 33% to $3.5 billion, and short-term deferred revenue increased 28% to $1.8 billion. We are experiencing exceptionally strong demand, demand that exceeds supply by more than historical norms. As a result, we are expanding our disclosures to include bookings and backlog to provide greater visibility into the strength of our business. Bookings represent the value of all orders received from customers. Backlog represents the value of all orders received but not fulfilled. When the order is fulfilled, we recognize both billings and product revenue. Turning to Q4 results. As noted on Slide 4, bookings were $1.4 billion, up 49%. On a sequential basis, backlog increased $122 million due to very strong demand. On a year-over-year basis, backlog increased $150 million to end the year at $162 million. Breaking down the backlog between product and services, approximately 75% relates to future product shipments, while the remaining 25% relates to various services. While it's difficult to forecast if an order might be canceled, several factors support our view that our backlog is strong, it should provide a tailwind of growth later this year and into next year. Existing customers account for approximately 90% of our backlog. No single end customer accounts for more than a, say, a low single-digit percentage of backlog. Many competitors are also impacted by supply chain constraints. Our products, along with our integrated operating system are not commodities really changed with offerings from other vendors. We actively manage our own supply chain and for the most employed security network solution over one-third of all firewall unit shipments, we are an attractive volume buyer from any suppliers. And lastly, our price for performance advantage may be difficult for our competition to match. And I apologize for the sound in the background, we don't know what's causing it, but I'll continue on. Moving to Q4 billings of $1.3 billion, billings are up 36%, which compares to 49% bookings in noted earlier. Enterprises favorites Fortinet's leading cost performance and integrated platform. This is especially evident in the 5-point increase in the large enterprise billing mix. Add more color to this, we could share, global 2000 buildings were up over 90%, the third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. The number of deals over $1 million increased 79% to 122 deals, breaking the 100 deal threshold for time in our history. We saw a record of four low eight-figure transactions in the quarter, all in the Americas. And lastly\u2026\nPeter Salkowski: We're going to take 202 second we can mix the phone line. We think it might be our phone for some reason. We're going to dial back in and be right back. Everybody else, stayput. \nOperator: Please remain online. Your conference will resume shortly.\nPeter Salkowski: Josh, can you hear us?\nOperator: Yes, I can hear you. You're in the main room right now. And I can still hear these sounds.\nPeter Salkowski: Josh?\nOperator: I'm sorry, but the sound is still coming in pretty bad.\nPeter Salkowski: Okay. We're going to drop this line. We\u2019ll be right back.\nOperator: Please remain online. Your conference will resume shortly.\nPeter Salkowski: Josh, we're back. Can you hear me? Josh, can you hear me?\nOperator: Hello. Yes, I can hear you, but the noise came back as soon as you got connected again.\nPeter Salkowski: Yeah. We're at a totally different line. I\u2019m on my cellphone now. It sounds like it's on your end, guys.\nOperator: Let me chat with you on and we'll get in just a moment.\nPeter Salkowski: Okay. Put everybody on hold, please.\nOperator: I will put the music, hold back on the call. You are connected that at this time, sir. You may proceed.\nPeter Salkowski: Josh, are you there. Okay. All right. We're going to start. Keith's going to back up a little bit. Hopefully, you can hear us now, and we'll start where he kind of left off and go from there. Apologies for the interlude there.\nKeith Jensen: I'll back up a couple of paragraphs to my best recollection of where the challenge started. So -- and I believe that was around when I was mentioning that we were breaking down our backlog between product and services, approximately 75% relates to product -- future product shipments, while the remaining 25% relates to various services. While it's difficult to forecast if an order might be canceled, several factors support our view that our backlog is strong and should provide a tailwind for growth later this year and into next year. Existing customers account for approximately 90% of our backlog. No single end customer accounts for more than a low single-digit percentage of backlog. Many competitors are also impacted by supply chain constraints. Our products, along with our integrated operating system, are not commodities readily exchanged with offerings from other vendors. We actively manage our own supply chain and is the most deployed network security solution with over one-third of all firewall unit shipments, we are an attractive volume buyer for many suppliers. And lastly, our price for performance advantage can be difficult for our competition to match. Moving to Q4 billings. At $1.3 billion, billings were up 36%, which compares to the 49% bookings growth noted earlier. Enterprise favored Fortinet's leading cost for performance and integrated platform. This was especially evident in the five-point increase in the large enterprise billings mix. To add more color to this, we can share that Global 2000 billings were up over 90%, the third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. The number of deals over $1 million increased 79% to 122 deals, breaking the 100-plus deal threshold for the first time in our history. We saw a record of four low figure, eight-figure transactions, all in the Americas in the quarter. And lastly, Secure SD-WAN deals over $1 million increased 63% to 26%, contributing to SD-WAN use case billings growth of 67% and putting SD-WAN at 16% of total billings. FortiGate billings were up 33% and accounted for 69% of total billings. As shown on slide 11, high-end FortiGates posted very strong billings growth. Non-FortiGate billings were up 43%, driving 1.5 points mix shift to non-FortiGate. Top 10 non-FortiGate solutions with growth over 40% included virtual firewalls, endpoints and switches. At the same time, several smaller solutions posted triple digit growth rates. Consistent with the elevated threat environment and the breadth of ransomware and other attacks, OT use case billings were up 70% and accounted for 8% of total billings. Average contract term was consistent year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter at 28 months. For the third consecutive quarter, we added approximately 6,000 new logos. Worldwide government buildings grab the largest share of the mix at 16%. Financial services accounted for 14% of billings on billings growth of 63%. Billings and manufacturing, transportation, utilities, construction and other verticals that have not consistently been in our top five remained elevated with billings growth of 40%. We believe the growth of these verticals is an indication of the broadening nature and greater awareness of the threat landscape, which is driving cybersecurity investments in industries that have historically perhaps spent a little bit less on security budgets. Moving over to the income statement. Revenue growth was 29%. Product revenue growth was 31%, illustrating the impact of backlog on product revenue growth. If backlog had remained flat quarter-over-quarter, the product revenue growth would have been as high as the mid-60s. Service revenue was up 27% to $585 million. Support and related services revenue was up 31% to $275 million, while security subscription services were up 24% to $309 million. Non-FortiGate products and service revenue of $324 million grew 41% and accounted for approximately 34% of total revenue, up 3 percentage points. FortiGate product and services revenue of $639 million grew 23% and accounted for 66% of total revenue. Total gross margin of 77.3% was 180 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance range and up 80 basis points quarter-over-quarter. A lower-than-expected drag from acquisitions and pricing actions taken to offset supplier cost increases contributed to the better-than-expected total gross margin and product gross margin. Product gross margin of 62.1% increased 140 basis points sequentially. Service gross margin of 87.1% increased 50 basis points sequentially. Operating margin of 28.5% improved 270 basis points sequentially and exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by 100 basis points. Better-than-expected gross margin performance and a slightly less-than-expected impact from acquisitions contributed to the better-than-expected operating margin. Headcount increased 24% to 10,195. Moving to the statement of cash flow summarized on Slides 12 and 15. Capital expenditures were $151 million, including $129 million for real estate investments. Our capital strategy includes increasing our office and warehouse capacity to support our higher levels of growth. We repurchased 1.8 million shares of common stock for a cost of 541 million. For the year, we repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares for a cost of 742 million. At year-end, the remaining share authorization was approximately $1.5 billion and set to expire in February of 2023. Inventory turns at 2.7 were flat year-over-year and on par with 2.9 times in the prior quarter. Overall, what we believe was better than market growth for the fourth quarter and full year, we believe we again gained market share. Supported by a strong pipeline growth and the key growth drivers outlined earlier, we believe we are in the early innings of a sustained high growth period for the cybersecurity industry and Fortinet, driven by digital transformation, hybrid cloud and the moving of data and security to the edge. The products we've created, the channel and customer relationships we've developed and the investments we've made to build a broad and integrated security fabric platform powered by our proprietary Hasek FortiGates, are expected to drive our continued growth and market share gains. Now I'd like to review our outlook for the first quarter summarized on slide 16, which is subject to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For at least the first half of the year, we expect elevated demand to outpace supply chain capacity, increasing backlog, an increase in backlog as a headwind to billings and revenue growth and provides interim pressure on margins. For the first quarter, assuming bookings in the range of $1.100 billion to $1.150 billion, which at the midpoint represents bookings growth of 32%, we expect billings in the range of $1.50 billion to $1.90 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 26%; revenue in the range of $865 million to $895 million, non-GAAP gross margin of 75.5% to 76.5%, non-GAAP operating margin of 19.5% to 20.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.75 to $0.80, which assumes a share count of between $166 million and $168 million. We estimate first quarter capital expenditures to be between $140 million and $150 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 18%. Before providing our full year 2022 guidance, I'd like to congratulate every member of the Fortinet team for the truly outstanding execution in 2021. The efforts and results have been outstanding and this is on top of now several years of consistent, predictable performance and improvements in key growth and profitability metrics. In 2022, we expect a small shift in our seasonality towards the second half of the year by two or three points. And for the full year, assuming bookings in the range of $5.580 billion to $5.680 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 30%, we expect billings in the range of $5.400 billion to $5.480 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 30%. Revenue in the range of $4.275 billion to $4.325 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 29%. Total service revenue in the range of $2.685 billion to $2.715 billion, which represents growth of approximately 29% and implies full year product -- implies full year product revenue growth of approximately 27, non-GAAP gross margin of 74% to 76%, non-GAAP operating margin of 24% to 26%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.85 to $5, which assumes a share count of between $169 million and $171 million. We estimate full year capital expenditures to be between $270 million and $300 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 18%. We expect cash taxes to be approximately $210 million. Lastly, I want to inform everyone that this we will be holding an Analyst Day on May 10 coinciding with Accelerate 2022, where we expect to update our medium-term financial model. Along with Ken, I'd like to thank our partners, customers, suppliers and all members of the Fortinet team for all their hard work, execution and outstanding success. I'll now hand the call back over to Peter.\nPeter Salkowski: Thank you, Keith. As a reminder everyone, please limit yourself to one question on how we lost a little time there due to the technical delays, apologies for all of that. But operator, can you open it up for Q&A, please?\nOperator: Sure. Thank you, sir.  I show our first question comes from the line of Brian Essex from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nBrian Essex: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question and thank you. Congratulations on a nice set of results. Thanks as well for the additional disclosure. And I guess maybe on that point, maybe could you help us understand what qualifies as a booking and from a timing perspective if an order is placed with a timing event maybe nine months from now, is that still included in bookings? And then maybe any other incremental color you can provide us on the supply chain management? How you're managing the supply chain? You mentioned pricing increases offsetting an incremental supplier costs. But maybe a view on are the issues abating at all? Are lead times still consistent with where they were last quarter? And any other nuances we should be aware of, like channel partners pre-buying inventory, which is one of the things that we picked up a little bit this quarter? Thank you.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. A lot of good stuff there. I don't know if we'll get couple of...\nBrian Essex: I keep in one question.\nKeith Jensen: Yes, I know you did really well. Keep in mind, our business model, right? End users buy from resellers who buy from distributors who buy from us. So it's not like a very large complex $50 million solution that's going to be deployed over time. When we get orders, it's typically the customers want the product. So I don't know that we would see something like we described at the beginning of the conversation in terms of order bookings. For us, booking as a distributor sends an order to us, and they would like to have shipment throughout if we -- so that counts the booking. And if we ship it, then it's becomes a building and it becomes product revenue. And if we don't, it becomes backlog. I'll just pause at that was, sorry. So in terms of supply chain and maybe Ken would offer some additional thoughts on that. I do -- we talked previously, I think that we felt that September, October and maybe very early in November could turn out to be the low watermark for supply chain challenges, at least in terms of what we call decommitments from our contract manufacturers and from our component suppliers. And I think that, to this point, is shown to be the case. We do still from time to time, have the commitments, but they're much, much smaller than they were back in that time frame. I think the general tone, if you will, with our channel, whether there's components here as contract manufacturers, is much, much better than it was. We do, like everybody else, we read the reports, and we see conversations and commentary around things like -- particularly in consumer electronics, where there be some improvement in auto manufacturing. I think we have reason to believe that the situation continues to improve as we move forward. At the same time, working extremely closely with our suppliers, conversations at very high levels and talking about maybe some longer-term projects that we may work on together, for example, making them aware of what our volume of business is and also a bit of a tip of the capital or engineering team, who's been going through the process of redesigning and recertifying some of the components and some of the other changes, if you will. All of that, I think, kind of gives us a feeling that the second half of this year should see improvement. Ken?\nKen Xie: Yes. I think you commented all of them. I think is different compared to most of our competitors, we handle the design, manufacture operation, put them out directly ourselves. And also we have a bigger quantity compare to our competitors can better negotiate with suppliers. And also the engineering also starting -- last year also starting redesigned some of the product to award a certain shortage of the component, which are working well with us, but some of them may take about six months. I think overall, that's what we feel pretty confident in the second half of this year since we'll be improving both because the supply chain itself and also some alternative design and also kind of better planning. I have to say last quarter, the demand was very, very strong, with booking grew 49%, which even kind of beyond -- kind of our planning. So that's caused some of the shortage. But overall, we have a much better shape compared to competitors in the inventory and in the supply. And also the other question, we don't see increased inventory in the channel in the distributor there, pretty much the same as they have in the last few years. So we don't see any increase of the channel to setup the product. So that's not the case for us.\nKeith Jensen: Yeah. And Brian such a good job of only answering one question, I'm going to jump also in and give some more color on it. I do -- did somebody orders a product early, some place in the world? Sure. I'm sure that happened. When we try and look at our own business, we try to identify possibilities of that happening. And the best number we can come up with is something that represents extremely low single digits of our business may have been impacted by that. And at the same time, you immediately pivot over to look at your pipeline. And even if that was happening, it's certainly not evident in the pipeline. We're extremely pleased with what we're seeing in terms of the pipeline growth. And then just a follow on to Ken's comment about distributor inventory levels, again, with our model, we do have visibility of the inventory that's in the channel. And that inventory -- those inventory levels are actually down a little bit year-over-year. So I don't think we're seeing the types of things that maybe you may have some concerns about.\nKen Xie: Yeah. And also the shortage more limit and pretty much most limited in the very low end and -- so the middle and the high end FortiGate, we do have enough inventory even for the more strong like 49% billing growth. And also, we have a very broad product portfolio. So there's a lot of alternative product. The customer, the channel controls. And at the same time, something redesigned already working, it will be ready in a few months.\nBrian Essex: Fantastic color. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani from Citi. Please go ahead.\nFatima Boolani: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Keith, let me focus this one for you. At the risk of oversimplification, I know you've given us the bookings growth. You've given us the billings growth and certainly, the product growth and the guidance for fiscal 2022. So between the 49% growth you saw in bookings, 36% billings growth that you saw this quarter and the 31% in product. Can you talk us through how that is dovetailing into your guidance for next year? And frankly, how much of this backlog you're expecting to amortize into your revenue and billings profile over the course of 2022? And as related to that, I understand you've taken some pretty substantial pricing increases for your subscription packages for the portfolio. I'm curious how much of that is contemplated in your guidance across these metrics? Thank you.\nKeith Jensen: Okay. I think Brian set the standard and Fatima is following it through. How many questions will account as one? Because I start with the easy one first pricing. We raised prices. We've talked about before prices in August and again in November. On our price list, keep in mind, those get discounted down. The price -- because services, whether it's support or security, attaches -- the pricing attaches to the box, so to speak. When you raise prices on the appliance, you're also effectively raising prices on the services. But then if you think through revenue recognition, obviously, you'll get some -- you'll get the price increase in revenue for the product more currently than you will for the services you're going to recognize that over time. And I think your question of what are we expecting in terms of backlog and amortization or what have you? As you can imagine, we've done a fair amount of scenario planning to go through the year. And I don't know that there is a one scenario that we would point to as opposed to a combination of scenarios. I think you can kind of solve for that maybe not on the phone right now, with some of the information that we've provided in terms of our expectation for backlog increasing, right, for the year. And so backlog is increasing for the year, I don't think that would be reflective of us bleeding into the income statement backlog that currently exists. The components of the backlog will shift, but net-net, it's going up.\nFatima Boolani: Thank you.\nOperator: I show our next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nIttai Kidron: Thanks, guys. Great numbers. I had a clarification and a question. Just on -- Keith, on the 2-point shift in seasonality in the second half. Is that just tied to supply chain fulfillment? I just want to make sure I got that right. And there's no other cause here? And then, Ken, maybe you could talk about, from a competitive standpoint, are you seeing any changes? And I wonder if you have any thoughts with respect to CheckPoint's recent introduction of their Lightspeed firewall, which is extremely price aggressive? How do you think about that in the market? Any thoughts there would be great?\nKeith Jensen: Yes, I'll just come quickly on the linearity. We just wanted to make sure we open the door to have the conversation with you guys about how linearity may be a little bit different this year than what has been historically for us. And yes, you can point back to the supply chain on that.\nKen Xie: Yes. I also mentioned the Checkpoint earnings this morning. I probably sent to deal we mentioned Fortinet. And so their newest product, probably like 20% faster than Fortinet product 1800 app, but that's the product we released more than two years ago. I think based on Moore\u2019s law. So every two year \u2013 every 18 months, the speed will double. So I think the latest product a much faster now. So I do see because the \u2013 we see security-driven networking conversion of network and security. So the network security started deploy pretty much in all the infrastructure, not just secure the border. So when we deployed internally at a much higher speed and that's where the high-speed firewalls needed to do the internal segmentation, security server, segment, different department, all these kind of things. So that's where we see quite a strong demand in milestone growth with the current ransomware environment. But also, we see that with working from anywhere, a lot of our users have to connect remotely or kind of connect remotely. So that's where the security SD-WANs and 5G market also see very strong demand. So that's what we see. We're leading innovation in both space with our own ASIC with all the secure SD-WAN 5G connection. It's a much bigger total addressable market compared to the traditional network security. So that's where we identify as over $170 billion total addressable market for us in the next three, four years. It's a huge potential and market large enough pretty much for all the competitors to compete, but definitely have to keep up the innovation, keep up the change to keeping gaining market share.\nIttai Kidron: Got it. Very good. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nShaul Eyal: Thank you. Good afternoon guys. Congrats. I'll behave myself limiting to one question. Back to the supply chain, Keith, I just want to make sure, is that predominantly non-FortiGate products, or do we have some FortiGate products also included in that entire supply chain discussion? Thank you.\nKeith Jensen: Yeah. And I think Ken touched upon that a little bit. I'll just build it out for little more clarity. If you look at more traditional, what we call secure networking products such as switches and access points, you're looking at probably something in the order of 60%, maybe two-thirds of the backlog would fit into that category, and the remainder is in FortiGate. And then Ken was making sure that we understood that. Within FortiGate, roughly one-third, the majority of that is in the entry level or low end FortiGates. We're not really experiencing the same pressure in the midrange and the high end that we see in the low end.\nShaul Eyal: Thanks guys.\nPeter Salkowski: And then operator, just a quick one. I just want to let everybody know on the call, given the technical difficulties we had earlier, we'll post the prepared remarks about the CEO script and the CFO script to the IR website as soon as we can after the call. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Bollin from Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.\nBen Bollin: Good evening, everyone. Thank you for taking the question. Ken or Keith, when you think about the elevated demand and placements on the product front, can you share any thoughts about how coincident that demand is or leading as it relates to additional fabric traction? Any thoughts or hooks around number of applications that are being deployed typically with that initial rollout versus what comes later? Thanks.\nKen Xie: We see a lot of enterprise they need to protect their internal network because its ransomware attack like we released that we served a few months ago, is 11 times higher on the ransomware attack compared to one years ago. So there\u2019s big demand to secure the company, whole infrastructure. Also working -- I think we also need more security, especially like secure SD-WAN, secure 5G, all these connections. So we see -- the demand is very, very strong. So that's where -- and also for supply for some other chip manufacturer, even with our own chip, usually, there's a lead time. So that's where we see the backlog and we're hoping we'll be -- go back, I hope will be more normal towards the end of the year.\nKeith Jensen: Yeah. Hi, Ben. How are you? Ken's pointing at me, so I'll follow-up a little bit. I think in terms of pull-through of non-FortiGate products, maybe I kind of came to the conversation a few years ago thinking that that was going to be more of a commercial and mid-enterprise area where we see the quantity. In actuality, it seems to move with customer size. The SMB is somewhat limited as we still see other products attaching and building that out. And then the mid enterprise, the enterprise, and then the service providers are very strong buyers of multiple products. And I think that why that's relevant is that's the affirmation of the platform strategy. I think they very early on realized the overhead cost of managing point solutions from different vendors could be fairly onerous, and that was pretty challenging. And so it is moving its way through the rest of the customer chain, if you will. I think the other thing that's happening more currently now is we've seen -- we talk about these other verticals that represent not in the top five, but coming to the table and buying security. And I think they're very clear with us in conversations that I've had with them and Ken as well that they're looking for a total solution. And the ability to cobble together a series of integrated products into one solution. Not only does that save them in terms of the initial purchase, but also the management cost. So I do think there's definitely a tailwind in that area.\nKen Xie: Yes. The other meditation point is really the Global 2000 account grow over 90%, so it's almost double year-over-year, a very strong demand in there.\nBen Bollin: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Hamza Fodderwala from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nHamza Fodderwala: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a question about just the appliance demand more broadly. Maybe a question for Ken. How do you think about the demand for hardware between factors like return to office, campus refresh, data center? What's really driving that appliance as we go through 2022?\nKen Xie: I think the convergence of network and security will be long-term and I think during the pandemic and even after pandemic, you see a lot of things changing, whether the working environment or more access, that's what the zero trust in starting to build up very demand there. And also internally, they need to secure the whole infrastructure both in the -- within the like campus network, data center or remote in connecting branch office. So that's where we see the whole infrastructure need to be secured. And also kind of consolidation among different vendors also starting happening more quickly because like Keith mentioned, the management cost is very high, if they have a different vendor for different part of cybersecurity. So that's where the vendor can provide more product integrate, automate together definitely has more advantage and lower and total management cost. Actually, that's why we see the, like I mentioned, the three driver convergence of our network and security and the consolidation of the vendor and at the same time, the strong elevated server security threat right now, especially like ransomware is a big impact to the business is all driving the strong growth.\nHamza Fodderwala: Thank you.\nKeith Jensen: Yes, I would say that I think one of the things that Ken ask us to go look at was what our product revenue growth has been if we didn't have backlog, right? And that's that kind of who knows when they call out with that point, but it was 65% or 66% product revenue growth if we had the product to deliver. I mean that's a huge number. And I think it speaks to the kind description of this is -- the demand is extremely high for appliances right now.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSterling Auty: Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. Keith, one for you. If I'm looking at it correct, if it wasn't for the gross margin pressure, it looks like operating margins would have expanded nicely in 2022. And I'm curious with things like return to office, maybe a pickup in business travel and maybe even wage inflation, how are you able to deliver that kind of underlying margin expansion in the operating line?\nKeith Jensen: I don't -- for 2022 versus 2021, I think we're guiding to 24% to -- I think we're guiding to basically 25% at the midpoint and just closed out a year at\u2026\nPeter Salkowski: 26%.\nKeith Jensen: 26%. I don't know that that's up. Sterling, you mind thinking about that?\nPeter Salkowski: I think if the gross margin was down.\nKeith Jensen: On the operating -- the leverage is coming through on the operating expenses.\nSterling Auty: Yeah. Exactly.\nKeith Jensen: Yeah. I think that while you can look at the percentages in terms of what we're spending, I think sales productivity in the current environment is probably the biggest driver, if you will, in terms of the leverage that we get out of this. Obviously, if you go back to 2021, not a lot of sales productivity probably in 2020. With COVID, very nice sales productivity numbers in 2021. Now we're looking at tailwinds. I must be honest, the price increases will indeed increase sales productivity.\nSterling Auty: Got it. Thank you.\nKeith Jensen: Okay.\nPeter Salkowski: Thanks Sterling.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Adam Borg from Stifel. Please go ahead.\nAdam Borg: Hi guys, and thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe just an SD-WAN, it's great to see the strength there continuing -- maybe you could comment just on, I guess, first the sustainability of those trends in coming years. And are you seeing this growth coming more from greenfield opportunities or some brownfield displacements? Thanks so much.\nKen Xie: It's pretty broad. As you can look at SD-WAN, probably, I'd say, more than half majority products go to the middle or high end range. And at the same time, a lot of enterprise customers, a lot of are all starting using leverage SD-WAN. So it's quite a broad -- much more beyond the retail.\nPeter Salkowski: Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Ho: Hi, good afternoon. And let me echo my congratulations on the strong quarter. Yeah, I guess, just given that you've delivered a quarter that's been particularly strong this year. Can you give us a bit of a sense of what's happening with the pipeline? And maybe what is giving you the confidence that you can continue to drive that sustained growth for several more years. I think you've gone through some of the factors one by one, but what are you seeing in the immediate term that allows you to continue growing at these rates? Thank you.\nKeith Jensen: Yeah, I\u2019m looking at Ken who wants to get more strategic. I'll give you a very tactical conversation about it. And Peter is making a shameless plug for the Analyst Day in May and saying that we'll talk about that then. Look, I'm really, really pleased with what the pipeline looks like at the moment. We go through our use we've talked before, I think, Jonathan, is slicing and dicing it in terms of how much our new customers, renewals, expansions inside customers, what's the deal size? What's the geography? And it's -- I don't want to just loss over some of the numbers that we saw in the enterprise segment in the fourth quarter. I think we're at 90% growth on the G2000 for three quarters in a row. The U S. did extremely well and without getting into a lot of details, they too accelerated for three quarters in a row. Looking at the pipeline and looking at again, more enterprise growth that's coming, I think we have a good position in SMB, love the execution. We've had some people in other settings comment upon, the maturity that the sales and marketing and execution level has reached now as a company. So I think the pipeline in our ability to execute, I don't see why that would change.\nKen Xie: Yes. And also, we have a lot of growth potential in the Global 2000. So like we said last year -- last quarter grown at 90% year-over-year. And also, this is the bigger account, you also can upsell, cross-sell a lot of other products. So we do see the pipeline is very, very strong. And also we're keeping enhance in the marketing and keeping pretty aggressively higher net sales and the sales capacity. So far some regions, some of the vertical, we still have much less capacity than some of our competitors. I think with the additional marketing sales capacity, we do see the growth will continue in the next few years.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits from KeyBank. Please go ahead.\nMichael Turits: Hey, guys. Thanks, Keith, for making the statement of demand very high for appliances. I guess I'd just like to reask Hamza\u2019s question about the sources of demand for appliances right now, particularly in the context though of how strong cloud is. I mean, we just had very strong cloud numbers coming in from Amazon as well as from others. So how should we really understand why so much is being spent in physical boxes right now as opposed to even some of your products that are in the cloud?\nKen Xie: I probably one common deal mentioned this morning in the call, definitely, the network security is a much bigger total addressable market. The cloud security ported by 2025, it is little bit over $20 billion and compared to current total addressable market, including network security, converting network security, endpoint or the other will be $170 billion. It's a much bigger market. And at the same time, there's a lot of innovation going on and have to secure the whole infrastructure. So that's where we see the price also even access the cloud, you need all these appliance. You also need this SD-WAN, 5G connection, all this to access the cloud. So that's where we see the. There's a huge market potential in the very fragmented market. There\u2019s a lot of growth potential.\nMichael Turits: Thanks, Ken.\nOperator: Thank you. I'm showing now, we have time for one more question coming from Keith Bachman from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nKeith Bachman: Yes, I'm going to ask a similar question to Michael before. Your product revenue growth has been 40%, 50% and now the underlying growth this quarter was north of 60%. Your competitors are also experiencing good product revenues, not nearly to the extent that you are. And so it's more than Checkpoint that's experiencing demand and it's more than the \u2013 what I characterize as the consolidation when you're taking share from the likes of Cisco and SD-WAN. And so I'm trying to understand, if you thought about the aggregate demand is in the last three quarters have been far exceeded anything that's happened in, say, the last five years between not only yourself, but your three primary competitors ex-Cisco. And so the question is, if traffic is normally one of the key drivers, but what are some other drivers for not just yourself, but for the three primary vendors? Just trying to understand that really, I think, consistent with some of the other questions about the durability of demand not just for yourself but for the industry in general?\nKen Xie: Yes. I think the industry I do believe, they need to start to secure the whole infrastructure, both internal LAN and also the WAN connection put outside. And that also like we see very, very strong demand to secure inside the company and also like all this data center or this internal segmentation, which is before the network security is too slow to deploy in the high-speed environment internally. And then also the SD-WAN, you can see pretty strong growth. And -- I think the overall convergence of repeating the network or security, that's the suite driver we gave out. I think probably in the Analyst Day, Peter, Keith mentioned, May 10th. So we'll probably give some more details on data and analysis and we'll see how long. I do believe this will be pretty long-term changing in the whole space where we were keeping growth in the next five to 10 years. And also ASIC advantage and the continue scale and scope all starting working for us because we have the quantity, which helping lower per chip cost, which none of our competitors have. And also, we're probably the only company-only chip. And we also leverage any other commercial chip available, including all the -- whatever Intel, MV, GPU, TPU,IPU other things we're using, but we have unique advantage of our own ASIC chip, which help in drive over high-speed, low-cost network security solution. On the other side, the economy of scope also working, because we have like a set some different product harbor, we call the fabric and now on mesh that basically mesh architecture, which is helping us to cross-sell, I think last quarter is the first time the over 30%. I think right now, it's a FortiGate count about 69%, non-FortiGate 41% and also over $1 billion last year. Also see very, very strong growth, grow faster than the FortiGate. So that's also helping to supporting the whole infrastructure security, converging on network and security and also elevate the threat environment.\nKeith Jensen: Thanks very much for the question. Shameless on Peter for continuing to plug\u2026\nKeith Bachman: Thank you.\nKeith Jensen: Early in the life cycle of cybersecurity industry, maybe 10 or 15 years ago, where firewalls had a very specific use and the environment, if you will, is more stable, it may be easier to identify refresh cycles that we keep looking for and have not yet seen in the last five years. And I think that's perhaps going back to Ken's point, I think that's because the environment is not stable at all. I think the reality is what you're seeing out there right now in terms of use cases and data volumes, data is all over the place -- and it's lots and lots of data. It's just getting more and more. And the use cases, I mean, five years ago, a lot of things that were air gaped away from the Internet aren't anymore. And now you see -- it's probably what's probably the manufacturing vertical for us. I just -- I don't know that you can presume that the environment, so to speak, and the political interest in it, the insurance company is interested in it, CIOs management team is interested in that. It is a hot topic of conversation. So even if you are due for a refresh cycle in the industry, and I don't know that we are, I don't think you're going to see that because of what's happening in the world out there.\nKeith Bachman: All right. Okay. Thank you gentlemen.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Peter Salkowski for any closing comments. Please go ahead.\nPeter Salkowski: Thank you. Again, apologies for the technical difficulties today. As I said earlier, we are planning to post the prepared remarks up on our website as soon as we can. So you can see all the numbers that Keith shared that I think help answer some of the questions with regards to bookings backlog and the sustainable growth in our business. I'd also like to remind everybody we'll be at the Morgan Stanley conference on March 9th, an in-person conference, our first and gosh, I don't even know how long. Fireside chat at the event and the webcast link for that -- for the Morgan Stanley conference will be on our Investor Relations website for you all to listen. Do you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to contact me. Thank you very much for your time. Again, apologies for the technical difficulties and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

            "content": "Thanks, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our outstanding fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. For the fourth quarter, bookings increased 49% to $1.420 billion. Billings increased 36% to $1.306 billion. Global G2000 billings growth accelerated to over 90%. Q-on-Q billings was up 67%, accounting for 16% of total billings. Total revenue growth, 29% to $964 million with product revenue up 31%. Our team navigated well through a challenging supply chain environment to deliver outstanding results. For the full year, revenue was $3.3 billion and GAAP operation margin was 20%. We generated a record of $1.2 billion of free cash flow, and we recorded our 13th consecutive year of GAAP profitability. Three growth drivers, convergence of security and networking, vendor consolidation with a security fabric match platform and an elevated threat environment are driving our strong financial results and market share gains. The move to Work from Anywhere has rapidly expanded the attack surface, which traditionally network security found hard to protect. Fortinet Security driven networking approach converges networking of security, including next-generation firewall, SD-WAN, 5G,  and OT to reduce capacity, while securing and connecting remote user to advance security and performance and a networking speed -- are increasingly consolidating to a cybersecurity match approach. Fortinet Security Fabric platform delivers unparalleled protection through a cybersecurity match architecture that provide broad, integrated and ultimate protection across multiple edge from endpoint to data center and hybrid cloud environment. Today, we announced a FortiGate 2000, the latest FortiGate next changing firewall, powered by Fortinet basic NP7 SPU to deliver sustainable, high-performance convergence of networking and security for zero trust edge and core network. The FortiGate 2009 secure computing routing offers an average 5x better performance than competitive offerings. Fortinet recently stood out amongst 19 network firewall vendors into a critical capability for network firewall. We evaluated the performance across non-critical capability. Fortinet FortiGate solution received overall high score in the enterprise data center, distributed enterprise edge and SMB use case and the second highest score in public cloud use case. Our FortiGate product is the only leader in both Gartner Magic Quadrant for network firewall and SD-WAN. Over the last several years, Fortinet's industry-leading innovation has transformed our company into one of the most influential and fastest-growing cybersecurity leaders. This, in addition to our growth drivers, strongly position us to capture market share and move to the next level of growth. Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners and suppliers worldwide for their continued support and hard work, and we especially like to send our operations team for doing a great job supporting Fortinet fast growth. Keith? Yes. I think you commented all of them. I think is different compared to most of our competitors, we handle the design, manufacture operation, put them out directly ourselves. And also we have a bigger quantity compare to our competitors can better negotiate with suppliers. And also the engineering also starting -- last year also starting redesigned some of the product to award a certain shortage of the component, which are working well with us, but some of them may take about six months. I think overall, that's what we feel pretty confident in the second half of this year since we'll be improving both because the supply chain itself and also some alternative design and also kind of better planning. I have to say last quarter, the demand was very, very strong, with booking grew 49%, which even kind of beyond -- kind of our planning. So that's caused some of the shortage. But overall, we have a much better shape compared to competitors in the inventory and in the supply. And also the other question, we don't see increased inventory in the channel in the distributor there, pretty much the same as they have in the last few years. So we don't see any increase of the channel to setup the product. So that's not the case for us. Yeah. And also the shortage more limit and pretty much most limited in the very low end and -- so the middle and the high end FortiGate, we do have enough inventory even for the more strong like 49% billing growth. And also, we have a very broad product portfolio. So there's a lot of alternative product. The customer, the channel controls. And at the same time, something redesigned already working, it will be ready in a few months. Yes. I also mentioned the Checkpoint earnings this morning. I probably sent to deal we mentioned Fortinet. And so their newest product, probably like 20% faster than Fortinet product 1800 app, but that's the product we released more than two years ago. I think based on Moore's law. So every two year \u2013 every 18 months, the speed will double. So I think the latest product a much faster now. So I do see because the \u2013 we see security-driven networking conversion of network and security. So the network security started deploy pretty much in all the infrastructure, not just secure the border. So when we deployed internally at a much higher speed and that's where the high-speed firewalls needed to do the internal segmentation, security server, segment, different department, all these kind of things. So that's where we see quite a strong demand in milestone growth with the current ransomware environment. But also, we see that with working from anywhere, a lot of our users have to connect remotely or kind of connect remotely. So that's where the security SD-WANs and 5G market also see very strong demand. So that's what we see. We're leading innovation in both space with our own ASIC with all the secure SD-WAN 5G connection. It's a much bigger total addressable market compared to the traditional network security. So that's where we identify as over $170 billion total addressable market for us in the next three, four years. It's a huge potential and market large enough pretty much for all the competitors to compete, but definitely have to keep up the innovation, keep up the change to keeping gaining market share. We see a lot of enterprise they need to protect their internal network because its ransomware attack like we released that we served a few months ago, is 11 times higher on the ransomware attack compared to one years ago. So there's big demand to secure the company, whole infrastructure. Also working -- I think we also need more security, especially like secure SD-WAN, secure 5G, all these connections. So we see -- the demand is very, very strong. So that's where -- and also for supply for some other chip manufacturer, even with our own chip, usually, there's a lead time. So that's where we see the backlog and we're hoping we'll be -- go back, I hope will be more normal towards the end of the year. Yes. The other meditation point is really the Global 2000 account grow over 90%, so it's almost double year-over-year, a very strong demand in there. I think the convergence of network and security will be long-term and I think during the pandemic and even after pandemic, you see a lot of things changing, whether the working environment or more access, that's what the zero trust in starting to build up very demand there. And also internally, they need to secure the whole infrastructure both in the -- within the like campus network, data center or remote in connecting branch office. So that's where we see the whole infrastructure need to be secured. And also kind of consolidation among different vendors also starting happening more quickly because like Keith mentioned, the management cost is very high, if they have a different vendor for different part of cybersecurity. So that's where the vendor can provide more product integrate, automate together definitely has more advantage and lower and total management cost. Actually, that's why we see the, like I mentioned, the three driver convergence of our network and security and the consolidation of the vendor and at the same time, the strong elevated server security threat right now, especially like ransomware is a big impact to the business is all driving the strong growth. It's pretty broad. As you can look at SD-WAN, probably, I'd say, more than half majority products go to the middle or high end range. And at the same time, a lot of enterprise customers, a lot of are all starting using leverage SD-WAN. So it's quite a broad -- much more beyond the retail. Yes. And also, we have a lot of growth potential in the Global 2000. So like we said last year -- last quarter grown at 90% year-over-year. And also, this is the bigger account, you also can upsell, cross-sell a lot of other products. So we do see the pipeline is very, very strong. And also we're keeping enhance in the marketing and keeping pretty aggressively higher net sales and the sales capacity. So far some regions, some of the vertical, we still have much less capacity than some of our competitors. I think with the additional marketing sales capacity, we do see the growth will continue in the next few years. I probably one common deal mentioned this morning in the call, definitely, the network security is a much bigger total addressable market. The cloud security ported by 2025, it is little bit over $20 billion and compared to current total addressable market, including network security, converting network security, endpoint or the other will be $170 billion. It's a much bigger market. And at the same time, there's a lot of innovation going on and have to secure the whole infrastructure. So that's where we see the price also even access the cloud, you need all these appliance. You also need this SD-WAN, 5G connection, all this to access the cloud. So that's where we see the. There's a huge market potential in the very fragmented market. There's a lot of growth potential. Yes. I think the industry I do believe, they need to start to secure the whole infrastructure, both internal LAN and also the WAN connection put outside. And that also like we see very, very strong demand to secure inside the company and also like all this data center or this internal segmentation, which is before the network security is too slow to deploy in the high-speed environment internally. And then also the SD-WAN, you can see pretty strong growth. And -- I think the overall convergence of repeating the network or security, that's the suite driver we gave out. I think probably in the Analyst Day, Peter, Keith mentioned, May 10th. So we'll probably give some more details on data and analysis and we'll see how long. I do believe this will be pretty long-term changing in the whole space where we were keeping growth in the next five to 10 years. And also ASIC advantage and the continue scale and scope all starting working for us because we have the quantity, which helping lower per chip cost, which none of our competitors have. And also, we're probably the only company-only chip. And we also leverage any other commercial chip available, including all the -- whatever Intel, MV, GPU, TPU,IPU other things we're using, but we have unique advantage of our own ASIC chip, which help in drive over high-speed, low-cost network security solution. On the other side, the economy of scope also working, because we have like a set some different product harbor, we call the fabric and now on mesh that basically mesh architecture, which is helping us to cross-sell, I think last quarter is the first time the over 30%. I think right now, it's a FortiGate count about 69%, non-FortiGate 41% and also over $1 billion last year. Also see very, very strong growth, grow faster than the FortiGate. So that's also helping to supporting the whole infrastructure security, converging on network and security and also elevate the threat environment."

            "name": "Keith Jensen",
            "content": "Thank you, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a summary of our very strong 2021 performance. Customer demand was strong and broad-based across geographies, customer sizes, industries, use cases and security solutions, reflecting the three key demand drivers that Ken mentioned, convergence of security and networking, vendor consolidation on our Security Fabric mesh platform and the elevated threat environment. Convergence or security-driven networking requires integrated security solutions to be delivered at networking speeds across the company's entire threat landscape of edges, including data centers, endpoints, work from anywhere and clouds, as well as across multiple use cases such as secure SD-WAN, WiFi, switching, 5G and OT. The networking speed and computing capabilities of our ASIC-powered for gates can be 5 to 10 times more than competitor firewalls with their off-the-shelf silicon products. Vendor consolidation is driven by customer focus on security effectiveness, performance and cost management. We deliver vendor consolidation through our Security Fabric platform and its broad range of products integrated with a single operating system, offering increased automation. As we saw in 2021, we expect strong customer demand fueled by these key drivers to continue. And turning to our 2021 performance, billings growth accelerated to 35% or $4.2 billion, representing our highest annual billings growth rate in six years. Revenue growth also accelerated coming in at 29%, representing the fourth consecutive year of revenue growth of 20% or more. And despite the supply chain environment, product revenue growth came in 37% growth, our highest annual product revenue growth rate in 10 years. Driven by strong demand for our fabric and cloud security solutions, non-FortiGate billings and revenue each exceeded $1 billion for the first time in our history. Non-FortiGate billings increased 46% to $1.25 billion, and non-FortiGate revenue increased 42% to $1.1 billion. Gross margin was 77.5% and operating margin was 26.2%. Our GAAP operating margin was 19.5%. It's one of the highest in the industry. Our near GAAP profitable, as Ken mentioned, for 13 consecutive years. Free cash flow was a record $1.2 billion, exceeding $1 billion for the first time in our history. Free cash flow margin was 36%. And when adjusted for real estate investments came in at 43%. Total deferred revenue increased 33% to $3.5 billion, and short-term deferred revenue increased 28% to $1.8 billion. We are experiencing exceptionally strong demand, demand that exceeds supply by more than historical norms. As a result, we are expanding our disclosures to include bookings and backlog to provide greater visibility into the strength of our business. Bookings represent the value of all orders received from customers. Backlog represents the value of all orders received but not fulfilled. When the order is fulfilled, we recognize both billings and product revenue. Turning to Q4 results. As noted on Slide 4, bookings were $1.4 billion, up 49%. On a sequential basis, backlog increased $122 million due to very strong demand. On a year-over-year basis, backlog increased $150 million to end the year at $162 million. Breaking down the backlog between product and services, approximately 75% relates to future product shipments, while the remaining 25% relates to various services. While it's difficult to forecast if an order might be canceled, several factors support our view that our backlog is strong, it should provide a tailwind of growth later this year and into next year. Existing customers account for approximately 90% of our backlog. No single end customer accounts for more than a, say, a low single-digit percentage of backlog. Many competitors are also impacted by supply chain constraints. Our products, along with our integrated operating system are not commodities really changed with offerings from other vendors. We actively manage our own supply chain and for the most employed security network solution over one-third of all firewall unit shipments, we are an attractive volume buyer from any suppliers. And lastly, our price for performance advantage may be difficult for our competition to match. And I apologize for the sound in the background, we don't know what's causing it, but I'll continue on. Moving to Q4 billings of $1.3 billion, billings are up 36%, which compares to 49% bookings in noted earlier. Enterprises favorites Fortinet's leading cost performance and integrated platform. This is especially evident in the 5-point increase in the large enterprise billing mix. Add more color to this, we could share, global 2000 buildings were up over 90%, the third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. The number of deals over $1 million increased 79% to 122 deals, breaking the 100 deal threshold for time in our history. We saw a record of four low eight-figure transactions in the quarter, all in the Americas. And lastly... I'll back up a couple of paragraphs to my best recollection of where the challenge started. So -- and I believe that was around when I was mentioning that we were breaking down our backlog between product and services, approximately 75% relates to product -- future product shipments, while the remaining 25% relates to various services. While it's difficult to forecast if an order might be canceled, several factors support our view that our backlog is strong and should provide a tailwind for growth later this year and into next year. Existing customers account for approximately 90% of our backlog. No single end customer accounts for more than a low single-digit percentage of backlog. Many competitors are also impacted by supply chain constraints. Our products, along with our integrated operating system, are not commodities readily exchanged with offerings from other vendors. We actively manage our own supply chain and is the most deployed network security solution with over one-third of all firewall unit shipments, we are an attractive volume buyer for many suppliers. And lastly, our price for performance advantage can be difficult for our competition to match. Moving to Q4 billings. At $1.3 billion, billings were up 36%, which compares to the 49% bookings growth noted earlier. Enterprise favored Fortinet's leading cost for performance and integrated platform. This was especially evident in the five-point increase in the large enterprise billings mix. To add more color to this, we can share that Global 2000 billings were up over 90%, the third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. The number of deals over $1 million increased 79% to 122 deals, breaking the 100-plus deal threshold for the first time in our history. We saw a record of four low figure, eight-figure transactions, all in the Americas in the quarter. And lastly, Secure SD-WAN deals over $1 million increased 63% to 26%, contributing to SD-WAN use case billings growth of 67% and putting SD-WAN at 16% of total billings. FortiGate billings were up 33% and accounted for 69% of total billings. As shown on slide 11, high-end FortiGates posted very strong billings growth. Non-FortiGate billings were up 43%, driving 1.5 points mix shift to non-FortiGate. Top 10 non-FortiGate solutions with growth over 40% included virtual firewalls, endpoints and switches. At the same time, several smaller solutions posted triple digit growth rates. Consistent with the elevated threat environment and the breadth of ransomware and other attacks, OT use case billings were up 70% and accounted for 8% of total billings. Average contract term was consistent year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter at 28 months. For the third consecutive quarter, we added approximately 6,000 new logos. Worldwide government buildings grab the largest share of the mix at 16%. Financial services accounted for 14% of billings on billings growth of 63%. Billings and manufacturing, transportation, utilities, construction and other verticals that have not consistently been in our top five remained elevated with billings growth of 40%. We believe the growth of these verticals is an indication of the broadening nature and greater awareness of the threat landscape, which is driving cybersecurity investments in industries that have historically perhaps spent a little bit less on security budgets. Moving over to the income statement. Revenue growth was 29%. Product revenue growth was 31%, illustrating the impact of backlog on product revenue growth. If backlog had remained flat quarter-over-quarter, the product revenue growth would have been as high as the mid-60s. Service revenue was up 27% to $585 million. Support and related services revenue was up 31% to $275 million, while security subscription services were up 24% to $309 million. Non-FortiGate products and service revenue of $324 million grew 41% and accounted for approximately 34% of total revenue, up 3 percentage points. FortiGate product and services revenue of $639 million grew 23% and accounted for 66% of total revenue. Total gross margin of 77.3% was 180 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance range and up 80 basis points quarter-over-quarter. A lower-than-expected drag from acquisitions and pricing actions taken to offset supplier cost increases contributed to the better-than-expected total gross margin and product gross margin. Product gross margin of 62.1% increased 140 basis points sequentially. Service gross margin of 87.1% increased 50 basis points sequentially. Operating margin of 28.5% improved 270 basis points sequentially and exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by 100 basis points. Better-than-expected gross margin performance and a slightly less-than-expected impact from acquisitions contributed to the better-than-expected operating margin. Headcount increased 24% to 10,195. Moving to the statement of cash flow summarized on Slides 12 and 15. Capital expenditures were $151 million, including $129 million for real estate investments. Our capital strategy includes increasing our office and warehouse capacity to support our higher levels of growth. We repurchased 1.8 million shares of common stock for a cost of 541 million. For the year, we repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares for a cost of 742 million. At year-end, the remaining share authorization was approximately $1.5 billion and set to expire in February of 2023. Inventory turns at 2.7 were flat year-over-year and on par with 2.9 times in the prior quarter. Overall, what we believe was better than market growth for the fourth quarter and full year, we believe we again gained market share. Supported by a strong pipeline growth and the key growth drivers outlined earlier, we believe we are in the early innings of a sustained high growth period for the cybersecurity industry and Fortinet, driven by digital transformation, hybrid cloud and the moving of data and security to the edge. The products we've created, the channel and customer relationships we've developed and the investments we've made to build a broad and integrated security fabric platform powered by our proprietary Hasek FortiGates, are expected to drive our continued growth and market share gains. Now I'd like to review our outlook for the first quarter summarized on slide 16, which is subject to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For at least the first half of the year, we expect elevated demand to outpace supply chain capacity, increasing backlog, an increase in backlog as a headwind to billings and revenue growth and provides interim pressure on margins. For the first quarter, assuming bookings in the range of $1.100 billion to $1.150 billion, which at the midpoint represents bookings growth of 32%, we expect billings in the range of $1.50 billion to $1.90 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 26%; revenue in the range of $865 million to $895 million, non-GAAP gross margin of 75.5% to 76.5%, non-GAAP operating margin of 19.5% to 20.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.75 to $0.80, which assumes a share count of between $166 million and $168 million. We estimate first quarter capital expenditures to be between $140 million and $150 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 18%. Before providing our full year 2022 guidance, I'd like to congratulate every member of the Fortinet team for the truly outstanding execution in 2021. The efforts and results have been outstanding and this is on top of now several years of consistent, predictable performance and improvements in key growth and profitability metrics. In 2022, we expect a small shift in our seasonality towards the second half of the year by two or three points. And for the full year, assuming bookings in the range of $5.580 billion to $5.680 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 30%, we expect billings in the range of $5.400 billion to $5.480 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 30%. Revenue in the range of $4.275 billion to $4.325 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 29%. Total service revenue in the range of $2.685 billion to $2.715 billion, which represents growth of approximately 29% and implies full year product -- implies full year product revenue growth of approximately 27, non-GAAP gross margin of 74% to 76%, non-GAAP operating margin of 24% to 26%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.85 to $5, which assumes a share count of between $169 million and $171 million. We estimate full year capital expenditures to be between $270 million and $300 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 18%. We expect cash taxes to be approximately $210 million. Lastly, I want to inform everyone that this we will be holding an Analyst Day on May 10 coinciding with Accelerate 2022, where we expect to update our medium-term financial model. Along with Ken, I'd like to thank our partners, customers, suppliers and all members of the Fortinet team for all their hard work, execution and outstanding success. I'll now hand the call back over to Peter. Yes. A lot of good stuff there. I don't know if we'll get couple of... Yes, I know you did really well. Keep in mind, our business model, right? End users buy from resellers who buy from distributors who buy from us. So it's not like a very large complex $50 million solution that's going to be deployed over time. When we get orders, it's typically the customers want the product. So I don't know that we would see something like we described at the beginning of the conversation in terms of order bookings. For us, booking as a distributor sends an order to us, and they would like to have shipment throughout if we -- so that counts the booking. And if we ship it, then it's becomes a building and it becomes product revenue. And if we don't, it becomes backlog. I'll just pause at that was, sorry. So in terms of supply chain and maybe Ken would offer some additional thoughts on that. I do -- we talked previously, I think that we felt that September, October and maybe very early in November could turn out to be the low watermark for supply chain challenges, at least in terms of what we call decommitments from our contract manufacturers and from our component suppliers. And I think that, to this point, is shown to be the case. We do still from time to time, have the commitments, but they're much, much smaller than they were back in that time frame. I think the general tone, if you will, with our channel, whether there's components here as contract manufacturers, is much, much better than it was. We do, like everybody else, we read the reports, and we see conversations and commentary around things like -- particularly in consumer electronics, where there be some improvement in auto manufacturing. I think we have reason to believe that the situation continues to improve as we move forward. At the same time, working extremely closely with our suppliers, conversations at very high levels and talking about maybe some longer-term projects that we may work on together, for example, making them aware of what our volume of business is and also a bit of a tip of the capital or engineering team, who's been going through the process of redesigning and recertifying some of the components and some of the other changes, if you will. All of that, I think, kind of gives us a feeling that the second half of this year should see improvement. Ken? Yeah. And Brian such a good job of only answering one question, I'm going to jump also in and give some more color on it. I do -- did somebody orders a product early, some place in the world? Sure. I'm sure that happened. When we try and look at our own business, we try to identify possibilities of that happening. And the best number we can come up with is something that represents extremely low single digits of our business may have been impacted by that. And at the same time, you immediately pivot over to look at your pipeline. And even if that was happening, it's certainly not evident in the pipeline. We're extremely pleased with what we're seeing in terms of the pipeline growth. And then just a follow on to Ken's comment about distributor inventory levels, again, with our model, we do have visibility of the inventory that's in the channel. And that inventory -- those inventory levels are actually down a little bit year-over-year. So I don't think we're seeing the types of things that maybe you may have some concerns about. Okay. I think Brian set the standard and Fatima is following it through. How many questions will account as one? Because I start with the easy one first pricing. We raised prices. We've talked about before prices in August and again in November. On our price list, keep in mind, those get discounted down. The price -- because services, whether it's support or security, attaches -- the pricing attaches to the box, so to speak. When you raise prices on the appliance, you're also effectively raising prices on the services. But then if you think through revenue recognition, obviously, you'll get some -- you'll get the price increase in revenue for the product more currently than you will for the services you're going to recognize that over time. And I think your question of what are we expecting in terms of backlog and amortization or what have you? As you can imagine, we've done a fair amount of scenario planning to go through the year. And I don't know that there is a one scenario that we would point to as opposed to a combination of scenarios. I think you can kind of solve for that maybe not on the phone right now, with some of the information that we've provided in terms of our expectation for backlog increasing, right, for the year. And so backlog is increasing for the year, I don't think that would be reflective of us bleeding into the income statement backlog that currently exists. The components of the backlog will shift, but net-net, it's going up. Yes, I'll just come quickly on the linearity. We just wanted to make sure we open the door to have the conversation with you guys about how linearity may be a little bit different this year than what has been historically for us. And yes, you can point back to the supply chain on that. Yeah. And I think Ken touched upon that a little bit. I'll just build it out for little more clarity. If you look at more traditional, what we call secure networking products such as switches and access points, you're looking at probably something in the order of 60%, maybe two-thirds of the backlog would fit into that category, and the remainder is in FortiGate. And then Ken was making sure that we understood that. Within FortiGate, roughly one-third, the majority of that is in the entry level or low end FortiGates. We're not really experiencing the same pressure in the midrange and the high end that we see in the low end. Yeah. Hi, Ben. How are you? Ken's pointing at me, so I'll follow-up a little bit. I think in terms of pull-through of non-FortiGate products, maybe I kind of came to the conversation a few years ago thinking that that was going to be more of a commercial and mid-enterprise area where we see the quantity. In actuality, it seems to move with customer size. The SMB is somewhat limited as we still see other products attaching and building that out. And then the mid enterprise, the enterprise, and then the service providers are very strong buyers of multiple products. And I think that why that's relevant is that's the affirmation of the platform strategy. I think they very early on realized the overhead cost of managing point solutions from different vendors could be fairly onerous, and that was pretty challenging. And so it is moving its way through the rest of the customer chain, if you will. I think the other thing that's happening more currently now is we've seen -- we talk about these other verticals that represent not in the top five, but coming to the table and buying security. And I think they're very clear with us in conversations that I've had with them and Ken as well that they're looking for a total solution. And the ability to cobble together a series of integrated products into one solution. Not only does that save them in terms of the initial purchase, but also the management cost. So I do think there's definitely a tailwind in that area. Yes, I would say that I think one of the things that Ken ask us to go look at was what our product revenue growth has been if we didn't have backlog, right? And that's that kind of who knows when they call out with that point, but it was 65% or 66% product revenue growth if we had the product to deliver. I mean that's a huge number. And I think it speaks to the kind description of this is -- the demand is extremely high for appliances right now. I don't -- for 2022 versus 2021, I think we're guiding to 24% to -- I think we're guiding to basically 25% at the midpoint and just closed out a year at... 26%. I don't know that that's up. Sterling, you mind thinking about that? On the operating -- the leverage is coming through on the operating expenses. Yeah. I think that while you can look at the percentages in terms of what we're spending, I think sales productivity in the current environment is probably the biggest driver, if you will, in terms of the leverage that we get out of this. Obviously, if you go back to 2021, not a lot of sales productivity probably in 2020. With COVID, very nice sales productivity numbers in 2021. Now we're looking at tailwinds. I must be honest, the price increases will indeed increase sales productivity. Okay. Yeah, I'm looking at Ken who wants to get more strategic. I'll give you a very tactical conversation about it. And Peter is making a shameless plug for the Analyst Day in May and saying that we'll talk about that then. Look, I'm really, really pleased with what the pipeline looks like at the moment. We go through our use we've talked before, I think, Jonathan, is slicing and dicing it in terms of how much our new customers, renewals, expansions inside customers, what's the deal size? What's the geography? And it's -- I don't want to just loss over some of the numbers that we saw in the enterprise segment in the fourth quarter. I think we're at 90% growth on the G2000 for three quarters in a row. The U S. did extremely well and without getting into a lot of details, they too accelerated for three quarters in a row. Looking at the pipeline and looking at again, more enterprise growth that's coming, I think we have a good position in SMB, love the execution. We've had some people in other settings comment upon, the maturity that the sales and marketing and execution level has reached now as a company. So I think the pipeline in our ability to execute, I don't see why that would change. Thanks very much for the question. Shameless on Peter for continuing to plug... Early in the life cycle of cybersecurity industry, maybe 10 or 15 years ago, where firewalls had a very specific use and the environment, if you will, is more stable, it may be easier to identify refresh cycles that we keep looking for and have not yet seen in the last five years. And I think that's perhaps going back to Ken's point, I think that's because the environment is not stable at all. I think the reality is what you're seeing out there right now in terms of use cases and data volumes, data is all over the place -- and it's lots and lots of data. It's just getting more and more. And the use cases, I mean, five years ago, a lot of things that were air gaped away from the Internet aren't anymore. And now you see -- it's probably what's probably the manufacturing vertical for us. I just -- I don't know that you can presume that the environment, so to speak, and the political interest in it, the insurance company is interested in it, CIOs management team is interested in that. It is a hot topic of conversation. So even if you are due for a refresh cycle in the industry, and I don't know that we are, I don't think you're going to see that because of what's happening in the world out there."

Lastly, all references to growth are on a year-over-year basis, unless noted otherwise. I will now turn the call over to Ken.\nKen Xie: And thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our outstanding third quarter 2020 web result. Billings increased 42% to $164 million, exceeding our $1 billion in quarter $2 billion for the first time in Fortinet History. Global to $2000 billion growth accelerates to over 50% total revenue growth 33% to $857 million with product revenue up 51%, our highest quarterly product revenue growth since going public in November 2009, with very strong business momentum, which remains focused on growth.  According to Gartner, the negro parameter is fragmented with many security team and the tools are producing cellos. And integration best operated solution, only add to the complexity. To address this challenge, Gartner is predicting that by 2024 optimizations that adopt our separate security mesh architecture will reduce the financial impact, of the individual security incident by an average of 90%.  In a recent report, Gartner called out, Fortinet Security Fabric as a platform that offers cybersecurity mash architecture approach. Fortinet is helping customers softening the issue of capacity through our security driven networking as security fabric platform, our approach for  for the basic offers factor 10 ton most security computing power. These results in tightly integrated functionality with better performance, lower cost, and power consumption compared to agenda CPU.  Or again, late the run-up it 40 Fabry solution like email lab and end-point together with FortiGate, firewall, offers much broader protection. While you integration at a better automation than other competitive solutions. As solutions continue to consolidate towards a powerful approach. And as  secured expand to local ad a wide area network to the walk for any aware environment and to the cloud.  Fortinet is strongly positioned to significantly capture market share of our projected total addressable market of more than a $174 billion by 2025. We are confident that this trend together with our -- relented this focused on organic innovation will drive better-than-industry average long-term growth for Fortinet. Walk from anywhere is here to stay.  The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly expanded the walk for anywhere . According to Gardner, authorizations are facing a hybrid future with 75% of workers seeing their expectation for working flexibility has increased. Today, Fortinet announcement industry most completes solution to enable organization to secure and connect warfare anywhere.  Our unions fly Fortinet, broad portfolio of Aviva Trust, endpoint, and network security solution within the Fortinet security fabric. Fortinet delivers security that follows user wager on the load and home are in the office to provide enterprise grade protection and the productivity. The 2021 Gartner magic quadrant for 1AG infrastructure address announced.  Fortinet was once again named the leader, placed -- highest ability to execute at a rent number 1 for Gray mode, Wolchok in critical capability. The leadership SD-WAN, Fortinet and of our rising recently are not the expansion of their wireless and global outfront with Fortinet secure SD-WAN. The solution is designed to provide enterprise on the business market customer. Was a converged networking security solution box to secure and connect war for nowhere.  We continue to see momentum and adoption of our secure SD-WAN when 5G board SDB branch and the cloud delivered SASE solution among the worlds largest of its providers. These service providers, including AT&T, which is Ted accounting kind of foreign IKA and others. We plan to announce in the coming months before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, and farmers worldwide for their continued support on our work.\nKeith Jensen: Thank you, Ken. Let's start the more detailed Q3 discussion with revenue and the drivers for our record-setting product revenue growth. Clearly, demand is strong. Total revenue of $867 million was up 33% driven by industry-leading product revenue growth of 51%. Looking closer at the 51% product revenue growth, our highest quarterly product growth rate in 12 years as a public Company, we can point to 3 drivers.  First, the convergence of security and networking, or what we call security driven networking. Second, strong customer demand for vendor consolidation on platforms. And third, a heightened awareness of today's elevated threat landscape across a broader set of entities. Fortinet is proud to be an innovative leader in security driven networking.  With a convergence of security and networking functionality incorporated into our broad integrated and automated security fabric platform. Our security driven networking investments in Wi-Fi switching, LAN, datacenter, Cloud 5G, and enabled us to provide integrated security at networking speeds from the datacenter to end-points and to the cloud. And with our secure SD-WAN solution, security at the edges.  Today we announced a unified solution enabling organizations to secure and connect work from anywhere. The unifying our zero-trust endpoint and network security solutions. We can deliver enterprise-grade security services and threat intelligence that seamlessly follows users on the road at home and in the office.  That's for consolidation. Customers are increasingly focused on vendor consolidation, automation, and platform strategies to provide a broad, integrated, and single platform approach the security, that effectively protect from the wide range of an attack vec -- attack vectors. Our security fabric platform, provides a broad range of security products, integrated on a single operating system.  Gartner recently called out Fortinet security fabric as a platform that provides a cybersecurity mesh architecture approach, or CSMA. The cornerstone of foreign as CSMA may approach is our AC driven Florida gates, which provide on average 5 to 10 times more computing power than competitors, firewalls running on common CPU's.  They're greater computing power allows our software engineers to embed additional security functionality and integration into the operating system, enhancing our price for performance advantage. The integration extends across our suite of security fabric solutions. It consists of the complete range of form factors and delivery methods, including physical and virtual appliances, Cloud, SaaS, and perpetual software.  Those hosted in non-hosted solution. And lastly, turning to awareness, the explosion of ransomware attacks has led to a greater awareness of the need for cybersecurity technologies. According to latest global threat landscape report published by our FortiGate -- FortiGate labs. The number of unique ramps OEM -ready taxes per week increased more than ten times from July of 2020 to June of 2021.  The increase in the taxes across entities of all sizes, geographies, and industries. These 3 factors, the convergence of security and networking, the adoption of cybersecurity mash architecture, and a greater awareness with threat landscape drove record-setting product revenue growth contribute to market share gains for Fortinet.  The dramatic product revenue growth was broad-based, with FortiGate and Non-FortiGate, both posting product revenue growth rates of approximately 50%. While tilting our current revenue mix 450 basis points from higher margin services revenue to product revenue. FortiGate product revenues were driven by entry-level in high-end FortiGate product revenue growth of 60% and 57% respectively.  Non-FortiGate product revenue growth was driven by several platform products including mail, sandbox, SIM, switches, and virtual firewalls. Rounding out our revenues, we saw service revenue of $530 million up 24%. Support and related services revenue was up 26% to $243 million while security subscription services revenue was up 22% to $287 million. Turning to revenue by Geo, that summarize on Slide 5, revenue in EMEA increased 33%.  In the Americas revenue increased 29%. And APAC posted revenue growth of 43%. Moving to billings., 40 billings crossed the $1 billion threshold, for the first time in our history. At $1 billion, $64 million billings were up 42%, as enterprises responded to the expanding threat landscape. Favoring costs were performance leaders, in integrated platform or CSMA strategies.  This is especially evident across the enterprise segments, for example, in the large enterprise sector, global 2,000 billings were up 52%, with growth accelerating over the last 3 consecutive quarters. And for the second consecutive quarter, we added over 6000 new logos across all customer segments. FortiGate billings were up 39% and accounted for 70% of total billings. As shown on Slide 6, entry level on high-end FortiGate posted very strong billings growth. Non FortiGate billings were up 49%.  Driving a 1-point billings mix shift to Non-FortiGate. The top ten solutions accounted for 68% of Non-FortiGate billings and we're up 48%. The number of deals over $1 million increased over 70% to 83 deals and saw secure SD-WAN deals more than doubled to 19. Average contract term increased three months year-over-year, and one-month, quarter-over-quarter to 29 months.  The increase in contract term was driven by the significant increase in G2000 and other large enterprise deals. SD-WAN billings were up 52%, outpacing the Company's billings growth and accounted for approximately 14% of total billings to continue to receive industry accolades. For the second consecutive year, Fortinet was named a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for WAN Edge infrastructure and positioned number one for ability to execute.  For critical capabilities Fortinet SD-WAN ranked first in the small ranch WAN, security sensitive and remote work use cases. And consistent with the elevated threat environment and the breadth of ransomware and other attacks, OT billings were up 77% Moving to worldwide billings by industry verticals. Among the top five verticals, worldwide government grab the largest share with a mix of 17% and saw billings growth of 22%.  We've made investments to expand our presence and engagement with the government sector. For example, in the U.S., where we recently added retired Forestar Adam Elster  to our Board of Directors. And yesterday for net federal announced Department of Defense certification approval for an additional 26 security fabric solutions.  Internationally, we're set to over open for EPS federal government integration Innovation Center in Australia before the end of the year. Utilities, manufacturing, transportation, and construction, and other verticals that have not consistently been in our top 5, combined for billings growth of 68%.  We believe the growth of these verticals is another indicator of the broadening nature of the threat landscape, and is driving security investments in industries that may have shown less affluent security budgets, and lower internal labor resource levels. On August 31st, Fortinet acquired a controlling stake in Alexa networks. Are Japan base networking Company for approximately $64 million.  Alexa provides high-performance network switches and routers in their local market. The investment increases our total addressable market, and reflects our leadership on the convergence of networking and security. Moving back to the Income statement, product gross margin declined 220 basis points to 60.7% reflecting the consolidation of  results and a change in our product mix.  Product cost increases associated with supply chain constraints were largely offset by our pricing actions. Services gross margins decreased 150 basis points to 86.6% due to Alexa and costs associated with expansion of our datacenter footprint. The 25.8% operating margin was 30 basis points above the top end of our guidance.  Despite pressure from lower gross margins and higher marketing expenses, primarily from the foreign net championship, , or event. Headcount increased 20% to 9,700, moving to the same, the cash flow summarize on Slide 78, free cash flow was $330 million representing a margin of 38%. Free cash flow benefited from strong billings, growth in good billings, linearity. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow margin was 41.5%.  We repurchased approximately 370,000 shares of our common stock for a total cost of 109 million at an average price per share of $2.94. The board increased the share repurchase authorization by 1.25 billion and extended the expiration date of February 2023. The remaining repurchase authorization is approximately $2 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $3.4 billion.  Inventory turns increased to 2.9 times from 2.7 times in the second -- from the second quarter 2021. Reflecting strong product sales in the quarter, answers and some supply chain pressure. DSO's at 63 days returned to pre -pandemic levels. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $69 million, including a payment for the new campus building of $13 million. As we noted in our last earnings call, we've pivoted our capital expenditures strategy to include building out our facilities and operations infrastructure to support our accelerating growth.  We estimate fourth quarter capital expenditures to between $170 and $190 million investments in our future facilities and operations infrastructure account for the sequential increase in CapEx. Before providing guidance, I'd like to comment on the supply chain, the consumer widely publicized, that the rapidly changing macroeconomic environment is causing disruption in global supply chains for companies of all sizes, and industries.  We expect the worldwide supply chain constraints will present evolving challenges in the fourth quarter, and into 2022. The supply chain issues have proven to be extremely dynamic. And like to pause here to acknowledge and thank each member of our operations team, for their truly outstanding performance.  With regards to pricing, we believe we entered this space with a harder and reputation of being able to provide customers excellent price for performance or value. We believe we can leverage this reputation to largely offset our increased cost. We believe our pricing actions have been met with understanding by our customers, as evidenced by our Q3 results, and strong pipeline growth. We view the current situation as our supply challenge, not to demand challenge.  Now I'd like to review our outlook for the fourth quarter summarized on Slide nine, which is subject to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. The following guidance reflects our best efforts estimate the supply chain impact. For the fourth quarter, we expect billings in the range of 1 billion to 165 million to one billion, 215 million.  Revenue in the range of 940 million to 970 million. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75 to 76%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 27 to 28%, which includes an estimated 200 basis point headwind from acquisitions, foreign exchange, and increased travel and marketing costs. Non-GAAP earnings-per-share were $1.10 to $1.15, which assumes a share count of between 168 and 170 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 21%.  Based on our very strong third quarter performance, and the upside I just provided for the fourth-quarter expectations, we are once again raising our 2021 guidance. We expect billings in the range of $4.40 billion to $4.90 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of approximate 31.5%. Revenue in the range of $3.320 billion to $3.350 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 28.5%.  Total service revenue in the range of $2.80 billion to $2.90 billion, which represents growth of 24% and applies full-year product revenue growth at 36%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 76.5% to 77.5%, non-GAAP operating margin of 25.5% to 26.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.85 to $3.85. This assumes a share count of between 167 and 169 million. We expect our Non-GAAP tax rate to be 21% We expect cash taxes to be approximately 130 million, which includes a $47 million tax payment made in the fourth quarter. Along with Ken, I'd like to thank our partners, our customers, and all members of the Fortinet team for all their hard work, execution and outstanding success. I will now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A.\nPeter Zarkowski: As a reminder, during the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question to allow others to participate. Eli (ph), please open up the call for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. . For your first question, we have Brian Essex from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nBrian Essex: Great. Good afternoon. And thank you for taking the question and congrats on some really nice results this quarter. I guess, Keith, you spent some extra time talking about the supply chain and it's certainly the most frequent question I've gotten from investors, particularly over the past three weeks.  So could you maybe help us understand, what kind of headwind you're quantifying or accounting for in your 4Q guide? Where you might see risks in the supply chain? And then, what you might be seeing from peers, particularly where you may be benefiting from having supply where your peers may not have product?\nKeith Jensen: Thanks Brian and I don't know that anybody knows all the answers to the questions that you articulated at all. You thought I'll give you some color as well. I think we saw a little bit of supply chain pressure in the second -- in the third quarters I alluded to, but obviously the number's nothing that was terribly noteworthy.  I do think the guidance that we've given for the fourth quarter is appropriately conservative, if you will, in terms of what we see for supply chain or what we would call backlog in the fourth quarter. I think we feel good about the guidance that we've given. I think the -- if you look at the general tone and what we're hearing from our operations team. I think there is sometime in the third quarter where every day was very dynamic with them.  With people calling and them having to scramble about component matters and contract manufacturing commitments or what have you. I'm hearing less about that at this point, that's probably very early on. I would also offer that, the backlog or supply chain first appears for us in some of the fabric products, the Non-FortiGate. And I think that'll continue on a little bit into the fourth quarter.  And probably also gets -- before it gets to some extent in the fourth quarter as well. Getting out to 2022, I think everybody is kind of in the same boat and trying to understand when we're actually going to see something to tell you real market improvement -- mark improvement. And I think we'll probably hold back commenting on that for the next several months until we get closer providing guidance for that, for the next year.\nKen Xie: Brian is a 10  I feel we are little bit better position compare to competitor. First, it's why we have the quantity much louder than our competitor. We are probably like a 3x compared to the fiscal on a unit shipment, maybe  pulled out of some other, which gave us better negotiation power be similar to supply, and also will manage all these more directly compared our competitor  some sort of party.  that's given us better visibility and also can act quicker earlier. Second, we have quite a broad product line. Bolstering the FortiGate and also NAMA FortiGate is an easier for our customer to go to the next line of products has a similar performance and then all running the FortiOS in FortiOS. So it's a more easy to use in some different product to sell better some of their product shortage.  And also, we have a great team -- operation side. And the same time, we have a culture more than less than a long term both on their inventories and market sales compared to our competitor. To me, some even   5, 10, 15 years ago, we tend to keep some more trade to me customer urgent needs. So that's actually been for that supply chain issue.\nBrian Essex: Great. Thank you very much. On our Peter's request for just one question and step back in the queue.\nOperator: Next we have Tal Liani from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nTal Liani: Hey guys, you're killing me with this one question thing. I want to focus on the most important part, which is the growth acceleration. Your revenue -- your product revenue growth, went from 25% to 41% to 51% in the last 3 quarters. And your billing growth, went from 14% to 35% to 42%, it's just a major acceleration.  And the question is, can you identify the key areas? I know that a lot of areas are growing, but when you look at material areas, meaning that the most -- the highest contribution to the growth acceleration. What are the key areas? Can you share with us the key areas, where you see the highest growth in terms of dollars? And can you also give us an update on SD-WAN specifically? Thanks.\nKen Xie: As you can see, both of FortiGate and also Non-FortiGate, all revenue growth like, 50%. FortiGate is small really to -- because like, a whether the internal SEC communications to protect all these read somewhere or go to the when I stick us, you went.  And also the Non-FortiGate more tied to the story, the fabric Fortinet security fabric, which is also Gartner sat in promoting the core cybersecurity mash architecture, which can reduce the financial costs of our single event by legacy, 90%. I think that this falls contributor for the gross, like a key said. And also some vendor consolidation, we see some smaller vendors starting got weaker and weaker. So we do see some market share gain here also.\nTal Liani: Okay? And when you look at 2022 and I know you don't provide guidance, but when you look forward, do you see the same drivers continuing to support the growth acceleration or how do you deal with these high targets next year?\nKen Xie: We do see this trend it's not slowed down. Well last for probably a few years. What are we close security driven network in our secure fabric, which really we're helping the enterprise or service provider to look at better security and the customer obviously. So far be back see anything slowed down. We feel we're well positioned to keeping gaining market share.\nKeith Jensen: I would just echo what Ken said Tal for -- but I think the threat landscape as a hot topic of conversation in all quarters of other world have seen right now. And it doesn't seem like that's going to abate anytime soon. I think the needs -- what can and team have built here with the body security and network -- networking speeds is critical.  But I think also this platform of our gardeners now call it, calling the mesh architecture -- cybersecurity mesh architecture, I think consistent with partners all the reports about, the percentage of companies we are looking for consolidation, I think Ken's commented on that, and how that's going to continue to increase it. It's certainly seemed to those tailwinds, are poised to continue to exist as we get into 2022\nTal Liani: Great, thanks.\nOperator: Our next we have Shaul Eyal from Cowen. Your line is now open.\nShaul Eyal: Thank you. Congrats on the performance and guidance, guys. Keith, that Federal vertical had a good performance. Was it just typical of third quarter of government seasonality? Or do you see that sustainable -- as sustainable buoying forward, given your recent investments, so within this vertical?\nKeith Jensen: Keep in mind for us, the government is a worldwide name when we talk about it. So it includes some U.S. Federal, international governments, also state and local governments, etc. It has been a very strong vertical of ours for well over a year, if not 2 years now. And I certainly don't see any reason that just on that basis that it was slowed down.  And I think if you overlay that with investments that, Ken and team are now making, particularly as it relates to the U.S. Federal team. I think there's some opportunities for us is to explore and exploit hopefully as we move forward.\nShaul Eyal: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next we have Michael Turits from KeyBanc. Your line is now open.\nMichael Turits: Hey, guys, some drill down on the FortiGate side and really understand. The purchasing has taken place and for what is good to see, I would think that we are modernizing datacenters, or is datacenter expansion? Is it displacements? And again, surprising perhaps considering the move to Cloud. So just drill down on the physical Bahram slashed quarter gate side.\nKeith Jensen: I think what we're -- and I hate to give compliments to my peers. But I think what we're really seeing here is really starting execution from the sales team. I think we came into this conversation and feeling that we had a very strong product suite. But I think the sales team has done a stellar job. And we talked to them about the same question you just asked me. Whereas if coming from?  I can hear and then the confidence and when it comes to Display's website. There's certainly no competitor that, they're afraid off. I can -- I can hear them articulate back the platform strategy, the land and the expand strategy. I can see them using some of the tools and products and technologies that, we've invested in -- invested in them.  And they're leveraging them, I think very successfully. So I -- going with a question going back, I think that, Tal have asked about, and we used this term before, a rising tide lifting all boats. And I think, we saw that in the quarter. There wasn't a weak geography, there wasn't a weak -- a weak product sweep, and I think everybody performed very strongly.\nKen Xie: Yes. Keith is the global to solving, growing over 58% and also the last , is  made like an active year before. In some peak end up price in some service provider set in paying off.\nMichael Turits: Yes, I think it's the same question, so hopefully not too, but I'm just trying to figure out, of course, execution and competition doing well that way. But where are we in terms of people just buying stuff to put in datacenter is when we're really in a cloud mode here. Is it because of a refresh, or why we've seen that investment?\nKen Xie: I think it's all claims to all like the long-term ASIC strategy which add a lot of performance and the more function, and the same time cost lower, and then low  also. That's where the security setting expands inside a data center inside Company, internal network, and also the wan side.  I see 1 5G. We also see a lot of driving for that end goal. So it's really selling expense for the whole infrastructures instead are traditionally just security Internet border. So that's how the much people total addressable market sometime because secure driven networking. But it's really a most suspended market and has smart strong security.\nMichael Turits: Thanks guys.\nOperator: Next we have Sterling Auty from JP Morgan. Your line is now open.\nSterling Auty: Yes. Thanks. Hi guys. The ongoing asked my 1 question is an extension of what Michael was just talking about. I'm curious as you look at the growth in the quarter, even if it's qualitative, can you help characterize for us how much of that growth is coming from actual displacement of solutions, both traditional cybersecurity and networking, versus how much of that growth is coming from existing customers, buying additional expansion. An additional product is just a build-out the handle their growth needs.\nKeith Jensen: I think the metric I would give is 6,000 new logos. I think that, I'm going to go back and say, I mean, the  the execution was very strong across-the-board. Did we -- was there penetration, greater penetration in our installed base of customers? Absolutely. No doubt about it.  But at the same time, that's two quarters back-to-back now that we've added 6,000 new logos, and I know some of those are small enterprises. But we're getting the at-bats that we've always coveted. And I think coming with more at-bats, I think you were seeing stronger execution as well.\nKen Xie: Also, the existing customers keep expanding . Something like security plus structure approach, like adding to one side, I see 1 5G and also expand with the internal segmentation and Wi - Fi security data center security. So that's what I can boast about. I do see probably maybe more come from the cost keeping expanding their security infrastructure.\nSterling Auty: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Next we have Rob Owens from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nRob Owens: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I'll pivot a little bit from Sterling and ask about G2K specifically, and what is driving the strength in G2K billings. Is that products related, is it just better distribution relationships that are getting you into these accounts and who do you think share is coming from in this market? Thanks.\nKeith Jensen: I think the -- I would give a general comment in terms of where -- who is the market share gainers and who are the market share donors? I don't think there'll be any surprises. I've actually -- the mentioned names in terms of, who I thought those were. In terms of distribution, I think when you get in, particularly in the U.S. market with a large enterprise focused distributors, you've got a -- as a Company, you've got to invest in time and bring opportunities to them and demonstrate that, you have a superior product, a superior offering.  And I think that, the team has done the heavy lifting on that. And I do believe that, we are getting more momentum, if you will, from those large U.S. distributors that, maybe we did not have previously. So I think there's some of that. And then I think we've continued to invest in both the sales and the marketing. We knew all along for several years now that, we needed to improve our coverage in terms of  accounts that we're assigned to wraps.  And the people that we're bringing in from outside and that, maybe had more of an enterprise experience unless of a channel experience, etc. So I do think that all those things have combined and are demonstrating the success, as you pointed out, G2000 growth at over 52% and accelerated for the last three quarters.\nRob Owens: Thank you.\nOperator: All right. Now we have Hamza Fodderwala from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nHamza Fodderwala: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I'm going to keep it to one question. But just on the OT side, you talked about that growing 77% this quarter. I think those are the first-time you mentioned that product specifically. Just curious, can you give us any rough sense of how material that's becoming to your overall billings and what's been driving that in more recent quarters?\nKeith Jensen: I think it's not as big as SD-WAN but growing faster. But also, I don't think we're -- I think that it's reached a point, if you will in terms of size that we're comfortable and we think its worthwhile making sure that we share with people outside the Company with those growth levels. If you combine SD-WAN and an OT together as a percentage of billings, you're going to get to something. I think that's over 20% of our total billings.\nHamza Fodderwala: Thank you.\nOperator: Next we have Adam Morgens from Stifel. Your line is now open.\nAdam Morgens: Hey guys and thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe just for Ken, so back at September, you guys signed a partnership with Linksys around securing work from home environments and segmenting corporate and personal networks. And I know one of your competitors also announced a similar idea.  So how should we think about the idea of securing home networks and effectively the whole becoming extension of a branch office of one and the opportunity to do that as we live in this work from anywhere world going forward? Thanks so much.\nKen Xie: It's a new market. It has a lot of potential supporting work from anywhere. That's where we partnered with LNG sales and which has down in home networking area for quite a while. And we do believe it's a -- eventually a lot of reasons if it's all these IOT are modest in connect online.  And also a lot of our workforce and school from  is kind of since there at all when neither Security, which we combined with the network security while endpoint security and also the clouds amount SASE. So we do feel it's a big long-term potential. But as it's a not quite. I mean that -- the business actually ramp up quickly, but it's an eventually will contribute more revenue for the Company.\nAdam Morgens: Great, thanks so much.\nKen Xie: Thank you.\nOperator: And next we have Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Your line is now open.\nJonathan Ho: Hi, good afternoon. Congrats on the strong results. Just wanted to, I guess, understand a little bit better the dynamics around the price increases to your base. Can you give us a sense of the magnitude or impact of the quarter from those increases? And is there a potential for that to stick even beyond some of these supply chain challenges? Thank you.\nKen Xie: Yes. We work carefully increase the price based on how cost increase, which also supporting by some our partner and at the same time. Because we have much better performance price ratio, and also more function, especially on the 40-k side. So we do feel we have more room to address by some of the price, and still, customers do like the product. So soon probably we do some price increase. And we'll just offset the cost increase. And we'll get margin back online.\nKeith Jensen: I would add to that, Jonathan, the -- one of the metrics that we look at in the third quarter, which is our ability to hold the line of the price increases, which were largely effective on August 1st. I'd say largely because you have to give notice to your channel partners, which is appropriate. And you can imagine them taking certain actions to get orders in the 1st month of the quarter, if you will.  So it gets a little bit distorted that way. But we do look at our ASPs and wanting to make sure and are discounting that, we're not giving back that price increase, if you will. And overall, I think the headline is that, we think we were on the direct product line. I think it was secretive to the margin in the quarter.  And I emphasize the direct, because as volatile as it is, predicting things like expedite fees and sometimes, freight prayed as well, can come into that line. So I think overall, when you factor in direct and indirect, we're probably in a wash for the quarter.\nJonathan Ho: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Next we have a Gray Powell from BTIG your line is now open.\nGray Powell: Great, thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the good numbers. So yeah, within your Non-FortiGate billings, can you roughly give us a sense as to how much is related to appliances versus software and Cloud? And then how should we think about supply chain issues potentially impacting Non-FortiGate in Q4?\nKeith Jensen: Yeah. I think the Non-FortiGate mix is something on the order of about -- we talked about this before, something we were at 30% to 40% of that is Cloud or software. And the remainder will be a hardware form factor. As I mentioned in the call, I think the first place that we saw supply chain pressure in this third quarter, was in non-FortiGate, more specifically around switches and access points.\nGray Powell: Got it. That's helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Next we have Andrew Niwinski from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nAndrew Niwinski: Great. Thank you and congrats on a great quarter. I want to ask about the high-end, that was certainly better than expected. I think over 37% of your FortiGate sales, which looks like it was the highest level of spend in at least the last two years. Can you talk about the drivers of the high-end? And whether the 5G rollouts in your leadership position in the carrier market might be contributing to that?\nKen Xie: Yeah. The big enterprise, the Global 2000 that contributes some high-end growth. And also on the product we have fresh  And I think in the last 1 to 2 years, we also refresh a higher-end. You've seen the latest ASIC for MPS -7, which has have 5 x better performances and more function compared with the previous MP6, which I see the high-end we probably were scratched like, maybe 80% of the  is already. So that's also we said in benefit some of these refresh we made in the last 1 to 2 years.\nAndrew Niwinski: No contribution from the 5G carrier-class customers there? There's more on the enterprise?\nKen Xie: There's some contribution from SD-WAN. But it's the 5G steering the ramp up stage. I don't see much, but I do see the huge potential.\nAndrew Niwinski: Super. Thank you.\nKen Xie: Thank you.\nOperator: And next we have Irvin Liu from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nIrvin Liu: Hi, thanks for the question. This question is for either Ken or Keith. You have the opportunity to meet with several customers and partners along with new prospects that, you\u2019re first of its kind Security Summit, that's the place that you're sponsored PGA Fortinet championship event. Can you just talk about whether you're seeing -- what you're seeing from a customer traction perspective, post the event. And perhaps if the event had led to a notable uptick in visibility and mindshare among customers.\nKeith Jensen: I think the head of marketing asked that question. But it's a good question.\nKen Xie: It's probably one of the biggest marketing investments we have been made, but definitely see Barb worse except for advance will result. A lot of customer and a lot of pun that, really appreciate all these -- fully that champing PGA had a beer.  And also we using it as a platform to bring different customer upon altogether, to share, communicate their experience and also to the training education. And so we do see this is already helping a lot of the marketing sales  we have and also generate a lot of  put in this way. Is more successful event.\nKeith Jensen: I would come over the topic and completely echo, and what Ken had to say. I've just -- I'm shocked at how enthusiastic I am about how that event came out. Whether we look at, what we call whitespace names that, we got from, say SMP 500. The percentage of attendees that were non-customers, and it was sit with us on one-to-one sessions and hear more about our story and the household names that were there, it was fantastic.  I think the branding with the marketing team pulled together with that, together with Silverado Country Club, was extremely successful. And I think also, it goes back to some of the comments we made earlier in the conversation. I think it was -- it really struck Fortinet at the right time in terms of its call its maturity, right? I think that the team here was, really in a good position to execute against that.  I was in a customer meeting yesterday here in Sunnyvale, with a very large Company that come to the event. And so it was a follow-up. And there have been other very large companies that have come to our ABC events here in Sunnyvale. And just in the first month and a half after the event, I'm just really impressed with what the guys did. Guys and ladies between.\nIrvin Liu: Got it. Thanks for the color.\nKeith Jensen: Yeah\nOperator:  Next we have Keith Bachman from BMO. Your line is now open.\nKeith Bachman: Thank you very much. I was -- wanted to direct this towards Keith. Keith, as you think about the billings guide, what you're suggesting EBITDA high-end, the billings' sequential growth would be about 13% in the past 2 years, you've grown billing sequentially, about 28%. So obviously a little less on the guide. I'm just wondering if you could just give us some color or thoughts around that.  And in particular, is that a reflection of -- was there any kind of pull in that you think about on the billings, were customers concerned about not getting product? And/or is it reflecting some of the concerns you previously mentioned about are we going to have enough of the supply chain availability or product availability I should say. And therefore, we might need to tamp down a little bit in Q4. And then I have a follow-up if I could, because Peter told me I'm allowed to ask a follow-up.\nKeith Jensen: Again. Look, I think what you're seeing there is supply chain. And as I said earlier in the conversation, that I think they -- we've been appropriately conservative, I hope, in terms of how we guided to it. To unpack that, just a little bit, we do with our sales team, and we manage things on a bookings basis with them. And then we put that up against what we have the ability to ship.  If I look at just the bookings number and we had a long internal conversation about whether or not that's a metric that we should provide in this time and decided not to. But if we look at just the bookings number, I would say that, it's a very strong indicator that the business is extremely healthy, if you will.  In terms of customer buying behavior there's always somebody getting in line early, if you will. That they have longer-term deployment or what have you. That's not new and maybe a little bit of it in the third quarter, no deal is over $10 million or they are the largest deal with probably seven or eight or something like that in the quarter.  We have seen in the fourth-quarter things where customers I'd say they are getting line orders. They've got deployments where our plans for deploying in 2022. And they want to make sure that, they're trying to time, when they are actually going to need the product and when the product is going to be available. So I have seen early in the quarter, a few companies exhibiting that behavior.\nKeith Bachman: We're hearing that a little bit from the channel, not the lead times, because they're getting out, customers are ordering early in more. But it sounds like what you're saying, essentially you are concerned about maybe the billings number reflects some -- you might not be able to make all shipment demand and so that's reflected in the quarter from -- I hope I'm not putting words in your mouth.\nKeith Jensen: No, absolutely. I think that would be a very prudent thing to say, with the supply train environment that we're in, I'm not just going to take the -- I can't just take the absolute booking number to shift, but I think there's been a fair amount of internal work around that if you will, now, on the other side, it does give us more predict more predictability as we come into 2022 of this behavior continues. So we've had in the past.  Backlog or bookings has not been something that -- Ford as a Company has really had reason or cause to talk about. And I don't know that as of today that we do. But as we get further into the fourth quarter and then moving into 2022, that maybe something that because of the predictability that it helps with, we may be talking about that next year.\nKeith Bachman: Okay. And my Peter -sanctioned second question then, is if you talk a little bit about the non-FortiGate mix. And I know you mentioned that in one of the previous questions, but how do you see that changing over the course of the next couple of quarters, if at all? And I'm not really talking about a supply chain constraint, but just on demand related pools.  As customers may look as they're deploying that incremental 6,000 customers and greater penetration on your existing -- do you see the software side moving up, if you will, in the non-FortiGate component. And then I will cede the floor. Thank you.\nKen Xie: That's where what do we call Fabry on mash. We see put his strong demand from a customer and we both increased the amount repurchase also the customer about that anything new multiple products, Fabry are matched solution. So that's where we Canadian few hall restaurant growth sound non-op 40-k. And Also we said we'll can be assemblies provide a carrier on the SaaS east and modest solution. You eventually will also benefit broader customer base.\nKeith Bachman: Okay. All right. Many thanks and congratulations for the incredible results.\nKen Xie: Thank you.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. That concludes the Q&A session. I will now turn the call back to Peter Zarkowski for closing remarks.\nPeter Zarkowski: Thank you, Eli. I would like to. Thanks everyone for joining the call today. I know you have a lot of calls this evening. Really appreciate your time.

            "name": "Ken Xie",
            "content": "And thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our outstanding third quarter 2020 web result. Billings increased 42% to $164 million, exceeding our $1 billion in quarter $2 billion for the first time in Fortinet History. Global to $2000 billion growth accelerates to over 50% total revenue growth 33% to $857 million with product revenue up 51%, our highest quarterly product revenue growth since going public in November 2009, with very strong business momentum, which remains focused on growth.  According to Gartner, the negro parameter is fragmented with many security team and the tools are producing cellos. And integration best operated solution, only add to the complexity. To address this challenge, Gartner is predicting that by 2024 optimizations that adopt our separate security mesh architecture will reduce the financial impact, of the individual security incident by an average of 90%.  In a recent report, Gartner called out, Fortinet Security Fabric as a platform that offers cybersecurity mash architecture approach. Fortinet is helping customers softening the issue of capacity through our security driven networking as security fabric platform, our approach for  for the basic offers factor 10 ton most security computing power. These results in tightly integrated functionality with better performance, lower cost, and power consumption compared to agenda CPU.  Or again, late the run-up it 40 Fabry solution like email lab and end-point together with FortiGate, firewall, offers much broader protection. While you integration at a better automation than other competitive solutions. As solutions continue to consolidate towards a powerful approach. And as  secured expand to local ad a wide area network to the walk for any aware environment and to the cloud.  Fortinet is strongly positioned to significantly capture market share of our projected total addressable market of more than a $174 billion by 2025. We are confident that this trend together with our -- relented this focused on organic innovation will drive better-than-industry average long-term growth for Fortinet. Walk from anywhere is here to stay.  The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly expanded the walk for anywhere . According to Gardner, authorizations are facing a hybrid future with 75% of workers seeing their expectation for working flexibility has increased. Today, Fortinet announcement industry most completes solution to enable organization to secure and connect warfare anywhere.  Our unions fly Fortinet, broad portfolio of Aviva Trust, endpoint, and network security solution within the Fortinet security fabric. Fortinet delivers security that follows user wager on the load and home are in the office to provide enterprise grade protection and the productivity. The 2021 Gartner magic quadrant for 1AG infrastructure address announced.  Fortinet was once again named the leader, placed -- highest ability to execute at a rent number 1 for Gray mode, Wolchok in critical capability. The leadership SD-WAN, Fortinet and of our rising recently are not the expansion of their wireless and global outfront with Fortinet secure SD-WAN. The solution is designed to provide enterprise on the business market customer. Was a converged networking security solution box to secure and connect war for nowhere.  We continue to see momentum and adoption of our secure SD-WAN when 5G board SDB branch and the cloud delivered SASE solution among the worlds largest of its providers. These service providers, including AT&T, which is Ted accounting kind of foreign IKA and others. We plan to announce in the coming months before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, and farmers worldwide for their continued support on our work. Brian is a 10  I feel we are little bit better position compare to competitor. First, it's why we have the quantity much louder than our competitor. We are probably like a 3x compared to the fiscal on a unit shipment, maybe  pulled out of some other, which gave us better negotiation power be similar to supply, and also will manage all these more directly compared our competitor  some sort of party.  that's given us better visibility and also can act quicker earlier. Second, we have quite a broad product line. Bolstering the FortiGate and also NAMA FortiGate is an easier for our customer to go to the next line of products has a similar performance and then all running the FortiOS in FortiOS. So it's a more easy to use in some different product to sell better some of their product shortage.  And also, we have a great team -- operation side. And the same time, we have a culture more than less than a long term both on their inventories and market sales compared to our competitor. To me, some even   5, 10, 15 years ago, we tend to keep some more trade to me customer urgent needs. So that's actually been for that supply chain issue. As you can see, both of FortiGate and also Non-FortiGate, all revenue growth like, 50%. FortiGate is small really to -- because like, a whether the internal SEC communications to protect all these read somewhere or go to the when I stick us, you went.  And also the Non-FortiGate more tied to the story, the fabric Fortinet security fabric, which is also Gartner sat in promoting the core cybersecurity mash architecture, which can reduce the financial costs of our single event by legacy, 90%. I think that this falls contributor for the gross, like a key said. And also some vendor consolidation, we see some smaller vendors starting got weaker and weaker. So we do see some market share gain here also. We do see this trend it's not slowed down. Well last for probably a few years. What are we close security driven network in our secure fabric, which really we're helping the enterprise or service provider to look at better security and the customer obviously. So far be back see anything slowed down. We feel we're well positioned to keeping gaining market share. Yes. Keith is the global to solving, growing over 58% and also the last , is  made like an active year before. In some peak end up price in some service provider set in paying off. I think it's all claims to all like the long-term ASIC strategy which add a lot of performance and the more function, and the same time cost lower, and then low  also. That's where the security setting expands inside a data center inside Company, internal network, and also the wan side.  I see 1 5G. We also see a lot of driving for that end goal.

Also, the existing customers keep expanding . Something like security plus structure approach, like adding to one side, I see 1 5G and also expand with the internal segmentation and Wi - Fi security data center security. So that's what I can boast about. I do see probably maybe more come from the cost keeping expanding their security infrastructure. It's a new market. It has a lot of potential supporting work from anywhere. That's where we partnered with LNG sales and which has down in home networking area for quite a while. And we do believe it's a -- eventually a lot of reasons if it's all these IOT are modest in connect online.  And also a lot of our workforce and school from  is kind of since there at all when neither Security, which we combined with the network security while endpoint security and also the clouds amount SASE. So we do feel it's a big long-term potential. But as it's a not quite. I mean that -- the business actually ramp up quickly, but it's an eventually will contribute more revenue for the Company. Thank you. Yes. We work carefully increase the price based on how cost increase, which also supporting by some our partner and at the same time. Because we have much better performance price ratio, and also more function, especially on the 40-k side. So we do feel we have more room to address by some of the price, and still, customers do like the product. So soon probably we do some price increase. And we'll just offset the cost increase. And we'll get margin back online. Yeah. The big enterprise, the Global 2000 that contributes some high-end growth. And also on the product we have fresh  And I think in the last 1 to 2 years, we also refresh a higher-end.

            "name": "Keith Jensen",
            "content": "Thank you, Ken. Let's start the more detailed Q3 discussion with revenue and the drivers for our record-setting product revenue growth. Clearly, demand is strong. Total revenue of $867 million was up 33% driven by industry-leading product revenue growth of 51%. Looking closer at the 51% product revenue growth, our highest quarterly product growth rate in 12 years as a public Company, we can point to 3 drivers.  First, the convergence of security and networking, or what we call security driven networking. Second, strong customer demand for vendor consolidation on platforms. And third, a heightened awareness of today's elevated threat landscape across a broader set of entities. Fortinet is proud to be an innovative leader in security driven networking.  With a convergence of security and networking functionality incorporated into our broad integrated and automated security fabric platform. Our security driven networking investments in Wi-Fi switching, LAN, datacenter, Cloud 5G, and enabled us to provide integrated security at networking speeds from the datacenter to end-points and to the cloud. And with our secure SD-WAN solution, security at the edges.  Today we announced a unified solution enabling organizations to secure and connect work from anywhere. The unifying our zero-trust endpoint and network security solutions. We can deliver enterprise-grade security services and threat intelligence that seamlessly follows users on the road at home and in the office.  That's for consolidation. Customers are increasingly focused on vendor consolidation, automation, and platform strategies to provide a broad, integrated, and single platform approach the security, that effectively protect from the wide range of an attack vec -- attack vectors. Our security fabric platform, provides a broad range of security products, integrated on a single operating system.  Gartner recently called out Fortinet security fabric as a platform that provides a cybersecurity mesh architecture approach, or CSMA. The cornerstone of foreign as CSMA may approach is our AC driven Florida gates, which provide on average 5 to 10 times more computing power than competitors, firewalls running on common CPU's.  They're greater computing power allows our software engineers to embed additional security functionality and integration into the operating system, enhancing our price for performance advantage. The integration extends across our suite of security fabric solutions. It consists of the complete range of form factors and delivery methods, including physical and virtual appliances, Cloud, SaaS, and perpetual software.  Those hosted in non-hosted solution. And lastly, turning to awareness, the explosion of ransomware attacks has led to a greater awareness of the need for cybersecurity technologies. According to latest global threat landscape report published by our FortiGate -- FortiGate labs. The number of unique ramps OEM -ready taxes per week increased more than ten times from July of 2020 to June of 2021.  The increase in the taxes across entities of all sizes, geographies, and industries. These 3 factors, the convergence of security and networking, the adoption of cybersecurity mash architecture, and a greater awareness with threat landscape drove record-setting product revenue growth contribute to market share gains for Fortinet.  The dramatic product revenue growth was broad-based, with FortiGate and Non-FortiGate, both posting product revenue growth rates of approximately 50%. While tilting our current revenue mix 450 basis points from higher margin services revenue to product revenue. FortiGate product revenues were driven by entry-level in high-end FortiGate product revenue growth of 60% and 57% respectively.  Non-FortiGate product revenue growth was driven by several platform products including mail, sandbox, SIM, switches, and virtual firewalls. Rounding out our revenues, we saw service revenue of $530 million up 24%. Support and related services revenue was up 26% to $243 million while security subscription services revenue was up 22% to $287 million. Turning to revenue by Geo, that summarize on Slide 5, revenue in EMEA increased 33%.  In the Americas revenue increased 29%. And APAC posted revenue growth of 43%. Moving to billings., 40 billings crossed the $1 billion threshold, for the first time in our history. At $1 billion, $64 million billings were up 42%, as enterprises responded to the expanding threat landscape. Favoring costs were performance leaders, in integrated platform or CSMA strategies.  This is especially evident across the enterprise segments, for example, in the large enterprise sector, global 2,000 billings were up 52%, with growth accelerating over the last 3 consecutive quarters. And for the second consecutive quarter, we added over 6000 new logos across all customer segments. FortiGate billings were up 39% and accounted for 70% of total billings. As shown on Slide 6, entry level on high-end FortiGate posted very strong billings growth. Non FortiGate billings were up 49%.  Driving a 1-point billings mix shift to Non-FortiGate. The top ten solutions accounted for 68% of Non-FortiGate billings and we're up 48%. The number of deals over $1 million increased over 70% to 83 deals and saw secure SD-WAN deals more than doubled to 19. Average contract term increased three months year-over-year, and one-month, quarter-over-quarter to 29 months.  The increase in contract term was driven by the significant increase in G2000 and other large enterprise deals. SD-WAN billings were up 52%, outpacing the Company's billings growth and accounted for approximately 14% of total billings to continue to receive industry accolades. For the second consecutive year, Fortinet was named a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for WAN Edge infrastructure and positioned number one for ability to execute.  For critical capabilities Fortinet SD-WAN ranked first in the small ranch WAN, security sensitive and remote work use cases. And consistent with the elevated threat environment and the breadth of ransomware and other attacks, OT billings were up 77% Moving to worldwide billings by industry verticals. Among the top five verticals, worldwide government grab the largest share with a mix of 17% and saw billings growth of 22%.  We've made investments to expand our presence and engagement with the government sector. For example, in the U.S., where we recently added retired Forestar Adam Elster  to our Board of Directors. And yesterday for net federal announced Department of Defense certification approval for an additional 26 security fabric solutions.  Internationally, we're set to over open for EPS federal government integration Innovation Center in Australia before the end of the year. Utilities, manufacturing, transportation, and construction, and other verticals that have not consistently been in our top 5, combined for billings growth of 68%.  We believe the growth of these verticals is another indicator of the broadening nature of the threat landscape, and is driving security investments in industries that may have shown less affluent security budgets, and lower internal labor resource levels. On August 31st, Fortinet acquired a controlling stake in Alexa networks. Are Japan base networking Company for approximately $64 million.  Alexa provides high-performance network switches and routers in their local market. The investment increases our total addressable market, and reflects our leadership on the convergence of networking and security. Moving back to the Income statement, product gross margin declined 220 basis points to 60.7% reflecting the consolidation of  results and a change in our product mix.  Product cost increases associated with supply chain constraints were largely offset by our pricing actions. Services gross margins decreased 150 basis points to 86.6% due to Alexa and costs associated with expansion of our datacenter footprint. The 25.8% operating margin was 30 basis points above the top end of our guidance.  Despite pressure from lower gross margins and higher marketing expenses, primarily from the foreign net championship, , or event. Headcount increased 20% to 9,700, moving to the same, the cash flow summarize on Slide 78, free cash flow was $330 million representing a margin of 38%. Free cash flow benefited from strong billings, growth in good billings, linearity. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow margin was 41.5%.  We repurchased approximately 370,000 shares of our common stock for a total cost of 109 million at an average price per share of $2.94. The board increased the share repurchase authorization by 1.25 billion and extended the expiration date of February 2023. The remaining repurchase authorization is approximately $2 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $3.4 billion.  Inventory turns increased to 2.9 times from 2.7 times in the second -- from the second quarter 2021. Reflecting strong product sales in the quarter, answers and some supply chain pressure. DSO's at 63 days returned to pre -pandemic levels. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $69 million, including a payment for the new campus building of $13 million. As we noted in our last earnings call, we've pivoted our capital expenditures strategy to include building out our facilities and operations infrastructure to support our accelerating growth.  We estimate fourth quarter capital expenditures to between $170 and $190 million investments in our future facilities and operations infrastructure account for the sequential increase in CapEx. Before providing guidance, I'd like to comment on the supply chain, the consumer widely publicized, that the rapidly changing macroeconomic environment is causing disruption in global supply chains for companies of all sizes, and industries.  We expect the worldwide supply chain constraints will present evolving challenges in the fourth quarter, and into 2022. The supply chain issues have proven to be extremely dynamic. And like to pause here to acknowledge and thank each member of our operations team, for their truly outstanding performance.  With regards to pricing, we believe we entered this space with a harder and reputation of being able to provide customers excellent price for performance or value. We believe we can leverage this reputation to largely offset our increased cost. We believe our pricing actions have been met with understanding by our customers, as evidenced by our Q3 results, and strong pipeline growth. We view the current situation as our supply challenge, not to demand challenge.  Now I'd like to review our outlook for the fourth quarter summarized on Slide nine, which is subject to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. The following guidance reflects our best efforts estimate the supply chain impact. For the fourth quarter, we expect billings in the range of 1 billion to 165 million to one billion, 215 million.  Revenue in the range of 940 million to 970 million. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75 to 76%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 27 to 28%, which includes an estimated 200 basis point headwind from acquisitions, foreign exchange, and increased travel and marketing costs. Non-GAAP earnings-per-share were $1.10 to $1.15, which assumes a share count of between 168 and 170 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 21%.  Based on our very strong third quarter performance, and the upside I just provided for the fourth-quarter expectations, we are once again raising our 2021 guidance. We expect billings in the range of $4.40 billion to $4.90 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of approximate 31.5%. Revenue in the range of $3.320 billion to $3.350 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 28.5%.  Total service revenue in the range of $2.80 billion to $2.90 billion, which represents growth of 24% and applies full-year product revenue growth at 36%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 76.5% to 77.5%, non-GAAP operating margin of 25.5% to 26.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.85 to $3.85. This assumes a share count of between 167 and 169 million. We expect our Non-GAAP tax rate to be 21% We expect cash taxes to be approximately 130 million, which includes a $47 million tax payment made in the fourth quarter. Along with Ken, I'd like to thank our partners, our customers, and all members of the Fortinet team for all their hard work, execution and outstanding success. I will now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A. Thanks Brian and I don't know that anybody knows all the answers to the questions that you articulated at all. You thought I'll give you some color as well. I think we saw a little bit of supply chain pressure in the second -- in the third quarters I alluded to, but obviously the number's nothing that was terribly noteworthy.  I do think the guidance that we've given for the fourth quarter is appropriately conservative, if you will, in terms of what we see for supply chain or what we would call backlog in the fourth quarter. I think we feel good about the guidance that we've given. I think the -- if you look at the general tone and what we're hearing from our operations team. I think there is sometime in the third quarter where every day was very dynamic with them.  With people calling and them having to scramble about component matters and contract manufacturing commitments or what have you. I'm hearing less about that at this point, that's probably very early on. I would also offer that, the backlog or supply chain first appears for us in some of the fabric products, the Non-FortiGate. And I think that'll continue on a little bit into the fourth quarter.  And probably also gets -- before it gets to some extent in the fourth quarter as well. Getting out to 2022, I think everybody is kind of in the same boat and trying to understand when we're actually going to see something to tell you real market improvement -- mark improvement. And I think we'll probably hold back commenting on that for the next several months until we get closer providing guidance for that, for the next year. I would just echo what Ken said Tal for -- but I think the threat landscape as a hot topic of conversation in all quarters of other world have seen right now. And it doesn't seem like that's going to abate anytime soon. I think the needs -- what can and team have built here with the body security and network -- networking speeds is critical.  But I think also this platform of our gardeners now call it, calling the mesh architecture -- cybersecurity mesh architecture, I think consistent with partners all the reports about, the percentage of companies we are looking for consolidation, I think Ken's commented on that, and how that's going to continue to increase it. It's certainly seemed to those tailwinds, are poised to continue to exist as we get into 2022 Keep in mind for us, the government is a worldwide name when we talk about it. So it includes some U.S. Federal, international governments, also state and local governments, etc. It has been a very strong vertical of ours for well over a year, if not 2 years now. And I certainly don't see any reason that just on that basis that it was slowed down.  And I think if you overlay that with investments that, Ken and team are now making, particularly as it relates to the U.S. Federal team. I think there's some opportunities for us is to explore and exploit hopefully as we move forward. I think what we're -- and I hate to give compliments to my peers. But I think what we're really seeing here is really starting execution from the sales team. I think we came into this conversation and feeling that we had a very strong product suite. But I think the sales team has done a stellar job. And we talked to them about the same question you just asked me. Whereas if coming from?  I can hear and then the confidence and when it comes to Display's website. There's certainly no competitor that, they're afraid off. I can -- I can hear them articulate back the platform strategy, the land and the expand strategy. I can see them using some of the tools and products and technologies that, we've invested in -- invested in them.  And they're leveraging them, I think very successfully. So I -- going with a question going back, I think that, Tal have asked about, and we used this term before, a rising tide lifting all boats. And I think, we saw that in the quarter. There wasn't a weak geography, there wasn't a weak -- a weak product sweep, and I think everybody performed very strongly. I think the metric I would give is 6,000 new logos. I think that, I'm going to go back and say, I mean, the  the execution was very strong across-the-board. Did we -- was there penetration, greater penetration in our installed base of customers? Absolutely. No doubt about it.  But at the same time, that's two quarters back-to-back now that we've added 6,000 new logos, and I know some of those are small enterprises. But we're getting the at-bats that we've always coveted. And I think coming with more at-bats, I think you were seeing stronger execution as well. I think the -- I would give a general comment in terms of where -- who is the market share gainers and who are the market share donors? I don't think there'll be any surprises. I've actually -- the mentioned names in terms of, who I thought those were. In terms of distribution, I think when you get in, particularly in the U.S. market with a large enterprise focused distributors, you've got a -- as a Company, you've got to invest in time and bring opportunities to them and demonstrate that, you have a superior product, a superior offering.  And I think that, the team has done the heavy lifting on that. And I do believe that, we are getting more momentum, if you will, from those large U.S. distributors that, maybe we did not have previously. So I think there's some of that. And then I think we've continued to invest in both the sales and the marketing. We knew all along for several years now that, we needed to improve our coverage in terms of  accounts that we're assigned to wraps.  And the people that we're bringing in from outside and that, maybe had more of an enterprise experience unless of a channel experience, etc. So I do think that all those things have combined and are demonstrating the success, as you pointed out, G2000 growth at over 52% and accelerated for the last three quarters. I think it's not as big as SD-WAN but growing faster. But also, I don't think we're -- I think that it's reached a point, if you will in terms of size that we're comfortable and we think its worthwhile making sure that we share with people outside the Company with those growth levels. If you combine SD-WAN and an OT together as a percentage of billings, you're going to get to something. I think that's over 20% of our total billings. I would add to that, Jonathan, the -- one of the metrics that we look at in the third quarter, which is our ability to hold the line of the price increases, which were largely effective on August 1st. I'd say largely because you have to give notice to your channel partners, which is appropriate. And you can imagine them taking certain actions to get orders in the 1st month of the quarter, if you will.  So it gets a little bit distorted that way. But we do look at our ASPs and wanting to make sure and are discounting that, we're not giving back that price increase, if you will. And overall, I think the headline is that, we think we were on the direct product line. I think it was secretive to the margin in the quarter.  And I emphasize the direct, because as volatile as it is, predicting things like expedite fees and sometimes, freight prayed as well, can come into that line. So I think overall, when you factor in direct and indirect, we're probably in a wash for the quarter. Yeah. I think the Non-FortiGate mix is something on the order of about -- we talked about this before, something we were at 30% to 40% of that is Cloud or software. And the remainder will be a hardware form factor. As I mentioned in the call, I think the first place that we saw supply chain pressure in this third quarter, was in non-FortiGate, more specifically around switches and access points. I think the head of marketing asked that question. But it's a good question. I would come over the topic and completely echo, and what Ken had to say. I've just -- I'm shocked at how enthusiastic I am about how that event came out. Whether we look at, what we call whitespace names that, we got from, say SMP 500. The percentage of attendees that were non-customers, and it was sit with us on one-to-one sessions and hear more about our story and the household names that were there, it was fantastic.  I think the branding with the marketing team pulled together with that, together with Silverado Country Club, was extremely successful. And I think also, it goes back to some of the comments we made earlier in the conversation. I think it was -- it really struck Fortinet at the right time in terms of its call its maturity, right? I think that the team here was, really in a good position to execute against that.  I was in a customer meeting yesterday here in Sunnyvale, with a very large Company that come to the event. And so it was a follow-up. And there have been other very large companies that have come to our ABC events here in Sunnyvale. And just in the first month and a half after the event, I'm just really impressed with what the guys did. Guys and ladies between. Yeah Again. Look, I think what you're seeing there is supply chain. And as I said earlier in the conversation, that I think they -- we've been appropriately conservative, I hope, in terms of how we guided to it. To unpack that, just a little bit, we do with our sales team, and we manage things on a bookings basis with them. And then we put that up against what we have the ability to ship.  If I look at just the bookings number and we had a long internal conversation about whether or not that's a metric that we should provide in this time and decided not to. But if we look at just the bookings number, I would say that, it's a very strong indicator that the business is extremely healthy, if you will.  In terms of customer buying behavior there's always somebody getting in line early, if you will. That they have longer-term deployment or what have you. That's not new and maybe a little bit of it in the third quarter, no deal is over $10 million or they are the largest deal with probably seven or eight or something like that in the quarter.  We have seen in the fourth-quarter things where customers I'd say they are getting line orders. They've got deployments where our plans for deploying in 2022. And they want to make sure that, they're trying to time, when they are actually going to need the product and when the product is going to be available. So I have seen early in the quarter, a few companies exhibiting that behavior. No, absolutely. I think that would be a very prudent thing to say, with the supply train environment that we're in, I'm not just going to take the -- I can't just take the absolute booking number to shift, but I think there's been a fair amount of internal work around that if you will, now, on the other side, it does give us more predict more predictability as we come into 2022 of this behavior continues. So we've had in the past.  Backlog or bookings has not been something that -- Ford as a Company has really had reason or cause to talk about. And I don't know that as of today that we do. But as we get further into the fourth quarter and then moving into 2022, that maybe something that because of the predictability that it helps with, we may be talking about that next year."

I will now turn the call over to Ken.\nKen Xie: Thanks, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our outstanding second quarter 2021 results. Billings increased 35% to $961 million, driven by solid execution and was the best it has been since 2015. Secure SD-WAN contributed 14% of second quarter billings. Total revenue grew 70% to $801 million with product revenue up 41%. Product revenue growth was the highest for nearly 10 years. Free cash flow was $395 million a quarterly level. With strong business momentum we remain focused on growth. Today we have announced expansion of our FortiCare and FortiGuard security services, adding a new security service called FortiTrust. FortiTrust security service offer user base licensing that follow the user across the organizations and high security platform. This enables organizations to easily manage and secure across all networks, endpoint and cloud, which traditionally has been siloded [ph]. Initial service level have been offered for Zero-Trust Network Access, and identity modifications. We have the current FortiCare security services which cover all Fortinet security fabric product with two-level services to include 24 x 7 technical support and timely insurance revolution. Additionally, FortiGuard security service has been [indiscernible] for different segment with added individual services for enterprise found those for commercial and the packages for SMB. Not only just an industry leading AI enabled security [indiscernible] that is regularly adjust protection across the FortiGuard security fabric. Today we announced a new FortiGate - 100F the industry's first high performance next generation firewall, with [indiscernible] Zero-Trust network access and advanced number of protection powered by the Fortinet NP7 [indiscernible] SPU the sigaoffers an average two times more performance than other competitive products based on our security [indiscernible]. These make the full apps the best protection for high speed internal network [indiscernible] centers.

Lastly, Fortinet has named Google Cloud's 2020 Security Partner of the Year, recognized for innovative thinking, outstanding customer service, and benefiting process of a car product and services. Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employee, customer and partners worldwide for their continuous support on our work.\nKeith Jensen: Thank you, Ken. And to add to your comments, we should note that as of the prior quarter, billings growth, product revenue growth and total revenue growth, all accelerated sequentially. In fact, all three growth rates were five-year Fortinet highs and product revenue growth was at its highest in over nine years. Okay let's drive through more detailed Q2 discussion with revenue. Total revenue of $801 million was up 30% driven by industry leading product revenue growth of 41%. The product revenue growth was broad based across geographies, FortiGate and non- FortiGate products, and across the use cases, illustrating market acceptance and customer demand through our integrated, single platform security fabric strategy across our customer infrastructures. Our financial strategy includes a rule of 40 target. The target the total of the revenue growth percentage and operating margin to be at least 40 and the second quarter strong demand and execution drove this actual total to be a rule of 55. FortiGate product revenue growth was 40%, while we continue to see robust growth from our secure SD-WAN functionality. Majority of the growth was driven by FortiGate revenue from other capabilities which are embedded in the FortiGate operating system. Non- FortiGate product revenue growth was over 40% for the second consecutive quarter and was driven by strong growth from our integrated security fabric products. One additional comment on our product revenue growth, the product revenue growth was a reflection of our continued strong organic growth and not the result of a few large deals, drawing down backlog, nor unusual number of delayed transactions from the prior quarter or pulled in from future periods. Service revenue of $503 million was up 24%. Support from related services revenue of $230 million was up 26%, while security subscription services revenue of $273 million was up 23%. Moving to the mix of FortiGate and Non-FortiGate platform revenue, FortiGate product and services revenue increased 26% driven by very strong demand for both branch and high-end FortiGate products. High end products included 10 NP7 powered FortiGates models, representing approximately 25% of high-end FortiGate shipments. Our ASIC driven FortiGates give customers five to ten times more computing power than firewalls running on common CPUs. The advanced computing power creates additional speed and capacity to continue to add functionality to our operating system, further driving our price for performance advantage. The combination of the ASIC advantage and the common operating system across products, can enable vendor consolidation, lowering total cost of ownership, and increasing automation. Non-FortiGate products and services revenue grew 39% and accounted for approximately 30% of total revenue, up over two percentage points. The integrated security fabric consists of a complete range, [indiscernible], bit of a reversal for our advanced meeting later on today folks, so you've got an inside scoop on what Patricia is going to say. Let me start again if I may. Non- FortiGate product and services revenue grew 39% and accounted for approximately 30% of total revenue for over 2 percentage points. The Integrated Security fabric consists of a complete range of form factors, and delivery methods, including physical and virtual appliances, cloud, SaaS and professional software, as well as hosted and non-hosted solutions. Together they provide a range of security solutions and form factors, enabling integrated protection for the hybrid environments, and the expanding digital attack surface from network data centers to endpoints to the cloud. Let's turn to revenue by geo. To summarize, on Slide 5, revenue in EMEA increased 34%. The Americas revenue increased to 29% and APAC posted revenue growth of 24%. Product revenue growth for both the Americas and EMEA regions was over 40%. Moving to billings. Second quarter billings were $961 million up 35%. We saw a strong growth in both the FortiGate and non-FortiGate segment of the Security Fabric platform. The FortiGate segment delivered billings growth of over 30%, accounting for 71% of total billings. As shown on Slide 6, branch and high end FortiGates posted very strong billings growth. The non-FortiGate segment accounted for over 29% of total billings and delivered billings growth of over 45%, driving a 2-point mix shift to non-FortiGate products and services. Given the continued strong performance, we believe our non-FortiGate platform is on a pace to be a $1 billion business this year. Secure SD-WAN billings represented 14% of total billings, and is a key functionality for an integrated SASE solution. In terms of Billings by geo, EMEA outperformed all geos, followed by the Americas and APAC. Europe had a very good quarter and growth in the Americas was driven by the United States, which was up sequentially by more than 30 percentage points. Latin America continued to recover from the pandemic induced slowdown, posting billings growth in the mid 20s for the second consecutive quarter. The average contract term was approximately 28 months, up two months from the second quarter of 2020 and one month in the first quarter of 2021. Deals of over $1 million increased from 59 to 79, and the pipeline for deals over $1 million continues to look good for the remainder of the year. Secure SD-WAN deals over $1 million increased from 13 to 19. Moving to worldwide billings by industry verticals. Billings by vertical illustrate the diversification in our business model, and importantly, suggest the current threat landscape is driving security investments in industries that may have historically shown lower investment levels. For example, the verticals that have historically not been in our top-five combined for billings growth of over 75%. Service providers accounted for 14% of total billings and were up 25%. Moving now to the income statement, product revenue growth of 41% drove a 3-point shift in the product and services revenue mix and along with it a gross margin decrease of 160 basis points to 77.5%. Product gross margin improved to 70 basis points to 61.7%. Services gross margin decreased 160 basis points to 86.9%, with datacenter investments and FX accounted for about 100 basis points of the impact. Operating margin of 25.4% was at the top end of the guidance range. Despite a 350 basis point headwind from the gross margin decline, a weaker US dollar, and increased travel and marketing event cost. We ended the quarter with a total headcount of 9043, an increase of 17%. Moving to the statement of cash flow summarized on Slide 7 and 8. Free cash flow for the second quarter came in at a quarterly record of $395 million benefiting from strong revenue growth, good month one linearity and lower capital expenditures. For the quarter, we repurchased approximately 455,000 shares of common stock for a total cost of $92 million, and an average share price of approximately $201. The remaining share repurchase authorization at the end of the second quarter was $921 million, with the authorization set to expire at the end of February 2022. We ended the first half of the year with total cash and investments of $3.4 billion, an increase of $1.7 billion. The increase includes the proceeds from our $1 billion investment grade debt issuance during the first quarter of 2021. DSO's returned to pre-pandemic levels, decreasing seven days year-over-year, and 15 days quarter-over-quarter to 66 days. Inventory turns increased to 2.7 times from 2.2 times, reflecting strong product sales in the quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $24 million and we have started to move into the new Sunnyvale building. We estimate third quarter capital expenditures to between $65 and $75 million, which includes a $30 million payment for the new campus building. We estimate 2021 capital expenditures to be between $175, and $200 million. With the acceleration of the growth and a little more understanding of the post pandemic work patterns, we are turning our attention to reviewing our facilities footprint, and the needed office and warehouse capacity in the U.S. and Canada. As we work through this process it is possible that our estimated capital expenditures for the next few quarters will increase as we prepare for the next phase of our growth. Looking forward, our goal remains to balance growth and profitability. Given the growth opportunities that we believe I had, we continue to expect to tilt our bias within this framework, more towards growth for at least the next several quarters. The opportunities we see are supported by a strong pipeline, increased sales effectiveness, the growing success of the single integrated security platform strategy, and the convergence of security and networking, the response of the current threat environment, and our development efforts which include continuing to invest in our ASIC advantage which enables a shared operating system across the Security Fabric platform, drives our price for performance advantage, increased the capacity to add features and functions while maintaining price points. And now I'll give your outlook for third quarter summarized on Slide 9 which is subject to disclaimers regarding forward looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the third quarter we expect billings in the range of $940 million to $960 million, revenue in the range of $800 million to $815 million, non-GAAP gross margin of $77.5 to 78.5%, non-GAAP operating margin of 24.5% to 25.5%. This includes an estimated 200 basis point headwind from foreign exchange and the increased travel and marketing costs, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.90 to $0.95, which assumes a share count of between $169 million and $171 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 21%. With that, we are raising our 2021 guidance and expect billings in the range of $3.870 billion to $3.920 billon, which at the midpoint represents growth of approximately 26%. Revenue in the range of $3.210 billion to $3.250 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of approximately 24.5%. Total service revenue in the range of $2.045 billion to $2.075 billion, which represents growth of approximate 23% and implies full year product revenue growth of approximately 28%. Non-GAAP gross margin is 77% to 79%. Non-GAAP operating margins of 25% to 27%, which includes an estimated 200 basis point headwind from foreign exchange and increased travel and marketing cost. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.75 to $3.90, which assumes a share count of between 168 million and 170 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 21%. We expect cash taxes to be approximately $90 million. Along with Ken, I'd like to thank our partners, customers, and the Fortinet team for all their hard work, execution, and outstanding success in the first half of 2021. I'll now hand the call back over to Peter, for the Q&A session. Hey Pete, operator Kathryn we are ready to open the call for questions please.\nOperator: Sure. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Brian Essex of Goldman Sachs. Sir, please go ahead.\nBrian Essex: Great, thank you for taking the quarter and guys congratulations on the results, really nice set of results this quarter. Maybe to start off Ken, I know you've talked in three years about not having exposure to final [ph] refresh cycles within your business. Could you maybe unpack a little bit the product revenue performance? Are you starting to see perhaps some exposure to the refresh cycles of others? Is this more rip and replace infrastructure upgrades or expansions? Maybe if you can maybe give us a little bit of an understanding of what's going on behind the product revenue growth this quarter?\nKen Xie: Yes, thanks Brian, good question. I have said the industry whether during the pandemic, after the pandemic probably in some kind of a whole structure changing is no longer the traditional border kind of firewall will be enough. You have to expand into the WAN like security WAN the 5G and also internal have to do maybe internal segmentation replacing the switch with secure switch and the Wi-Fi to program now it is kind of a [indiscernible] kind of internal attack. So that's where and also consolidation also going on and also maybe have a [indiscernible] make a different powerful structure security together to protect the whole attack more to kind of attacks everywhere protection there. So that's where we will see is a big change for the whole architecture of how to architect a new protection architecture to protect the whole infrastructure security there. So that's probably different than the actually fresher traditional firewall that is the new expanding infrastructure need to be have our own protection there. So that's what we see like the program we announced today, [indiscernible] inside the high speed mobile environment to do all these kind of internal segmentation, [indiscernible] protection and all these kind of things. And then also we see very strong growth whether the secure C-band and also the 5G [indiscernible] and that's to have lot of [indiscernible] work on phone solution there. That's what is doing probably even much faster there. So maybe this is the whole infrastructure being changed. [Indiscernible] now working started coming more [indiscernible] by the boost on the price and also different kind of vertical.\nBrian Essex: Got it, that's super helpful. Maybe to followup, service provider was slightly lower as a percentage of revenue this quarter. I understand that on the product revenue side and the high end you saw lot better growth, but it is, should we think about that segment particularly to the extent that they might be selling through for SASE or you might be getting better traction with OPAQ. Howe should we think about growth in the service provider market, is that still to come or is that a more stable kind of mid 20s grower segment for you? d\nKen Xie: I think in the ramp up stage, in the early stage of ramp up, compared to last quarter probably like down about 15 percentage, this quarter grew about 25%. So it is [indiscernible] like dimension, they are kind of building infrastructure right here for the 5G, [indiscernible] and now SASE, which we have a different strategy or faster strategy actually quite a different, probably very different from our other player. And so we have a new strategy and we are [indiscernible] and are working with service provider to build in their SASE at the same time like the service revenue we will be kind of low to margin that will be there. Also we have seen some own infrastructure, if some customer don\u2019t have a service provider or want to working without them that we also have a kind of own kind of SASE solution there, which is also in the grade with the -- for the OS, inside for the OS, they have a building SASE they trust no access and some other part. They could also come in a different, there is no competitor and eventually they also hoped they can use ASIC plus data to additional continued power to our kind of own SASE solution there. So that's where we feel is a long term investment, but once we have it, we have a huge advantage compared to other competitors.\nBrian Essex: All right, that's helpful color. Thank you very much and congrats again.\nKen Xie: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Hamza Fodderwala of Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.\nHamza Fodderwala: Hey guys, thank you for taking my question. I had a followup regarding the prior question on some of the drivers of product revenue growth. So Ken, as the customers are coming back into the office or as we move into this more hybrid work environment, and you talked a lot about these larger network transformation deals. I was wondering what do you see the pipeline looking like or those larger deals heading into the back half and beyond? And do you think that some of the things that we saw in the past 12 to 18 months is going to be an accelerant for those more larger and infrastructure type deals?\nKen Xie: You know, we see the pipeline were strong for the larger multiple products deal, which like approach, I mean covered multiple part of infrastructure and also the product only grows like 41% is also very strong. We feel that all products we have different than the traditional are some of our competitors are using the [indiscernible] only. So we have the latest in the industry, but also we developed ASIC in the last 21 years. Just like the product we announced today, the -- based on our [indiscernible] we call it [indiscernible] region, but for the same cost was the function, performance compare to other competitor of industry average, so will have six time better performance basically like a -- because the competing part is huge from our own ASIC. And so that's what's changing the landscape of like the product what is now a security product or some other leverage basic is a huge [indiscernible] power gave us much better function and a better performance that can hugely replace a lot of our competitors. At the same time, we did see the expansion product as per market whether it will be from home or kind of a security internal work inside the company inside a data center which also plan lot of high end product loss, so the hybrid product [indiscernible] also we see public putting high maybe the highest in the last few quarters and even last few years.\nHamza Fodderwala: All right, that's helpful. And maybe just a followup question for Keith or Ken. Now Keith you mentioned the operating margin in the back half having about a 200 basis point impact from FX. I was just wondering just on your spending plans around hiring what you're seeing there, it's obviously a very competitive market for talent these days and I'm wondering if that's been factored all into your guidance?\nKeith Jensen: Yes, I think we obviously pay attention to our recruiting and to our attrition rates. I think the metric that we gave was that our overall headcount increased 17%. I would offer that the sales headcount actually grew significantly more than that. So I think that we're in a bit of a sweet spot and it kind of relates to what Ken was saying just a moment ago in terms of the success that we're having and I think you could read through to the high end FortiGates was probably being data center deployments and probably taking advantage of some competitors that are going through a refresh cycle and at the same time some of the branch FortiGates maybe [indiscernible] visual transformation. And I think that the audience of sales people understand that and they see the opportunities there.\nHamza Fodderwala: Thank you.\nOperator: And sir, our next question is from Sterling Auty of JP Morgan. You may go ahead.\nSterling Auty: Yes, thanks guys. For my one question, I just wanted to dive into Keith, in your prepared remarks you made the comment that the majority of growth was driven by FortiGate revenue from other capabilities embedded in the operating system. I wondered if you could kind of peel back the onion there? What does that mean and what capabilities were you referring to that were in particular demand in the quarter?\nKeith Jensen: Yes, I think that we tried to make the point in the past that some people think about the firewall somewhat complicically. We found a track close to 12 to 15 different firewall use cases. Well if you want to talk about micro segmentation, IPS, et cetera, all of those, the totality of those, the growth there was contributed more if you will than SD-WAN. SD-WAN we saw still obviously contributed very nicely at 14% of our total billings, which probably puts it close about 35%, or probably 55% growth. So I think there's a long list of things that a firewall is use for and we were very pleased with the success that we saw throughout that suite of offerings.\nKen Xie: Also, especially the Forti [indiscernible], your beauty and your cosmetic access, and the beauty of SASE there we see strong interest in this area. Both found a service provider for enterprise by working on a solution there.\nSterling Auty: Understood. Thank you.\nKen Xie: Thank you,\nOperator: And sir, our next question is from Rob Owens of Piper Sandler. You may go ahead.\nRob Owens: Great, like thank you guys for taking my question and following the lead of Mr. Auty, I'd like to ask one question. Could you elaborate a little bit on your commentary around some of these non-traditional verticals that are starting to tick up meaningfully in spend, is this more one time in nature or these verticals were just starting to wake up to some of the security issues that we're reading about in the media every day? And to that and maybe you could comment a little bit around your OT success and your strategy there? Thanks.\nKeith Jensen: Yes, and then Rob, I think you did a very good job of laying all the dots to connect there. We're talking, we're looking at industries or verticals, such as manufacturing, transportation, energy utilities, or what have you. And to see the dramatic growth that we saw in that segment of business. We have, we've historically talked about our top-five, financial services, government service provider, tech, and retail, and they've been very consistent about that 65% to 66%, but we saw a significant shift this quarter. To those others, that was just the sheer growth that we saw on those others. And the point that you alluded toOT, OT performed very, very strongly in the quarter. And I think that's consistent with what we saw that vertical growth in those other verticals that I just mentioned.\nRob Owens: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Shaul Eyal of Cowen and Company. You may go ahead.\nShaul Eyal: Thank you. Also, single question on my end. When we look at the billing upside, revenue upside you've printed, can you unpack for us the mix between your logos and the current installed base? Any qualitative color and discussion will be appreciated.\nKeith Jensen: Yes, this Shaul is Keith. New logos were very strong in the quarter, probably up about 50% year-over-year. And I've given numbers in the past to kind of suggest that 5000 customers that we had the quarter, obviously a very strong quarter is going to be north of that first part of the response. Second part response, you would not normally expect to see that the new customers in the initial quarter would be significant contributors to revenue, but rather contributors to revenue growth over the longer period of time. But there was a very strong performance from the new logo segment in terms of customers have signed up with us in the quarter.\nShaul Eyal: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Saket Kalia of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSaket Kalia: Okay, great. Hey, thanks for taking my question here. Ken, maybe for you, you touched on this a little bit in your prepared remarks, but can you just talk a little bit about the new pricing options that you announced recently? Specifically, do you feel like there is demand for that per user pricing for kind of access to the broader FortiCare and FortiGuard portfolio and what sort of what was sort of some of the early feedback as you may be tested those options?\nKen Xie: We do see going forward, especially like works from now remotely. The producer license which can cover multiple devices, including the mobile home device, work for home, and also internal inside enterprise company there like a cover multiple, like a not just a 40-K that goes through to the trust network access, but also some other like a web or mail or some other application or kind of a compiler infrastructure data center, they need access. So that per user license will make much easier for the user for the customer to really use in all these security servers in a multiple part infrastructure module cover multiple product there. So that's where we feel this is also very important part. And on top of the current FortiCare, we certainly would cover all the parts that we have and also the FortiGuard cover the product need a real time update on the subscription, all these kind of things there. So we feel this FortiTrust is probably the trend in the future, but still needs some time to ramp up. Especially we see the deal trust member access setting have a pretty quick growth opportunity with which we are fully paid out to have all this built in. And also the identity how to like, kind of make sure the identity across multiparty infrastructure and easily kind of management user we feel all these two services also kind of don't get very important. It needs some time ramp up, but we do see there's a huge increase and demand in front of customer. That is also the reason we launched this new FortiTrust service.\nSaket Kalia: Got it. Thank you.\nKen Xie: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question, sir, from Michael Turits of KeyBanc. You may go ahead.\nMichael Turits: Hey, everybody, a huge quarter of course. I think for both Keith and for Ken, a lot of people have been circling around and trying to understand the strength and the upside. But I just would like to just try to compare where the demand was last year, in 2020, to where it is this year. And why it seems so much stronger. Has there been a shift, say from remote access focus to more breach or what has changed both qualitatively and quantitatively that we're seeing this acceleration?\nKen Xie: Last year, the probably more like in the rush supporting whatever can make it work in working remotely. But this year, they did definitely see the infrastructure need to be upgraded to be changed to more supporting this long-term. So that's where we see a lot of new infrastructure design and how to supporting not just work remotely, but also secure the whole infrastructure, different part of the infrastructure from their own when access to their internal segmentation. And also even the 5G or I see my own internal Wi-Fi. So there's a lot of new security architecture covering multiple part of product is more of a strong interest. And also Keith mentioned the OT is a moderate because the whether the 5g IoT OT, also that's also rather strong.\nKeith Jensen: Yes, Mike, I think I agree with Ken completely. And maybe just to add, if you think back about Q2 2020, specifically, at least for us, it was a quarter that was characterized probably by a lot of software. We did very well with our software in the second quarter last year. But on the flip side, anything that requires somebody to be on premise in a data center or taking on a large deployment or phased deployment or something like that, Q2 of last year, there really wasn't much of that. Obviously today, I think it's a year later, it's a very, very different environment in that regard. And I do think you're also seeing the threat environment and things like the OT, part of the business do very, very well.\nMichael Turits: Great, thanks guys.\nOperator: Our next question from Jonathan Ho of William Blair. You may ask your question.\nJonathan Ho: Hi, good afternoon. I just wanted to understand if you're running into any issues around the supply chain or potential chipset shortages. And does this lead to any potential impact to your order cadences at all?\nKeith Jensen: I'd love to say that we're completely immune to chip shortages and such, but I can't say that. I do think that as we talked about last quarter, the fact that our inventory turns we run, hover around to, suggested that we have six months of inventory on hand. We do and then some of the chip manufacturers are pretty focused on a 52 week lead time. I think I feel very, very good about how the manufacturing operations team executed in the second quarter and how they're going about things for the third quarter for the rest of this year. I would offer that as part of the forecasting process and the guidance setting process. That has become a more significant input, if you will, into that process and making sure that we've accounted for it in terms of our estimates of any challenges that we may have was moved through the rest of the year.\nJonathan Ho: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ben Bollin of Cleveland Research. Sir, you may go ahead.\nBen Bollin: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Ken, historically, when there are periods like this, where you see accelerated purchase behavior and a little bit of a one on supply, if you will, inevitably there's a bit of a digestion period after the fact, as customers learn how to deploy and consume what they just purchased. Could you talk a little bit about how fabric in the broader organization, either in sales or the channel is addressing or thinking about that potential risk into the future?\nKen Xie: Yes, we definitely see more and more customers to the benefit of the fabric, call it fabric which on multiple products, I think we make with ultimate together. So that's also making the Non-FortiGate grow faster than the FortiGate will be over a billion dollar, over a simple do a billion dollar this year. And so it is a customer, buy this multiple product most of them already, like whether they are our customer or already test them on the pod, and then just keep expanding beyond the what's the initial purchase there. So we do see the interest get stronger and stronger and the Non-FortiGate also keeping flow much faster than the FortiGate, which keep expanding from whatever the current installation base within the big enterprise. That's also the Gartner forecast. They see the integration, the consolidation starting kind of more and more important for these big enterprise because to manage multiple products from different vendors, much higher cost compared to like, that the platform approach, which can multiple products have a different part of infrastructure also using it quite often to guide at least the FortiGate fabric that we have.\nKeith Jensen: This is Keith and just kind of to build on Ken's comment, I think that is the business strategy, right? If we look at our installed base of customers and see how their adoption progresses in terms of the number of fabric products that they add, over what period of time, we will certainly expect that to continue on. And then if you look in the current quarter, the new customers that we added, those are largely, those are buying firewalls, if you will, and maybe one or two things, if you will from the fabric suite. But we would expect them I guess I understand they have to digest and install the firewalls. But as we get as they get to know and understand our product and our integration strategy more and more, that we'll have the opportunity to come back in and sell them additional products and services as we go forward.\nBen Bollin: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question from Gray Powell of BTIG. You may now ask your question.\nGray Powell: Okay, great, thanks. Yes, so I'd like to stick with the, the topic of Non-FortiGate and fabric and cloud and just sort of the strength that you've been seeing there. Within fabric and cloud, what are like the biggest product components that have the -- that have the most momentum? And then how should we think about just the sustainability of that demand longer term?\nKen Xie: The Non-FortiGate, we have almost 30 products, most of them are developed internally and it's super [indiscernible] now gave up. I mean, individual product, because it is up and down quarterly, and also pretty much all contribute to the growth, we don't see any one or two too much kind of often compared with others. So that's probably maybe some time later, we can start I guess sorting things out. But at this stage, we do see, it's also dependent on a customer environment, depends on the sales support in, like some of them like have a e-mail working with FortiGate, some with website, some is employing, some is -- like access control, or some kind of sandboxing. And all cloud approach is a quite a white collar job or kind of even cover all these as like a 2020 product. So that's where it was difficult to break out and then try to see the trend, but we do see that the compliment is really to consolidate, integrate, automate approach, definitely has a huge benefit compared to our separate products from different vendors.\nGray Powell: Got it. That's, that's really helpful. Thank you very much, and congratulations on the great results.\nKen Xie: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question is from Adam Tindle of Raymond James. You may now ask your question.\nAdam Tindle: Okay, thank you. I wanted to ask a strategic question to Ken. You had record quarterly free cash flow. So Keith's doing a core job at managing that more efficient balance Keith you talked about at the Analyst Day. But all joking aside, Ken, you've got significant liquidity available both on the balance sheet and can imagine lenders beating down your door. So if you could double click on the key tech areas that you would consider to enhance the value proposition, I would just imagine that SASE is accelerating or the SD-WAN leader, for example, some of those secure web gateway players in the private markets are more mature and would that be an area of consideration or any other key areas that you would consider enhancing the value proposition inorganically? Thank you.\nKen Xie: Yes, we definitely keeping closely watching out of the chain in the industry, and also new technology auditions. But also we want to keep the innovation, not the culture we have in the last 21 years and also keep the organic growth was strong. Probably the cash level investment strategy to Keith to cover that.\nKeith Jensen: Yes, I think for us, we look at our R&D spending as a source of investment, not a traditional capital allocation. But we are have historically been a buy versus permanent build versus buy company. And that is to, we feel strongly about the importance of having the platform to be integrated. You do see us doing tuck-in acquisitions, sometimes they take a little bit longer to bring to market perhaps because the technologies are things that we want to work with a little bit more before we bring them out. So I don't think that's a surprise. I don't know that precludes us from doing something larger in the future, but we'll look at those opportunities as they come up. The continuing focus will be take finding the opportunities to rebalance the balance sheet with a little bit of deploying some of the cash we raised the debt offering perhaps repurchase some, some share buyback, if you will. And at the same time also, as we look out for the next three to five years, and we anticipate continued growth, perhaps a little more investment, if you will, in our facilities footprint.\nAdam Tindle: That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Irvin Liu of Evercore ISI. Sir, you may go ahead.\nIrvin Liu: Hi, thanks for letting me on. And I would also like to add my congratulations on the great quarter. I had a question on SD-WAN. I was wondering if you can perhaps unpack some of the drivers behind the continued momentum here, whether the current hybrid work environment has been a contributor behind this strength? And can you help us understand what workers gradually returning to offices means for you?\nKen Xie: Irvin, good question. There are a few more and we still see more of our strong demand and also huge potential. That our product we have Integrated Security from our beginning leverage to FortiGate has a huge computing power. Part of what - FortiGate, we see a huge advantage compared to some other competitor whether using the universal CPU or some other approach, which difficult at any function because the company implementation for a low cost CPU. So that's where we do believe we will be the leader, the number one leader in IT one space size, now definitely will be strong. And [indiscernible] it will offer a kind of huge advantage, like availability, the cost saving compared to the traditional networking protocol MPLS, or some other part. And also a lot of service provider also starting kind of most focus on their IP where no 5g some other part, we used to also kind of fit in all kind of long-term bigger picture, we call it security through networking, which will be compared with today all the networking just through a connection and the speed. And the security networking will also need to look at application, the content, the device behind, the user behind and even different kind of location there. So that's where we see all these kind of security function add on top of networking has huge potential and which is to buy the security while also doesn't just one part of it, but also the secure 5G and also internal secure switch infected Wi-Fi we do see a lot of our potential to keep in using security cover the whole infrastructure.\nIrvin Liu: Got it. Thank you.\nKen Xie: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question from Imtiaz Koujalgi of Guggenheim Partners. Sir you may go ahead.\nImtiaz Koujalgi: Hey, guys, thanks for your question. I have a question around the attach of supported subscriptions were part of this quarter because it looks like you had strong momentum and product. Your strong earnings momentum. Also it looks like the upside in product didn't lead to maybe it's sort of similar upside in billings. Was there a difference in products mix was led to difference in attach rate within subscription and support the score.\nKeith Jensen: Now, I think the -- we track our attach rates and our renewal rates, if you will, within those advantages anything I let say plus or minus 2%. And I think that, you know, we were comfortably inside those brands. So there was nothing unusual in that regard. I think that the services buildings in total, we're probably have to go back and check that the best quarter that we've had in four years. So I feel so good about the both the services and the product performance in the quarter.\nImtiaz Koujalgi: And just one follow up, you give us a mix of balance between FortiGate to Non-FortiGate is that had the same kind of mix you have in the product line also. This the 70,30 roughly, is that the mix of Non-FortiGate and FortiGate in the product line, or is that mix different for products?\nKeith Jensen: Yes, I don't have that number in front of me, but I don't have a reason. I don't recall them being significantly different. We've looked at them. And I'm trying to recall what we leave in the script just a moment ago in terms of product revenue. Yes, I think we've offered FortiGate product revenue growth in the script, as well as Non-FortiGate product revenue said they were both, FortiGate was 40% and Non-FortiGate was over 40%.\nKen Xie: Those are growth rates we don't we haven't given a breakdown by mix for the two per product. We haven't even FortiGate a product and non- FortiGate product there's a mix we haven't given that.\nImtiaz Koujalgi: Got it. Very helpful. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question is from Patrick Colville of Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead.\nPatrick Colville: Thank you so much for taking my question. I mean, 41% product growth is extremely impressive. I guess, questions were fielding from investors around the cyclicality or the kind of, I guess, whether it's secular growth and so, could you just help us understand, whether one time benefits because of recent hacks or because in recent events or post-Coronavirus that led to this kind of very strong number or a feeling that, the follow market there comes from some secular dynamics that we all should be aware of?\nKen Xie: We do see the lot of product started going through the, lot of a new part of infrastructure or kind of a new area. And that has also like Keith mentioned, decided top five vertical, we do see the, other vertical growth faster, much faster than the top five verticals that common service provider, finance service, education type something like that. That is, but also make a money infrastructure we do see like, whether deploy on the WAN side on the whatever the [indiscernible] or some other kind of internet infrastructure within data center, or even with a home, there's a quite a broad, kind of like a buying pattern compared to before. And that also, we do believe we eventually will drive additional service because the western product round may go up and your service revenue will come in later. And also classic production of the new FortiTrust service. They feel it's all also add an additional layer of potential security survey for the future. It's definitely not definitely simpler, like I mentioned early that receives the changing of the security infrastructure. It is not kind of refresh or replace the traditional firewall, which also from time-to-time need to be upgraded, because now we'll have faster and faster, but also expanding into the new infrastructure part and also kind of a new area. We do see all kind of growth faster than the traditional microfinance surveys or some other part.\nKeith Jensen: Yes, to add to Ken;s comments, I think it was a quarter. And it has been for a while now that we just saw a lot of tailwinds. The tailwinds included whether it was SD-WAN or OT as an example. Now, the refresh opportunity, if you will, is really an opportunity for us to review as updated displays the incumbents. Credit for net that has 500,000 customers and 70 different firewall models and we even today we announced the new firewall in our press release. You know, it's not as if, historically you've seen blips with us in terms of spikes from refresh. But on the flip side, some of the competitors and legacy players have a shorter list of customers and a shorter list of products. And maybe you're not doing as well in Gartner Magic Quadrant as we are. So we view that as an opportunity. I do think that, other tailwinds that came into the quarter. We talked about the verticals can mention it again, and also when I look at our customer sizes, whether you're SMB, to always to the global 2000 did very, very well, I think one thing that stood out for us was the mid enterprise or the commercial part of the business that came on very, very strong in the quarter as well. So I think there was a long list of tailwinds for us that that worked out in our favor on that product revenue growth number.\nKen Xie: Yes, also the review, the introduction of the new products that compete in part advantage comes from [indiscernible]. It's bigger and bigger compared to other competitor, which not only helping make, replacing some of the installation page, but also expanding the memory area of the internal network, high speed environment, but also has a much more function beyond a traditional network security. Therefore, VPN, like we mentioned, whether from as your partner acts as a module, like a SASE or other product like SD-WAN and the 5G security, which none of the traditional firewall has. And that's also what had additional like sales and on the product, also the future service, which is not refresh compared to the traditional firewall, which they don't have that function or don't have a company in power to keep additional function of their current performance demanding. So that's where we feel the strategy we have. That is ASIC company and part advantage and that give us additional function and additional performance, much lower costs, and starting working very well.\nPatrick Colville: Great, thank you so much.\nKen Xie: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Tal Liani of Bank of America. You may go ahead.\nTal Liani: Hey, great. Thank you. I want to talk about gross margin. If I'm correct, and it's if I'm not, it's not going to be the first time, but if I'm correct, your gross margin had gotten down about 140 bits sequentially. And I also checked it versus consensus. It's lower, 100 bits lower than consensus this quarter, next quarter and 200 bits below consensus for the year for the guidance. So do I have any having stake in my calculation or it's not? Can you elaborate on gross margin? Why is it lower sequentially and the guidance?\nKeith Jensen: Yes, I think what you're seeing it's all is the mix shift, right? The product mix shift versus the services mix shift, you can do some pretty simple math in the second quarter. And you can get to, when you have 41% product revenue growth at 61%, 62% gross margin, versus the services that's fairly confident 23% and 88%, gross margin, that 25%, swing and gross margin. When you take that back and you look at it 20 points or 25 point over performance and product, it works out to be just about one point maybe a just little bit north of one point on the gross margin line. \nKen Xie: Also you can look in the product gross margin, we actually improved year-over-year, even the cost kind of increased, but we do improve the product gross margin. And also we do believe is the product gross margin, product growth 41%, we can have a lot of a future growth in the service. That's also the reason we had the FortiCare and the FortiGate and same had FortiTrust, which we do believe we're keeping, making the future, so ending that the service studies grow faster going forward.\nTal Liani: Is there any change in the pricing environment?\nKeith Jensen: There's no change in the discounting. Discounting for the quarter was neutral for us, if you will, we have taken certain steps as we look forward to, some of the changes in the cost structure that we're seeing from our suppliers. And we've taken certain steps in terms of our own pricing going have not actually hit yet. But they will hit in time for when we actually see those costs in our income statement.\nTal Liani: Can you elaborate on the last point? What does it mean? So do you expect the margins to decline? Or do you expect to increase prices in anticipation?\nKeith Jensen: I don't expect, I do not expect margins to decline now. Beyond what will happen with a mix, you have to if you will, between products and services, right to the extent we continue to overreact to over performance, the product line the way we just did, it's going to put pressure on the gross margin line. But keep in mind, the operating margin came in right at the high end of the range. So I think we successfully managed that. And it's certainly very consistent with what we foreshadowed earlier in the year, where we said within our framework, this was a year in which we would go towards growth. We obviously did that putting up 35% billings growth and 41% product growth, and at the same time delivering 25% operating margin plus.\nKen Xie: Yes, we also did more investment on infrastructure, which kind of making the service revenue gross margin lower a little bit, but also help in the future and additional servers come in.\nTal Liani: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer. You may ask your question.\nIttai Kidron: Thanks and great results as well guys. Ken, I was hoping to kind of, you gave a lot of great color on the backdrop and what you're doing and how you're extending well in the field, but maybe you can tie it up also with the competition discussion, maybe you can kind of help us understand what you're seeing from your competitors right now and who do you see is his most vulnerable for share loss, because it's clear that you're going to continue to gain share in this marketplace for the foreseeable future. But who do you see are as the more vulnerable vendors here that are likely to see to you and others that bring to the table what you can bring to the table?\nKen Xie: Better the growth - and we just have some long term strategic investment, which gives us more advantage, whether from the ASIC chip, which we started with 21 years ago, or starting building other part of fabric products, which integrate ultimately from day one, comparison, or competitor, more company acquisition makes it more difficult to do the integration and automation and maintain the organic growth there. But on the other side, we do see this sort of market shift changing. We also want to take the time, like our SASE strategy, we have a private omni lender working with a service provider to feed their SASE need long term good product for them the same time building some infrastructure as a model to integrate within the FortiGate, Forti OS as a single as our products and cover also SASE that has no access or some other parts, such as the one security, making the product kind of more easier for customer to deploy and fit in the big environment, fast environment much, much better. So that actually we continue to have this kind of a lot of long term strategy, and we do see the -- like a long-term benefits going forward.\nIttai Kidron: Very good. I tried. Thanks, guys.\nKen Xie: Thank you.\nOperator: Speakers, that would be our last question for this call and I'll turn it back over to Peter Salkowski. You may go ahead.\nPeter Salkowski: Thank you, Kathryn. I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today. Fortinet will be attending the following investor, Virtual Investor Conferences during the third quarter. We're doing the Oppenheimer Conference on August 10 and KeyBanc on August 11. Events with presentations will be webcast and those web cast links are going to be up on our website. Actually, they're already up on our website as of now. If you have any questions, following this call, please feel free to reach out to me. And with that, have a great day and take care everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our outstanding second quarter 2021 results. Billings increased 35% to $961 million, driven by solid execution and was the best it has been since 2015. Secure SD-WAN contributed 14% of second quarter billings. Total revenue grew 70% to $801 million with product revenue up 41%. Product revenue growth was the highest for nearly 10 years. Free cash flow was $395 million a quarterly level. With strong business momentum we remain focused on growth. Today we have announced expansion of our FortiCare and FortiGuard security services, adding a new security service called FortiTrust. FortiTrust security service offer user base licensing that follow the user across the organizations and high security platform. This enables organizations to easily manage and secure across all networks, endpoint and cloud, which traditionally has been siloded [ph]. Initial service level have been offered for Zero-Trust Network Access, and identity modifications. We have the current FortiCare security services which cover all Fortinet security fabric product with two-level services to include 24 x 7 technical support and timely insurance revolution. Additionally, FortiGuard security service has been [indiscernible] for different segment with added individual services for enterprise found those for commercial and the packages for SMB. Not only just an industry leading AI enabled security [indiscernible] that is regularly adjust protection across the FortiGuard security fabric. Today we announced a new FortiGate - 100F the industry's first high performance next generation firewall, with [indiscernible] Zero-Trust network access and advanced number of protection powered by the Fortinet NP7 [indiscernible] SPU the sigaoffers an average two times more performance than other competitive products based on our security [indiscernible]. These make the full apps the best protection for high speed internal network [indiscernible] centers. You can even see the momentum and the adoption of our SD-WAN [indiscernible] across network access and cloud solutions among the world's largest service providers. In May Fortinet was recognized as the winner of the Microsoft Security [indiscernible] type award. Lastly, Fortinet has named Google Cloud's 2020 Security Partner of the Year, recognized for innovative thinking, outstanding customer service, and benefiting process of a car product and services. Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employee, customer and partners worldwide for their continuous support on our work. Yes, thanks Brian, good question. I have said the industry whether during the pandemic, after the pandemic probably in some kind of a whole structure changing is no longer the traditional border kind of firewall will be enough. You have to expand into the WAN like security WAN the 5G and also internal have to do maybe internal segmentation replacing the switch with secure switch and the Wi-Fi to program now it is kind of a [indiscernible] kind of internal attack. So that's where and also consolidation also going on and also maybe have a [indiscernible] make a different powerful structure security together to protect the whole attack more to kind of attacks everywhere protection there. So that's where we will see is a big change for the whole architecture of how to architect a new protection architecture to protect the whole infrastructure security there. So that's probably different than the actually fresher traditional firewall that is the new expanding infrastructure need to be have our own protection there. So that's what we see like the program we announced today, [indiscernible] inside the high speed mobile environment to do all these kind of internal segmentation, [indiscernible] protection and all these kind of things. And then also we see very strong growth whether the secure C-band and also the 5G [indiscernible] and that's to have lot of [indiscernible] work on phone solution there. That's what is doing probably even much faster there. So maybe this is the whole infrastructure being changed. [Indiscernible] now working started coming more [indiscernible] by the boost on the price and also different kind of vertical. I think in the ramp up stage, in the early stage of ramp up, compared to last quarter probably like down about 15 percentage, this quarter grew about 25%. So it is [indiscernible] like dimension, they are kind of building infrastructure right here for the 5G, [indiscernible] and now SASE, which we have a different strategy or faster strategy actually quite a different, probably very different from our other player. And so we have a new strategy and we are [indiscernible] and are working with service provider to build in their SASE at the same time like the service revenue we will be kind of low to margin that will be there. Also we have seen some own infrastructure, if some customer don't have a service provider or want to working without them that we also have a kind of own kind of SASE solution there, which is also in the grade with the -- for the OS, inside for the OS, they have a building SASE they trust no access and some other part. They could also come in a different, there is no competitor and eventually they also hoped they can use ASIC plus data to additional continued power to our kind of own SASE solution there. So that's where we feel is a long term investment, but once we have it, we have a huge advantage compared to other competitors. Thank you. You know, we see the pipeline were strong for the larger multiple products deal, which like approach, I mean covered multiple part of infrastructure and also the product only grows like 41% is also very strong. We feel that all products we have different than the traditional are some of our competitors are using the [indiscernible] only. So we have the latest in the industry, but also we developed ASIC in the last 21 years. Just like the product we announced today, the -- based on our [indiscernible] we call it [indiscernible] region, but for the same cost was the function, performance compare to other competitor of industry average, so will have six time better performance basically like a -- because the competing part is huge from our own ASIC. And so that's what's changing the landscape of like the product what is now a security product or some other leverage basic is a huge [indiscernible] power gave us much better function and a better performance that can hugely replace a lot of our competitors. At the same time, we did see the expansion product as per market whether it will be from home or kind of a security internal work inside the company inside a data center which also plan lot of high end product loss, so the hybrid product [indiscernible] also we see public putting high maybe the highest in the last few quarters and even last few years. Also, especially the Forti [indiscernible], your beauty and your cosmetic access, and the beauty of SASE there we see strong interest in this area. Both found a service provider for enterprise by working on a solution there. Thank you, We do see going forward, especially like works from now remotely. The producer license which can cover multiple devices, including the mobile home device, work for home, and also internal inside enterprise company there like a cover multiple, like a not just a 40-K that goes through to the trust network access, but also some other like a web or mail or some other application or kind of a compiler infrastructure data center, they need access. So that per user license will make much easier for the user for the customer to really use in all these security servers in a multiple part infrastructure module cover multiple product there. So that's where we feel this is also very important part. And on top of the current FortiCare, we certainly would cover all the parts that we have and also the FortiGuard cover the product need a real time update on the subscription, all these kind of things there. So we feel this FortiTrust is probably the trend in the future, but still needs some time to ramp up. Especially we see the deal trust member access setting have a pretty quick growth opportunity with which we are fully paid out to have all this built in. And also the identity how to like, kind of make sure the identity across multiparty infrastructure and easily kind of management user we feel all these two services also kind of don't get very important. It needs some time ramp up, but we do see there's a huge increase and demand in front of customer. That is also the reason we launched this new FortiTrust service. Thank you. Last year, the probably more like in the rush supporting whatever can make it work in working remotely. But this year, they did definitely see the infrastructure need to be upgraded to be changed to more supporting this long-term. So that's where we see a lot of new infrastructure design and how to supporting not just work remotely, but also secure the whole infrastructure, different part of the infrastructure from their own when access to their internal segmentation. And also even the 5G or I see my own internal Wi-Fi. So there's a lot of new security architecture covering multiple part of product is more of a strong interest. And also Keith mentioned the OT is a moderate because the whether the 5g IoT OT, also that's also rather strong. Yes, we definitely see more and more customers to the benefit of the fabric, call it fabric which on multiple products, I think we make with ultimate together. So that's also making the Non-FortiGate grow faster than the FortiGate will be over a billion dollar, over a simple do a billion dollar this year. And so it is a customer, buy this multiple product most of them already, like whether they are our customer or already test them on the pod, and then just keep expanding beyond the what's the initial purchase there. So we do see the interest get stronger and stronger and the Non-FortiGate also keeping flow much faster than the FortiGate, which keep expanding from whatever the current installation base within the big enterprise. That's also the Gartner forecast. They see the integration, the consolidation starting kind of more and more important for these big enterprise because to manage multiple products from different vendors, much higher cost compared to like, that the platform approach, which can multiple products have a different part of infrastructure also using it quite often to guide at least the FortiGate fabric that we have. The Non-FortiGate, we have almost 30 products, most of them are developed internally and it's super [indiscernible] now gave up. I mean, individual product, because it is up and down quarterly, and also pretty much all contribute to the growth, we don't see any one or two too much kind of often compared with others. So that's probably maybe some time later, we can start I guess sorting things out. But at this stage, we do see, it's also dependent on a customer environment, depends on the sales support in, like some of them like have a e-mail working with FortiGate, some with website, some is employing, some is -- like access control, or some kind of sandboxing. And all cloud approach is a quite a white collar job or kind of even cover all these as like a 2020 product. So that's where it was difficult to break out and then try to see the trend, but we do see that the compliment is really to consolidate, integrate, automate approach, definitely has a huge benefit compared to our separate products from different vendors. Yes, thank you. Yes, we definitely keeping closely watching out of the chain in the industry, and also new technology auditions. But also we want to keep the innovation, not the culture we have in the last 21 years and also keep the organic growth was strong. Probably the cash level investment strategy to Keith to cover that. Irvin, good question. There are a few more and we still see more of our strong demand and also huge potential. That our product we have Integrated Security from our beginning leverage to FortiGate has a huge computing power. Part of what - FortiGate, we see a huge advantage compared to some other competitor whether using the universal CPU or some other approach, which difficult at any function because the company implementation for a low cost CPU. So that's where we do believe we will be the leader, the number one leader in IT one space size, now definitely will be strong. And [indiscernible] it will offer a kind of huge advantage, like availability, the cost saving compared to the traditional networking protocol MPLS, or some other part. And also a lot of service provider also starting kind of most focus on their IP where no 5g some other part, we used to also kind of fit in all kind of long-term bigger picture, we call it security through networking, which will be compared with today all the networking just through a connection and the speed. And the security networking will also need to look at application, the content, the device behind, the user behind and even different kind of location there. So that's where we see all these kind of security function add on top of networking has huge potential and which is to buy the security while also doesn't just one part of it, but also the secure 5G and also internal secure switch infected Wi-Fi we do see a lot of our potential to keep in using security cover the whole infrastructure. Thank you. Those are growth rates we don't we haven't given a breakdown by mix for the two per product. We haven't even FortiGate a product and non- FortiGate product there's a mix we haven't given that. We do see the lot of product started going through the, lot of a new part of infrastructure or kind of a new area. And that has also like Keith mentioned, decided top five vertical, we do see the, other vertical growth faster, much faster than the top five verticals that common service provider, finance service, education type something like that. That is, but also make a money infrastructure we do see like, whether deploy on the WAN side on the whatever the [indiscernible] or some other kind of internet infrastructure within data center, or even with a home, there's a quite a broad, kind of like a buying pattern compared to before. And that also, we do believe we eventually will drive additional service because the western product round may go up and your service revenue will come in later. And also classic production of the new FortiTrust service. They feel it's all also add an additional layer of potential security survey for the future. It's definitely not definitely simpler, like I mentioned early that receives the changing of the security infrastructure. It is not kind of refresh or replace the traditional firewall, which also from time-to-time need to be upgraded, because now we'll have faster and faster, but also expanding into the new infrastructure part and also kind of a new area. We do see all kind of growth faster than the traditional microfinance surveys or some other part. Yes, also the review, the introduction of the new products that compete in part advantage comes from [indiscernible]. It's bigger and bigger compared to other competitor, which not only helping make, replacing some of the installation page, but also expanding the memory area of the internal network, high speed environment, but also has a much more function beyond a traditional network security. Therefore, VPN, like we mentioned, whether from as your partner acts as a module, like a SASE or other product like SD-WAN and the 5G security, which none of the traditional firewall has. And that's also what had additional like sales and on the product, also the future service, which is not refresh compared to the traditional firewall, which they don't have that function or don't have a company in power to keep additional function of their current performance demanding. So that's where we feel the strategy we have. That is ASIC company and part advantage and that give us additional function and additional performance, much lower costs, and starting working very well. Thank you. Also you can look in the product gross margin, we actually improved year-over-year, even the cost kind of increased, but we do improve the product gross margin. And also we do believe is the product gross margin, product growth 41%, we can have a lot of a future growth in the service. That's also the reason we had the FortiCare and the FortiGate and same had FortiTrust, which we do believe we're keeping, making the future, so ending that the service studies grow faster going forward. Yes, we also did more investment on infrastructure, which kind of making the service revenue gross margin lower a little bit, but also help in the future and additional servers come in. Better the growth - and we just have some long term strategic investment, which gives us more advantage, whether from the ASIC chip, which we started with 21 years ago, or starting building other part of fabric products, which integrate ultimately from day one, comparison, or competitor, more company acquisition makes it more difficult to do the integration and automation and maintain the organic growth there. But on the other side, we do see this sort of market shift changing. We also want to take the time, like our SASE strategy, we have a private omni lender working with a service provider to feed their SASE need long term good product for them the same time building some infrastructure as a model to integrate within the FortiGate, Forti OS as a single as our products and cover also SASE that has no access or some other parts, such as the one security, making the product kind of more easier for customer to deploy and fit in the big environment, fast environment much, much better. So that actually we continue to have this kind of a lot of long term strategy, and we do see the -- like a long-term benefits going forward. Thank you."

            "name": "Keith Jensen",
            "content": "Thank you, Ken. And to add to your comments, we should note that as of the prior quarter, billings growth, product revenue growth and total revenue growth, all accelerated sequentially. In fact, all three growth rates were five-year Fortinet highs and product revenue growth was at its highest in over nine years. Okay let's drive through more detailed Q2 discussion with revenue. Total revenue of $801 million was up 30% driven by industry leading product revenue growth of 41%. The product revenue growth was broad based across geographies, FortiGate and non- FortiGate products, and across the use cases, illustrating market acceptance and customer demand through our integrated, single platform security fabric strategy across our customer infrastructures. Our financial strategy includes a rule of 40 target. The target the total of the revenue growth percentage and operating margin to be at least 40 and the second quarter strong demand and execution drove this actual total to be a rule of 55. FortiGate product revenue growth was 40%, while we continue to see robust growth from our secure SD-WAN functionality. Majority of the growth was driven by FortiGate revenue from other capabilities which are embedded in the FortiGate operating system. Non- FortiGate product revenue growth was over 40% for the second consecutive quarter and was driven by strong growth from our integrated security fabric products. One additional comment on our product revenue growth, the product revenue growth was a reflection of our continued strong organic growth and not the result of a few large deals, drawing down backlog, nor unusual number of delayed transactions from the prior quarter or pulled in from future periods. Service revenue of $503 million was up 24%. Support from related services revenue of $230 million was up 26%, while security subscription services revenue of $273 million was up 23%. Moving to the mix of FortiGate and Non-FortiGate platform revenue, FortiGate product and services revenue increased 26% driven by very strong demand for both branch and high-end FortiGate products. High end products included 10 NP7 powered FortiGates models, representing approximately 25% of high-end FortiGate shipments. Our ASIC driven FortiGates give customers five to ten times more computing power than firewalls running on common CPUs. The advanced computing power creates additional speed and capacity to continue to add functionality to our operating system, further driving our price for performance advantage. The combination of the ASIC advantage and the common operating system across products, can enable vendor consolidation, lowering total cost of ownership, and increasing automation. Non-FortiGate products and services revenue grew 39% and accounted for approximately 30% of total revenue, up over two percentage points. The integrated security fabric consists of a complete range, [indiscernible], bit of a reversal for our advanced meeting later on today folks, so you've got an inside scoop on what Patricia is going to say. Let me start again if I may. Non- FortiGate product and services revenue grew 39% and accounted for approximately 30% of total revenue for over 2 percentage points. The Integrated Security fabric consists of a complete range of form factors, and delivery methods, including physical and virtual appliances, cloud, SaaS and professional software, as well as hosted and non-hosted solutions. Together they provide a range of security solutions and form factors, enabling integrated protection for the hybrid environments, and the expanding digital attack surface from network data centers to endpoints to the cloud. Let's turn to revenue by geo. To summarize, on Slide 5, revenue in EMEA increased 34%. The Americas revenue increased to 29% and APAC posted revenue growth of 24%. Product revenue growth for both the Americas and EMEA regions was over 40%. Moving to billings. Second quarter billings were $961 million up 35%. We saw a strong growth in both the FortiGate and non-FortiGate segment of the Security Fabric platform. The FortiGate segment delivered billings growth of over 30%, accounting for 71% of total billings. As shown on Slide 6, branch and high end FortiGates posted very strong billings growth. The non-FortiGate segment accounted for over 29% of total billings and delivered billings growth of over 45%, driving a 2-point mix shift to non-FortiGate products and services. Given the continued strong performance, we believe our non-FortiGate platform is on a pace to be a $1 billion business this year. Secure SD-WAN billings represented 14% of total billings, and is a key functionality for an integrated SASE solution. In terms of Billings by geo, EMEA outperformed all geos, followed by the Americas and APAC. Europe had a very good quarter and growth in the Americas was driven by the United States, which was up sequentially by more than 30 percentage points. Latin America continued to recover from the pandemic induced slowdown, posting billings growth in the mid 20s for the second consecutive quarter. The average contract term was approximately 28 months, up two months from the second quarter of 2020 and one month in the first quarter of 2021. Deals of over $1 million increased from 59 to 79, and the pipeline for deals over $1 million continues to look good for the remainder of the year. Secure SD-WAN deals over $1 million increased from 13 to 19. Moving to worldwide billings by industry verticals. Billings by vertical illustrate the diversification in our business model, and importantly, suggest the current threat landscape is driving security investments in industries that may have historically shown lower investment levels. For example, the verticals that have historically not been in our top-five combined for billings growth of over 75%. Service providers accounted for 14% of total billings and were up 25%. Moving now to the income statement, product revenue growth of 41% drove a 3-point shift in the product and services revenue mix and along with it a gross margin decrease of 160 basis points to 77.5%. Product gross margin improved to 70 basis points to 61.7%. Services gross margin decreased 160 basis points to 86.9%, with datacenter investments and FX accounted for about 100 basis points of the impact. Operating margin of 25.4% was at the top end of the guidance range. Despite a 350 basis point headwind from the gross margin decline, a weaker US dollar, and increased travel and marketing event cost. We ended the quarter with a total headcount of 9043, an increase of 17%. Moving to the statement of cash flow summarized on Slide 7 and 8. Free cash flow for the second quarter came in at a quarterly record of $395 million benefiting from strong revenue growth, good month one linearity and lower capital expenditures. For the quarter, we repurchased approximately 455,000 shares of common stock for a total cost of $92 million, and an average share price of approximately $201. The remaining share repurchase authorization at the end of the second quarter was $921 million, with the authorization set to expire at the end of February 2022. We ended the first half of the year with total cash and investments of $3.4 billion, an increase of $1.7 billion. The increase includes the proceeds from our $1 billion investment grade debt issuance during the first quarter of 2021. DSO's returned to pre-pandemic levels, decreasing seven days year-over-year, and 15 days quarter-over-quarter to 66 days. Inventory turns increased to 2.7 times from 2.2 times, reflecting strong product sales in the quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $24 million and we have started to move into the new Sunnyvale building. We estimate third quarter capital expenditures to between $65 and $75 million, which includes a $30 million payment for the new campus building. We estimate 2021 capital expenditures to be between $175, and $200 million. With the acceleration of the growth and a little more understanding of the post pandemic work patterns, we are turning our attention to reviewing our facilities footprint, and the needed office and warehouse capacity in the U.S. and Canada. As we work through this process it is possible that our estimated capital expenditures for the next few quarters will increase as we prepare for the next phase of our growth. Looking forward, our goal remains to balance growth and profitability. Given the growth opportunities that we believe I had, we continue to expect to tilt our bias within this framework, more towards growth for at least the next several quarters. The opportunities we see are supported by a strong pipeline, increased sales effectiveness, the growing success of the single integrated security platform strategy, and the convergence of security and networking, the response of the current threat environment, and our development efforts which include continuing to invest in our ASIC advantage which enables a shared operating system across the Security Fabric platform, drives our price for performance advantage, increased the capacity to add features and functions while maintaining price points. And now I'll give your outlook for third quarter summarized on Slide 9 which is subject to disclaimers regarding forward looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the third quarter we expect billings in the range of $940 million to $960 million, revenue in the range of $800 million to $815 million, non-GAAP gross margin of $77.5 to 78.5%, non-GAAP operating margin of 24.5% to 25.5%. This includes an estimated 200 basis point headwind from foreign exchange and the increased travel and marketing costs, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.90 to $0.95, which assumes a share count of between $169 million and $171 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 21%. With that, we are raising our 2021 guidance and expect billings in the range of $3.870 billion to $3.920 billon, which at the midpoint represents growth of approximately 26%. Revenue in the range of $3.210 billion to $3.250 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of approximately 24.5%. Total service revenue in the range of $2.045 billion to $2.075 billion, which represents growth of approximate 23% and implies full year product revenue growth of approximately 28%. Non-GAAP gross margin is 77% to 79%. Non-GAAP operating margins of 25% to 27%, which includes an estimated 200 basis point headwind from foreign exchange and increased travel and marketing cost. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.75 to $3.90, which assumes a share count of between 168 million and 170 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 21%. We expect cash taxes to be approximately $90 million. Along with Ken, I'd like to thank our partners, customers, and the Fortinet team for all their hard work, execution, and outstanding success in the first half of 2021. I'll now hand the call back over to Peter, for the Q&A session. Hey Pete, operator Kathryn we are ready to open the call for questions please. Yes, I think we obviously pay attention to our recruiting and to our attrition rates. I think the metric that we gave was that our overall headcount increased 17%. I would offer that the sales headcount actually grew significantly more than that. So I think that we're in a bit of a sweet spot and it kind of relates to what Ken was saying just a moment ago in terms of the success that we're having and I think you could read through to the high end FortiGates was probably being data center deployments and probably taking advantage of some competitors that are going through a refresh cycle and at the same time some of the branch FortiGates maybe [indiscernible] visual transformation. And I think that the audience of sales people understand that and they see the opportunities there. Yes, I think that we tried to make the point in the past that some people think about the firewall somewhat complicically. We found a track close to 12 to 15 different firewall use cases. Well if you want to talk about micro segmentation, IPS, et cetera, all of those, the totality of those, the growth there was contributed more if you will than SD-WAN. SD-WAN we saw still obviously contributed very nicely at 14% of our total billings, which probably puts it close about 35%, or probably 55% growth. So I think there's a long list of things that a firewall is use for and we were very pleased with the success that we saw throughout that suite of offerings. Yes, and then Rob, I think you did a very good job of laying all the dots to connect there. We're talking, we're looking at industries or verticals, such as manufacturing, transportation, energy utilities, or what have you. And to see the dramatic growth that we saw in that segment of business. We have, we've historically talked about our top-five, financial services, government service provider, tech, and retail, and they've been very consistent about that 65% to 66%, but we saw a significant shift this quarter. To those others, that was just the sheer growth that we saw on those others. And the point that you alluded toOT, OT performed very, very strongly in the quarter. And I think that's consistent with what we saw that vertical growth in those other verticals that I just mentioned. Yes, this Shaul is Keith. New logos were very strong in the quarter, probably up about 50% year-over-year. And I've given numbers in the past to kind of suggest that 5000 customers that we had the quarter, obviously a very strong quarter is going to be north of that first part of the response. Second part response, you would not normally expect to see that the new customers in the initial quarter would be significant contributors to revenue, but rather contributors to revenue growth over the longer period of time. But there was a very strong performance from the new logo segment in terms of customers have signed up with us in the quarter. Yes, Mike, I think I agree with Ken completely. And maybe just to add, if you think back about Q2 2020, specifically, at least for us, it was a quarter that was characterized probably by a lot of software. We did very well with our software in the second quarter last year. But on the flip side, anything that requires somebody to be on premise in a data center or taking on a large deployment or phased deployment or something like that, Q2 of last year, there really wasn't much of that. Obviously today, I think it's a year later, it's a very, very different environment in that regard. And I do think you're also seeing the threat environment and things like the OT, part of the business do very, very well. I'd love to say that we're completely immune to chip shortages and such, but I can't say that. I do think that as we talked about last quarter, the fact that our inventory turns we run, hover around to, suggested that we have six months of inventory on hand. We do and then some of the chip manufacturers are pretty focused on a 52 week lead time. I think I feel very, very good about how the manufacturing operations team executed in the second quarter and how they're going about things for the third quarter for the rest of this year. I would offer that as part of the forecasting process and the guidance setting process. That has become a more significant input, if you will, into that process and making sure that we've accounted for it in terms of our estimates of any challenges that we may have was moved through the rest of the year. This is Keith and just kind of to build on Ken's comment, I think that is the business strategy, right? If we look at our installed base of customers and see how their adoption progresses in terms of the number of fabric products that they add, over what period of time, we will certainly expect that to continue on. And then if you look in the current quarter, the new customers that we added, those are largely, those are buying firewalls, if you will, and maybe one or two things, if you will from the fabric suite. But we would expect them I guess I understand they have to digest and install the firewalls. But as we get as they get to know and understand our product and our integration strategy more and more, that we'll have the opportunity to come back in and sell them additional products and services as we go forward. Yes, I think for us, we look at our R&D spending as a source of investment, not a traditional capital allocation. But we are have historically been a buy versus permanent build versus buy company. And that is to, we feel strongly about the importance of having the platform to be integrated. You do see us doing tuck-in acquisitions, sometimes they take a little bit longer to bring to market perhaps because the technologies are things that we want to work with a little bit more before we bring them out. So I don't think that's a surprise. I don't know that precludes us from doing something larger in the future, but we'll look at those opportunities as they come up. The continuing focus will be take finding the opportunities to rebalance the balance sheet with a little bit of deploying some of the cash we raised the debt offering perhaps repurchase some, some share buyback, if you will. And at the same time also, as we look out for the next three to five years, and we anticipate continued growth, perhaps a little more investment, if you will, in our facilities footprint. Now, I think the -- we track our attach rates and our renewal rates, if you will, within those advantages anything I let say plus or minus 2%. And I think that, you know, we were comfortably inside those brands. So there was nothing unusual in that regard. I think that the services buildings in total, we're probably have to go back and check that the best quarter that we've had in four years. So I feel so good about the both the services and the product performance in the quarter. Yes, I don't have that number in front of me, but I don't have a reason. I don't recall them being significantly different. We've looked at them. And I'm trying to recall what we leave in the script just a moment ago in terms of product revenue. Yes, I think we've offered FortiGate product revenue growth in the script, as well as Non-FortiGate product revenue said they were both, FortiGate was 40% and Non-FortiGate was over 40%. Yes, to add to Ken;s comments, I think it was a quarter. And it has been for a while now that we just saw a lot of tailwinds. The tailwinds included whether it was SD-WAN or OT as an example. Now, the refresh opportunity, if you will, is really an opportunity for us to review as updated displays the incumbents. Credit for net that has 500,000 customers and 70 different firewall models and we even today we announced the new firewall in our press release. You know, it's not as if, historically you've seen blips with us in terms of spikes from refresh. But on the flip side, some of the competitors and legacy players have a shorter list of customers and a shorter list of products. And maybe you're not doing as well in Gartner Magic Quadrant as we are. So we view that as an opportunity. I do think that, other tailwinds that came into the quarter. We talked about the verticals can mention it again, and also when I look at our customer sizes, whether you're SMB, to always to the global 2000 did very, very well, I think one thing that stood out for us was the mid enterprise or the commercial part of the business that came on very, very strong in the quarter as well. So I think there was a long list of tailwinds for us that that worked out in our favor on that product revenue growth number. Yes, I think what you're seeing it's all is the mix shift, right? The product mix shift versus the services mix shift, you can do some pretty simple math in the second quarter. And you can get to, when you have 41% product revenue growth at 61%, 62% gross margin, versus the services that's fairly confident 23% and 88%, gross margin, that 25%, swing and gross margin. When you take that back and you look at it 20 points or 25 point over performance and product, it works out to be just about one point maybe a just little bit north of one point on the gross margin line. There's no change in the discounting. Discounting for the quarter was neutral for us, if you will, we have taken certain steps as we look forward to, some of the changes in the cost structure that we're seeing from our suppliers. And we've taken certain steps in terms of our own pricing going have not actually hit yet. But they will hit in time for when we actually see those costs in our income statement. I don't expect, I do not expect margins to decline now. Beyond what will happen with a mix, you have to if you will, between products and services, right to the extent we continue to overreact to over performance, the product line the way we just did, it's going to put pressure on the gross margin line. But keep in mind, the operating margin came in right at the high end of the range. So I think we successfully managed that. And it's certainly very consistent with what we foreshadowed earlier in the year, where we said within our framework, this was a year in which we would go towards growth. We obviously did that putting up 35% billings growth and 41% product growth, and at the same time delivering 25% operating margin plus."

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today, Peter Salkowski, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin sir.\nPeter Salkowski: Thank you, Rowanda. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Peter Salkowski, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fortinet. I am pleased to welcome everyone to our call to discuss Fortinet's financial results for the first quarter of 2021. Speakers on today's call are Ken Xie, Fortinet's Founder, Chairman and CEO; and Keith Jensen, our Chief Financial Officer. This is a live call that will be available for replay via webcast on our Investor Relations website. Ken will begin our call today by providing a high-level perspective on our business. Keith will then review our financial and operating results for the first quarter, before providing guidance for the second quarter and updating the full year. We'll then open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on today's call we will be making forward-looking statements and these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Please refer to our SEC filings, in particular the risk factors in our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for more information. All forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation and specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also, all references to financial metrics that we make on today's call are non-GAAP, unless stated otherwise. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are located in our earnings press release and in the presentation that accompanies today's remarks, both of which are posted on the Investor Relations website. Lastly, all references to growth are on a year-over-year basis, unless noted otherwise. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ken.\nKen Xie: Thank you, Peter. And thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our first quarter 2021 result. We are very pleased with our strong first quarter performance. Billings increased 27% to $851 million, driven by solid execution across a broad and integrated product and services. Secure SD-WAN contributed 14% to first quarter billing. Total revenue grew 23% to $710 million with product revenue growth of 25%, the highest quarterly product revenue growth in the last five years. With strong business momentum and great visibility, we've remained focused on growth. In the first quarter, we released FortiOS7.0, which offered the industry first OS label with tight integration of a broad security and network functions, including SASE, SD-WAN, Zero-Trust Network Access, CASB and 5G capability. Today we announced the 40 GIG 71.01 AF, the world\u2019s fastest next-generation firewall, and the only firewall with hyperscale 400 gig interface. The 71.01 AF will help 5G mobile network operators to secure multiple edges within their infrastructure and are enabled by MSPs to be with scalable security offerings. Powered by our new MP7 security process unit, the 71.01 AF delivers security contributing of 2x to 19x greater than comparative solutions. We continue to see momentum and adoption of our SD-WAN, SASE and zero trust network access solution among the world\u2019s largest service providers. Today, we announced Bridges Telecom, a new major secure SD-WAN service powered by Fortinet. In March Fortinet and AT&T announced the ability of a new managed SASE solution for enterprise customers. Increasingly, organizations are consolidating towards a holistic platform approach, delivering integrated and automate security cover on-premise network, endpoint and cloud secure edge. The Fortinet Security Fabric is a cyber security platform, organically built on a broad and a huge set of networking and security technology designed to seamlessly operate together. The high-profile of security incidence that occurred over the past few months, along with the pandemic, has elevated the need for a broad platform that can secure an enterprise on target infrastructure across multiple edge in a zero-trust environment. We expect companies to increase the percentage of IT spending used for security in an effort to address their cyber security needs. Our security-driven networking approach, is a key growth driver. Additionally, we expect that our significant organic product growth will lead to increase the service revenue. Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners, worldwide for their continued support and hard work. Keith?\nKeith Jensen: Thank you, Ken. And to add to your comment, we should note that billings growth, product revenue growth and total revenue growth were each at five-year highs. Okay, let's start the more detailed Q1 discussion with revenue. Total revenue of $710 million was up 23% driven by industry-leading product revenue growth of 25%. Auto-driven growth was broad-based across geographies, Security Fabric products and use cases illustrating the market acceptance of our integrated, single platform, security strategy. Customer demand for security across their entire infrastructure and the diversity of our customer base. Product revenue growth was over 30% for both infrastructure and cloud fabric products. And all three geographic regions increased 20% or more. Demand for security fabric products was strong across all form factors, hardware, software, and virtual machines. The growth we experienced for product revenue was not the result of a few large deals, lower backlog or higher channel partner inventory levels. The product revenue growth also enables increases in services billings and future services revenue. In the first quarter service revenue of $470 million was up 22%. Support and related services revenue increased 23%, to $214 million. Security subscription services revenue increased 21% to $255 million benefiting from outsized growth from our cloud provider and SaaS security offerings. Moving to the mix of FortiGate and Non-FortiGate platform revenue, the FortiGate segment of the Fabric platform saw revenue increase 17% driven by demand for entry-level and high-end FortiGate products. High-end includes 10 new NP7 powered FortiGates that were introduced in the past week, which includes today's announcement of the 71.21F. These new products now represent approximately 20% of high-end FortiGate shipments. Our AC driven FortiGates give customers five to ten times more computing power than firewalls that run on common CPUs. The advanced computing power creates not only speed, but also the capacity to continue to add functionality to our operating system, driving our price for performance advantage. The Non-FortiGate segment saw revenue grow over 40% and now accounts for 31% of total revenue up four percentage points. The integrated security fabric solutions, consists of a complete range of form factors and delivery methods, including physical and virtual appliances, cloud, SaaS and professional software, as well as hosted and non-hosted solutions. Together, they provide a range of security solutions and form factors enabling integrated protection for hybrid environments and the expanding digital attack surface from the data center, to the endpoint, to the cloud. Given the strong first quarter performance \u2013 revenue performance, we believe our Non-FortiGate platform is now on a pace to be a $1 billion business this year, representing an acceleration of this milestone. Let's turn to revenue by geographies. As summarized on Slide 5, revenue in the Asia Pacific area increased 26%; EMEA revenue increased 25%; and Americas posted revenue growth of 20%. As I mentioned earlier, all three regions experienced product revenue growth of 20% or more. Moving to billings. The first quarter billings were $851 million, up 27%. We saw strong growth in both the FortiGate and non-FortiGate segments at a Security Fabric platform. The FortiGate segment delivered billings growth of 20%, accounting for 70% of total billings. As shown on Slide 6, entry-level FortiGate posted very strong billings growth in the quarter. The non-FortiGate segment accounted for 30% of total billings and delivered billings growth of 50%, driving a four-point year-over-year mix shift to non-FortiGate. Taking together, these data points highlight the market acceptance of our single integrated security platform strategy. In terms of billing growth by geos, APAC outperformed all geos followed by Europe, and the Americas. In the Americas, Canada had a very strong quarter and Latin America rebounded from the pandemic induced slowdown posted billings growth in the mid 20% range. Moving to billings by customer segments, the small enterprise segment posted solid growth across all geos. This segment is driven by new customer acquisitions, customer Security Fabric expansions, solid execution by our channel partners and the large diverse makeup of this international customer segment. At the same time, we saw strong growth in our larger deals. The number of deals of $1 million, increased 74% to 66 deals in the first quarter. The pipeline for deals of a $1 million looks good for the remainder of the year. As Ken noted, secure SD-WAN billings were 14% of total billings. SD-WAN as a key functionality and an integrated staffing solution. Moving to worldwide billings by industry verticals was another strong international performance. The worldwide government sector topped all verticals at 19% of total billings and was up 60%. Service providers and MSSPs accounted for 16% of total billings. The rebound for education accelerated. We've done this growth of 50%. Retail turned into a solid quarter with billing growth of 21%. Our strong and consistent billings and revenue performance over the past several years is testament to our geographic and customer diversity. The growing success with a single integrated security platform strategy and our ASIC advantage, which enables a shared operating system across the Security Fabric platform drives our price or performance advantage, increase the capacity to add features and functions while maintaining price points. Moving back to the income statement. As shown on Slide 4, total gross margin improved 10 basis points to 78.9%. Product gross margin improved 120 basis points to 62.6% benefiting from lower direct product cost. The increase in product gross margin offsets the drag on total gross margins from the revenue mix shift driven by the strong product revenue growth and a gross margin \u2013 and the gross margin FX headwind [indiscernible] about 25 basis points. Operating margin for the first quarter increased 210 basis points to 24.5%, benefitting from the strong revenue performance in the quarter. The benefit from lower travel and marketing program expenses are approximately 100 basis points. It was more than offset by an operating margin headwind from foreign exchange of about 150 basis points. To end the quarter \u2013 we end the quarter with total head count of 8,615, an increase of 16%.  Moving to the statement of cash flow summarized on Slide 7 and 8. Free cash flow for the first quarter came in at $264 million, up $22 million from the first quarter of 2020, despite a $24.5 million year-over-year increase in CapEx spending. We ended the year with total cash and investments of $3.1 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion. The increase includes the proceeds from our $1 billion investment grade debt issuance during the first quarter. The issuance followed our inaugural strong triple B credit ratings. Throughout the pandemic, we have leveraged the strength of our balance sheet as a competitive advantage to support our partners and customers as they experienced geo-specific economic challenges. As a result daily sales outstanding increased seven days to 81 days and in line with our expectations and reflecting our earlier decisions to provide geographically targeted extended payment terms. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, DSI was on the first quarter of 2021 decreased six days, as we saw early progress towards returning to pre-pandemic payment terms. Inventory turns declined to 2.1 times from 2.5 times, reflecting the efforts we took to mitigate supply chain risk, including increasing our inventory levels, starting earlier in 2020. We expect extended payment terms and higher inventory balances to be in effect as we move through 2021. Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $52 million, including $38 million related to construction and other real estate activity. We expect to begin moving employees and the new Sunnyvale campus building in the middle of the year. Although the timing will depend on local pandemic protocols and employee safety considerations. We estimate capital expenditures for second quarter between $30 million and $40 million for all of 2021 to between 150 and 179.  The average contract term in the first quarter was approximately 27 months, up less than two months from the first quarter of 2020, and down approximately one month from the fourth quarter of 2020. Secure SD-WAN accounted for 15 deals of $1 million versus four in the first quarter of 2020, and contributed to the increase in average contract term. As we look forward, our goal remains to balance growth and profitability. And given the growth opportunities we highlighted during the March Analyst Day and as confirmed in our first quarter results, we have tilted our bias towards growth for at least the next several quarters. The opportunities we see are supported by a strong pipeline, increased sales capacity and our development efforts, which include the NP7 chip and our new FortiOS7.0 operating system that was recently released. Now I'd like to review our outlook for the second quarter guidance summarized on Slide 9, which is subject to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the second quarter, we expect billings in the range of $860 to $880 million. Revenue in the range of $733 million to $747 million. Non-GAAP gross margins of 78.5% to 79.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 24.5% to 25.5%, which includes an expected 100 basis points to 150 basis points headwind in foreign exchange. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.83 to $0.88, which assumes a share count of between $168 million and $170 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 21%. Before raising our 2021 guidance, I\u2019d like to congratulate every member of the Fortinet team for the truly outstanding start to 2021. For the 2021 we expect billings in the range of $3.685 billion to $3.745 billion, which at the mid point represents growth of approximately 20%. Revenue in the range of $3.080 billion to $3.130 billion, which at the mid point represents growth of approximately 20%. Total service revenue in the range of $2.020 billion to $2.050 billion, which represents growth of approximately 21% and implies product revenue growth of approximately 17%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 78% to 80%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 25% to 27%. When backing out the 2020 T&E benefit, the midpoint of the guidance represents a 50 to 100 basis point increase in 2021 operating margin, despite an expected headwind from foreign exchange. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.65 or $3.80, which assumes a share count of between $170 million and $172 million and about $0.07 per share impact in debt issuance. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 21%. [ph] We expect cash taxes to be approximately $80 million. And along with Ken, I'd like to thank our partners, our customers, and the Fortinet team for all their support and hard work in these difficult and unique times. Now I'll hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A.\nPeter Salkowski: Thank you, Keith. As a reminder, during the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and others to participate, we've got a fairly large queue today. So I'd like to get through everybody at least once. Towanda, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rob Owens with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nRob Owens: Great. And thank you for taking my question. With one of other verticals in the media, seeing issues with chip shortages and some supply chain issues, is that sort of sneak into the security market relative to firewall point shipments. And can you talk a little bit about your potential exposure? Thanks.\nKeith Jensen: Well, I think the chip shortages \u2013 this is Keith, Rob. I think the chip shortages that you point out is can touch a lot of different industries. I think one thing about Fortinet in addition to having different form factors is the inventory balances that we carry, a two times inventory turns, you're looking at basically six months of inventory that we're carrying on our balance sheet. I do expect that the supply chain issues will be something particularly related to chips that will be a constant conversation points throughout 2021 and into 2022. But I think in terms of when we sit down and talk about our expectations for the year, I think we have a fairly good understanding of how to work that in.\nRob Owens: Thanks, Keith.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBrian Essex: Great. Thank you. And thank you very much for taking the question. Ken, I was just wondering, billings commentary worldwide government up 60%, some really nice acceleration there and then MSSP and service providers still 16% of total. May if you can talk about obviously we know what the secular drivers in MSSP are. How durable is that, maybe the factors that are driving that acceleration in government spend, and then maybe talk a little bit about particularly on the service provider side, it doesn't seem as though we're seeing an acceleration from 5G and IoT yet. Who are the buyers there? How do you anticipate that segment will play out through the rest of the year as you look your way through the remainder of the year?\nKen Xie: Yes. Carrier on this a lot of service provider starting to now reshaping their \u2013 security network offer whether it's 5G, SD-WAN, all of the SASE and also supporting work from home kind of still in the early stage, I put in this way. So that's where we working very closely with all the service provider like the VG [ph] we announced today, the AT&T we announced last month and pretty much all the service provider to support and then all these shifting of the business model. And I say it's still early stage. We do involve a lot of testing trial. And at the same time, I do believe eventually the service provider business will go back up to the number one is tend to be like a high 20, like if you go back four, six years ago, but it's a \u2013 because it's a new kind of shifting, so they are \u2013 they do have some work to do and also some big investment we see going forward. So we're working together with them to keep growing this business right now.\nBrian Essex: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.\nKen Xie: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Your line is open.\nJonathan Ho: Good afternoon. Congratulations on the strong quarter. I just wanted to get a better sense of what you're seeing in terms of demand for the SASE and ZTNA oriented products. And are you seeing that pipeline sort of continued to rise especially as we look at sort of replacements for the traditional VPN connections and other sort of more legacy technologies? Thank you.\nKen Xie: Yes, that is the new fast growing market, but also they probably replace some of the traditional approach, but some other traditional approach also expand inside campus, inside \u2013 and probably inside the data center, so that go through the internal segmentation. On other side, we do believe we entered the SASE zero trust network like we said few years ago it's the best position probably saw the service provider carrier. So we tend to be more working with them, partner with them and also offer kind of more tighter integrated solution like we said in the FortiOS7.0 is very integrate OS network inside of some different vendor using different box, so you can kind of look at different inputs factors to that. So that's actually working much better with a wider service provider with customer directly. So that's where we do see there are some fast growing going forward, but it's just part of the whole infrastructure solution will now replace the traditional approach, but also the whole thing\u2019s security is smarter than that dynamic space, there is a new team come up and also the \u2013 that alternatives also not goes away. So that's where we try to address is a new chain and same time keeping at hands the traditional solution and to supporting the customer in all different vertical different region.\nJonathan Ho: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.\nBen Bollin: Good evening, Ken, Peter \u2013 Keith, Peter. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how you see customer discussions changing or evolving as they contemplate and start to return to their offices and to work. And then also hoping you could touch on how you view the growth opportunity over time from completely new customers versus wallet share expansion with your existing customers? Thanks.\nKen Xie: The customer doesn't view security, become more and more important, but also they need to cover much broad infrastructure and all edges instead of as a traditional secure whatever the border or the data in other company. So that's more device, more user, more infrastructure need to be covered. So that's \u2013 it's not a simple refresh. It's really a change into the whole infrastructure approach and also working together with traditionally negative from vendor cover, whether now working on end point as a mother part of a security. Now they're looking for some consolidation and they prefer, when they have multiple cover of a different part of infrastructure working together. So that you can see that the fabric approach we did a few years ago starting doing quite well and almost pretty much every quarter double the growth compared to the traditional network security. But now what they created, we also see more healthy growth and it\u2019s really not as expanding beyond the traditional border security approach, but also because the ASIC advantage, which increased the secure computing power 5 to 10 times compared to that the other vendors software loaded on the traditional CPU. So that\u2019s able to add a more function and also kind of increase performance, lower the cost, and also a low car park assumption, more green. So that that\u2019s actually making that this like the product worlds like we say that keeping us, keeping to better and better. And that we do see this whole infrastructure approach will keeping going for the next, probably a few quarters even to a few years. And the consolidation will keeping going within the industry.\nKeith Jensen: Yes, then I would just continue on with Ken\u2019s comments. I think the headline that he\u2019s talked about previously is that the back to work really the combination of back to work and many companies being in a hybrid model that the attack surface now seems to be permanently expanded for many, many companies. In terms of growth in how we see it with new logos and expansion opportunities, we easily add several thousand new customers every quarter. But if you look at the mix of billings, the mix of billings is going to come from our installed base of customers, if you will. And I think the simple model we\u2019ll look at is, from that initial sale of perhaps a firewall or something else. There\u2019s two different ways to expand. One is finding more and more use cases inside organizations for firewalls and increasingly displacement opportunities. And then the second is, and this is where Ken was going is the expansion opportunity where those non-FortiGate fabric partner products. And we\u2019re seeing there with that that mix shift from FortiGate to non-FortiGate, and now being 30% of our business, 31% of our business. I think it\u2019s taking as one affirmation of the strategy and two, you\u2019re seeing it in the numbers.\nBen Bollin: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nTal Liani: Hi guys, I\u2019m going to take you to the basics with my question. Last year was strong and there was some concern that the firewall market is being driven by a COVID-related demand, just because of work-from-home. And the question is whether you expect any slowdown of demand related to the anniversary of the trends last year. And the second question is your non-FortiGate grew extremely strong again. If you can take us through the basics, what are the products that are growing there? Just what are the trends and what do you bring to the market? Thanks.\nKen Xie: I can take the first part, maybe Keith got second half. I don\u2019t see any slowdown even for the FortiGate side. It is \u2013 we\u2019re keeping gain in market share, like I said because there\u2019s a fundamental like a technology architecture difference with 5 to 10 times the computing power compared to our competitor we can easily add a function performance and even for work-from-home is more like a one single with the box and replace like a three, four different box on an helping that security side, like of these apart, and also like manage home Wi-Fi and the traffic there. So that\u2019s also lot of company also starting to this kind of expand the branch to the home called home branch or whatever to meet working standard like a better networking, reliability, security to the whole environment. So that\u2019s also need to be the solution. That\u2019s also lot of the reason we see some of the low asset and keeping grow pretty fast. It\u2019s a look for a home actually helping driving some of this point of your sales. But also going forward whether the service provider some other after say most enterprise, not even kind of a change might after infrastructure to adapt is more work-from-home yet. They are still in the early stage. So we do see there\u2019s a big potential going forward. Yes, that\u2019s all, Keith.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. Well, it\u2019s a little tough for me to look back at the second quarter of last year and where their billings growth was and the product revenue grew up and things that I was getting. I didn\u2019t feel like I was getting a tailwind from VPN or something like that in the second quarter of last year. That said I think we\u2019re very pleased with how the year continued to play out and in the growth numbers that we\u2019ve provided. I don\u2019t know that, early on in the stages of work from home, but that was something that necessarily Fortinet participated in to the same level of maybe some of the other firewall vendors did. And then the second part of your question you'll be glad to know that Ken and Peter and I sit down every quarter and look at the fab and the non-FortiGate products and try and find the one that's really distinguishing itself. And we keep coming to the same conclusion each quarter. It's a rising tide lifting all boats. If not that any one product is really standing out more so than the other over an extended period of time.\nKen Xie: Yeah, it's really because most of the part that we develop internally from day one, it's making integrate operate together. So that's probably the key number one reason, customer want to buy is \u2013 we tried to consolidate, make it easier to manage. It's different than some other company when they acquire some part of our company from outside is that take a long time and more difficult to integrate. So we have internally developed from day one. We've been making working together.\nTal Liani: Right. So, my question was much more basic, what are the key products that are driving up the growth of non-FortiGate? So we know it's SD-WAN, what else?\nKen Xie: I see what I think the part of FortiGate.\nTal Liani: Got it. Yes.\nKen Xie: So we don\u2019t comment on non-FortiGate, but is we have like 20, 30 given product, touch all part of the infrastructure and the key said is difficult to point out which one is ready. Yes, it\u2019s a [indiscernible] I read the whole thing.\nTal Liani: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nSterling Auty: Thanks. Hi, guys. Wondering if you could help me better understand the disproportionate improvement that you saw internationally, especially in EMEA relative to the improvement you saw in the U.S.?\nKen Xie: I think similar like we comment in the last couple of quarters, it's a photo there like pandemic, once is starting get improving, also try to think about how to go back [indiscernible] mother. You mentioned infrastructure since we'll be studying across. So that's where like APAC [indiscernible] it'd be faster by U.S. catch up however quickly.\nKeith Jensen: I'll just add on to that. Sterling, I think the \u2013 certainly for us that the markets are somewhat different. And maybe that comes into play a little bit, the European, the international part of the market. We are oftentimes you'll have the number one market share when the incumbent and particularly during the pandemic, I think incumbents have an advantage. I think in the U.S. perhaps we're a bit more of a challenger if you will. And I don't know that, a lot of CIOs and CTOs were focused on firewall refreshes in the second quarter and third quarter of last year and going through a competitive dynamics. And I think there's also a bit of the partner ecosystem. When you're the incumbent, you probably have more mind share with the partners. Then when you do with the challengers. Now, having said all that as we look forward, and we look at our pipeline, particularly in relation to the United States, as we go to the end of the second quarter here through the rest of the year. I think we're feeling very good about the direction of that organization is headed.\nKen Xie: Yes, we also will keeping your mass more into the U.S. for supporting further growth like we did for the PGA sponsorship and some things I think will be helping drive the growth in the U.S.\nSterling Auty: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gray Powell with BTIG. Your line is open.\nGray Powell: Okay, great. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the good numbers. So, yeah, maybe to follow up on the SASE side of the business. How quickly should we think of billings growth ramping under 40 SASE product, and then I don't want to get too aggressive, but could it potentially have a similar ramp to what you saw in 2018 and 2019 with SD-WAN back when that product was just getting started? Just how should we think about \u2013 just the overall upsell there. Thanks. \nKen Xie: I also, I can say a little bit similar question. We also kind of look at different market study and also what's the best model to do this with a partner together. I feel maybe similar like SD-WAN, but it's \u2013 but also SD-WAN is a part of the \u2013 part of a SASE solution and also SASE including some other function there, which we also want to have a like a better integration and better performance and that you need to manage. So that's where we take some time to launch our SASE and also more closely working with partner to do that. But it's a \u2013 the market definitely growing, but we also closely watching and what's the best way to position ourselves to catch the trend.\nGray Powell: Okay. Thank you very much.\nKen Xie: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal with Cowen . Your line is open.\nShaul Eyal: Thank you. Good afternoon, gentlemen, congrats on a strong performance. Keith or Ken historically the refresh cycle concert used to provide some disruption at times. I would even say some noise around specifically for in its business. It would appear that over the past, probably 18 months or so. There's less discussion and focus around it. Do you think that Fortinet is gradually shifting away from it or is that there's so many concurrent internal refresh cycle given the broadening of your platform, that it is becoming less of a relevant issue? What's the thinking about it?\nKen Xie: I probably hesitate to use some upper refresh compared to last time, you can see that 2012, 2013. And that's where it's the major firewall replacing the traditional firewall VPN, which was [indiscernible] firewall has them intrusion prevention, and anti-virus all the other functions. They're a proxy. But this time it's expanding into a much broader, bigger infrastructure both internal inside the company, and also go to the outside company that one side even expand work from home.  So it's more kind of expanding and same kind of different part of security also need to be more working together. So that's from company IT side, they look \u2013 if they can consolidate and help them to manage and integrate, automate will be more important. So that's where like I said, there's a multi-wise, more people connected and like a [indiscernible] it's a little bit different and that's where making \u2013 make a large, broad integrated approach, I feel is more important and same kind of supporting that than you technology that what are five GSP when, and also kind of, they be service model also would be, would be important, but we also feel once the product at, in the customer hand because the huge computing power to liquidity, we can also be add additional servers and keeping helping customers adopt the nuisance they need, and also be a service provider. So that that's also kind of keeping that the biggest \u2013 keeping growing in general.\nKeith Jensen: I think you and Ken are kind of touching on same thing with, even in reference to, I would say it this way, it's going to get harder and harder. I think to discern industry refresh cycles, it compared to where it was maybe five or six, seven years ago for a number of reasons. One, the firewall vendors are simply larger. Their footprint is much, much bigger than it was before. Secondly, you have some of us sort of showing success on the platform strategy, when 30% of your billings are coming from the platform, again, to your point, it's going to get a little harder to discern it and the sheer size, if you will as the footprint in terms of customers, but also the number of different used cases that are starting to evolve and continue to evolve inside those organizations. I think all that comes together, it's going to get murkier and murkier ready to go forward, to find a refresh cycle. You may have some individual competitors that maybe have very, very large price points or machines or something like that, where they have their own internal refresh cycle that you may see some noise around, but that's really not the Florida approach for firewall refreshes.\nKen Xie: The traditional firewall all the way they are rarely being deployed. It's not going away. They also kind of, every five years probably need to be updated to the new motto to match and that working speed as a modern one, but they also expanding beyond that one and also need to be walking, not out of a security infrastructure, putting this way.\nShaul Eyal: Understood. Thank you so much. Well done.\nKen Xie: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Tindle with Raymond. James. Your line is open.\nAdam Tindle: Okay thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe one for Keith, you've talked about this being a year to invest for growth. Your Q1 results clearly say that's working billings growth in high 20s at a scale approaching $1 billion and doing that with healthy profit is pretty unique. So, for my question, I was just wondering at this point, if you evaluated whether to lean even more on growth, given the early results that you're seeing?  And if you could maybe touch on the logic of why not are there diminishing returns above this level, is this something you would consider reevaluating as the year progresses? Thank you.\nKeith Jensen: Yes, Adam, it sounds like you are listening in to some of the conversations that Ken and I have with our respective point of view, I think. I think we're really pleased with how the business executed in the first quarter, putting up 27% billings growth and being 11 to 12 points above, and then raising the 22%, 3.5 points on the billings line for the year, probably for the quarter and then taking the year up at the same time by about four points, I think, the level of execution is shown to be very, very high. And the level of success with the firewalls and the Non-FortiGate products have been \u2013 we\u2019re very, very pleased with what's happening there. I think we'll see how this year plays out. We felt that there were tailwinds coming into the year for us at a number of different ways, whether it was GDP, whether it was stimulus, whether it was the product suite that we had, or our sales team's ability to execute. And let's see how we do as we continue on this trajectory, hopefully through the rest of the year.\nAdam Tindle: Thank you. That's fair enough. I'd love to be a fly on the wall for those conversations.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\nAndrew Nowinski: Great. Thank you. And congrats on another great quarter. I want to ask about the partnerships with some of the MSPs that you mentioned AT&T and BT. Those have been historically strong partnerships for Zscaler. So, I'm wondering do you think you are eating into these Zscaler\u2019s mind share at those partners or are they just trying to offer their customers maybe another SASE offering?\nKen Xie: Let us say, in the last few years for some point we used Zscaler as one of the service providers could be partnered. But also, some of the telecom companies, they do have their infrastructure and also some of their customer base, which we have been working with them for a long, long time. So, once, especially during the pandemic, IT has been in a high pressure to supporting whether internal or some other need being interesting. That\u2019s where SASE offers sort of more service-based approach which also kind of adopt based on [indiscernible] service provider quickly. So that's where we also leverage all kinds of relation with the partner and also our product technology, and vendors and offer much tighter, integrated SASE across network solution. Some bigger telecom partner they like it a lot, I put in this way.  So that's why we're continuing to work with them. So I do believe the business in the carrier service provider, when we go back to the number one like a few years ago, the high 20 that also have to work in closely with a partner and also some other infrastructure, a new infrastructure, I can mention whether the SD-WAN and the 5G or some other mode of IoT OT or even may be SIPG, or some other thing. I think there's a lot of potential which will result, how can a service provider do keep expanding the security business together.\nAndrew Nowinski: Yes, it sounds good. Thanks a lot, Ken.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Irvin Liu with Evercore. Your line is open.\nIrvin Liu: Ken congrats on the great quarter. You previously identified, continued expansion into large enterprise as a key contributor to growth in share gains. Can you talk about whether this was a factor in your Q1 outperformance? And also, can you also talk about any key differences when selling to large enterprises versus SME, S&D customers, for example, the go-to-market motion and/or timetable required to close a deal? So, any color here, will be helpful. Thanks.\nKen Xie: Yes, I think we try to give a little bit of color on that in the script, and I've used the term before that the growth being bookend if you will. Through the pandemic, you have quarters where SMB did well. And I think we provided some metrics there about large deals, deals over $1 million, which we think is a pretty good proxy for the success that we're seeing in the enterprise. I do think also the mid-segment is coming online for us a little bit stronger than maybe we saw in 2020. And we continue to believe that 2020 was an unusual year, both geographically and across customer segments. In terms of the cadence, in terms of how to sell the enterprise versus SMB, I would say absolutely, you make a large investment and it plays very well with the channel partners. There's no doubt about that the MSSPs, the carriers, et cetera. And in those channel partners oftentimes, particularly distributors, play a role in the enterprise. But to be successful there, you absolutely have to have a direct sales force that is helping to bring deals to those channel partners. And I kind of made a comment earlier about incumbency versus challenger. I think that's perhaps even more important than the geography where you're the challenger and you're trying to get mind share from some of those large key resellers that are linked together with some of the legacy firewall vendors. I mean, you've really got to partner with them, to bring deals to them and convince them with that strategy. And I think we're starting to see that track and take hold for us.\nIrvin Liu: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani with UBS. Your line is open\nFatima Boolani: Good afternoon. And thank you for taking the questions. Keith for you, I was hoping you could share some more details around the expectations of the SD-WAN mix that you have embedded in your guidance. How should we think about that? And certainly, how are you thinking about it? And where are the incremental areas of budgets or dollars and ultimately share gains within SD-WAN/SASE going to come from between the carrier market, as well as the enterprise DIY market?\nKeith Jensen: Yes, I think \u2013 hi Fatima, nice to hear from you again. I think in terms of SD-WAN, the way we go to our budget and we would describe SD-WAN as you heard us before, SD-WAN is a use case for the firewalls, similar to OT micro-segmentation, zero trust, et cetera. And we're not necessarily prone to building our models, if you will, by used cases for the firewalls, nor similarly necessarily by products. We do look at our pipeline and we do sanity check against Gardner projections for growth and things of that nature to make sure that we're in the range, if you will. So, I would expect that. The other comment I would offer is Ken has been quite clear for setting the goal early on, that he wanted SD-WAN to be 5% of billings. And we got there and he moved it to 10%. And we got there and now he has moved it to 15%. So, it's a little bit of movement cheese, I guess for Ken, in terms of setting goals for us. But that's fine. We like that. And I think you really kind of answered your own question in terms of growth investments. Where we would spend money, I think, that carrier service provider opportunities for both SD-WAN and SASE are key areas for those investments. But I'll hand it back to Ken.\nKen Xie: Yes, I do believe SD-WAN will be a bigger, long-term market and we want to be the number one. And also like we do see a lot of potential even this work-from-home lot of enterprise had to do a lot of service provide [indiscernible], still where small percentage were early stage to using the SD-WAN. So that's where \u2013 and also, we have huge advantage using our SoC4 chip to supporting this like one-box solution which has about 20 times better performance and a much lower cost compared to the second nearest competitor. So that's where is there huge opportunity with the best technology and working closely with a partner towards keeping growing SD-WAN. So we do see there\u2019s a huge potential. And we are also trying to be the number one soon. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hamza Fodderwala with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nHamza Fodderwala: Hi guys, good evening. And thank you for taking my question. I was wondering on the core sort of firewalling side, how much of the demand are you seeing come from used cases around micro-segmentation, particularly given some of these recent cyberattacks?\nKen Xie: We do have a lot of asking about how to secure internally whether within ourselves and company are obviously in the data center. But I have to say security still need a maximum company in power to process the traffic compared to large solution. My estimate probably usually it\u2019s 3,000 5,000 ton more company power needed. That's where so if we cannot solve that speed issue was a major other kind of a managed deployment, you show is still more difficult. That's also the AC takes more advantage may be five to ten times better performance computing power and then pass lower than other software-only approach. So, it's a lot of requests, but I have to say, it's not many solutions can need summer requests, because internal, whether with in a campus or within a data center, the network speed tend to be easily 10 to 100 times more faster than the one approach. I mean, the one connection. So that's where we are working with the customer or the partner directly. And also combined both the WAN security, and the LAN security and the whole infrastructure security is more important. But with today work-from-home with the Zero-Trust Network Access you have to be, make the whole infrastructure secure.  So, I see a huge market potential for the internal segmentation inside data center of campus security, but it\u2019s also a challenging job to meet a speed requirement, compared networking and also make sure it can easily be deployed and easily managed.\nHamza Fodderwala: Thank you for the color.\nKen Xie : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays. Your line is open.\nSaket Kalia: Okay, great. Hey, thanks for taking my question here, guys. Keith, maybe for you just going back to the Non-FortiGate part of the business, do you see any trends in perhaps market segment or geography that is adopting Non-FortiGate at higher rates? And I only ask that because with the growing enterprise business, with your growing enterprise business, that is, I would imagine more of the enterprises would maybe be more willing to work with multiple specialist vendors. So is Non-FortiGate part of the business, perhaps more weighted towards the mid-market or perhaps international? And relatedly, just kind of broad brush is how is that Non-FortiGate business sort of split between products and services? Sorry, there's a lot there. Does that make sense?\nKeith Jensen: Yes, there is a lot there. And answering no from me makes sense. How is that? Look I don't think the product service mix between \u2013 we would look about this and talking about previously, the FortiGate versus non-FortiGate, the product service mix is not different in any meaningful way, if you will, when you look at the mix. And again, we're selling solutions, so you're typically bundling that with a firewall cell. To see the Non-FortiGate billings, growth at that 50% number and seeing that the mix of the business, I think, obviously makes us very excited. It's actually a little bit counter-intuitive in terms of where itself. For the last several quarters the Americas has done very, very well with selling the Fabric. And I've been on phone calls with very large enterprises that want to know much more about the Fabric. Now that they've become comfortable with the firewall. I probably went into those conversations socket with much of the same expectation that you perhaps described, which is, that may be something that plays more to the SMB part of the business side of big enterprise. And I do think it does. I do think the enterprise willingness and in the U.S. you see the enterprise willingness to engage on the Fabric was probably a sign of a number of things. One is, at the end of the day, everybody has got a budget and this is a more cost-effective way to go about doing it. You can manage your infrastructure much easier perhaps with a single vendor strategy than you might otherwise. And I think the common operating system running on it or being integrated to OS/7 is something that's very exciting. And then you start talking to the vision about a SASE offering that\u2019s running on an integrated OS7 system, as well. So, I gave you a lot there. But to give color to it, I think, the long-winded response would be, it is not shown to be unique to a size of customer or to a geography. \nSaket Kalia: That makes sense. Thanks, Keith. \nOperator: Thank you. Our net question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.\nKeith Bachman: Thank you very much. I'm going to follow-on Saket. and I have one question to keep within Peter's rules, but I'm going to break it into a couple of sub parts. On the non-FortiGate side as well. I wanted to break it into: a) is there anything over the next 12 months that you look at, that you think in particular is interesting or exciting? b) Keith, is there anything you could breakout on attach rates, where you currently stand on the non-FortiGate side to attach rates? It would seem to me that there's still a hell of a lot of room to run there. Just if you look at your installed base where some opportunities.  And then c) if you had to partition the non-FortiGate into cloud and non-cloud in other words, there's a lot of, I think, FortiGate products that are relevant to on-premise situations versus cloud, but there's a way to just kind of break it out in percentage dollar wise, 50% of it's aligned to on-premise deployments versus 50% is cloud deployments. Is there any way to break that out in the non-FortiGate side in particular? Thanks very much.\nKen Xie: Yes, charging by the question, I think, I am going to look forward to you.\nKeith Jensen: Then I'm broke. I think there was \u2013 I'm going to lead that the tough question or the fun question for Ken at the end which is, if you look out over 12 months, what's going to take off in non-FortiGate. Keith, I would probably point you back to if we didn't do it in Analyst Day in March, we didn't do it in the Analyst Day in November 19, where we gave some breakdown of the Fabric products between what we call cloud and what we call infrastructure. And you can think of that as being hardware to me help answer your question there. I think when you use the term attach rate, we may use the term penetration rate.\nKeith Bachman: Yes.\nKeith Jensen: And by that is, for a customer that's a firewall vendor, how many \u2013 or as you start looking at your expansion opportunity Keith inside these customers, what type of penetration are you seeing and how are you going to market, if you will, and encouraging the sales team and the marketing team to whatever that number is increasing the penetration. And I would say that's something that's really been an area of focus, I would say, for us more recently over the last couple of quarters. And I think that's really at the moment more of we're pleased with it, don't get me wrong. But I think right now that's more of an internal metric that we're using with our sales team and our marketing team. And to some extent with our engineering team.\nKen Xie: Yes, great. I think also I probably not go to detail outside of number so far the non-FortiGate almost doubled FortiGate world in the last few years or so. I don't see any changing of the trend right now. But definitely from customer end goal it\u2019s a \u2013 they also asked what's the reason they really need to be more consolidate, make the whole infrastructure managers working together, all this kind of things, which are working quite well with us because we design the product. [Indiscernible] we are working 40 gig from day one. And then making a whole fabric working together to integrate, automate, all the security solution there. So that's where the \u2013 but also we see there's still small percentage customer has [indiscernible] to grow and the same time there's a new productivity coming up to working with 40 gig. So that's where we do see \u2013 we probably keep the trend, the non-FortiGate will keep and grow faster. And probably eventually even the business, maybe more than 40 gig, maybe in a few years.\nKeith Bachman: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nMichael Turits: Hey guys. For Ken and Keith do you see any difference in the type of projects, in security that you were seeing last year, primarily for the move to work-from-home versus this year, or we've worked from home as well as back-to-office? And as part of that, Keith, you mentioned, I think, saying that you are seeing, I think, some more willingness to do firewall replacements this year. Is that also a part of it?\nKen Xie: Yes, last year work-from-home is more like a patch, whatever they have. And without changing much of infrastructure this is definitely thinking, redesigning infrastructure where to leverage make a better technology like SD-WAN or some other, and at the same time making kind of a better solution in a zero-trust environment that\u2019s much more secure. So that's probably \u2013 but still in the early stage. We do see a lot of our gross potential there. But it's whole infrastructure changing compared to kind of last year, quicker like a patch solution.\nKeith Jensen: Yes, Michael, I would add to Ken's comments. I think the headline is whether the tailwinds coming to your security is top of mind for so many companies right now, so many CIOs and SIOs and whether that's solo wins, or it's work-from-home it was Microsoft, a little challenge is to ramp up a ransomware. It's just \u2013 it's a year, I think, that a lot of CIOs and SIOs are focused on security for a lot of different reasons. I do think that there was \u2013 for us in the U.S. market, if you will, and Ken has talked about this before, a little more difficult to say in the middle part of last year, it's kind of a year to get mind share from CIOs and SIOs to have a conversation about how you can save money while improving performance in their firewall. I think those opportunities are starting to appear more in terms of getting out and having customers take their prospects, take that meeting if you will. And I think there's also, some of these larger deployments that can go on for, well over a year or a couple of years, I think, some of those deployments, perhaps were a bit stalled if you will, last year and they are coming back online as we look at 2021.\nMichael Turits: So just to clarify, larger deployments are starting to come back online. And so is that the answer that people are more willing to talk about displacements of competitors this year than last year? \nKeith Jensen: Is it the answer to which \u2013 are you asking if I'm seeing that the answer is yes, or you\u2019re asking if that's the driver of the business, I would say yes; if you're asking if that's be driver of the business, I don't think so.\nMichael Turits: No, just if you see more.\nKeith Jensen: Yes.\nKen Xie: Yes, there are more spend beyond the traditional deployment. And also like a more device, multiple and more infrastructure need to be secure.\nMichael Turits: Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Patrick Colville with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nPatrick Colville: Thanks for squeezing me. Can I just kind of just finish it off on a multi-part? I guess the first one would be just about linearity. Last year, the linearity between one and two is a kind of unusual. So just help us understand how that might play out in fiscal 2021? And then I guess my kind of second part, if I may is, product revenue, this quarter was phenomenal. Baked into guidance, I guess, there's a kind of the rest of the year is more like a kind of mid-teens growth rates. Just to help us understand, is anything that is worth flagging in regards to the kind of performance in the rest of the year versus 1Q? Thank you.\nKeith Jensen: Yes, I think that, if you get comfortable with the business model, you understand the product and services and how very predictable that higher margin services revenue is. I think that we did take this as the opportunity to raise product revenue. We implied product revenue guidance, if you will, when you reverse engineer after we give the service revenue guidance by about five points. And I think that takes you to about 17% in terms of our guidance now for the full year. And we'll see how the year plays out. I think we feel good about it. In terms of linearity from Q1 to Q2, I would probably point you to one of our actual results that we had last year in Q1 and Q2. And our actual results in Q1 of this year and our guidance for Q2. \nPatrick Colville: That's very clear. Thanks for your time.\nOperator: Thank you. I will now like to turn the call back over to Peter for closing remarks.\nPeter Salkowski: Thank you, Rowanda. I like to thank everyone for joining the call today. Fortinet will be attending a few conferences in the second quarter, we have the J.P. Morgan Conference on May 25, Alliancebernstein on June 2, and Bank of America is June 8. Presentations and webcasts links are up on our website. Thank you very much. Have a great day. And please reach out if you have any other questions. Have a great day. Thank you. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ken Xie",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter. And thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our first quarter 2021 result. We are very pleased with our strong first quarter performance. Billings increased 27% to $851 million, driven by solid execution across a broad and integrated product and services. Secure SD-WAN contributed 14% to first quarter billing. Total revenue grew 23% to $710 million with product revenue growth of 25%, the highest quarterly product revenue growth in the last five years. With strong business momentum and great visibility, we've remained focused on growth. In the first quarter, we released FortiOS7.0, which offered the industry first OS label with tight integration of a broad security and network functions, including SASE, SD-WAN, Zero-Trust Network Access, CASB and 5G capability. Today we announced the 40 GIG 71.01 AF, the world's fastest next-generation firewall, and the only firewall with hyperscale 400 gig interface. The 71.01 AF will help 5G mobile network operators to secure multiple edges within their infrastructure and are enabled by MSPs to be with scalable security offerings. Powered by our new MP7 security process unit, the 71.01 AF delivers security contributing of 2x to 19x greater than comparative solutions. We continue to see momentum and adoption of our SD-WAN, SASE and zero trust network access solution among the world's largest service providers. Today, we announced Bridges Telecom, a new major secure SD-WAN service powered by Fortinet. In March Fortinet and AT&T announced the ability of a new managed SASE solution for enterprise customers. Increasingly, organizations are consolidating towards a holistic platform approach, delivering integrated and automate security cover on-premise network, endpoint and cloud secure edge. The Fortinet Security Fabric is a cyber security platform, organically built on a broad and a huge set of networking and security technology designed to seamlessly operate together. The high-profile of security incidence that occurred over the past few months, along with the pandemic, has elevated the need for a broad platform that can secure an enterprise on target infrastructure across multiple edge in a zero-trust environment. We expect companies to increase the percentage of IT spending used for security in an effort to address their cyber security needs. Our security-driven networking approach, is a key growth driver. Additionally, we expect that our significant organic product growth will lead to increase the service revenue. Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners, worldwide for their continued support and hard work. Keith? Yes. Carrier on this a lot of service provider starting to now reshaping their \u2013 security network offer whether it's 5G, SD-WAN, all of the SASE and also supporting work from home kind of still in the early stage, I put in this way. So that's where we working very closely with all the service provider like the VG [ph] we announced today, the AT&T we announced last month and pretty much all the service provider to support and then all these shifting of the business model. And I say it's still early stage. We do involve a lot of testing trial. And at the same time, I do believe eventually the service provider business will go back up to the number one is tend to be like a high 20, like if you go back four, six years ago, but it's a \u2013 because it's a new kind of shifting, so they are \u2013 they do have some work to do and also some big investment we see going forward. So we're working together with them to keep growing this business right now. Thank you. Yes, that is the new fast growing market, but also they probably replace some of the traditional approach, but some other traditional approach also expand inside campus, inside \u2013 and probably inside the data center, so that go through the internal segmentation. On other side, we do believe we entered the SASE zero trust network like we said few years ago it's the best position probably saw the service provider carrier. So we tend to be more working with them, partner with them and also offer kind of more tighter integrated solution like we said in the FortiOS7.0 is very integrate OS network inside of some different vendor using different box, so you can kind of look at different inputs factors to that. So that's actually working much better with a wider service provider with customer directly. So that's where we do see there are some fast growing going forward, but it's just part of the whole infrastructure solution will now replace the traditional approach, but also the whole thing's security is smarter than that dynamic space, there is a new team come up and also the \u2013 that alternatives also not goes away. So that's where we try to address is a new chain and same time keeping at hands the traditional solution and to supporting the customer in all different vertical different region. The customer doesn't view security, become more and more important, but also they need to cover much broad infrastructure and all edges instead of as a traditional secure whatever the border or the data in other company. So that's more device, more user, more infrastructure need to be covered. So that's \u2013 it's not a simple refresh. It's really a change into the whole infrastructure approach and also working together with traditionally negative from vendor cover, whether now working on end point as a mother part of a security. Now they're looking for some consolidation and they prefer, when they have multiple cover of a different part of infrastructure working together. So that you can see that the fabric approach we did a few years ago starting doing quite well and almost pretty much every quarter double the growth compared to the traditional network security. But now what they created, we also see more healthy growth and it's really not as expanding beyond the traditional border security approach, but also because the ASIC advantage, which increased the secure computing power 5 to 10 times compared to that the other vendors software loaded on the traditional CPU. So that's able to add a more function and also kind of increase performance, lower the cost, and also a low car park assumption, more green. So that that's actually making that this like the product worlds like we say that keeping us, keeping to better and better. And that we do see this whole infrastructure approach will keeping going for the next, probably a few quarters even to a few years. And the consolidation will keeping going within the industry. I can take the first part, maybe Keith got second half. I don't see any slowdown even for the FortiGate side. It is \u2013 we're keeping gain in market share, like I said because there's a fundamental like a technology architecture difference with 5 to 10 times the computing power compared to our competitor we can easily add a function performance and even for work-from-home is more like a one single with the box and replace like a three, four different box on an helping that security side, like of these apart, and also like manage home Wi-Fi and the traffic there. So that's also lot of company also starting to this kind of expand the branch to the home called home branch or whatever to meet working standard like a better networking, reliability, security to the whole environment. So that's also need to be the solution. That's also lot of the reason we see some of the low asset and keeping grow pretty fast. It's a look for a home actually helping driving some of this point of your sales. But also going forward whether the service provider some other after say most enterprise, not even kind of a change might after infrastructure to adapt is more work-from-home yet. They are still in the early stage. So we do see there's a big potential going forward. Yes, that's all, Keith. Yeah, it's really because most of the part that we develop internally from day one, it's making integrate operate together. So that's probably the key number one reason, customer want to buy is \u2013 we tried to consolidate, make it easier to manage. It's different than some other company when they acquire some part of our company from outside is that take a long time and more difficult to integrate. So we have internally developed from day one. We've been making working together. I see what I think the part of FortiGate. So we don't comment on non-FortiGate, but is we have like 20, 30 given product, touch all part of the infrastructure and the key said is difficult to point out which one is ready. Yes, it's a [indiscernible] I read the whole thing. I think similar like we comment in the last couple of quarters, it's a photo there like pandemic, once is starting get improving, also try to think about how to go back [indiscernible] mother. You mentioned infrastructure since we'll be studying across. So that's where like APAC [indiscernible] it'd be faster by U.S. catch up however quickly. Yes, we also will keeping your mass more into the U.S. for supporting further growth like we did for the PGA sponsorship and some things I think will be helping drive the growth in the U.S. I also, I can say a little bit similar question. We also kind of look at different market study and also what's the best model to do this with a partner together. I feel maybe similar like SD-WAN, but it's \u2013 but also SD-WAN is a part of the \u2013 part of a SASE solution and also SASE including some other function there, which we also want to have a like a better integration and better performance and that you need to manage. So that's where we take some time to launch our SASE and also more closely working with partner to do that. But it's a \u2013 the market definitely growing, but we also closely watching and what's the best way to position ourselves to catch the trend. Thank you. I probably hesitate to use some upper refresh compared to last time, you can see that 2012, 2013. And that's where it's the major firewall replacing the traditional firewall VPN, which was [indiscernible] firewall has them intrusion prevention, and anti-virus all the other functions. They're a proxy. But this time it's expanding into a much broader, bigger infrastructure both internal inside the company, and also go to the outside company that one side even expand work from home.  So it's more kind of expanding and same kind of different part of security also need to be more working together. So that's from company IT side, they look \u2013 if they can consolidate and help them to manage and integrate, automate will be more important. So that's where like I said, there's a multi-wise, more people connected and like a [indiscernible] it's a little bit different and that's where making \u2013 make a large, broad integrated approach, I feel is more important and same kind of supporting that than you technology that what are five GSP when, and also kind of, they be service model also would be, would be important, but we also feel once the product at, in the customer hand because the huge computing power to liquidity, we can also be add additional servers and keeping helping customers adopt the nuisance they need, and also be a service provider. So that that's also kind of keeping that the biggest \u2013 keeping growing in general. The traditional firewall all the way they are rarely being deployed. It's not going away. They also kind of, every five years probably need to be updated to the new motto to match and that working speed as a modern one, but they also expanding beyond that one and also need to be walking, not out of a security infrastructure, putting this way. Yeah. Thank you. Let us say, in the last few years for some point we used Zscaler as one of the service providers could be partnered. But also, some of the telecom companies, they do have their infrastructure and also some of their customer base, which we have been working with them for a long, long time. So, once, especially during the pandemic, IT has been in a high pressure to supporting whether internal or some other need being interesting. That's where SASE offers sort of more service-based approach which also kind of adopt based on [indiscernible] service provider quickly. So that's where we also leverage all kinds of relation with the partner and also our product technology, and vendors and offer much tighter, integrated SASE across network solution. Some bigger telecom partner they like it a lot, I put in this way.  So that's why we're continuing to work with them. So I do believe the business in the carrier service provider, when we go back to the number one like a few years ago, the high 20 that also have to work in closely with a partner and also some other infrastructure, a new infrastructure, I can mention whether the SD-WAN and the 5G or some other mode of IoT OT or even may be SIPG, or some other thing. I think there's a lot of potential which will result, how can a service provider do keep expanding the security business together. Yes, I think we try to give a little bit of color on that in the script, and I've used the term before that the growth being bookend if you will. Through the pandemic, you have quarters where SMB did well. And I think we provided some metrics there about large deals, deals over $1 million, which we think is a pretty good proxy for the success that we're seeing in the enterprise. I do think also the mid-segment is coming online for us a little bit stronger than maybe we saw in 2020. And we continue to believe that 2020 was an unusual year, both geographically and across customer segments. In terms of the cadence, in terms of how to sell the enterprise versus SMB, I would say absolutely, you make a large investment and it plays very well with the channel partners. There's no doubt about that the MSSPs, the carriers, et cetera. And in those channel partners oftentimes, particularly distributors, play a role in the enterprise. But to be successful there, you absolutely have to have a direct sales force that is helping to bring deals to those channel partners. And I kind of made a comment earlier about incumbency versus challenger. I think that's perhaps even more important than the geography where you're the challenger and you're trying to get mind share from some of those large key resellers that are linked together with some of the legacy firewall vendors. I mean, you've really got to partner with them, to bring deals to them and convince them with that strategy. And I think we're starting to see that track and take hold for us. Yes, I do believe SD-WAN will be a bigger, long-term market and we want to be the number one. And also like we do see a lot of potential even this work-from-home lot of enterprise had to do a lot of service provide [indiscernible], still where small percentage were early stage to using the SD-WAN. So that's where \u2013 and also, we have huge advantage using our SoC4 chip to supporting this like one-box solution which has about 20 times better performance and a much lower cost compared to the second nearest competitor. So that's where is there huge opportunity with the best technology and working closely with a partner towards keeping growing SD-WAN. So we do see there's a huge potential. And we are also trying to be the number one soon. We do have a lot of asking about how to secure internally whether within ourselves and company are obviously in the data center. But I have to say security still need a maximum company in power to process the traffic compared to large solution. My estimate probably usually it's 3,000 5,000 ton more company power needed. That's where so if we cannot solve that speed issue was a major other kind of a managed deployment, you show is still more difficult. That's also the AC takes more advantage may be five to ten times better performance computing power and then pass lower than other software-only approach. So, it's a lot of requests, but I have to say, it's not many solutions can need summer requests, because internal, whether with in a campus or within a data center, the network speed tend to be easily 10 to 100 times more faster than the one approach. I mean, the one connection. So that's where we are working with the customer or the partner directly. And also combined both the WAN security, and the LAN security and the whole infrastructure security is more important. But with today work-from-home with the Zero-Trust Network Access you have to be, make the whole infrastructure secure.  So, I see a huge market potential for the internal segmentation inside data center of campus security, but it's also a challenging job to meet a speed requirement, compared networking and also make sure it can easily be deployed and easily managed. Thank you. Yes, charging by the question, I think, I am going to look forward to you. Yes, great. I think also I probably not go to detail outside of number so far the non-FortiGate almost doubled FortiGate world in the last few years or so. I don't see any changing of the trend right now. But definitely from customer end goal it's a \u2013 they also asked what's the reason they really need to be more consolidate, make the whole infrastructure managers working together, all this kind of things, which are working quite well with us because we design the product. [Indiscernible] we are working 40 gig from day one. And then making a whole fabric working together to integrate, automate, all the security solution there. So that's where the \u2013 but also we see there's still small percentage customer has [indiscernible] to grow and the same time there's a new productivity coming up to working with 40 gig. So that's where we do see \u2013 we probably keep the trend, the non-FortiGate will keep and grow faster. And probably eventually even the business, maybe more than 40 gig, maybe in a few years. Yes, last year work-from-home is more like a patch, whatever they have. And without changing much of infrastructure this is definitely thinking, redesigning infrastructure where to leverage make a better technology like SD-WAN or some other, and at the same time making kind of a better solution in a zero-trust environment that's much more secure. So that's probably \u2013 but still in the early stage. We do see a lot of our gross potential there. But it's whole infrastructure changing compared to kind of last year, quicker like a patch solution. Yes, there are more spend beyond the traditional deployment. And also like a more device, multiple and more infrastructure need to be secure."

            "name": "Keith Jensen",
            "content": "Thank you, Ken. And to add to your comment, we should note that billings growth, product revenue growth and total revenue growth were each at five-year highs. Okay, let's start the more detailed Q1 discussion with revenue. Total revenue of $710 million was up 23% driven by industry-leading product revenue growth of 25%. Auto-driven growth was broad-based across geographies, Security Fabric products and use cases illustrating the market acceptance of our integrated, single platform, security strategy. Customer demand for security across their entire infrastructure and the diversity of our customer base. Product revenue growth was over 30% for both infrastructure and cloud fabric products. And all three geographic regions increased 20% or more. Demand for security fabric products was strong across all form factors, hardware, software, and virtual machines. The growth we experienced for product revenue was not the result of a few large deals, lower backlog or higher channel partner inventory levels. The product revenue growth also enables increases in services billings and future services revenue. In the first quarter service revenue of $470 million was up 22%. Support and related services revenue increased 23%, to $214 million. Security subscription services revenue increased 21% to $255 million benefiting from outsized growth from our cloud provider and SaaS security offerings. Moving to the mix of FortiGate and Non-FortiGate platform revenue, the FortiGate segment of the Fabric platform saw revenue increase 17% driven by demand for entry-level and high-end FortiGate products. High-end includes 10 new NP7 powered FortiGates that were introduced in the past week, which includes today's announcement of the 71.21F. These new products now represent approximately 20% of high-end FortiGate shipments. Our AC driven FortiGates give customers five to ten times more computing power than firewalls that run on common CPUs. The advanced computing power creates not only speed, but also the capacity to continue to add functionality to our operating system, driving our price for performance advantage. The Non-FortiGate segment saw revenue grow over 40% and now accounts for 31% of total revenue up four percentage points. The integrated security fabric solutions, consists of a complete range of form factors and delivery methods, including physical and virtual appliances, cloud, SaaS and professional software, as well as hosted and non-hosted solutions. Together, they provide a range of security solutions and form factors enabling integrated protection for hybrid environments and the expanding digital attack surface from the data center, to the endpoint, to the cloud. Given the strong first quarter performance \u2013 revenue performance, we believe our Non-FortiGate platform is now on a pace to be a $1 billion business this year, representing an acceleration of this milestone. Let's turn to revenue by geographies. As summarized on Slide 5, revenue in the Asia Pacific area increased 26%; EMEA revenue increased 25%; and Americas posted revenue growth of 20%. As I mentioned earlier, all three regions experienced product revenue growth of 20% or more. Moving to billings. The first quarter billings were $851 million, up 27%. We saw strong growth in both the FortiGate and non-FortiGate segments at a Security Fabric platform. The FortiGate segment delivered billings growth of 20%, accounting for 70% of total billings. As shown on Slide 6, entry-level FortiGate posted very strong billings growth in the quarter. The non-FortiGate segment accounted for 30% of total billings and delivered billings growth of 50%, driving a four-point year-over-year mix shift to non-FortiGate. Taking together, these data points highlight the market acceptance of our single integrated security platform strategy. In terms of billing growth by geos, APAC outperformed all geos followed by Europe, and the Americas. In the Americas, Canada had a very strong quarter and Latin America rebounded from the pandemic induced slowdown posted billings growth in the mid 20% range. Moving to billings by customer segments, the small enterprise segment posted solid growth across all geos. This segment is driven by new customer acquisitions, customer Security Fabric expansions, solid execution by our channel partners and the large diverse makeup of this international customer segment. At the same time, we saw strong growth in our larger deals. The number of deals of $1 million, increased 74% to 66 deals in the first quarter. The pipeline for deals of a $1 million looks good for the remainder of the year. As Ken noted, secure SD-WAN billings were 14% of total billings. SD-WAN as a key functionality and an integrated staffing solution. Moving to worldwide billings by industry verticals was another strong international performance. The worldwide government sector topped all verticals at 19% of total billings and was up 60%. Service providers and MSSPs accounted for 16% of total billings. The rebound for education accelerated. We've done this growth of 50%. Retail turned into a solid quarter with billing growth of 21%. Our strong and consistent billings and revenue performance over the past several years is testament to our geographic and customer diversity. The growing success with a single integrated security platform strategy and our ASIC advantage, which enables a shared operating system across the Security Fabric platform drives our price or performance advantage, increase the capacity to add features and functions while maintaining price points. Moving back to the income statement. As shown on Slide 4, total gross margin improved 10 basis points to 78.9%. Product gross margin improved 120 basis points to 62.6% benefiting from lower direct product cost. The increase in product gross margin offsets the drag on total gross margins from the revenue mix shift driven by the strong product revenue growth and a gross margin \u2013 and the gross margin FX headwind [indiscernible] about 25 basis points. Operating margin for the first quarter increased 210 basis points to 24.5%, benefitting from the strong revenue performance in the quarter. The benefit from lower travel and marketing program expenses are approximately 100 basis points. It was more than offset by an operating margin headwind from foreign exchange of about 150 basis points. To end the quarter \u2013 we end the quarter with total head count of 8,615, an increase of 16%.  Moving to the statement of cash flow summarized on Slide 7 and 8. Free cash flow for the first quarter came in at $264 million, up $22 million from the first quarter of 2020, despite a $24.5 million year-over-year increase in CapEx spending. We ended the year with total cash and investments of $3.1 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion. The increase includes the proceeds from our $1 billion investment grade debt issuance during the first quarter. The issuance followed our inaugural strong triple B credit ratings. Throughout the pandemic, we have leveraged the strength of our balance sheet as a competitive advantage to support our partners and customers as they experienced geo-specific economic challenges. As a result daily sales outstanding increased seven days to 81 days and in line with our expectations and reflecting our earlier decisions to provide geographically targeted extended payment terms. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, DSI was on the first quarter of 2021 decreased six days, as we saw early progress towards returning to pre-pandemic payment terms. Inventory turns declined to 2.1 times from 2.5 times, reflecting the efforts we took to mitigate supply chain risk, including increasing our inventory levels, starting earlier in 2020. We expect extended payment terms and higher inventory balances to be in effect as we move through 2021. Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $52 million, including $38 million related to construction and other real estate activity. We expect to begin moving employees and the new Sunnyvale campus building in the middle of the year. Although the timing will depend on local pandemic protocols and employee safety considerations. We estimate capital expenditures for second quarter between $30 million and $40 million for all of 2021 to between 150 and 179.  The average contract term in the first quarter was approximately 27 months, up less than two months from the first quarter of 2020, and down approximately one month from the fourth quarter of 2020. Secure SD-WAN accounted for 15 deals of $1 million versus four in the first quarter of 2020, and contributed to the increase in average contract term. As we look forward, our goal remains to balance growth and profitability. And given the growth opportunities we highlighted during the March Analyst Day and as confirmed in our first quarter results, we have tilted our bias towards growth for at least the next several quarters. The opportunities we see are supported by a strong pipeline, increased sales capacity and our development efforts, which include the NP7 chip and our new FortiOS7.0 operating system that was recently released. Now I'd like to review our outlook for the second quarter guidance summarized on Slide 9, which is subject to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the second quarter, we expect billings in the range of $860 to $880 million. Revenue in the range of $733 million to $747 million. Non-GAAP gross margins of 78.5% to 79.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 24.5% to 25.5%, which includes an expected 100 basis points to 150 basis points headwind in foreign exchange. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.83 to $0.88, which assumes a share count of between $168 million and $170 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 21%. Before raising our 2021 guidance, I'd like to congratulate every member of the Fortinet team for the truly outstanding start to 2021. For the 2021 we expect billings in the range of $3.685 billion to $3.745 billion, which at the mid point represents growth of approximately 20%. Revenue in the range of $3.080 billion to $3.130 billion, which at the mid point represents growth of approximately 20%. Total service revenue in the range of $2.020 billion to $2.050 billion, which represents growth of approximately 21% and implies product revenue growth of approximately 17%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 78% to 80%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 25% to 27%. When backing out the 2020 T&E benefit, the midpoint of the guidance represents a 50 to 100 basis point increase in 2021 operating margin, despite an expected headwind from foreign exchange. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.65 or $3.80, which assumes a share count of between $170 million and $172 million and about $0.07 per share impact in debt issuance. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 21%. [ph] We expect cash taxes to be approximately $80 million. And along with Ken, I'd like to thank our partners, our customers, and the Fortinet team for all their support and hard work in these difficult and unique times. Now I'll hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A. Well, I think the chip shortages \u2013 this is Keith, Rob. I think the chip shortages that you point out is can touch a lot of different industries. I think one thing about Fortinet in addition to having different form factors is the inventory balances that we carry, a two times inventory turns, you're looking at basically six months of inventory that we're carrying on our balance sheet. I do expect that the supply chain issues will be something particularly related to chips that will be a constant conversation points throughout 2021 and into 2022. But I think in terms of when we sit down and talk about our expectations for the year, I think we have a fairly good understanding of how to work that in. Yes, then I would just continue on with Ken's comments. I think the headline that he's talked about previously is that the back to work really the combination of back to work and many companies being in a hybrid model that the attack surface now seems to be permanently expanded for many, many companies. In terms of growth in how we see it with new logos and expansion opportunities, we easily add several thousand new customers every quarter. But if you look at the mix of billings, the mix of billings is going to come from our installed base of customers, if you will. And I think the simple model we'll look at is, from that initial sale of perhaps a firewall or something else. There's two different ways to expand. One is finding more and more use cases inside organizations for firewalls and increasingly displacement opportunities. And then the second is, and this is where Ken was going is the expansion opportunity where those non-FortiGate fabric partner products. And we're seeing there with that that mix shift from FortiGate to non-FortiGate, and now being 30% of our business, 31% of our business. I think it's taking as one affirmation of the strategy and two, you're seeing it in the numbers. Yes. Well, it's a little tough for me to look back at the second quarter of last year and where their billings growth was and the product revenue grew up and things that I was getting. I didn't feel like I was getting a tailwind from VPN or something like that in the second quarter of last year. That said I think we're very pleased with how the year continued to play out and in the growth numbers that we've provided. I don't know that, early on in the stages of work from home, but that was something that necessarily Fortinet participated in to the same level of maybe some of the other firewall vendors did. And then the second part of your question you'll be glad to know that Ken and Peter and I sit down every quarter and look at the fab and the non-FortiGate products and try and find the one that's really distinguishing itself. And we keep coming to the same conclusion each quarter. It's a rising tide lifting all boats. If not that any one product is really standing out more so than the other over an extended period of time. I'll just add on to that. Sterling, I think the \u2013 certainly for us that the markets are somewhat different. And maybe that comes into play a little bit, the European, the international part of the market. We are oftentimes you'll have the number one market share when the incumbent and particularly during the pandemic, I think incumbents have an advantage. I think in the U.S. perhaps we're a bit more of a challenger if you will. And I don't know that, a lot of CIOs and CTOs were focused on firewall refreshes in the second quarter and third quarter of last year and going through a competitive dynamics. And I think there's also a bit of the partner ecosystem. When you're the incumbent, you probably have more mind share with the partners. Then when you do with the challengers. Now, having said all that as we look forward, and we look at our pipeline, particularly in relation to the United States, as we go to the end of the second quarter here through the rest of the year. I think we're feeling very good about the direction of that organization is headed. I think you and Ken are kind of touching on same thing with, even in reference to, I would say it this way, it's going to get harder and harder. I think to discern industry refresh cycles, it compared to where it was maybe five or six, seven years ago for a number of reasons. One, the firewall vendors are simply larger. Their footprint is much, much bigger than it was before. Secondly, you have some of us sort of showing success on the platform strategy, when 30% of your billings are coming from the platform, again, to your point, it's going to get a little harder to discern it and the sheer size, if you will as the footprint in terms of customers, but also the number of different used cases that are starting to evolve and continue to evolve inside those organizations. I think all that comes together, it's going to get murkier and murkier ready to go forward, to find a refresh cycle. You may have some individual competitors that maybe have very, very large price points or machines or something like that, where they have their own internal refresh cycle that you may see some noise around, but that's really not the Florida approach for firewall refreshes. Yes, Adam, it sounds like you are listening in to some of the conversations that Ken and I have with our respective point of view, I think. I think we're really pleased with how the business executed in the first quarter, putting up 27% billings growth and being 11 to 12 points above, and then raising the 22%, 3.5 points on the billings line for the year, probably for the quarter and then taking the year up at the same time by about four points, I think, the level of execution is shown to be very, very high. And the level of success with the firewalls and the Non-FortiGate products have been \u2013 we're very, very pleased with what's happening there. I think we'll see how this year plays out. We felt that there were tailwinds coming into the year for us at a number of different ways, whether it was GDP, whether it was stimulus, whether it was the product suite that we had, or our sales team's ability to execute. And let's see how we do as we continue on this trajectory, hopefully through the rest of the year. Yes, I think \u2013 hi Fatima, nice to hear from you again. I think in terms of SD-WAN, the way we go to our budget and we would describe SD-WAN as you heard us before, SD-WAN is a use case for the firewalls, similar to OT micro-segmentation, zero trust, et cetera. And we're not necessarily prone to building our models, if you will, by used cases for the firewalls, nor similarly necessarily by products. We do look at our pipeline and we do sanity check against Gardner projections for growth and things of that nature to make sure that we're in the range, if you will. So, I would expect that. The other comment I would offer is Ken has been quite clear for setting the goal early on, that he wanted SD-WAN to be 5% of billings. And we got there and he moved it to 10%. And we got there and now he has moved it to 15%. So, it's a little bit of movement cheese, I guess for Ken, in terms of setting goals for us. But that's fine. We like that. And I think you really kind of answered your own question in terms of growth investments. Where we would spend money, I think, that carrier service provider opportunities for both SD-WAN and SASE are key areas for those investments. But I'll hand it back to Ken. Yes, there is a lot there. And answering no from me makes sense. How is that? Look I don't think the product service mix between \u2013 we would look about this and talking about previously, the FortiGate versus non-FortiGate, the product service mix is not different in any meaningful way, if you will, when you look at the mix. And again, we're selling solutions, so you're typically bundling that with a firewall cell. To see the Non-FortiGate billings, growth at that 50% number and seeing that the mix of the business, I think, obviously makes us very excited. It's actually a little bit counter-intuitive in terms of where itself. For the last several quarters the Americas has done very, very well with selling the Fabric. And I've been on phone calls with very large enterprises that want to know much more about the Fabric. Now that they've become comfortable with the firewall. I probably went into those conversations socket with much of the same expectation that you perhaps described, which is, that may be something that plays more to the SMB part of the business side of big enterprise. And I do think it does. I do think the enterprise willingness and in the U.S. you see the enterprise willingness to engage on the Fabric was probably a sign of a number of things. One is, at the end of the day, everybody has got a budget and this is a more cost-effective way to go about doing it. You can manage your infrastructure much easier perhaps with a single vendor strategy than you might otherwise. And I think the common operating system running on it or being integrated to OS/7 is something that's very exciting. And then you start talking to the vision about a SASE offering that's running on an integrated OS7 system, as well. So, I gave you a lot there. But to give color to it, I think, the long-winded response would be, it is not shown to be unique to a size of customer or to a geography. Then I'm broke. I think there was \u2013 I'm going to lead that the tough question or the fun question for Ken at the end which is, if you look out over 12 months, what's going to take off in non-FortiGate. Keith, I would probably point you back to if we didn't do it in Analyst Day in March, we didn't do it in the Analyst Day in November 19, where we gave some breakdown of the Fabric products between what we call cloud and what we call infrastructure. And you can think of that as being hardware to me help answer your question there. I think when you use the term attach rate, we may use the term penetration rate. And by that is, for a customer that's a firewall vendor, how many \u2013 or as you start looking at your expansion opportunity Keith inside these customers, what type of penetration are you seeing and how are you going to market, if you will, and encouraging the sales team and the marketing team to whatever that number is increasing the penetration. And I would say that's something that's really been an area of focus, I would say, for us more recently over the last couple of quarters. And I think that's really at the moment more of we're pleased with it, don't get me wrong. But I think right now that's more of an internal metric that we're using with our sales team and our marketing team. And to some extent with our engineering team. Yes, Michael, I would add to Ken's comments. I think the headline is whether the tailwinds coming to your security is top of mind for so many companies right now, so many CIOs and SIOs and whether that's solo wins, or it's work-from-home it was Microsoft, a little challenge is to ramp up a ransomware. It's just \u2013 it's a year, I think, that a lot of CIOs and SIOs are focused on security for a lot of different reasons. I do think that there was \u2013 for us in the U.S. market, if you will, and Ken has talked about this before, a little more difficult to say in the middle part of last year, it's kind of a year to get mind share from CIOs and SIOs to have a conversation about how you can save money while improving performance in their firewall. I think those opportunities are starting to appear more in terms of getting out and having customers take their prospects, take that meeting if you will. And I think there's also, some of these larger deployments that can go on for, well over a year or a couple of years, I think, some of those deployments, perhaps were a bit stalled if you will, last year and they are coming back online as we look at 2021. Is it the answer to which \u2013 are you asking if I'm seeing that the answer is yes, or you're asking if that's the driver of the business, I would say yes; if you're asking if that's be driver of the business, I don't think so. Yes. Yes, I think that, if you get comfortable with the business model, you understand the product and services and how very predictable that higher margin services revenue is. I think that we did take this as the opportunity to raise product revenue. We implied product revenue guidance, if you will, when you reverse engineer after we give the service revenue guidance by about five points. And I think that takes you to about 17% in terms of our guidance now for the full year. And we'll see how the year plays out. I think we feel good about it. In terms of linearity from Q1 to Q2, I would probably point you to one of our actual results that we had last year in Q1 and Q2. And our actual results in Q1 of this year and our guidance for Q2."

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference to your host, Mr. Peter Salkowski, Senior Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nPeter Salkowski: Thank you, Valerie. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Peter Salkowski, Senior Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations at Fortinet. I'm pleased to welcome everyone to our call to discuss Fortinet's financial results for the full-year and fourth quarter of 2022. Speakers on today's call are Ken Xie, Fortinet's Founder, Chairman and CEO; and Keith Jensen, our Chief Financial Officer. This is a live call that will be available for replay via webcast on our Investor Relations website. Ken will begin our call today by providing a high-level perspective on our business. Keith will then review our financial and operating results for the full-year and fourth quarter of 2022 before providing guidance for the first quarter of 2023 and the full-year. We'll then open the call for questions. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, and these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Please refer to our SEC filings, in particular, the risk factors in our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for more information. All forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation and specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements.

Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are located in the earnings press release and in the presentation that accompany today's remarks, both of which are posted on the Investor Relations website. Ken and Keith's prepared remarks for today's earnings call will be posted on the quarterly earnings section of our Investor Relations website immediately following the call. Lastly, all references to growth are on a year-over-year basis unless noted otherwise. I will now turn the call over to Ken Xie.\nKen Xie: Thanks, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our outstanding full-year and fourth quarter 2022 results. For the full-year, revenue growth accelerated to 33%. We continue to gain market share in the service security industry with customers increasingly recognizing how Fortinet integrate and a single platform approach to security delivers along total cost of ownership and a greater return on investment than competing solutions. Product revenue growth of 42% was very strong, making Fortinet a leading product revenue company in the cybersecurity industry with total product revenue of $1.8 billion. Our SD-WAN and OT bookings together accounted for over 25% of total bookings. And our goal is to keep growing and achieve #1 market share in network firewall Secure SD-WAN and OT security market over the next couple of years. For 20 years, Fortinet has made long-term strategies and investments around the convergence of networking and security. Yesterday, we announced our fifth-generation FortiSecurity processor, the FortiSP5. This new SoC base for the ASIC has secure computing power rating for major network security functions like Firewall to support 17x to 32x greater than the average of our competitor similar price model using general purpose CPUs and doubles the ASIC chip acceleration of applications to Forti such as New Trust, SASE, 5G and our SD-Branch with much better performance and efficiency. According to the most recent IDC data on unit shipment of firewall plants, Fortinet hold the #1 unit shipped market share position and 48%, providing Fortinet with an attractive economy of scale position us well as making it difficult for competitors to develop their own ASIC technology due to high entry barrier and significant investment that is required. Fortinet is a huge security computing power advanced advantages are able for the OS to integrate more security functions and applications than our competitors with much better performance and much lower energy consumption, resulting in a much lower total cost of ownership while offering easier operations for our customers. For example, a recent Forrester report highlighted that customers deploying Fortinet Secure SD-WAN solutions achieved a 300% return on investment over three years with a payback period of only eight months. Fortinet's substantial installed base of product with reach functions enable us to offer additional secure services, and upsell, integrated and automated for the Fabric Product Solutions. We recently announced several new and advanced services that help SoC team reduce their operations cyber-risk while being more efficient and handling cybersecurity issues. As networking and security continue to converge and consolidate, we believe we are well positioned to achieve our 2025 building target of $10 billion. Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners and suppliers worldwide for their continued support and hard work. Keith?\nKeith Jensen: Thank you, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. As we look back at 2022, we see the success of our strategy to lead in convergence and consolidation as well as the combined power of our ASIC technology with our integrated operating system. Combined, these efforts are driving our strong financial results. There's been an explosion of devices that must be connected to the cloud, data center and edge compute. As a result, the infrastructure has expanded to support secure connectivity via distributed firewalls, it is no longer feasible to overlay security on top of networking in the data center. They must be deployed as a converged solution. Firewalls need to work seamlessly with networking and security applications across the company's entire infrastructure. Fortinet is leading the convergence trend with a wide range of technologies, including network firewalls, Secure SD-WAN, 5G and OT security, all embedded in our single operating system delivered as hardware, software, cloud and as a service. Traditional CPU-based solutions are very inefficient as supporting both networking and security. That's why Fortinet developed proprietary ASIC technology to build an application-specific solution. Yesterday, as Ken mentioned, we announced our next-generation ASIC, the FortiSecurity processor or FortiSP5, which allows line speed convergence of networking and security at every network edge. The new seven nanometer technology combines existing NP7 technology with new content processor capabilities. Our enhanced platform suite of integrated products is delivering on customer demands for convergence, vendor consolidation, ease of management and lower operating costs. The success of this strategy is evident in our full-year 2022 results, and I'll start there. Billings passed the $5 billion mark, totaling $5.6 billion and growing 34%. While revenue totaled $4.4 billion, with growth accelerating to 32%, the fifth consecutive year of revenue growth of 20% or more. Driven by strong demand for our fabric and cloud security solutions, enhanced platform technology billings and revenue both increased over 40% to $1.8 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. And despite a challenging global supply chain environment, product revenue growth came in at 42%, our highest annual product revenue growth rate in over 10 years. Our product revenue growth was driven by the combined -- by the continued growth of our firewall use cases and the addition of over 23,000 new customers. Service revenue was up 26% to $2.6 billion, resulting in three consecutive years of accelerating service revenue growth rates. Gross margin was strong at 76.3% and operating margin outpaced our initial expectations, increasing 110 basis points to a new Fortinet record high of 27.3%. Our GAAP operating margin of 22% is one of the highest in the industry, and we continued our streak of being GAAP profitable every year of our 14-year history as a public company. Earnings per share increased 49% to $1.19. Free cash flow was a record at $1.45 billion. Free cash flow margin was 33% and adjusted for real estate investments, the free cash flow margin came in at 37%. And for the year, we repurchased approximately 36 million shares at a cost of $2 billion. Total deferred revenue increased 34% to $4.6 billion. Short-term deferred revenue increased 32% to $2.35 billion. Quarterly contract terms throughout the year were consistent with the year earlier periods, including the fourth quarter at 28 months. Before moving on to our Q4 results, I'd like to summarize our enterprise success and highlight a few seven figure deals from 2022. We saw great success during the year with our strategy to expand further into the large enterprise segment as the number of deals over $1 million increased over 55% to a record 546 deals and billings on these deals increased by over 70%. If we look at a few of our large deals of the year, let's start with the competitive upsell deal, Fortinet displaced a 11 different vendors by consolidating the customer's network to security functions on our Security Fabric. This worldwide wholesaler previously purchased secure SD-WAN and FortiProxy. Next on the list was a centralized network security solution that could be managed and deployed to its 400 global locations. This customer chose Fortinet Security Fabric for a selectable and integrated solution across multiple scenarios, including work from anywhere, perimeter security and data center segmentation. In another upsell deal, a leading global manufacturer was spun off and had to stand up the security and networking infrastructure separately. The newly created infrastructures included remote access, SD-WAN, application delivery control, authentication, endpoint, e-mail protection and switching. Keys to our win included our Zero Trust capabilities, a cloud-first SD-WAN strategy and the ease of integration and convergence across our platform suite. Lastly, in the new logo win, a large U.S. retailer with over 500 locations were struggling with a total cost of ownership of their legacy security architecture. Keys to this win included delivering a single pane of glass versus the multiple consoles they were using and replacing the competitors' firewalls with our FortiGate's, delivering URL filtering, WiFi security, and edge router replacement, all on our unified and integrated FortiOS platform. This customer reported anticipated savings of $29 million over five years. Turning to Q4 results, both billings and revenue delivered new Fortinet records with billings of $1.7 billion and revenue of $1.3 billion. Both metrics increased over 30%. The strong fourth quarter revenue performance reflects solid customer demand across both our core and enhanced platform technologies. In the fourth quarter, we added over 6,200 new logos, another new Fortinet record reflecting the support of our channel partners, the leverage they bring and the breadth of our worldwide customer base. Taking a closer look at the fourth quarter, billings growth of 32%, was driven by a 40% increase in enhanced platform technology billings, which accounted for over one-third of total billings. Total revenue growth of 33% was driven by a strong demand for core and enhanced technology platforms, which increased 26% and 47%, respectively. Product revenue grew 43% to $540 million. Service revenue was up 27% to $743 million, driven by strong product revenue growth and strength in our security subscriptions. Short-term deferred revenue grew 32% and represents eight consecutive quarters of accelerating growth rates. Total gross margin of 77.6% was driven by a 310 basis point increase in product gross margin to 65.2%. Several factors converged to drive our record high quarterly product gross margin, including legacy pricing actions, easing supply chain cost pressures and improved discounting. Service gross margin of 86.7%, ticked down 40 basis points due to increased labor cost and our expansion in cloud services and the related hosting costs. Operating margin of 32.5%, was up 400 basis points year-over-year due to the strong gross margin performance and FX benefit. Looking to the statement of cash flow summaries on Slides 11 and 12. Free cash flow was $497 million, adjusted free cash flow, which excludes real estate investments was $510 million, representing a 40% adjusted free cash flow margin. Cash taxes were $63 million, capital expenditures were $31 million, including $13 million for real estate investments. DSO increased 14 days sequentially and year-over-year to 89 days, also impacting service revenue growth. Moving to guidance. We believe the continued innovations we made in building our platform enables our customers' digital transformation journey. And as Ken noted, customers are increasingly recognizing how Fortinet is integrated and single platform approach to security can deliver a lower total cost of ownership and a greater return on investments than competing solutions. Now I'd like to review our outlook for 2023, summarized on Slide 15, which is subject to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the first quarter, we expect billings in the range of $1.415 billion to $1.465 billion which at the midpoint represents growth of 24%. Revenue in the range of $1.180 billion to $1.220 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 26%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%; non-GAAP operating margin of 23% to 24%, which at the midpoint represents an increase of 150 basis points. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.27 to $0.29, which assumes a share count of between $795 million and $805 million, capital expenditures of $80 million to $110 million, non-GAAP tax rate of 17%, cash taxes of $20 million. And should also note that first quarter guidance assumes backlog decreases slightly during the quarter. For the full-year, we expect billings in the range of $6.710 billion to $6.790 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 21%. Revenue in the range of $5.370 billion to $5.430 billion which at the midpoint represents growth of 22%. Total service revenue in the range of $3.335 billion to $3.365 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 27%, it implies a fourth consecutive year of accelerating service revenue growth. The service revenue guidance also implies product revenue growth of 15%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%, non-GAAP operating margin of 25% to 26%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.39 to $1.41, which assumes a share count of between $805 million and $815 million. Capital expenditures of $400 million to $450 million due to continued investments in clouds, data centers and facilities. Non-GAAP tax rate of 17%, cash taxes of $375 million, split somewhat evenly between the first and second half of the year. The increase in cash taxes reflects recently effective R&D capitalization and amortization requirements. The full-year estimate assumes backlog approaches historical levels by the end of the year. Cybersecurity, but not immune to economic slowdowns is expected to remain a comparatively safe harbor. And with a strong business model and history of execution, we are confident that our market share gains will continue. We remain on track to achieve our 2025 financial targets, which include billings of $10 billion, revenue of $8 billion, non-GAAP operating margin of at least 25%, and adjusted free cash flow margin in the mid to high 30% range in 2025. And with that, I'll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A session.\nPeter Salkowski: Thank you, Keith. Operator, please open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Open up the call, please. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Essex of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nBrian Essex: Great. Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for taking the question. And congrats on some solid results and a solid guide. I guess given that we heard from one of your peers last night and they were I guess, markedly more conservative or cautious on the macro than you seem to be. Maybe for Ken and Keith, could you help us understand what you're seeing in the market from a macro perspective, how enterprises are spending. And how does any changes in the quarter relative to initial expectations pan out with regard to demand, we're seeing sales cycles. We're hearing about sales cycles elongating and budget scrutiny ongoing. What are you seeing on your side?\nKen Xie: I took a question feedback from some customer partners. Their budget is tight, but Fortinet solution has a better cost of total cost ownership and also kind of even cost saving for some like a Secure SD-WAN solution. And at the same time, we do see -- the use case of firewall expanding much broader than before, especially for this OT security, some other area, which pretty much, I'd say, network security may be the only solution to secure some of this OT area. So that's where we see the demand is still pretty strong. And so we probably -- we're keeping gaining more market share in this well fragmented market.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. Thanks, Ken. I spot on with that. I would also add, look, I think we're all sensitive to the overhang from the macro environment and what that may mean is [indiscernible]. But when we look at our internal numbers, whether it's pipeline growth and even if we compare what pipeline growth is today versus a year-ago, it's even up in terms of percentage growth rates. The use cases, and I think in this environment, the savings that we offer and the ROI that we provide and some of the case studies that we provided in the call there are examples of that. I think we're continuing to benefit from that, and we do see that continued opportunities for market share gains even in this environment.\nBrian Essex: Got it. Maybe just for a quick follow-up then, Keith. As you think about the level of conservatism in your fiscal '23 guide, I mean, stronger than, I think some had expected. I know I'm going to get the question tomorrow how much conservatism is in there. What gives you confidence in hitting that kind of level of performance, particularly with regard to billings. And then any change to your 2025 targets as you kind of look at the strength that you're seeing in the market from here on out?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think that the approach that we take, if you will, is consistent this time around with what we've done in prior years, but with certainly added conservatism in it to reflect what's happening or what may happen with the macro environment. And first and foremost, we start with the pipeline and looking at the pipeline growth there and the kind of the timing of the pipeline and making sure that we have deals that are teed up for the middle of the year and perhaps even to the second half of the year. So there's ample opportunity there. You also want to make sure that you've got sales productivity numbers that make sense and sales capacity numbers that make sense. Yes, I think there will be some tailwind from the backlog, which I commented on in the comment that we're going to get some benefit from that as it continues to burn down. But keep in mind that we have seen some changes in cancellation rates, and I think we've added a significant amount of conservatism there around cancellation rates. Again, so I think it's really about the pipeline, it's the tailwind that we have and it take us the advantages that we're offering and total cost of ownership in this environment.\nBrian Essex: Okay, that's super helpful. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani of Citi. Your line is open.\nFatima Boolani: Hey, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. Keith, for you, just with respect to the services revenue guidance at 27%. That's not a material difference from the cadence you've been running at this year. And I'm curious what sort of input embed that revenue segment for you? And I ask because we have the dynamic of some of your customers delaying their subscription registrations over the course of '22. And then we also have the dynamic of a lot of your customers not having realized the pricing increases that you've expected in the last 12 to 18 months. So I'm curious as to why with those positive inputs, you -- we wouldn't see better services growth. And what sort of things that you're being conservative about there? And then a quick follow-up, please.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think it kind of goes back to Brian's question a moment ago in terms of -- with the level of conservatism and caution that's in the guide. And I know that historically, I've often complained that I don't get much room in the services line from where the consensus is versus what I'm forecasting. At a 27% number, I think that's pretty much right on top of what the street of that for the full-year. And I think in this macro environment, I think that's a great -- a good place for us to be at this point of the year for full-year guidance.\nFatima Boolani: Understood. And any commentary on operating margin and operating profitability performance because we are seeing compression into next year, certainly on a quarterly basis. But anything to be mindful of there as it relates to maybe onetime items that are peeling out just perhaps why not see better follow-through in profitability? And that's it for me. Thank you.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. Yes, I think our guidance is pretty much in sync with where we are historically at this point in time and consistent what we always talked about the 25% margin number. But I think the -- what you may be suggesting or inferring is really, it's all about FX, if you will, when you look at 2022 compared to 2023. We had a nice benefit from FX in 2022. And I think in terms of what our assumptions are for 2023, like the rest of people, we read the economic reports from the big banks and so forth and what the dollar is expected to do. And I think we've really pulled out a lot of that benefit by the end of this year. And so you're not really going to see that in the year-over-year comparison.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia of Barclays. Your line is open.\nSaket Kalia: Okay, great. Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions here. Maybe first for maybe a question for both Ken and Keith. Clearly, SD-WAN and OT are becoming a bigger part of the business and that too with higher growth rates. And so maybe the question is, how do you folks think about the growth rate or runway for growth in those two businesses either separately or together, over the next couple of years, as part of the total growth equation or part of the $10 billion goal, however you want to think about it, but really curious about that SD-WAN and OT part of the business that's been doing so well.\nKen Xie: I think there is two parts. First, I totally agree with you said that SD-WAN and the OT market growing faster than the network security average. And on the other side, we do believe our solution has huge advantage compared to other competitors. So both SD-WAN, OT market is still pretty fragmented and compared to our home growth integrated solution and leverage for the ASIC company and power. So advantage much huge compared to other competitors, quite some mostly come from acquisition. And at the same time, they don't have the ASIC help to increase speed, lower the cost and the power consumption. So that's why we feel we're keeping growing above the market, so above the market growth rate. There's a different research about how the market is growing. But I do agree it's a fast-growing market compared to the cybersecurity space and there will be a lot of potential going forward.\nSaket Kalia: Got it. Got it. Very helpful. Keith, maybe just a quick follow-up for you. Actually, great to see the billings duration stay roughly similar. I'm curious if you could just talk anecdotally or just specifically just around how you're thinking about billings duration here in '23? And whether that's been something that you feel like customers have pushed on given the interest rate environment that we're in?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I don't think that we've really seen customers push on the term. Obviously, at 28 months -- 28 months, which is kind of been keeping where we've been historically. But I do think in the fourth quarter, we certainly had conversations with customers that were I think perhaps even more focused on cash flow, if you will, than they were on discounting in terms of extended payment terms and that sort of thing. So if I were to look at the -- what I'm hearing back from customers, it was all about cash protection. And with that, I assume if I were trying to do a lot of five-year deals or something like that, I might have felt more pressure. But given the SMB mix of our business and our partner footprint, obviously, didn't come through in the numbers really.\nSaket Kalia: Yes, absolutely. Great to see. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Hamza Fodderwala of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nHamza Fodderwala: Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. Good evening. Keith, I wanted to clarify something you said about the cancellation rates. I think you mentioned that you're seeing some changes there. Can you maybe elaborate on that a little bit? I think like the past few quarters, it's been around 4%, 5%. Just if you could provide any more color on that comment?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. We did see a pickup to if we want to call it mid-single digits in Q3, we saw it tick up to high-single-digits in fourth quarter -- in the fourth quarter. And we've anticipated this, particularly as the backlog starts to shift its mix as the firewalls. There's still a significant amount of firewalls in the backlog, but it really now has tilted towards the network equipment, the switches and the access points. And so as you would expect, one last comment on that, as we see the shift in the mix in the backlog as well as the pick-up in the cancellation rates, I would also offer that as part of the guidance setting process, I think we've taken a fairly conservative approach to cancellation rates on what they -- how they may impact 2023 or said another way, we're not expecting all the backlog that exists at the beginning of the year to convert in 2023 because we think there'll be some cancellations.\nHamza Fodderwala: Got it. And just maybe a follow-up for Ken. I think SD-WAN is now nearly a $1 billion business for Fortinet which is quite remarkable because you just started selling it, I think, maybe four years ago. I'm curious as more of that base starts to come up for refresh. What are other monetization drivers do you see for SD-WAN, whether it be attaching more services or perhaps increasing the price points. I'm curious how you're thinking about that?\nKen Xie: Definitely more service, whether under the overlay service for SD-WAN because our SD-WAN has all the security function and also a lot of -- deployed case whether supporting work from core from anywhere or kind of helping enterprise reduce their total cost of networking all these things. We do see a lot of additional service they need. At the same time, we also see the service provider starting more working together with us, offer some quite additional service beyond -- that's the traditional SD-WAN. So that's also helping drive much more service going forward.\nHamza Fodderwala: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrad Zelnick: Great, thank you very much and congratulations on just blow out results and guidance, a nice job. My first question is just around the new ASIC FortiSP5. Can you remind us what if any impact we might expect in terms of customer purchasing patterns and what you've seen in the past and the extent perhaps it can drive accelerated demand and/or maybe the risk of trade-down effect? And I've got a follow-up. Thanks.\nKen Xie: Probably want to take some time, I'd say, maybe one to two years to refresh the product. And that's where every quarter, we tend to release one or two products, whether leverage new ASIC or the new CPU of Smarter network chip in the industry. I don't feel it will be a significant impact up and down of the result and will be more smooth transition. Because security deployment is a kind of a -- take long time to design, evaluate, deploy and also very, very long sales cycle. At the same time, the life cycle of the product also tend to be quite long, like seven to 10 years. So that's where the ASIC each generation definitely will help in and at the same time has a huge advantage compared to using general-purpose CPU. So that's where we're keeping gaining market share. But consider the switching costs, consider the long cycle, sales cycle and deployment cycle. And also, we also need time to put ASIC into a new product, which also taken in a few months, three to six months, thus I do see it will be like a more long-term positive impact instead of short-term.\nKeith Jensen: Yes, Brad, I would only offer again for context. I think that -- this is what Fortinet has been 20 generation. It's a chip probably now we think content processors and network processors and systems-on-a-chip. And I think that Fortinet, Ken and Michael have actually shown the ability to transition through those generations of chips. And if you look back at the financials, I think it's a little bit difficult to find a year that for a period of time, really saw spike because of the new chip. These are much more long-term plays. And I think the approach here is to execute in a smooth fashion over a number of years.\nBrad Zelnick: Thanks for the reminder and Keith, can you just expand on your comments around DSOs being up sequentially year-on-year and the impact of services revenue? And related to that, I recall you had a change in policy around subscription activations. Is that also impacting services revenue. Any help there would be great. Thanks.\nKeith Jensen: Yes, the change in activation policies started February last week, I believe, February 1. So we'll start to see that going forward. What I was referring to is the -- is really all about linearity, right? That's what it gives you insights to. And if I see my DSO go from, call it, 75 days to 89 or 90, you can kind of start doing the math there and see that's a 20% increase in DSO, and it's really driven by how linearity came through in the quarter. And when linearity starts shifting that much, we lose the opportunity to gain service revenue from sales early in the quarter that would normally activate. So we really didn't get a lift in service revenue from in-quarter deals the way that we would have expected because of linearity.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal of Cowen. Your line is open.\nShaul Eyal: Thank you. And good afternoon and congrats on the great performance and guidance. Keith, given the slightly lower-than-expected 4Q service revenue, how should we be thinking about the first quarter service revenue growth?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think that we kind of remain truthful to or faithful to the notion of providing service revenue guidance for the full-year and kind of leave the Street work out the numbers from that point going forward. I think that certainly, as we kind of look at laying out the year and with the backdrop of the macro that we're all concerned about, I don't think we really wanted to push too hard on some of the metrics that we didn't need to push on. And I think where we ended up with is pretty consistent in the quarter with our consensus when we look at our internal allocations between product and service revenue.\nShaul Eyal: Understood. And maybe one more. As we think about the non-GAAP operating margins and really great performance, should we be thinking of the target to be sort of an average of 25% over the period or a floor of 25% over the course of the next few years?\nKeith Jensen: I'm going to answer yes. Yes, you should be thinking about one of those two ways. Look, I think we're driven by being above 25% operating margin, right? I think the ones that -- the last few years have taught us is life full of surprises. And so locking into a fixed commitment is a little bit challenging sometimes. But clearly, we manage the business as if it's the floor.\nShaul Eyal: Understood. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Borg of Stifel. Your line is open.\nAdam Borg: Thanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe for Ken or Keith, just on sales headcount. Obviously, you guys have been aggressively growing sales and marketing headcount in recent years, and it's nice to see the enterprise success you talked about. Just curious where we are in sales force productivity. And how we should think about sales headcount growth and even overall headcount growth in '23? And I have a follow-up.\nKen Xie: Yes, we are continuing hiring. But at the same time, we want to keeping the efficiency and is not dropping the efficiency for the sales and marketing. And at the same time, there's some long-term investment, whether in R&D, the infrastructure supporting, we will continue to need to make. So that's why we do expect the total head count will keep it increased, but probably the rate that just like the last few years will be below the top line increase.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think just building Ken's comment one of the notes that we do track tenure. We talked about it last quarter. Tenure [ph] would be people that have been here for, say, people have been here more than six months. And I commented last quarter, the tenure was up, I think, eight points. It's actually moved back to historical norms now. And tenure is kind of a key component of productivity as we see -- as we go forward.\nAdam Borg: Got it. And maybe just a quick follow-up just on the FortiGate and entry mid and high. It's nice to see really strong midrange growth is interesting at the high end leased by my math was the lowest mix since 2017. Just curious if anything to comment there. Thanks so much.\nKen Xie: That sometimes depend on certain like products or backlog. I think that's probably the average still pretty similar. We don't see much, but sometimes from quarter-to-quarter, it may change a little bit. But I have to say the total mix is still pretty much the same.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think that's one of the challenges you have in the current environment and the supply chain was really doing funny things, if you will, into delivery, and we don't give you a lot of insights to orders that we were taking in, but we provide billings numbers, you get some distortion there just simply based upon what's available. Specifically, we saw a significant amount of availability of the 100F products, if you will, which are a midrange product. And you're seeing that availability came in the fourth quarter, and it shifted that mix in the way you just described it.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nTal Liani: Hello. Thank you. There's going to be one day call that no one is going to butcher my name, and I'm going to be very happy. But I wanted to ask you two things. First of all, could you provide a backlog for 4Q or anything about it? I'm trying to calculate the bookings for the year and what happens to bookings? And any color on backlog would be great. And the second question, a few people asked you about the services growth for next year. I want to ask you about the product growth. The product growth is going from 42% to 15%, if my math is right, from last year to next year to this year. And on the other hand, your commentary is positive. It's -- there's more activity, there's more product sales. So can you take us through the dynamics of product growth and also the connection, the relationship between services and products. Thanks.\nKeith Jensen: Yes, I'll start with the last one first, if you will. I think that I think we are very excited about the opportunities in front of us in terms of how the company is executing. But we are certainly also very cognizant of the unknown of the macro environment. And I think there's just an opportunity here in terms of how we guide for the full-year to really bake in concerns around the macro and how it may manifest in the coming months -- coming quarters. So I think you're seeing that, and I kind of made a comment earlier that historically, it's been tough for me to be somewhat cautious on service revenue because it's so visible. We're looking at short-term deferred revenue and the conservatism oftentimes ends up in product revenue. I think there's still an element of that in this conversation.\nKen Xie: Yes, I think for the backlog like what I said in the last one or two quarter, it's continued shifting to the network area, network and the Wi-Fi which is more industry standard product. I'd say probably today, most of the backlog will come from the network side and the Wi-Fi side, which has a higher cancellation rate. And -- so that's where like Keith has mentioned, we take a pretty, when it's positive conservative, but that definitely pretty good estimate what will the impact for the whole year on all these -- the backlog for the product revenue. And product revenue, definitely, we see probably going forward, the benefit of the new ASIC and also some of the new products that were helping and also some of the case, the use case -- additional use case of the firewall definitely also are helping, but it will take some time. So that's where we tend to be more careful to forecast. At the same time, we do see long-term, we still have a huge advantage compared to other competitors because the investment we made in the product, in the hardware, in ASIC give us huge advantage of the total cost of ownership towards container keeping gaining market share in that space.\nTal Liani: And do you provide some numbers about the backlog or maybe how material it is to revenues as a percentage of revenues?\nKen Xie: I think it's -- since it's been a large difficult to forecast at the same time, with the change in cancellation and also most of the backlog related to networking WiFi not a core product. So that's where, since last quarter, we no longer provide detail of the backlog, we feel that could be a little bit misleading if we keep in providing that.\nKeith Jensen: I think we can add over some directional comments here with it. So the headlines would be that backlog was up year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter it was down. But as you start thinking through how to treat the backlog in terms of doing your own models going forward, again, we would come back and remind you of a couple of things. We expect the cancellation rates are going to increase, and that's baked into our guidance, as we look at things. And when we say return to historical norms in the commentary, I think we probably would have three years ago had backlog for professional services and training that may have been in the $30 million range. So maybe with growth now you're probably looking at a steady state that could get you over $40 million to $50 million. So just a note of caution, they'll just take all that backlog and assume it's all going to convert into billings and revenue in 2023 given those dynamics.\nTal Liani: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nIttai Kidron: Thanks. Hey guys. Nice quarter. Keith, I was wondering if you could do a little bit of a deeper dive for us into the enhanced part of your business, if there's a way for you to kind of break it down a little bit for us by product. And perhaps rank order for us, categories which are growing above the average for the category and below the average for the category. I would just like to get a little bit more color as to the change in mix within that?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I don't know that I've really seen a change in the mix, if you will. I think the -- when you look at the -- what we call the FortiManager, FortiAnalyzer. And certainly, the virtual machines are doing very, very well. And then as you start looking at the tail of the fabric products in the -- on the areas of EDR and monitor and SIM and so on and so forth, I think that they're smaller dollar totals, but sometimes very dramatic and exciting growth rates. So I want to be a little bit careful about getting -- painting anybody in too great a light in terms of their contribution because everybody is contributing. Certainly, the networking equipment part of the business has done very, very well, and this is a key component of this convergent story that we've talked about, and it remains probably about one-third of the fabric business.\nIttai Kidron: Got it. Excellent. And then just going back to the cancellation rate, just to make sure I understand this. How much of this is tied into supply chain, meaning of supply chain? Is it getting better availability is no longer an issue? Customers are less perhaps interested in getting too far ahead in line and waiting for product. How much of that is a factor in this?\nKen Xie: The supply chain environment definitely have some improvement for networking for the WiFi. That's where sometimes a customer, they may have a multiple order to see which vendor can deliver because a lot of networking equipment WiFi is a pretty standard product. Even for us, we do add quite some security functions in there. But at sometimes customers just cannot wait. So that's where we see a little bit higher cancellation rate with -- I think right now, the overall supply chain environment, I think is improving.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think the conversation around cancellation rates, a few things there. We said it went from mid single-digits to high single-digits. And then as we built into the guidance, it is a multiple that we built in the guidance of what we just saw in the fourth quarter. What we actually get out of it, we'll see. But the reason to be so cautious about it is what Ken is talking about. We knew that we had an advantage with firewalls and dealing with our suppliers and our vendors and we thought we'd be successful in pushing down that component of backlog first. And indeed, the mix has shown that. I think it's now something on the order of about 75%, 25% between networking equipment and firewalls still firewalls in the mix. But as Ken pointing out is there may be more risk with that networking equipment of cancellations as we go forward, and particularly its a backlog deal for those elements continue to age out a little bit as we move through this process. In terms of continuing supply chain challenges, I'm not quite sure I was making the length on that. I don't -- I guess that would have an impact on the continuing to build of backlog. But as we said in our comments, we really expect to get to a backlog number by the end of this year that's much more closely aligned with our historical norms.\nIttai Kidron: Very good. Thanks. Good luck.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nAndrew Nowinski: Okay. Thank you. Just two quick questions. First, I want to ask a question on EMEA. You've had five quarters now of accelerating growth in Europe, and that seems to defy the macro trends that we consistently hear about in Europe. Just wondering if there's something specific in your portfolio that might be driving that strong growth in Europe?\nKen Xie: I think we definitely have a pretty long tenure and a good team there. And at the same time, the case, the firewall case also expand quite well in Europe, in some countries there. And some of the service provider carrier, they are a little bit more ahead compared to some bigger service provider were the U.S. on moving some new solutions, including some 5G SD-WAN. So that's where we continue to see some good growth there. Also, we kind of surprisingly even during the recession, the SMB sector growing quite strong compared to some enterprise. Enterprise more about how to lower the cost ownership, protect some of their own kind of profit margin. But SMB, they do see the importance of cyber security, especially in retina were they are starting more targeted SMB right now. So we do see quite strong growth in SMB and so that's also helping some regions in Europe.\nAndrew Nowinski: Got it. Okay. And then I wanted to ask about gross margins. So you talked about easing cost pressures and lower discounting as some of the levers that drove that better-than-expected gross margin. I guess, number one, how sustainable do you think those factors are as we look into fiscal '23? And then when you launched new ASIC, like you did earlier today, is that a headwind to gross margin initially?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think a few things we talked about price benefits, the discounting and then some easing of the impact of the supply chain. I think the price benefit is something that will obviously stay with us in the future. And so we should still get a tailwind from that. However, discounting and supply chains, call it, savings for lack of a better term, that's what we relate to our history of price increases. And I think we kind of reached a very kind of maybe the high watermark in terms of being -- having price increases covering those costs, and that will start to settle back down to a more normalized pattern going forward. Meaning that we'll still have inflationary cost increases, but we've really slowed down the price benefits, the price increases. So net-net, price increases continue, discounting and supply chain benefits may not.\nAndrew Nowinski: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Raymond McDonough of Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.\nRaymond McDonough: Hi, thanks. Maybe for Ken or Keith. The last time we saw product growth accelerate for two years was back in 2014 and '15, you had two really strong years of product growth, and that was followed by a pretty sharp deceleration of growth over the next two years. And I understand the business is a lot different than it was back then, but there does seem to be some similarities, at least how it relates to the macro environment and your results obviously point to you guys navigating it, the macro quite well. But you did reiterate your '25 guidance, which I believe implies mid-teens product growth. So I guess the question is, why should we think this time is different? Is it just that you have a significantly larger portfolio of solutions? Is it broader acceptance from customers willing to consolidate networking and security functionality. Any comparisons or contrast you can provide specifically as it relates to product growth versus, if you will, the previous cycle would be helpful.\nKen Xie: I think in the 2014, 2015 last the outbreak of a weather target so many case, which a lot of enterprise tried to upgrade from the traditional connection-based firewall to the next-gen firewall, which including some prevention and other things. So that's where it's more like kind of refresh more in the enterprise area. So we do see some strong growth there after the severe issue. And then by this time, we see there's a few things. One is really during the pandemic, there's a new infrastructure build supporting a homework anywhere. At the same time, the ransomware attack quite broadly hit the whole industry. And another part, we keep on seeing the convergence, which is like SD-WAN, the 5G, the WiFi and also internal segmentation. So that's a much broader used case of the firewall deployment and also including OPG, a lot of more devices being connected. So we feel this time it is really kind of a more broad firewall used case kind of apply to the whole infrastructure. That's what we kind of more emphasized the convergence is a little bit different than the last time it's like eight, nine years ago. So that's why we feel this time probably will be more smooth transition because the traditional firewall, whatever will not go away. And at the same time, that's more used case convergence into the traditional networking area, expanding to the OT some other area, we're helping keeping driving the product revenue growth and then followed by the additional service revenue. So that's the chance we're planning.\nRaymond McDonough: That's helpful. And if I could, maybe a follow-up. You talked a little bit about the momentum in large deals and enterprise deals in '22. But given the macro environment, could you compare and contrast maybe Keith or Ken behavior you're seeing from larger customers and maybe those on the smaller end of the spectrum. Are you seeing more deal delays upmarket, more propensity to consolidate functionality at the lower end? Anything -- any more color would be helpful.\nKen Xie: Yes, it's definitely helping the customer lower the total cost of ownership, both on the management cost and also on the product service cost, which we have here an advantage over the competitors. So that's where we see a lot of a big enterprise customers. They definitely want to -- when they see the renewal, when they see all this -- need to add additional protection for the infrastructure, we do see this like how to have a better total cost of ownership and at the same time, leverage a single integrated platform, automated platform to offer better security networking together. Even there's a trend to merge the traditional network operating team and security operating team together to making the stock and not kind of combined together and also converge on the traditional networking and security together. So we do see some trends happening in the big enterprise and which we kind of developed technology and the long-term investments starting to see. I mean, stating benefit for the trend.\nKeith Jensen: Great.\nRaymond McDonough: Yes, go ahead.\nKeith Jensen: Like everybody else, I mean, you're reading about people talking about deals taking longer to get across the finish line and more approvals and so forth. And I don't think we were immune to that by any stretch of the imagination. Keep in mind as we're going through as the world is moving through this. At the same time, Fortinet's kind of expanding from just seven figure deals. And I think we talked about 546 seven figure deals or more last year, if I remember correctly, a huge number. Now adding more and more eight figure deals. So I think we're probably seeing huge opportunities, but we're also getting exposed to how that approval process works and how we manage with our sales team, our customers through that process.\nRaymond McDonough: Great. Thanks for the color and congrats on the strong results.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Tindle of Raymond James. Your line is open.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. Thanks. Good afternoon. Keith, I wanted to start with pricing. I think we picked up if we got this right, another pricing increase announced in January effective in February. Wondering if you could touch on the rationale and early response to that -- where are we in the elasticity of demand? And thinking forward, obviously, costs are ultimately going to normalize, hopefully, in your model. What would be the strategy for you once costs normalize, would you reduce price or capture margin? Thanks.\nKeith Jensen: Yes, on that part first. I mean I think we'll continue to monitor the market and make the appropriate adjustments there. I don't seeing inflation go backwards it's probably not something that's happened a lot in history, but it could happen, I guess. In terms of the most recent price increase that we talked about, it's almost a non-event to me. It's extremely low single-digits growth and after discounting, it's a fraction of an interest point.\nAdam Tindle: Got it. Okay. And then maybe just as a follow-up for Ken. I wanted to ask on SASE competition. When your main competitors has said they've integrated their SASE offering with SD-WAN and Secure Web Gateway in particular. They're pushing that sales motion across the entire sales force now. As we think about Fortinet, obviously, very strong in SD-WAN, but that Secure Web Gateway or proxy piece is perhaps not as prevalent or a different strategy. It's clearly not impacting your unit market share at present, but just thinking forward to competing and differentiating in SASE now that your competitor really pushing that motion across the entire sales force? Thank you.\nKen Xie: Yes, I think we -- our strategy, like [indiscernible] seeing in the last few years is; first, we want to have a SASE or integrated in the same system, the same OS, including all the SD-WAN or the SASE function. So making SASE can be more easily broader deploy and also working with service provider to leverage their infrastructure to offer a SASE. So it's a little bit different than some of the SASE players right now in the market. So we do believe this is highly integrated the single system as will be more efficient and same time will be more secure. And so that's what we're keeping building and whether the new FortiASIC [indiscernible] and also the new FortiOS reflect all this kind of development we reported into the solution. At the same time, we're keeping working closely with pretty much all the carrier service provider, even cloud provider to offer SASE together. And that's also a little bit different strategy compared to some other SASE player. So we do believe long-term leverage infrastructure, a lot of our own service provider telecom provider had will be much more efficient than the profit model compared to some of the SASE solution or player kind of losing money, which will be difficult to last long. So that's what we will keeping invest in this area. And also, we want to be a long-term player in this space and also we'll be keeping internal innovation R&D and keeping driving this space.\nAdam Tindle: Very helpful. Thanks and congrats on the year.\nKen Xie: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Bollin of Cleveland Research. Your line is open.\nBen Bollin: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Could you share a little bit of what is happening with respect to the cloud infrastructure build-out. Tell us a little bit about what you're doing, where you are in the progress and customer response thus far? And then I had a follow-up on the networking category.\nKen Xie: Yes. We continue keeping building of the infrastructure, including the cloud. Also our strategy a little bit different than 100 players we tend to build out ourselves just like we -- you can see the investment in some of the real estate. Quite some of that also go to the -- like a data center infrastructure that give us much better cost and also more long-term benefit just like how we -- the investment made in early real estate kind of benefit our office cost, rental costs. So that's where we're using the cost saving we get from this rental keeping invest into some more long-term infrastructure real estate. We do see that we're keeping benefit the company a long time. But at the same time, like I said, also partner working with car service providers that's other strategy we have managed some of their infrastructure. So that's also make a win-win both party or benefit or will be profit. That's also the strategy we have.\nBen Bollin: And within that, Ken, could you speak to, is this -- is it purely cost is latency part of the narrative? Is it being closer to your customers? What's the broader strategy within it?\nKen Xie: Not just, but also will make it easy to manage easy to scale. Even some of the SASE solution I had to be the some bigger customers, they may even do themselves. So if you can integrate a more successive function to the same or into the same system. So that's sort of the long-term strategy we have and also working with service providers is very, very important for us.\nBen Bollin: And then my last one. Ken, what are your thoughts on the traditional campus networking opportunity in the WLAN market? How do you think about wallet share opportunity and the ability to displace more of the incumbent there? That's it for me. Thank you.\nKen Xie: That's kind of the thinking we have like over 20, 30 years really. There's a convergence of networking, traditional networking and network security. I think SD-WAN is a very, very good example. So the WAF solution will be more efficient, more secure, and there's a lot of additional service we can apply to secure SD-WAN, which is whether offer free or we are not kind of there yet. But same thing for a lot of other web technology. And so we feel that's a huge potential. And -- but also doing security in the networking environment not need a huge company in power, which has come from ASIC investment we made, which also will take a long time to see the return of investment, that's what we kind of comment from day one back 23 years ago. So when we start with we really need to invest and planning all these kind of long-term convergence of networking or security together. So the new ASIC is one example is the fifth generation of our SoC chip, which also including some of the investments we made in the mine generation of our content process and seven-generation network processor together with a lot of multiple CPU. So we continue to develop technology and eventually will be deployed more broadly beyond the traditional network security.\nOperator: Thank you. I'd like to turn the call back over to Peter Salkowski for any closing remarks.\nPeter Salkowski: Thank you, Valerie. I'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call. Fortinet will be attending investor conferences hosted by Baird and Morgan Stanley during the first quarter. A fireside webcast link will be posted on the Events & Presentations section of Fortinet's Investor Relations website for the Morgan Stanley conference. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to contact me. Have a great rest of your day. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

            "name": "Ken Xie",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our outstanding full-year and fourth quarter 2022 results. For the full-year, revenue growth accelerated to 33%. We continue to gain market share in the service security industry with customers increasingly recognizing how Fortinet integrate and a single platform approach to security delivers along total cost of ownership and a greater return on investment than competing solutions. Product revenue growth of 42% was very strong, making Fortinet a leading product revenue company in the cybersecurity industry with total product revenue of $1.8 billion. Our SD-WAN and OT bookings together accounted for over 25% of total bookings. And our goal is to keep growing and achieve #1 market share in network firewall Secure SD-WAN and OT security market over the next couple of years. For 20 years, Fortinet has made long-term strategies and investments around the convergence of networking and security. Yesterday, we announced our fifth-generation FortiSecurity processor, the FortiSP5. This new SoC base for the ASIC has secure computing power rating for major network security functions like Firewall to support 17x to 32x greater than the average of our competitor similar price model using general purpose CPUs and doubles the ASIC chip acceleration of applications to Forti such as New Trust, SASE, 5G and our SD-Branch with much better performance and efficiency. According to the most recent IDC data on unit shipment of firewall plants, Fortinet hold the #1 unit shipped market share position and 48%, providing Fortinet with an attractive economy of scale position us well as making it difficult for competitors to develop their own ASIC technology due to high entry barrier and significant investment that is required. Fortinet is a huge security computing power advanced advantages are able for the OS to integrate more security functions and applications than our competitors with much better performance and much lower energy consumption, resulting in a much lower total cost of ownership while offering easier operations for our customers. For example, a recent Forrester report highlighted that customers deploying Fortinet Secure SD-WAN solutions achieved a 300% return on investment over three years with a payback period of only eight months. Fortinet's substantial installed base of product with reach functions enable us to offer additional secure services, and upsell, integrated and automated for the Fabric Product Solutions. We recently announced several new and advanced services that help SoC team reduce their operations cyber-risk while being more efficient and handling cybersecurity issues. As networking and security continue to converge and consolidate, we believe we are well positioned to achieve our 2025 building target of $10 billion. Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners and suppliers worldwide for their continued support and hard work. Keith? I took a question feedback from some customer partners. Their budget is tight, but Fortinet solution has a better cost of total cost ownership and also kind of even cost saving for some like a Secure SD-WAN solution. And at the same time, we do see -- the use case of firewall expanding much broader than before, especially for this OT security, some other area, which pretty much, I'd say, network security may be the only solution to secure some of this OT area. So that's where we see the demand is still pretty strong. And so we probably -- we're keeping gaining more market share in this well fragmented market. I think there is two parts. First, I totally agree with you said that SD-WAN and the OT market growing faster than the network security average. And on the other side, we do believe our solution has huge advantage compared to other competitors. So both SD-WAN, OT market is still pretty fragmented and compared to our home growth integrated solution and leverage for the ASIC company and power. So advantage much huge compared to other competitors, quite some mostly come from acquisition. And at the same time, they don't have the ASIC help to increase speed, lower the cost and the power consumption. So that's why we feel we're keeping growing above the market, so above the market growth rate. There's a different research about how the market is growing. But I do agree it's a fast-growing market compared to the cybersecurity space and there will be a lot of potential going forward. Definitely more service, whether under the overlay service for SD-WAN because our SD-WAN has all the security function and also a lot of -- deployed case whether supporting work from core from anywhere or kind of helping enterprise reduce their total cost of networking all these things. We do see a lot of additional service they need. At the same time, we also see the service provider starting more working together with us, offer some quite additional service beyond -- that's the traditional SD-WAN. So that's also helping drive much more service going forward. Probably want to take some time, I'd say, maybe one to two years to refresh the product. And that's where every quarter, we tend to release one or two products, whether leverage new ASIC or the new CPU of Smarter network chip in the industry. I don't feel it will be a significant impact up and down of the result and will be more smooth transition. Because security deployment is a kind of a -- take long time to design, evaluate, deploy and also very, very long sales cycle. At the same time, the life cycle of the product also tend to be quite long, like seven to 10 years. So that's where the ASIC each generation definitely will help in and at the same time has a huge advantage compared to using general-purpose CPU. So that's where we're keeping gaining market share. But consider the switching costs, consider the long cycle, sales cycle and deployment cycle. And also, we also need time to put ASIC into a new product, which also taken in a few months, three to six months, thus I do see it will be like a more long-term positive impact instead of short-term. Yes, we are continuing hiring. But at the same time, we want to keeping the efficiency and is not dropping the efficiency for the sales and marketing. And at the same time, there's some long-term investment, whether in R&D, the infrastructure supporting, we will continue to need to make. So that's why we do expect the total head count will keep it increased, but probably the rate that just like the last few years will be below the top line increase. That sometimes depend on certain like products or backlog. I think that's probably the average still pretty similar. We don't see much, but sometimes from quarter-to-quarter, it may change a little bit. But I have to say the total mix is still pretty much the same. Yes, I think for the backlog like what I said in the last one or two quarter, it's continued shifting to the network area, network and the Wi-Fi which is more industry standard product. I'd say probably today, most of the backlog will come from the network side and the Wi-Fi side, which has a higher cancellation rate. And -- so that's where like Keith has mentioned, we take a pretty, when it's positive conservative, but that definitely pretty good estimate what will the impact for the whole year on all these -- the backlog for the product revenue. And product revenue, definitely, we see probably going forward, the benefit of the new ASIC and also some of the new products that were helping and also some of the case, the use case -- additional use case of the firewall definitely also are helping, but it will take some time. So that's where we tend to be more careful to forecast. At the same time, we do see long-term, we still have a huge advantage compared to other competitors because the investment we made in the product, in the hardware, in ASIC give us huge advantage of the total cost of ownership towards container keeping gaining market share in that space. I think it's -- since it's been a large difficult to forecast at the same time, with the change in cancellation and also most of the backlog related to networking WiFi not a core product. So that's where, since last quarter, we no longer provide detail of the backlog, we feel that could be a little bit misleading if we keep in providing that. The supply chain environment definitely have some improvement for networking for the WiFi. That's where sometimes a customer, they may have a multiple order to see which vendor can deliver because a lot of networking equipment WiFi is a pretty standard product. Even for us, we do add quite some security functions in there. But at sometimes customers just cannot wait. So that's where we see a little bit higher cancellation rate with -- I think right now, the overall supply chain environment, I think is improving. I think we definitely have a pretty long tenure and a good team there. And at the same time, the case, the firewall case also expand quite well in Europe, in some countries there. And some of the service provider carrier, they are a little bit more ahead compared to some bigger service provider were the U.S. on moving some new solutions, including some 5G SD-WAN. So that's where we continue to see some good growth there. Also, we kind of surprisingly even during the recession, the SMB sector growing quite strong compared to some enterprise. Enterprise more about how to lower the cost ownership, protect some of their own kind of profit margin. But SMB, they do see the importance of cyber security, especially in retina were they are starting more targeted SMB right now. So we do see quite strong growth in SMB and so that's also helping some regions in Europe. I think in the 2014, 2015 last the outbreak of a weather target so many case, which a lot of enterprise tried to upgrade from the traditional connection-based firewall to the next-gen firewall, which including some prevention and other things. So that's where it's more like kind of refresh more in the enterprise area. So we do see some strong growth there after the severe issue. And then by this time, we see there's a few things. One is really during the pandemic, there's a new infrastructure build supporting a homework anywhere. At the same time, the ransomware attack quite broadly hit the whole industry. And another part, we keep on seeing the convergence, which is like SD-WAN, the 5G, the WiFi and also internal segmentation. So that's a much broader used case of the firewall deployment and also including OPG, a lot of more devices being connected. So we feel this time it is really kind of a more broad firewall used case kind of apply to the whole infrastructure. That's what we kind of more emphasized the convergence is a little bit different than the last time it's like eight, nine years ago. So that's why we feel this time probably will be more smooth transition because the traditional firewall, whatever will not go away. And at the same time, that's more used case convergence into the traditional networking area, expanding to the OT some other area, we're helping keeping driving the product revenue growth and then followed by the additional service revenue. So that's the chance we're planning. Yes, it's definitely helping the customer lower the total cost of ownership, both on the management cost and also on the product service cost, which we have here an advantage over the competitors. So that's where we see a lot of a big enterprise customers. They definitely want to -- when they see the renewal, when they see all this -- need to add additional protection for the infrastructure, we do see this like how to have a better total cost of ownership and at the same time, leverage a single integrated platform, automated platform to offer better security networking together. Even there's a trend to merge the traditional network operating team and security operating team together to making the stock and not kind of combined together and also converge on the traditional networking and security together. So we do see some trends happening in the big enterprise and which we kind of developed technology and the long-term investments starting to see. I mean, stating benefit for the trend. Yes, I think we -- our strategy, like [indiscernible] seeing in the last few years is; first, we want to have a SASE or integrated in the same system, the same OS, including all the SD-WAN or the SASE function. So making SASE can be more easily broader deploy and also working with service provider to leverage their infrastructure to offer a SASE. So it's a little bit different than some of the SASE players right now in the market. So we do believe this is highly integrated the single system as will be more efficient and same time will be more secure. And so that's what we're keeping building and whether the new FortiASIC [indiscernible] and also the new FortiOS reflect all this kind of development we reported into the solution. At the same time, we're keeping working closely with pretty much all the carrier service provider, even cloud provider to offer SASE together. And that's also a little bit different strategy compared to some other SASE player. So we do believe long-term leverage infrastructure, a lot of our own service provider telecom provider had will be much more efficient than the profit model compared to some of the SASE solution or player kind of losing money, which will be difficult to last long. So that's what we will keeping invest in this area. And also, we want to be a long-term player in this space and also we'll be keeping internal innovation R&D and keeping driving this space. Thank you. Yes. We continue keeping building of the infrastructure, including the cloud. Also our strategy a little bit different than 100 players we tend to build out ourselves just like we -- you can see the investment in some of the real estate. Quite some of that also go to the -- like a data center infrastructure that give us much better cost and also more long-term benefit just like how we -- the investment made in early real estate kind of benefit our office cost, rental costs. So that's where we're using the cost saving we get from this rental keeping invest into some more long-term infrastructure real estate. We do see that we're keeping benefit the company a long time. But at the same time, like I said, also partner working with car service providers that's other strategy we have managed some of their infrastructure. So that's also make a win-win both party or benefit or will be profit. That's also the strategy we have. Not just, but also will make it easy to manage easy to scale. Even some of the SASE solution I had to be the some bigger customers, they may even do themselves. So if you can integrate a more successive function to the same or into the same system. So that's sort of the long-term strategy we have and also working with service providers is very, very important for us. That's kind of the thinking we have like over 20, 30 years really. There's a convergence of networking, traditional networking and network security. I think SD-WAN is a very, very good example. So the WAF solution will be more efficient, more secure, and there's a lot of additional service we can apply to secure SD-WAN, which is whether offer free or we are not kind of there yet. But same thing for a lot of other web technology. And so we feel that's a huge potential. And -- but also doing security in the networking environment not need a huge company in power, which has come from ASIC investment we made, which also will take a long time to see the return of investment, that's what we kind of comment from day one back 23 years ago. So when we start with we really need to invest and planning all these kind of long-term convergence of networking or security together. So the new ASIC is one example is the fifth generation of our SoC chip, which also including some of the investments we made in the mine generation of our content process and seven-generation network processor together with a lot of multiple CPU. So we continue to develop technology and eventually will be deployed more broadly beyond the traditional network security."

            "name": "Keith Jensen",
            "content": "Thank you, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. As we look back at 2022, we see the success of our strategy to lead in convergence and consolidation as well as the combined power of our ASIC technology with our integrated operating system. Combined, these efforts are driving our strong financial results. There's been an explosion of devices that must be connected to the cloud, data center and edge compute. As a result, the infrastructure has expanded to support secure connectivity via distributed firewalls, it is no longer feasible to overlay security on top of networking in the data center. They must be deployed as a converged solution. Firewalls need to work seamlessly with networking and security applications across the company's entire infrastructure. Fortinet is leading the convergence trend with a wide range of technologies, including network firewalls, Secure SD-WAN, 5G and OT security, all embedded in our single operating system delivered as hardware, software, cloud and as a service. Traditional CPU-based solutions are very inefficient as supporting both networking and security. That's why Fortinet developed proprietary ASIC technology to build an application-specific solution. Yesterday, as Ken mentioned, we announced our next-generation ASIC, the FortiSecurity processor or FortiSP5, which allows line speed convergence of networking and security at every network edge. The new seven nanometer technology combines existing NP7 technology with new content processor capabilities. Our enhanced platform suite of integrated products is delivering on customer demands for convergence, vendor consolidation, ease of management and lower operating costs. The success of this strategy is evident in our full-year 2022 results, and I'll start there. Billings passed the $5 billion mark, totaling $5.6 billion and growing 34%. While revenue totaled $4.4 billion, with growth accelerating to 32%, the fifth consecutive year of revenue growth of 20% or more. Driven by strong demand for our fabric and cloud security solutions, enhanced platform technology billings and revenue both increased over 40% to $1.8 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. And despite a challenging global supply chain environment, product revenue growth came in at 42%, our highest annual product revenue growth rate in over 10 years. Our product revenue growth was driven by the combined -- by the continued growth of our firewall use cases and the addition of over 23,000 new customers. Service revenue was up 26% to $2.6 billion, resulting in three consecutive years of accelerating service revenue growth rates. Gross margin was strong at 76.3% and operating margin outpaced our initial expectations, increasing 110 basis points to a new Fortinet record high of 27.3%. Our GAAP operating margin of 22% is one of the highest in the industry, and we continued our streak of being GAAP profitable every year of our 14-year history as a public company. Earnings per share increased 49% to $1.19. Free cash flow was a record at $1.45 billion. Free cash flow margin was 33% and adjusted for real estate investments, the free cash flow margin came in at 37%. And for the year, we repurchased approximately 36 million shares at a cost of $2 billion. Total deferred revenue increased 34% to $4.6 billion. Short-term deferred revenue increased 32% to $2.35 billion. Quarterly contract terms throughout the year were consistent with the year earlier periods, including the fourth quarter at 28 months. Before moving on to our Q4 results, I'd like to summarize our enterprise success and highlight a few seven figure deals from 2022. We saw great success during the year with our strategy to expand further into the large enterprise segment as the number of deals over $1 million increased over 55% to a record 546 deals and billings on these deals increased by over 70%. If we look at a few of our large deals of the year, let's start with the competitive upsell deal, Fortinet displaced a 11 different vendors by consolidating the customer's network to security functions on our Security Fabric. This worldwide wholesaler previously purchased secure SD-WAN and FortiProxy. Next on the list was a centralized network security solution that could be managed and deployed to its 400 global locations. This customer chose Fortinet Security Fabric for a selectable and integrated solution across multiple scenarios, including work from anywhere, perimeter security and data center segmentation. In another upsell deal, a leading global manufacturer was spun off and had to stand up the security and networking infrastructure separately. The newly created infrastructures included remote access, SD-WAN, application delivery control, authentication, endpoint, e-mail protection and switching. Keys to our win included our Zero Trust capabilities, a cloud-first SD-WAN strategy and the ease of integration and convergence across our platform suite. Lastly, in the new logo win, a large U.S. retailer with over 500 locations were struggling with a total cost of ownership of their legacy security architecture. Keys to this win included delivering a single pane of glass versus the multiple consoles they were using and replacing the competitors' firewalls with our FortiGate's, delivering URL filtering, WiFi security, and edge router replacement, all on our unified and integrated FortiOS platform. This customer reported anticipated savings of $29 million over five years. Turning to Q4 results, both billings and revenue delivered new Fortinet records with billings of $1.7 billion and revenue of $1.3 billion. Both metrics increased over 30%. The strong fourth quarter revenue performance reflects solid customer demand across both our core and enhanced platform technologies. In the fourth quarter, we added over 6,200 new logos, another new Fortinet record reflecting the support of our channel partners, the leverage they bring and the breadth of our worldwide customer base. Taking a closer look at the fourth quarter, billings growth of 32%, was driven by a 40% increase in enhanced platform technology billings, which accounted for over one-third of total billings. Total revenue growth of 33% was driven by a strong demand for core and enhanced technology platforms, which increased 26% and 47%, respectively. Product revenue grew 43% to $540 million. Service revenue was up 27% to $743 million, driven by strong product revenue growth and strength in our security subscriptions. Short-term deferred revenue grew 32% and represents eight consecutive quarters of accelerating growth rates. Total gross margin of 77.6% was driven by a 310 basis point increase in product gross margin to 65.2%. Several factors converged to drive our record high quarterly product gross margin, including legacy pricing actions, easing supply chain cost pressures and improved discounting. Service gross margin of 86.7%, ticked down 40 basis points due to increased labor cost and our expansion in cloud services and the related hosting costs. Operating margin of 32.5%, was up 400 basis points year-over-year due to the strong gross margin performance and FX benefit. Looking to the statement of cash flow summaries on Slides 11 and 12. Free cash flow was $497 million, adjusted free cash flow, which excludes real estate investments was $510 million, representing a 40% adjusted free cash flow margin. Cash taxes were $63 million, capital expenditures were $31 million, including $13 million for real estate investments. DSO increased 14 days sequentially and year-over-year to 89 days, also impacting service revenue growth. Moving to guidance. We believe the continued innovations we made in building our platform enables our customers' digital transformation journey. And as Ken noted, customers are increasingly recognizing how Fortinet is integrated and single platform approach to security can deliver a lower total cost of ownership and a greater return on investments than competing solutions. Now I'd like to review our outlook for 2023, summarized on Slide 15, which is subject to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the first quarter, we expect billings in the range of $1.415 billion to $1.465 billion which at the midpoint represents growth of 24%. Revenue in the range of $1.180 billion to $1.220 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 26%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%; non-GAAP operating margin of 23% to 24%, which at the midpoint represents an increase of 150 basis points. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.27 to $0.29, which assumes a share count of between $795 million and $805 million, capital expenditures of $80 million to $110 million, non-GAAP tax rate of 17%, cash taxes of $20 million. And should also note that first quarter guidance assumes backlog decreases slightly during the quarter. For the full-year, we expect billings in the range of $6.710 billion to $6.790 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 21%. Revenue in the range of $5.370 billion to $5.430 billion which at the midpoint represents growth of 22%. Total service revenue in the range of $3.335 billion to $3.365 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 27%, it implies a fourth consecutive year of accelerating service revenue growth. The service revenue guidance also implies product revenue growth of 15%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%, non-GAAP operating margin of 25% to 26%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.39 to $1.41, which assumes a share count of between $805 million and $815 million. Capital expenditures of $400 million to $450 million due to continued investments in clouds, data centers and facilities. Non-GAAP tax rate of 17%, cash taxes of $375 million, split somewhat evenly between the first and second half of the year. The increase in cash taxes reflects recently effective R&D capitalization and amortization requirements. The full-year estimate assumes backlog approaches historical levels by the end of the year. Cybersecurity, but not immune to economic slowdowns is expected to remain a comparatively safe harbor. And with a strong business model and history of execution, we are confident that our market share gains will continue. We remain on track to achieve our 2025 financial targets, which include billings of $10 billion, revenue of $8 billion, non-GAAP operating margin of at least 25%, and adjusted free cash flow margin in the mid to high 30% range in 2025. And with that, I'll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A session. Yes. Thanks, Ken. I spot on with that. I would also add, look, I think we're all sensitive to the overhang from the macro environment and what that may mean is [indiscernible]. But when we look at our internal numbers, whether it's pipeline growth and even if we compare what pipeline growth is today versus a year-ago, it's even up in terms of percentage growth rates. The use cases, and I think in this environment, the savings that we offer and the ROI that we provide and some of the case studies that we provided in the call there are examples of that. I think we're continuing to benefit from that, and we do see that continued opportunities for market share gains even in this environment. Yes. I think that the approach that we take, if you will, is consistent this time around with what we've done in prior years, but with certainly added conservatism in it to reflect what's happening or what may happen with the macro environment. And first and foremost, we start with the pipeline and looking at the pipeline growth there and the kind of the timing of the pipeline and making sure that we have deals that are teed up for the middle of the year and perhaps even to the second half of the year. So there's ample opportunity there. You also want to make sure that you've got sales productivity numbers that make sense and sales capacity numbers that make sense. Yes, I think there will be some tailwind from the backlog, which I commented on in the comment that we're going to get some benefit from that as it continues to burn down. But keep in mind that we have seen some changes in cancellation rates, and I think we've added a significant amount of conservatism there around cancellation rates. Again, so I think it's really about the pipeline, it's the tailwind that we have and it take us the advantages that we're offering and total cost of ownership in this environment. Yes. I think it kind of goes back to Brian's question a moment ago in terms of -- with the level of conservatism and caution that's in the guide. And I know that historically, I've often complained that I don't get much room in the services line from where the consensus is versus what I'm forecasting. At a 27% number, I think that's pretty much right on top of what the street of that for the full-year. And I think in this macro environment, I think that's a great -- a good place for us to be at this point of the year for full-year guidance. Yes. Yes, I think our guidance is pretty much in sync with where we are historically at this point in time and consistent what we always talked about the 25% margin number. But I think the -- what you may be suggesting or inferring is really, it's all about FX, if you will, when you look at 2022 compared to 2023. We had a nice benefit from FX in 2022. And I think in terms of what our assumptions are for 2023, like the rest of people, we read the economic reports from the big banks and so forth and what the dollar is expected to do. And I think we've really pulled out a lot of that benefit by the end of this year. And so you're not really going to see that in the year-over-year comparison. Yes. I don't think that we've really seen customers push on the term. Obviously, at 28 months -- 28 months, which is kind of been keeping where we've been historically. But I do think in the fourth quarter, we certainly had conversations with customers that were I think perhaps even more focused on cash flow, if you will, than they were on discounting in terms of extended payment terms and that sort of thing. So if I were to look at the -- what I'm hearing back from customers, it was all about cash protection. And with that, I assume if I were trying to do a lot of five-year deals or something like that, I might have felt more pressure. But given the SMB mix of our business and our partner footprint, obviously, didn't come through in the numbers really. Yes. We did see a pickup to if we want to call it mid-single digits in Q3, we saw it tick up to high-single-digits in fourth quarter -- in the fourth quarter. And we've anticipated this, particularly as the backlog starts to shift its mix as the firewalls. There's still a significant amount of firewalls in the backlog, but it really now has tilted towards the network equipment, the switches and the access points. And so as you would expect, one last comment on that, as we see the shift in the mix in the backlog as well as the pick-up in the cancellation rates, I would also offer that as part of the guidance setting process, I think we've taken a fairly conservative approach to cancellation rates on what they -- how they may impact 2023 or said another way, we're not expecting all the backlog that exists at the beginning of the year to convert in 2023 because we think there'll be some cancellations. Yes, Brad, I would only offer again for context. I think that -- this is what Fortinet has been 20 generation. It's a chip probably now we think content processors and network processors and systems-on-a-chip. And I think that Fortinet, Ken and Michael have actually shown the ability to transition through those generations of chips. And if you look back at the financials, I think it's a little bit difficult to find a year that for a period of time, really saw spike because of the new chip. These are much more long-term plays. And I think the approach here is to execute in a smooth fashion over a number of years. Yes, the change in activation policies started February last week, I believe, February 1. So we'll start to see that going forward. What I was referring to is the -- is really all about linearity, right? That's what it gives you insights to. And if I see my DSO go from, call it, 75 days to 89 or 90, you can kind of start doing the math there and see that's a 20% increase in DSO, and it's really driven by how linearity came through in the quarter. And when linearity starts shifting that much, we lose the opportunity to gain service revenue from sales early in the quarter that would normally activate. So we really didn't get a lift in service revenue from in-quarter deals the way that we would have expected because of linearity. Yes. I think that we kind of remain truthful to or faithful to the notion of providing service revenue guidance for the full-year and kind of leave the Street work out the numbers from that point going forward. I think that certainly, as we kind of look at laying out the year and with the backdrop of the macro that we're all concerned about, I don't think we really wanted to push too hard on some of the metrics that we didn't need to push on. And I think where we ended up with is pretty consistent in the quarter with our consensus when we look at our internal allocations between product and service revenue. I'm going to answer yes. Yes, you should be thinking about one of those two ways. Look, I think we're driven by being above 25% operating margin, right? I think the ones that -- the last few years have taught us is life full of surprises. And so locking into a fixed commitment is a little bit challenging sometimes. But clearly, we manage the business as if it's the floor. Yes. I think just building Ken's comment one of the notes that we do track tenure. We talked about it last quarter. Tenure [ph] would be people that have been here for, say, people have been here more than six months. And I commented last quarter, the tenure was up, I think, eight points. It's actually moved back to historical norms now. And tenure is kind of a key component of productivity as we see -- as we go forward. Yes. I think that's one of the challenges you have in the current environment and the supply chain was really doing funny things, if you will, into delivery, and we don't give you a lot of insights to orders that we were taking in, but we provide billings numbers, you get some distortion there just simply based upon what's available. Specifically, we saw a significant amount of availability of the 100F products, if you will, which are a midrange product. And you're seeing that availability came in the fourth quarter, and it shifted that mix in the way you just described it. Yes, I'll start with the last one first, if you will. I think that I think we are very excited about the opportunities in front of us in terms of how the company is executing. But we are certainly also very cognizant of the unknown of the macro environment. And I think there's just an opportunity here in terms of how we guide for the full-year to really bake in concerns around the macro and how it may manifest in the coming months -- coming quarters. So I think you're seeing that, and I kind of made a comment earlier that historically, it's been tough for me to be somewhat cautious on service revenue because it's so visible. We're looking at short-term deferred revenue and the conservatism oftentimes ends up in product revenue. I think there's still an element of that in this conversation. I think we can add over some directional comments here with it. So the headlines would be that backlog was up year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter it was down. But as you start thinking through how to treat the backlog in terms of doing your own models going forward, again, we would come back and remind you of a couple of things. We expect the cancellation rates are going to increase, and that's baked into our guidance, as we look at things. And when we say return to historical norms in the commentary, I think we probably would have three years ago had backlog for professional services and training that may have been in the $30 million range. So maybe with growth now you're probably looking at a steady state that could get you over $40 million to $50 million. So just a note of caution, they'll just take all that backlog and assume it's all going to convert into billings and revenue in 2023 given those dynamics. Yes. I don't know that I've really seen a change in the mix, if you will. I think the -- when you look at the -- what we call the FortiManager, FortiAnalyzer. And certainly, the virtual machines are doing very, very well. And then as you start looking at the tail of the fabric products in the -- on the areas of EDR and monitor and SIM and so on and so forth, I think that they're smaller dollar totals, but sometimes very dramatic and exciting growth rates. So I want to be a little bit careful about getting -- painting anybody in too great a light in terms of their contribution because everybody is contributing. Certainly, the networking equipment part of the business has done very, very well, and this is a key component of this convergent story that we've talked about, and it remains probably about one-third of the fabric business. Yes. I think the conversation around cancellation rates, a few things there. We said it went from mid single-digits to high single-digits. And then as we built into the guidance, it is a multiple that we built in the guidance of what we just saw in the fourth quarter. What we actually get out of it, we'll see. But the reason to be so cautious about it is what Ken is talking about. We knew that we had an advantage with firewalls and dealing with our suppliers and our vendors and we thought we'd be successful in pushing down that component of backlog first. And indeed, the mix has shown that. I think it's now something on the order of about 75%, 25% between networking equipment and firewalls still firewalls in the mix. But as Ken pointing out is there may be more risk with that networking equipment of cancellations as we go forward, and particularly its a backlog deal for those elements continue to age out a little bit as we move through this process. In terms of continuing supply chain challenges, I'm not quite sure I was making the length on that. I don't -- I guess that would have an impact on the continuing to build of backlog. But as we said in our comments, we really expect to get to a backlog number by the end of this year that's much more closely aligned with our historical norms. Yes. I think a few things we talked about price benefits, the discounting and then some easing of the impact of the supply chain. I think the price benefit is something that will obviously stay with us in the future. And so we should still get a tailwind from that. However, discounting and supply chains, call it, savings for lack of a better term, that's what we relate to our history of price increases. And I think we kind of reached a very kind of maybe the high watermark in terms of being -- having price increases covering those costs, and that will start to settle back down to a more normalized pattern going forward. Meaning that we'll still have inflationary cost increases, but we've really slowed down the price benefits, the price increases. So net-net, price increases continue, discounting and supply chain benefits may not. Great. Like everybody else, I mean, you're reading about people talking about deals taking longer to get across the finish line and more approvals and so forth. And I don't think we were immune to that by any stretch of the imagination. Keep in mind as we're going through as the world is moving through this. At the same time, Fortinet's kind of expanding from just seven figure deals. And I think we talked about 546 seven figure deals or more last year, if I remember correctly, a huge number. Now adding more and more eight figure deals. So I think we're probably seeing huge opportunities, but we're also getting exposed to how that approval process works and how we manage with our sales team, our customers through that process. Yes, on that part first. I mean I think we'll continue to monitor the market and make the appropriate adjustments there. I don't seeing inflation go backwards it's probably not something that's happened a lot in history, but it could happen, I guess. In terms of the most recent price increase that we talked about, it's almost a non-event to me. It's extremely low single-digits growth and after discounting, it's a fraction of an interest point."

Lastly, all references to growth are on a year-over-year basis unless noted otherwise. I will now turn the call over to Ken.\nKen Xie: Thanks, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining today\u2019s call to review our outstanding third quarter 2022 results. Revenue for the quarter grew 33%, significantly outpacing the industry growth rate. We believe that customer recognition of the exceptional value proposition we provided by our high performance Forti-ASIC technology and integrated FortiOS operating system is driving our ability to take cyber security market share. Product revenue growth was very strong at 39%, extending our position as a product revenue leader in the cybersecurity industry. Our product revenue performance reflects the strong demand we have built over the past 18 months across our security solutions along with the successful execution of our internal teams in managing the supply chain challenges. Three growth drivers, the heightened threat environment, the convergence of security and networking, and the consolidation of security functionality and the vendors, together with the opportunity to upsell additional security services to our significant installed base are expected to drive future growth. First, the threat landscape, including ransomware, continue to expand and evolving targeting companies of all size, location and industries. To counter the threat landscape, we are implementing our unique Universal ZTNA across a wide range of customers, driving triple-digit growth for this product and delivering a comprehensive approach to zero trust that is consistent for any user, anywhere, on any device and supporting today\u2019s hybrid workforce. Second, for years Fortinet has led strategies around the convergence of networking and security. We estimate the total addressable market for networking and security will increase from $54 billion today to $73 billion in 2026. Convergence accelerates digital transformation and substantially reduce operational costs by combining networking modernization with dynamic security that seamlessly span every part of the network, especially now that many companies are merging SOC and NOC operations together. Fortinet is leading the convergence trend with a wide range of technologies including Network Firewall and Segmentation, Secure SD-WAN, OT Security, and 5G in a single operating system which can be deployed as hardware, software, cloud, and As a Service. Fortinet continues to gain Secure SD-WAN market share as our integrated Secure SD-WAN solution delivers better security, performance and efficiencies over more traditional offerings. In the quarter, SD-WAN and OT bookings grew over 45% and 75%, respectively, and together accounted for over 25% of total bookings. We believe we can achieve number one market share in SD-WAN in the next couple of years. Today, we announced the FortiGate 1000F, our latest innovation in converging networking and security. Powered by our new NP7 SPU, the 1000F delivers 5 to 10 times higher performance across six major network security functions while consuming 80% less power versus competitive solutions. The lower power consumption was a contributing factor in our top 2% ranking in S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment. Our third growth driver is the consolidation of a vendors and product functionality. With Forti-ASIC\u2019s huge computing power advantage, FortiOS can integrate more security functions than our competitors, together with over 30 key products ranging from endpoint to network to the cloud security. Fortinet provides our customers with easier operation while lower the management costs and the total cost of ownership. Additionally, we are very focused on upselling value-added security services to our significant customer base. According to IDC\u2019s second quarter unit share data, Fortinet hold a number one market share position for units shipped at 43%, up 210 basis points. We expect to reach 50% market share in the next few years. This leadership position and the substantial installed base creates attractive economy of a scale and the opportunity to upsell additional security services. Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners, and suppliers worldwide for their continued support and hard work. Keith?\nKeith Jensen: All right. Thank you, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Let\u2019s start with an overview of our strong third quarter performance. Revenue of $1.15 billion was another quarterly record for Fortinet, increasing 33% year-over-year and 12% sequentially; our highest third quarter sequential growth rate in eleven years. We continue to deliver better than industry average top-line growth and generate strong profitability. Our operating margin exceeded guidance at over 28%, driving the adjusted free cash flow margin to 40%. Our history as a public company has revolved around the Rule of 40, measured as the combined total of revenue growth and operating margin. Impressively, the Q3 total came in at over 60. We continue to see success in our strategy for expanding further into the large enterprise segment. The number of deals over $1 million increased over 80% to 153 deals. The total billings value of deals over $1 million more than doubled driven by a record number of deals over $5 million, and G2000 bookings increased over 40%. Our strong third quarter results reflect solid customer demand across both our Core and Enhanced Platform Technologies and the exceptional performance of the team in a challenging supply chain environment. We believe the investments we\u2019ve made in building our platform and our go-to-market engine enables our customers\u2019 digital transformation journey. Our platform strategy allows customers to converge networking functionality with security capabilities while consolidating cybersecurity products, providing security across their entire digital infrastructure while lowering their operating costs. Recently, the Forrester Wave Enterprise Firewalls report acknowledged the success of our investment strategy, placing Fortinet as a leader for the first time in its history. According to Forrester, \u201cFortinet excels at performance for value and offers a wide array of adjacent services. Long known for its bang-for-the-buck approach to network security, Fortinet has built a flexible and capable platform with its flagship product, the FortiGate Firewall.\" Taking a closer look at the income statement, product revenue grew 39%. Product revenue growth for our Core and Enhanced Platform Technology products increased 29% and 51%, respectively. The product revenue growth rate accelerated over 4 points sequentially, especially impressive given it is our toughest year-over-year comparison in over 10 years. Service revenue was up 28%, accelerating 3 points sequentially driven by strong product revenue growth and seven consecutive quarters that increased our term deferred revenue growth rates. Support and related service revenue was up 28%, accelerating over 2 points sequentially to $311 million. While security subscription service revenue was up 29%, accelerating 4 points sequentially to $370 million. Total revenue in the Americas increased 34%. EMEA revenue increased 37% and APAC posted revenue growth of 23%. Total gross margin at 76.2% exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Product gross margin of 61% was up 30 basis points year-over-year. Services gross margin of 86.6% was flat year-over-year, but up 70 basis points sequentially. Operating margin of 28.3% was up 250 basis points, benefiting from FX and the operating margin leverage that comes with higher revenues. Shifting to billings. Billings of $1.4 billion were up 33%, representing the sixth consecutive quarter of billings growth in excess of 30%. Core platform billings were up 27% and accounted for 67% of total billings. As shown on Slide 6, we entry-level FortiGates posted very strong billings growth with the mix shifting 16 points in their favor, driven by demand and as we expected improved supply. Enhanced platform technology billings were up 45% and accounted for 33% of total billings, a positive mix shift of 3 points. Average contract term was flat year-over-year at 29 months. Looking at the statement of cash flow summarized on Slide 7 and 8. Free cash flow was $395 million. Adjusted free cash flow, which excludes real estate investments, was $464 million, representing a 40% adjusted free cash flow margin. DSOs were down five days sequentially while increasing 12 days year-over-year to 75 days. Cash taxes were $69 million. Capital expenditures were $88 million, including $69 million for real estate investments. We repurchased 10.2 million shares of our common stock for a cost of $500 million, bringing the year-to-date totals to 36 million shares at a total cost of $2 billion. The remaining repurchase authorization totals $530 million. Regarding backlog, the backlog at the end of the third quarter was up slightly from the end of the prior quarter, with FortiGate Firewalls accounting for just one-third of total backlog. We expect fourth quarter ending backlog to be relatively consistent with the third quarter backlog as we are seeing early signs of a transition back to more normalized customer buying behaviors. Moving to guidance. The current environment favors a Fortinet style platform that offers integrated solutions and strong security capabilities and an attractive cost of ownership. To enhance our ability to capture our share of the large market opportunity, we plan to continue to invest in innovation across our integrated platform offerings. Now I\u2019d like to review our outlook for the fourth quarter summarized on Slide 9, which is subject to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. And to start, as part of the Q4 guidance setting process, we considered several factors, including the greater macro uncertainty today and with it, the increased risk of forecasting the timing of certain larger transactions. The transition to more normalized customers buying behaviors, which means there is less of an emphasis on ordering to get a place online. And for comparison, in the fourth quarter of 2021, when supply was tighter, backlog increased over $120 million and contributed to 49% bookings growth. And lastly, elevated year early year top line comparisons that include certain onetime items adding a couple of points of service revenue growth and fully cycling the Alaxala acquisition. In response, we have slightly widened our top line guidance ranges. For the fourth quarter, we expect to again reach the Rule of 60. And with that, the key metrics include billings in the range of $1.665 billion to $1.720 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 30%. Revenue in the range of $1.275 billion to $1.315 billion, which represents growth of 34%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%, non-GAAP operating margin of 30% to 31%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.38 to $0.40, which assumes a share count of between $795 million and $805 million. We expect capital expenditures of $75 million to $85 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 17%. And for the full year, we expect billings and revenue growth to exceed 30% for the second consecutive year. Billings in the range of $5.540 billion to $5.595 billion, which at the midpoint represents 33%, revenue in the range of $4.410 billion to $4.450 billion, which represents growth of 33%. Perhaps for context, we should note at the midpoint, these full year billings and revenue growth rates are 3 points higher than the initial growth rates we provided in early February, despite the start of the war in Ukraine in late February, significant increases in interest rates and increasing uncertainty in the macro environment, and importantly, full year backlog is expected to be above the February estimate of $350 million. Total service revenue in the range of $2.645 billion to $2.655 billion, which represents growth of 27% and implies full year product revenue growth of 42%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%; non-GAAP operating margin of 26% to 27% at the midpoint a year-over-year increase of 30 basis points. And again, for context, at the midpoint, gross and operating margin expectations were 50 and 100 basis points above the February guide, respectively. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.13 to $1.15, which assumes a share count of between $800 million and $810 million. We expect full year capital expenditures of $325 million to $335 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 17%. We expect cash taxes to be $265 million. Before wrapping up, I\u2019d like to offer some preliminary thoughts on 2023 and our midterm targets on the heels of a very strong set of growth in 2021 and in 2022. We continue to successfully balance growth and profitability, while investing in longer-term innovation and go-to-market initiatives to future growth. The strength of our business model includes its diversification, margins that provide capacity for future investment and a rich mix of higher-margin recurring service revenues. As we saw in the highs of pandemic, the diversification helps mitigate the risk of economic slowdowns. Specifically, in 2020, we delivered operating margins of nearly 27%, adjusted free cash flow margin of over 38% and top line growth of 20%. And during the past 12 months, we have really exceeded our target operating margin targets, while increasing our engineering headcount by about 20% and significantly increasing our future sales capacity by over 25%, including a greater than 50% increase in new, non-tenured, salespeople. While we will provide more detailed 2023 guidance when we report our fourth quarter results, it\u2019s worth noting this revenue accounts for 60% of total revenue, with gross margins hovering above 85%. We see continued service revenue growth driven by two years of very strong product revenue growth and seven consecutive quarters accelerating short-term deferred revenue growth. With a strong business model and the history of being able to execute, we are confident that our momentum will continue and point to our key growth drivers, including strategic investments, the heightened threat environment, the convergence of networking and security, the cybersecurity consolidation. Cyber securities are not immune to economic slowdowns is expected to remain a relatively safe harbor. As such, we remain on track to achieve all of our medium-term financial targets from our May 2022 Analyst Day, including $10 billion in billings and $8 billion in revenue in 2025, each representing a 22% three-year CAGR from the midpoint of our 2022 guidance. The targets also included an average non-GAAP operating margin of at least 25% for the four years from 2022 to 2025 and a 2025 adjusted free cash flow margin in the mid-to-high 30% range. Illustrating our long-term focus for balancing growth and profitability, our targets remain committed to the Rule of 40 or better. I\u2019ll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A.\nPeter Salkowski: Thank you, Keith. [Operator Instructions] Eric, we are ready for Q&A.\nOperator: Excellent. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Fatima Boolani at Citi. Fatima, your line is open.\nFatima Boolani: Thank you. Good afternoon. I appreciate you taking my questions. Keith, this one\u2019s for you, just with respect to the 4Q guidance and the outlook. I appreciate you kind of breaking down the three principal factors that went into that. But I wanted to dig in specifically on the comment you made about normalized buying behavior as it relates to the backlog build. So I think what I inferred from your comments is that while the backlog is going to be sequentially up and sort of higher than what you initially pointed out to be maybe $350 million of ending backlog. That\u2019s certainly below the $500 million that you were previously telegraphing. So I just wanted to better understand sort of the modulation downward on backlog there and how the sort of normalized buying behavior contributes to that? And then I\u2019ll ask my follow-up.\nKeith Jensen: Okay. I think when we talk about normalized buying behavior, I think that we certainly saw some enterprise customers in the U.S. during the supply chain challenges. They were placing orders to get in line to hold their place in line for when the inventory is available. And I think I\u2019ll say a year ago or so that, that was an appropriate behavior when there was a lot of uncertainty around the supply chain and maybe they\u2019re planning what we\u2019re going to do in 2022. I think that somewhat in general now, and maybe Ken will talk more about this, I think people are getting is that the \u2013 certainly, we are, but the supply chain is a little bit easier to forecast and somewhat easier to manage. I don\u2019t mean by any stretch easy, but I do think it\u2019s easier. And with that, I think you\u2019re starting to see the market drift back towards the emphasis start to what I would call more traditional buying, which is when they need it, they\u2019re placing the order.\nKen Xie: And also looking at the composition of our backlog, it\u2019s only one-third or less related to our network security platform FortiGate more than half related to like a switch in AP, which is a networking equipment which is kind of an industry problem in the networking side because the networking device tend to be more changeable, more standard driven. So a lot of customers, sometimes double, triple order try to get ahead of whatever the supply chain issue and also some of them can easily cancel once they got the product. So that\u2019s why we feel probably keeping track in the backlog may not be the best way to forecast the business, and we should be more focused on security, security related, especially driving the future service based on huge FortiGate installation base.\nFatima Boolani: Thank you. And Keith, just a clarification on the services revenue trajectory and more broadly thinking about next year. So we saw the reacceleration this quarter in services revenue. So wondering if you could give us a quick update on how the delayed registrations from earlier in the year and transactions from earlier in the year are trending and how we should think about that filtering and flowing into our models for next year? Thank you.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think we\u2019ve been messaging throughout the quarter at various conferences that \u2013 and even in the prior quarter that we had a clear expectation that service revenue growth has accelerated. So we\u2019re very pleased to see that. I think there\u2019s a number of things that are providing a tailwind into that. Customer registering units is part of that. I think also the price increase is making its way first into orders and deferred revenue and now into the income statement. Keeping in mind that we have contracts at sometimes or as long as five years, that will give you a sense of how long the tailwind may relate to price increases as we will continue to cycle through renewals at old prices and replace them with new contracts. So I think we feel good about the direction of the service revenue and the margins that it provides, together with the fact that it\u2019s 60% of our business.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from Saket Kalia at Barclays. Saket, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nSaket Kalia: Okay. Great. Thanks very much for taking my question here. Keith, maybe just to start with you. I\u2019d love to just zero in on product revenue growth a little bit for this year. Can you just maybe talk about some of the growth drivers for product revenue this year that aren\u2019t expected to repeat next year? Again, very helpful detail kind of thinking about total billings for kind of following years. But for product, what are some of the one-off things that we should be keeping in mind like in Alaxala like price adjustments, just to sort of think about what normalized growth in product might look as we start to think about the following years.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think Alaxala is probably the easiest one to talk about in terms of providing numbers. We\u2019ve talked about the fact that their revenue stream was probably something in the order of $130 million to $140 million when we acquired them and reminded people that they are a March 31 year-end, so their fourth quarter is a little bit off cycle. I think that it\u2019s growth single digits. So I think that probably gives people a good level expectation reminder there that our interest in Alaxala is a lot to run at the IP and some opportunities that we have there to do things more longer term, if you will. In terms of other unique things about product revenue in the quarter, I mean, I think that as the backlog comes into revenue as we go through the end of 2022 here and certainly into 2023 is tend to provide, again, a fairly significant tailwind to what the product revenue growth will be in 2023, assuming we get the drawn in backlog that we may see.\nKen Xie: Yes. Also, we believe the growth driver, especially the converged network and security. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s a slowdown. We\u2019ll be keeping driving the product revenue growth in the next 5 to 10 years. You can see the secure SD-WAN and OT both had a pretty healthy growth. And at the same time, we will continue to growth in the next 5 to 10 years in a huge market potential.\nSaket Kalia: Got it. Got it. Maybe for my follow-up, really for both of you, I\u2019ll make a jump ball here. I think in Q3, we had operating margins of about 28%. I think the guide for Q4 is for margins a little bit higher. When I think that long-term guide out to 25% of at least, it feels like you\u2019re doing a lot better than that here in the near-term. Maybe the question is, how do you sort of think about that balance, right, in terms of growth, maybe moderating or normalizing as we mentioned versus sort of that long-term margin?\nKen Xie: I think that\u2019s where \u2013 if you look at the 13-year history, we as a public company, we always balance the growth and with the margin. So that\u2019s where we feel the 25% above is a healthy margin and then we can also give the money to invest in the growth become a leader in the space. That\u2019s where we\u2019re continue to balance, but if the growth slowdown definitely will be more helping in the margin. So that\u2019s what we keep in saying the Rule of 40, probably in the last few quarters, we kind of even reached the Rule of 60 now. So that\u2019s where also \u2013 when the growth slowed down and sometimes the service revenue has a higher margin, which can also help in the margin, but we do expect the growth will continue in the next few years with the three growth drivers I mentioned and plus additional service revenue to our big installation base, a lot of are not quite unable the security service revenue yet.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I would probably certainly agree with Ken operate just a little more detail on it. Keeping in mind that our \u2013 we sell in U.S. dollars, so there\u2019s really not a direct FX impact there. On the revenue line, obviously, you can get into certain countries where the pressure on discounting, if you will, because of exchange rates can be a little more intense. But on the OpEx, because 30% of our business is in the U.S. and the rest is international. We do get a tailwind from OpEx from the strength of the U.S. And I think you\u2019re seeing that in Q3 and you\u2019re seeing that in Q4. And probably why it\u2019s important is that we\u2019ve talked for a number of years now around and made reference to 25% operating margin. If you go back four years ago, five years ago, it was probably a target to get to 25% operating margin. And since then, we\u2019ve talked about averaging 25%, so I think a floor of 25%. It has certainly served us well as a way to help other people understand about how we invest in the business, and as Ken makes reference to it. As we have funds available over that 25% operating margin, it creates opportunities for some, not necessarily all that you\u2019re seeing currently of those margin dollars to be reinvested back in innovation and back into our go-to-market strategy.\nSaket Kalia: Got it. Very helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Okay. We\u2019re just lining up the next question. And the next question comes from Hamza Fodderwala at Morgan Stanley. Hamza, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nHamza Fodderwala: Hi, good evening. Thank you for taking my question. Keith, on the backlog, I appreciate, look, sometimes you have too many metrics that creates too many noise. And on the supply chain front, it seems like it\u2019s getting a bit clearer. But could you give us any more granularity on how that backlog and that booking trajectory looked relative to your guidance, which I think when you guided to it, you were saying about 36% growth at the midpoint for bookings. So just curious how that shook out in Q3.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think I\u2019ll come back to kind of Ken\u2019s commentary around backlog, which is really what kind of drives the conversation about bookings. I think a year ago, when we introduced the backlog metric, there was a lot of uncertainty around what the supply chain crisis was going to look like and how it might impact our business and the purpose of providing the backlog disclosure and the booking disclosure then was to kind of round out and help investors understand more about our business model as we go forward. And as we heard in the question earlier from one of the questions, at the beginning of year, what kind of a swag \u2013 that kind of swag backlog growth of $350 million in the first quarter and then it came back and said, in the second quarter, maybe it\u2019s going to get closer to $500 million for the full year. And now I think we\u2019re looking at a number that\u2019s going to be less than that, something in the floor probably seems reasonable from where we\u2019re at. And I think with net-net, the message there\u2019s two messages to I think we\u2019re becoming much more comfortable with our ability to execute in this environment and maybe some easing in the environment itself. And then secondly, I think that it was always our intention. I think we messaged this that these will be short-term metrics that we provide \u2013 and I think they\u2019ve served us and our investors well for an extended period of time, but it\u2019s probably time now that we feel that we\u2019ve gotten a better control on it to bring us more \u2013 bring us back online, if you will, with what our industry competitors are disclosing and not disclosing.\nHamza Fodderwala: Makes total sense. Just to follow up really quickly. I mean, is it fair to say that your bookings growth is still higher than your billings growth. Obviously, your backlog grew. So you\u2019re still expecting underlying bookings to be higher than 30% this year.\nKeith Jensen: Yes, we\u2019re not going down to the detail of talking specifically about bookings, as I just mentioned going forward from our backlog, more than what we\u2019ve given to this point.\nHamza Fodderwala: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from Rob Owens at Piper Sandler. Rob, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nRob Owens: Great. Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. Just one from curious with the supply chain getting a little bit easier, how you\u2019re thinking of about gross margin, both kind of in the short term as well as the medium term. Thanks.\nKen Xie: I think the component and also the cost continue to go up. So that\u2019s where \u2013 and also, we still have a pretty tight inventory to make most shipments shipping by air instead of by ocean. So that\u2019s where \u2013 so we\u2019ll keep it adjusted by all these costs and probably some of the wet ourselves, some of them we may do some price increase, but we also feel even some price increase, we continue to have a price advantage compared to competitive industry average with our own products. So that\u2019s where the margin we feel probably will be more stabilized. And that\u2019s probably the overall supply probably keep improving.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. Ken, spot on with that. I probably a couple a little more granularity. I think if you maybe look at it between product gross margin and services gross margin, the product win is the one that\u2019s probably more volatile related to what we\u2019re seeing. We\u2019ve certainly heard commentary that maybe things are easing a little bit, the chip manufacturers, but I would say that there\u2019s no indication of any sort of cost reduction savings that are coming from either chip manufacturers or the component suppliers. So what we\u2019ll see how that plays out. Our strategy has been, and Ken alluded to this, is that we came into this economic cycle a year ago, believing that we had a price performance advantage and that we could raise prices and our target was really to pass along most but not all the price increases, call it plus or minus 1% margin. It\u2019s kind of our target every quarter. It doesn\u2019t fall that way every quarter because of various variables. And I would imagine that to the extent that prices can remain to be elevated as we move into 2023, that\u2019s kind of the starting point for our price strategy into 2023 as well, again, because we have not seen signs that we\u2019ve lost the pro formas advantage. In fact, we continue to win that way. Service is a little bit different. I mean, the largest cost component in services is labor. And if you look back, we\u2019re a company that has its annual merit increase in the first or second month of the year, so you kind of get a rather immediate job on the COGS line from those \u2013 from the compensation increases, which is certainly appropriate and then you have to grow the service revenue into it. And I think that\u2019s part of the conversation about why you saw the reference to sequential margin increases. On the revenue side, it gets fairly complex. Well, maybe that complex. But thinking through how price increases that started about a year ago and kind of at a quarterly pace, if you will, how those price increases will make their way first on the balance sheet in deferred revenue and to what extent each item is going to reflect all those price increases and then how it will come off the balance sheet in future periods. So you will get tailwind from the price increases. And I would expect that particular tailwind should continue to, for an extended period of time.\nRob Owens: Ken and Keith, thank you.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question, just connecting the line now comes from Shaul Eyal at Cowen. Shaul, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nShaul Eyal: Thank you so much. Good afternoon, guys. Keith, question on APAC, softest performance in, I think, like two years, what was driving that? And I have a follow-up.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think we\u2019ve made a leadership change there around the end of June, beginning of July, we had a retirement. And I think that\u2019s just kind of the transition of leaders, if you will, is one was exiting into retirement and we brought so on. But I think we feel very, very good about in terms of their abilities. And I think the other part of it is you\u2019re starting to see the lapping effect of Alaxala because all of Alaxala sitting in APAC. And so you\u2019re going to see that now roll up on basically the full quarter comparisons that impact.\nShaul Eyal: Understood. Understood. And on FortiGate sales, maybe looking at it from a tier perspective, it was slightly more mixed than prior quarters, entry level actually representing most growth versus the mid-range and high end. So any color on that front?\nKen Xie: That\u2019s where the \u2013 we see pretty strong growth related to the SD-WAN and OT, which more using the low end unit and at the same time, the supply chain improvements help a little bit. That\u2019s where the \u2013 we\u2019ll be able to shipping more product in the low line side. We still have some backlog in the middle high end, but it\u2019s a low end had some improvement by redesign some of the products and also better supply chain right now\nKeith Jensen: Yes. Ken talked about this in the past, the ability to introduce the new 70F product in the second quarter. We were a little bit hamstrung in Q2 and the beginning of Q3 even back into Q1 really on the low end. And I think we kind of messaged a bit in our conversations over the last quarter or so that we expected low end supply availability to really jump, if you will, in the third quarter, and we did see that. So it\u2019s really more of a supply conversation in some ways as much as it is a demand conversation.\nShaul Eyal: Thank you for the color. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Okay. We\u2019re just bringing our next caller live. Brad Zelnick from Deutsche Bank. Brad, your line is live.\nBrad Zelnick: Thank you so much and thank you for taking the questions. Ken, just a big picture question for you to start out with. You mentioned Fortinet success is in part coming from the industry trend of vendor and product consolidation. Why is Fortinet so well positioned as a platform for consolidation? And how does this inform your product and corporate development roadmap in terms of the need for even more product breadth to compete with other platform competitors out there that keep adding additional functionality.\nKen Xie: I think we have a few unique advantage. The first from day one, we developed the FortiASIC, which have a huge companion power increase compared to using traditional CPU, but also FortiASIC also working side by side with the CPU. So that\u2019s the huge computing power advantage comes from FortiASIC give us more computing power for the FortiOS to run more function, more security function including a lot of networking function. So that advantage is none of our competitors have that. So that\u2019s making us keeping driving the market share and also the unit shipment, I mentioned, we like 43% of our market shareholder unit shipment there. So that\u2019s what we keeping \u2013 give us a long-term growth going forward because also on the convergence of security networking the secure computing power it must have a huge need to address both security and networking function there. Second is for the FortiOS is well integrate together with more function, leverage, security and power. So that\u2019s also kind of a huge advantage for us compared to some other competitor, whether they have to use like a different blade or different functions. They have to go to some different parts or even to the cloud to address some secure computing power there. And then third one, we also have about 30 different products, mostly home developed and integrate, automate together. So that\u2019s also what helping drive we call the wider security fabric on called a mesh network. So that\u2019s also helping the customer to lower the management cost and total cost of ownership. I think all these three factors we\u2019re keeping driving Fortinet better position for the consolidation, both on the product functionality and also on different products into a single vendor platform strategy.\nBrad Zelnick: Ken, thank you for that. And it\u2019s clearly working by your strategy. Maybe Keith just for you, you\u2019ve disclosed quite a bit of information so much so that I have a very simple question that I just might have missed. But can you just very clearly explained for the reduction in the full year billings guidance for \u2013 that you\u2019ve given us now the update on with these results. Thanks.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think you\u2019re talking about full year fourth quarter, one of the same at this point. And I would really just point to the macro environment and what we\u2019ve seen really in the \u2013 over the last 90 days in terms of economic activity, if you will, I think when you look at how that manifests somewhat specifically, I think I\u2019m getting a little more cautious in some of the forecasting of close timing on some of the very large deals. We\u2019ve been very successful over the last few years. You saw some of the numbers about enterprise penetration with our growth in the enterprise. The deals have actually gotten significantly larger as we\u2019ve gone forward. And I think it\u2019s appropriate in that environment to be a little more cautious on what we expect to close rates to be. The business itself is very healthy. If I look at the end of the spectrum, the small enterprise part of the business, for example, it actually outgrew the other two parts of the business in the last quarter by \u2013 it took about a point of mix, I think, from the other two. So I feel \u2013 feel good about the business, but just a little cautious about the macro environment as we go forward, how to forecast what\u2019s coming from the sales team.\nBrad Zelnick: It makes total sense and in line with a lot of other data points that we\u2019re all seeing out there. I guess just maybe as you think about what contributes to that, is there \u2013 it doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s anything competitive, but what are the customers doing? Are they shrinking deal sizes? Are they just taking more time and sweating out their existing assets? Any other color on that would be helpful. Thanks.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see deal sizes getting smaller one because we\u2019re moving into the enterprise. If we were more established there and it was just kind of the same routine over and over, the fact that we\u2019re growing in the enterprise, and again, you saw the numbers is going to by itself, increase our average deal size. I certainly do feel that there\u2019s caution is corporate America and the rest of the world is probably going through their budgeting cycles right now and looking at what they\u2019re planning for, not only the end of 2022 and 2023. I think the other aspect of that, and again, I think this is fairly consistent with the other comments we\u2019ve probably heard. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good time to really get in a position of forecasting some sort of significant budget flush in the fourth quarter. If it develops, that would be fantastic. But I think prudence is a little bit appropriate here.\nBrad Zelnick: It makes total sense to me. Thank you so much for taking the questions.\nKeith Jensen: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. And next up, we have Shrenik Kothari, Shrenik from Robert Baird, your line is open. Thank you. Shrenik Kothari at Robert Baird, your line is open. Okay. We will move on to the next question. Please standby. Tal Liani at Bank of America. Tal, your line is open.\nMadeline Brooks: Hi, here is Madeline on for Tal today. Just two quick ones for me, and I apologize if this has already been mentioned or running between a few earnings right now. But just to be \u2013 just as Steve very pointed about it, last quarter, we heard bookings and bookings was a little bit softer than expected. This quarter, no disclosure in bookings. And again, I apologize, this was already mentioned. But just want to get, Keith, from your perspective directly, why no bookings for this quarter after a weaker quarter of booking last quarter.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. We talked a link of this before you get on the call and for everybody\u2019s benefit, I\u2019ll just quickly kind of go through it. Yes, I think when we got into this conversation a year ago, we felt the backlog, which is really the driver of the bookings conversation was something that we thought was important to investors to understand and be able to track how we\u2019re performing as a business and what they\u2019re seeing in the drivers. As we\u2019ve moved forward, I think that if you fast forward a year later, I think we feel more comfortable now about some of the backlog forecasting. And earlier, we made reference that backlog may exit the year, something closer to 400 or a little bit north of that. And so with that in mind, I think we\u2019re bringing ourselves back into what I would call industry norms, where nobody else really discloses this information, but we thought it was appropriate for the first year. I would also offer one comment about backlog that\u2019s important, and we get a lot of conversations around cancellation rates. Our cancellation rate has been extremely consistent at about 4% each and every quarter.\nKen Xie: Also, the composition of backlog is kind of different now compared to one year ago, which is one year ago, I have to say, majority of that \u2013 related to the FortiGate and now FortiGate is less than one-third of the whole backlog and the majority of backlog that come from the switch and AP Wi-Fi, which is also kind of a more industry problem, which switch and AP more easily customer can change in different vendor compared to the security product, they have to design in, they have to a high switching cost. So that\u2019s where we feel the backlog sometimes unpredictable and with the majority of come from switch and AP.\nMadeline Brooks: Got it. Thanks so much. And just one follow-up question there, too. I just mentioned having a little bit of prudence for going into next year and just your guidance. I\u2019m also just wondering on the visibility side, are you seeing less visibility, the same visibility? Can you just talk to the trends that you\u2019re seeing there in your pipeline?\nKeith Jensen: I think the pipeline visibility is very good. And the pipeline growth is very strong. And I think that one of the things that we did at the end of the prepared remarks was, we went back to the 2022 mid-term guidance numbers that we gave, I think, a $10 billion booking company in 2025 and $8 million in revenue and margins of 25% or more and basically reiterated that. And I think we\u2019re doing that which requires a 22% CAGR from this point forward. We\u2019re doing that with the \u2013 after looking at our pipeline, looking at the strength of our pipeline so that it makes sense to us.\nMadeline Brooks: Got it. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Okay. Getting ready for our next caller. Our next caller is Keith Bachman at BMO. Keith, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nKeith Bachman: Many thanks. I also had two, Keith, to start with you. I wanted to go back to the billings commentary for Q4. Just on the revenue base is essentially the same, and therefore, it\u2019s a DR impact that you\u2019re guiding lower. As you mentioned that you\u2019re expecting backlog to be less than the $500 million and maybe for in change. Did some of that backlog, is it actually then flowing into the billings, and therefore, the billings guide down is even a little bit worse than it actually appears and any other context you could draw out on where specifically that billings weakness is Europe or what have you but if you could flesh those out, then I had a follow-up for Ken, please.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I want to be clear, we are expecting backlog to actually increase from Q3 to Q4, not significantly, but slightly, so.\nKeith Bachman: Okay. So therefore, none of that backlog then is flowing into that billings in Q as anticipated, right?\nKeith Jensen: Correct. I mean you\u2019re always going to get some existing backlog that flows in the buildings, which you\u2019re going to get new backlog, net-net, it\u2019s going to be an add in total to it for the year. And I think the \u2013 and it\u2019s a good question about Europe. I don\u2019t want to \u2013 over that Europe form, you saw the revenue numbers and what we don\u2019t disclose it. I would say the billings numbers Europe performed very, very well in the quarter and their pipeline remains extremely strong as we go forward. Now we\u2019ll see as we get through and get closer to 2023, and I certainly would really agree that there are certain tailwinds that are appropriate for Europe. But to this point, they\u2019ve done it very, very well.\nKeith Bachman: Okay. Ken, for you, then it relates to that very directly relates. As we think about Europe in calendar year 2023, the currency, as you alluded to, is a headwind. So I was just in Europe and customers view that the prices since you price in dollars have actually gone up quite a bit. So is there a risk? Or how should we think about is there a risk of prices actually needing to come down because of the dollar-based pricing and therefore, the significant price increase, if you will, felt by the Europeans, is there a risk that prices need to come specifically down for currency next year? And/or would you see any risk more broadly, whether it\u2019s currency or otherwise, whereby because supply and demand is coming back into balance sometime during CY2023 that there is some risk rather than getting price increases that we might be in a situation where prices actually start to move lower?\nKen Xie: I think first about our price policies really, we \u2013 when there\u2019s a cost increase like components another, we do like take some ourself. And then some others we probably have to pass the customer partner. But even with like price increase, we\u2019re still leading the industry on the price performance on the functionality service. So that\u2019s where so far we don\u2019t see \u2013 in the last year because of pricing and actually, we\u2019re keeping gaining market share because we have a leading price performance especially in a lot of what we call it convergence area and also like SD-WAN and OT is a very, very fast-growing area. So it\u2019s all our price advantage compared to competitors. And also, we do see a lot of potential to drive additional service because our service charge probably average about half of our some of competitor charging some are offer free, some are offer less, some are in sell as a bundle. So we do see a lot of potential growth area in the service, which also have a higher margin.\nKeith Bachman: Okay. Okay. Thank you.\nKeith Jensen: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. Just pulling up our next caller and it\u2019s Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Gregg, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay. Thank you for taking the questions. Keith, I know that you had experienced a bit of a pause in the first 10 days of June. With that in mind, how was linearity in the Q3 period? Were there any air pockets or anything that you would call out?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I don\u2019t think \u2013 we didn\u2019t see anything like we saw good question. We didn\u2019t see anything like the two-week pause or10-day pause. We saw the first part of June in the Q3. I think that \u2013 when we look at linearity, you can see the DSOs, and I think it\u2019s a pretty good reflection of where we\u2019re at with linearity. It has not and probably will never be a 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 business in terms of linearity. You\u2019re always going to get about 50% of your business in the final month of the quarter, but nothing really unusual about the activity there.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay. Thanks. And just as a follow-up, we\u2019re getting quite a few questions about that billings guidance for the Q4. You outlined earlier to in response to Brad\u2019s question, the cash list that\u2019s sort of going into the Q4 guidance and the prudence with respect to the possibility for sales cycles to be elongated. I do just want to be fair, though, on that point. As it relates to the Q3 period and perhaps even the month of October, are you seeing any changes as it relates to average sales cycle?\nKen Xie: We still have a very strong pipeline, actually stronger than before. And at the same time, we built pretty healthy, strong sales capacity to meet out the demand. Keith mentioned some tenure like we have about 50% of sales force actually has a tenure probably not reach the tenure yet, which we believe will become more productive in the next 6 months to 12 months, which also will helping drive the both the top line bottom line.\nKeith Jensen: And just so I don\u2019t if you can because I\u2019ve already done that. So tenure is up about 50% in the people. That as a \u2013 we didn\u2019t have a given a number, but it runs about 30% of the mix. So it\u2019s a significant number of people that we increased that are starting new to the organization.\nGregg Moskowitz: And that will make sense. I\u2019m just wondering if there were any changes perhaps that you noticed that where might have been macro-related affecting sales cycles over the past 3 months to 4 months or so was as possible. It would just be very helpful to get a brief commentary on that as well. Thank you.\nKen Xie: I just think that, as I said earlier in the conversation, as we started to see some \u2013 our deal size is getting larger in the enterprise, we\u2019re certainly subject to more inspection perhaps than the eight-figure deals are started much more inspection than the seven-figure deals worth.\nGregg Moskowitz: Yes. Okay. Makes sense. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Standby for our next question. Adam Tindle at Raymond James is our next caller. Adam, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. Thanks. Good afternoon. Keith, I wanted to start to appreciate that you gave a little bit of color on 2023 on services growth acceleration, obviously, an exciting catalyst I think the flip side of that is we\u2019re just kind of really unsure how to think about puts and takes to the other line item on product revenue growth. Not asking, obviously, for specific guidance, but I\u2019m thinking about these tough comps. You just had very strong growth in one of the toughest comps that you\u2019ve ever experienced in Q3. Your exit rate billings is \u2013 guidance is coming down. I think there\u2019s worry that the cancellation rates are at 4%, but could that ultimately increase with supply chain visibility. So a lot of fear on how bad product revenue growth could ultimately be and certainty on services revenue growth. So anything you could maybe point us to for a realistic view of how to think about puts and takes to product revenue growth in 2023.\nKen Xie: Yes, kind of covering some old ground here. I don\u2019t mean that negatively. One, I would just \u2013 again, the fact that we reiterated the mid-term guidance which is a 22% CAGR is probably a good indicator of how we think about it. I think that investors and analysts and ourselves are trying to understand the timing of when the backlog is going to reverse and actually go to the income statement and have an impact from product revenue. And it\u2019s going to provide \u2013 when it does happen, I think it will provide some elevated product revenue numbers as we look forward to it. Yes, I don\u2019t have another point to that, and I kind of lost my train of thought. I apologize.\nAdam Tindle: Yes. The growth driver we feel has not changed, like the convergence, like all the consolidation, also elevate like a threat environment. That\u2019s how we\u2019re keeping driving the product growth. And also \u2013 the service also I think the product revenue is really the leading indicator of service revenue. So it\u2019s a pretty strong product revenue growth in the last two, three years we do see the service revenue continue to improve.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. And I would come back and just talk a little bit about the cancellation rate comment that concern, again, it has been remarkably consistent at 4%, not suggesting there\u2019s something there that would be a challenge. And certainly, I think the firewall part of that, which is roughly 1/3 is probably very specific to us and not really a commodity. There\u2019s other metrics provided in the past, and we can certainly kind of go through them again over 90% to 95% of all backlogs with existing customers. It\u2019s not as if there\u2019s people coming off to Street trying to order from us because they\u2019re trying to double order or something like that. That\u2019s just not plausible about it. And of what\u2019s in backlog, I think, again, over 50% looking at Peter or not along with the \u2013 agrees with me, that\u2019s been partially delivered. So it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019re going to cancel something. So as a backlog got older, do we have more concerns about it. We watched aging a little bit. Yes, we did, but now we\u2019re starting to see a bit of a plateau here in terms of what the backlog increases are and certainly some easing around to be on the horizon around the supply chain environment. So while we do watch the cancellation rates very, very closely, we are not seeing indicators of concern there.\nKen Xie: Yes. I think one other stat. I think I\u2019m recalling the numbers correctly, I have to look to stack up, but I think the top 20 deals in backlog accounts for like 8% of backlog.\nPeter Salkowski: Yes, that\u2019s what it was. Yes.\nKen Xie: Yes.\nAdam Tindle: Got it. Maybe I can sneak in a quick follow-up. Just to get all the fear out there because aftermarket move suggests there\u2019s a lot of fear. On from a billings basis, you\u2019re mixing towards larger deals, which is obviously a good thing for the business, but your average contract term is flat at 29 months. A number of software companies are seeing durations decline in particular on those large multi-year deals. How do you think about potentially controlling for this so that duration doesn\u2019t become a headwind to billings growth? Thanks.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think as we continue to \u2013 we\u2019ve said for several years that as we continue to expand into the enterprise segment, we expect that that\u2019s going to bring with the longer-term contracts. And it has shown that. If you go a couple of years, I think average contract rates were closer to 24 months or 25 months, and you\u2019re seeing that continued pressure. And I absolutely continue to believe that as we continue to have success expanding the enterprise, and that continues to be a larger part of our business, it will continue to put a bit of tailwind, if you will, on average contract term. I think also SD-WAN has shown to clearly be a longer-term contract that when customers come to the party. So we\u2019re not seeing that. I\u2019m happy to see the last few quarters that we\u2019ve kind of ended that 28%, 29% month and staying at that level. I was actually a little concerned that it was going to continue to grow and get into the low 30s.\nAdam Tindle: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. We have our last question for the session. Michael Turits at KeyBanc. Your line is open, Michael.\nMichael Turits: Thanks. So to the extent you Ken, can you talk whether or not it seems realistic for backlog to continue to rise after this quarter? Or is that the point starts to go down, and at a fundamental level, where do you think we are relative to demand and, if you will, a refresh cycle around data centers that may have been neglected during COVID.\nKen Xie: I have \u2013 probably were not using the refresh because I feel in the last like couple of years, some change in the network security landscape. So I probably more using the convergence, especially we see the strong growth SD-WAN, OT and also internal segmentation, other data center security which security is starting to deploy into the position traditionally network security, not deployed. So that\u2019s actually we plan most of the growth from that area. We do get into some big enterprise. They\u2019re also looking at how do the consolidation like whether networking security, working with the other part of the infrastructure there. And we also see the very, very strong growth for our business in the big enterprise there also. So that\u2019s probably not the times really deploying to the new area and not only the environment is very, very fast and also a lot of like working from home remotely but also a lot of new areas drive a lot of new deployment. So that\u2019s where probably we\u2019re not kind of looking at refresh, replacing some of the old network security device, but it\u2019s more in the new area we see will be \u2013 drive the growth for a very long time in the next 5 years to 10 years.\nMichael Turits: And Keith on backlog?\nKeith Jensen: I\u2019m sorry, backlog.\nMichael Turits: Yes.\nKeith Jensen: I think the last quarter and maybe I think the fourth quarter it would \u2013 the inference would be that we\u2019re at a plateau.\nPeter Salkowski: Still going to depend on supply, though, which is still the dynamic, but.\nKeith Jensen: Yes.\nMichael Turits: Thanks.\nOperator: Okay. At this time, I would like to turn it back to Peter Salkowski, Vice President of Investor Relations for closing remarks. Peter?\nPeter Salkowski: Thank you, Eric. I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining today\u2019s call. Fortinet will be attending investor conferences hosted by Barclays, Stifel and Wells Fargo during the fourth quarter. Fireside webcast links will be posted on the Events and Presentations section of our website. If you have any follow-up questions, please [indiscernible] Thank you very much.\nOperator: And this concludes our program. You may now disconnect. Thank you.",

            "content": "Thanks, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our outstanding third quarter 2022 results. Revenue for the quarter grew 33%, significantly outpacing the industry growth rate. We believe that customer recognition of the exceptional value proposition we provided by our high performance Forti-ASIC technology and integrated FortiOS operating system is driving our ability to take cyber security market share. Product revenue growth was very strong at 39%, extending our position as a product revenue leader in the cybersecurity industry. Our product revenue performance reflects the strong demand we have built over the past 18 months across our security solutions along with the successful execution of our internal teams in managing the supply chain challenges. Three growth drivers, the heightened threat environment, the convergence of security and networking, and the consolidation of security functionality and the vendors, together with the opportunity to upsell additional security services to our significant installed base are expected to drive future growth. First, the threat landscape, including ransomware, continue to expand and evolving targeting companies of all size, location and industries. To counter the threat landscape, we are implementing our unique Universal ZTNA across a wide range of customers, driving triple-digit growth for this product and delivering a comprehensive approach to zero trust that is consistent for any user, anywhere, on any device and supporting today's hybrid workforce. Second, for years Fortinet has led strategies around the convergence of networking and security. We estimate the total addressable market for networking and security will increase from $54 billion today to $73 billion in 2026. Convergence accelerates digital transformation and substantially reduce operational costs by combining networking modernization with dynamic security that seamlessly span every part of the network, especially now that many companies are merging SOC and NOC operations together. Fortinet is leading the convergence trend with a wide range of technologies including Network Firewall and Segmentation, Secure SD-WAN, OT Security, and 5G in a single operating system which can be deployed as hardware, software, cloud, and As a Service. Fortinet continues to gain Secure SD-WAN market share as our integrated Secure SD-WAN solution delivers better security, performance and efficiencies over more traditional offerings. In the quarter, SD-WAN and OT bookings grew over 45% and 75%, respectively, and together accounted for over 25% of total bookings. We believe we can achieve number one market share in SD-WAN in the next couple of years. Today, we announced the FortiGate 1000F, our latest innovation in converging networking and security. Powered by our new NP7 SPU, the 1000F delivers 5 to 10 times higher performance across six major network security functions while consuming 80% less power versus competitive solutions. The lower power consumption was a contributing factor in our top 2% ranking in S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment. Our third growth driver is the consolidation of a vendors and product functionality. With Forti-ASIC's huge computing power advantage, FortiOS can integrate more security functions than our competitors, together with over 30 key products ranging from endpoint to network to the cloud security. Fortinet provides our customers with easier operation while lower the management costs and the total cost of ownership. Additionally, we are very focused on upselling value-added security services to our significant customer base. According to IDC's second quarter unit share data, Fortinet hold a number one market share position for units shipped at 43%, up 210 basis points. We expect to reach 50% market share in the next few years. This leadership position and the substantial installed base creates attractive economy of a scale and the opportunity to upsell additional security services. Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners, and suppliers worldwide for their continued support and hard work. Keith? And also looking at the composition of our backlog, it's only one-third or less related to our network security platform FortiGate more than half related to like a switch in AP, which is a networking equipment which is kind of an industry problem in the networking side because the networking device tend to be more changeable, more standard driven. So a lot of customers, sometimes double, triple order try to get ahead of whatever the supply chain issue and also some of them can easily cancel once they got the product. So that's why we feel probably keeping track in the backlog may not be the best way to forecast the business, and we should be more focused on security, security related, especially driving the future service based on huge FortiGate installation base. Yes. Also, we believe the growth driver, especially the converged network and security. We don't think that's a slowdown. We'll be keeping driving the product revenue growth in the next 5 to 10 years. You can see the secure SD-WAN and OT both had a pretty healthy growth. And at the same time, we will continue to growth in the next 5 to 10 years in a huge market potential. I think that's where \u2013 if you look at the 13-year history, we as a public company, we always balance the growth and with the margin. So that's where we feel the 25% above is a healthy margin and then we can also give the money to invest in the growth become a leader in the space. That's where we're continue to balance, but if the growth slowdown definitely will be more helping in the margin. So that's what we keep in saying the Rule of 40, probably in the last few quarters, we kind of even reached the Rule of 60 now. So that's where also \u2013 when the growth slowed down and sometimes the service revenue has a higher margin, which can also help in the margin, but we do expect the growth will continue in the next few years with the three growth drivers I mentioned and plus additional service revenue to our big installation base, a lot of are not quite unable the security service revenue yet. I think the component and also the cost continue to go up. So that's where \u2013 and also, we still have a pretty tight inventory to make most shipments shipping by air instead of by ocean. So that's where \u2013 so we'll keep it adjusted by all these costs and probably some of the wet ourselves, some of them we may do some price increase, but we also feel even some price increase, we continue to have a price advantage compared to competitive industry average with our own products. So that's where the margin we feel probably will be more stabilized. And that's probably the overall supply probably keep improving. That's where the \u2013 we see pretty strong growth related to the SD-WAN and OT, which more using the low end unit and at the same time, the supply chain improvements help a little bit. That's where the \u2013 we'll be able to shipping more product in the low line side. We still have some backlog in the middle high end, but it's a low end had some improvement by redesign some of the products and also better supply chain right now I think we have a few unique advantage. The first from day one, we developed the FortiASIC, which have a huge companion power increase compared to using traditional CPU, but also FortiASIC also working side by side with the CPU. So that's the huge computing power advantage comes from FortiASIC give us more computing power for the FortiOS to run more function, more security function including a lot of networking function. So that advantage is none of our competitors have that. So that's making us keeping driving the market share and also the unit shipment, I mentioned, we like 43% of our market shareholder unit shipment there. So that's what we keeping \u2013 give us a long-term growth going forward because also on the convergence of security networking the secure computing power it must have a huge need to address both security and networking function there. Second is for the FortiOS is well integrate together with more function, leverage, security and power. So that's also kind of a huge advantage for us compared to some other competitor, whether they have to use like a different blade or different functions. They have to go to some different parts or even to the cloud to address some secure computing power there. And then third one, we also have about 30 different products, mostly home developed and integrate, automate together. So that's also what helping drive we call the wider security fabric on called a mesh network. So that's also helping the customer to lower the management cost and total cost of ownership. I think all these three factors we're keeping driving Fortinet better position for the consolidation, both on the product functionality and also on different products into a single vendor platform strategy. Also, the composition of backlog is kind of different now compared to one year ago, which is one year ago, I have to say, majority of that \u2013 related to the FortiGate and now FortiGate is less than one-third of the whole backlog and the majority of backlog that come from the switch and AP Wi-Fi, which is also kind of a more industry problem, which switch and AP more easily customer can change in different vendor compared to the security product, they have to design in, they have to a high switching cost. So that's where we feel the backlog sometimes unpredictable and with the majority of come from switch and AP. I think first about our price policies really, we \u2013 when there's a cost increase like components another, we do like take some ourself. And then some others we probably have to pass the customer partner. But even with like price increase, we're still leading the industry on the price performance on the functionality service. So that's where so far we don't see \u2013 in the last year because of pricing and actually, we're keeping gaining market share because we have a leading price performance especially in a lot of what we call it convergence area and also like SD-WAN and OT is a very, very fast-growing area. So it's all our price advantage compared to competitors. And also, we do see a lot of potential to drive additional service because our service charge probably average about half of our some of competitor charging some are offer free, some are offer less, some are in sell as a bundle. So we do see a lot of potential growth area in the service, which also have a higher margin. We still have a very strong pipeline, actually stronger than before. And at the same time, we built pretty healthy, strong sales capacity to meet out the demand. Keith mentioned some tenure like we have about 50% of sales force actually has a tenure probably not reach the tenure yet, which we believe will become more productive in the next 6 months to 12 months, which also will helping drive the both the top line bottom line. I just think that, as I said earlier in the conversation, as we started to see some \u2013 our deal size is getting larger in the enterprise, we're certainly subject to more inspection perhaps than the eight-figure deals are started much more inspection than the seven-figure deals worth. Yes, kind of covering some old ground here. I don't mean that negatively. One, I would just \u2013 again, the fact that we reiterated the mid-term guidance which is a 22% CAGR is probably a good indicator of how we think about it. I think that investors and analysts and ourselves are trying to understand the timing of when the backlog is going to reverse and actually go to the income statement and have an impact from product revenue. And it's going to provide \u2013 when it does happen, I think it will provide some elevated product revenue numbers as we look forward to it. Yes, I don't have another point to that, and I kind of lost my train of thought. I apologize. Yes. I think one other stat. I think I'm recalling the numbers correctly, I have to look to stack up, but I think the top 20 deals in backlog accounts for like 8% of backlog. Yes. I have \u2013 probably were not using the refresh because I feel in the last like couple of years, some change in the network security landscape. So I probably more using the convergence, especially we see the strong growth SD-WAN, OT and also internal segmentation, other data center security which security is starting to deploy into the position traditionally network security, not deployed. So that's actually we plan most of the growth from that area. We do get into some big enterprise. They're also looking at how do the consolidation like whether networking security, working with the other part of the infrastructure there. And we also see the very, very strong growth for our business in the big enterprise there also. So that's probably not the times really deploying to the new area and not only the environment is very, very fast and also a lot of like working from home remotely but also a lot of new areas drive a lot of new deployment. So that's where probably we're not kind of looking at refresh, replacing some of the old network security device, but it's more in the new area we see will be \u2013 drive the growth for a very long time in the next 5 years to 10 years."

            "name": "Keith Jensen",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's start with an overview of our strong third quarter performance. Revenue of $1.15 billion was another quarterly record for Fortinet, increasing 33% year-over-year and 12% sequentially; our highest third quarter sequential growth rate in eleven years. We continue to deliver better than industry average top-line growth and generate strong profitability. Our operating margin exceeded guidance at over 28%, driving the adjusted free cash flow margin to 40%. Our history as a public company has revolved around the Rule of 40, measured as the combined total of revenue growth and operating margin. Impressively, the Q3 total came in at over 60. We continue to see success in our strategy for expanding further into the large enterprise segment. The number of deals over $1 million increased over 80% to 153 deals. The total billings value of deals over $1 million more than doubled driven by a record number of deals over $5 million, and G2000 bookings increased over 40%. Our strong third quarter results reflect solid customer demand across both our Core and Enhanced Platform Technologies and the exceptional performance of the team in a challenging supply chain environment. We believe the investments we've made in building our platform and our go-to-market engine enables our customers' digital transformation journey. Our platform strategy allows customers to converge networking functionality with security capabilities while consolidating cybersecurity products, providing security across their entire digital infrastructure while lowering their operating costs. Recently, the Forrester Wave Enterprise Firewalls report acknowledged the success of our investment strategy, placing Fortinet as a leader for the first time in its history. According to Forrester, \u201cFortinet excels at performance for value and offers a wide array of adjacent services. Long known for its bang-for-the-buck approach to network security, Fortinet has built a flexible and capable platform with its flagship product, the FortiGate Firewall.\" Taking a closer look at the income statement, product revenue grew 39%. Product revenue growth for our Core and Enhanced Platform Technology products increased 29% and 51%, respectively. The product revenue growth rate accelerated over 4 points sequentially, especially impressive given it is our toughest year-over-year comparison in over 10 years. Service revenue was up 28%, accelerating 3 points sequentially driven by strong product revenue growth and seven consecutive quarters that increased our term deferred revenue growth rates. Support and related service revenue was up 28%, accelerating over 2 points sequentially to $311 million. While security subscription service revenue was up 29%, accelerating 4 points sequentially to $370 million. Total revenue in the Americas increased 34%. EMEA revenue increased 37% and APAC posted revenue growth of 23%. Total gross margin at 76.2% exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Product gross margin of 61% was up 30 basis points year-over-year. Services gross margin of 86.6% was flat year-over-year, but up 70 basis points sequentially. Operating margin of 28.3% was up 250 basis points, benefiting from FX and the operating margin leverage that comes with higher revenues. Shifting to billings. Billings of $1.4 billion were up 33%, representing the sixth consecutive quarter of billings growth in excess of 30%. Core platform billings were up 27% and accounted for 67% of total billings. As shown on Slide 6, we entry-level FortiGates posted very strong billings growth with the mix shifting 16 points in their favor, driven by demand and as we expected improved supply. Enhanced platform technology billings were up 45% and accounted for 33% of total billings, a positive mix shift of 3 points. Average contract term was flat year-over-year at 29 months. Looking at the statement of cash flow summarized on Slide 7 and 8. Free cash flow was $395 million. Adjusted free cash flow, which excludes real estate investments, was $464 million, representing a 40% adjusted free cash flow margin. DSOs were down five days sequentially while increasing 12 days year-over-year to 75 days. Cash taxes were $69 million. Capital expenditures were $88 million, including $69 million for real estate investments. We repurchased 10.2 million shares of our common stock for a cost of $500 million, bringing the year-to-date totals to 36 million shares at a total cost of $2 billion. The remaining repurchase authorization totals $530 million. Regarding backlog, the backlog at the end of the third quarter was up slightly from the end of the prior quarter, with FortiGate Firewalls accounting for just one-third of total backlog. We expect fourth quarter ending backlog to be relatively consistent with the third quarter backlog as we are seeing early signs of a transition back to more normalized customer buying behaviors. Moving to guidance. The current environment favors a Fortinet style platform that offers integrated solutions and strong security capabilities and an attractive cost of ownership. To enhance our ability to capture our share of the large market opportunity, we plan to continue to invest in innovation across our integrated platform offerings. Now I'd like to review our outlook for the fourth quarter summarized on Slide 9, which is subject to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. And to start, as part of the Q4 guidance setting process, we considered several factors, including the greater macro uncertainty today and with it, the increased risk of forecasting the timing of certain larger transactions. The transition to more normalized customers buying behaviors, which means there is less of an emphasis on ordering to get a place online. And for comparison, in the fourth quarter of 2021, when supply was tighter, backlog increased over $120 million and contributed to 49% bookings growth. And lastly, elevated year early year top line comparisons that include certain onetime items adding a couple of points of service revenue growth and fully cycling the Alaxala acquisition. In response, we have slightly widened our top line guidance ranges. For the fourth quarter, we expect to again reach the Rule of 60. And with that, the key metrics include billings in the range of $1.665 billion to $1.720 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 30%. Revenue in the range of $1.275 billion to $1.315 billion, which represents growth of 34%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%, non-GAAP operating margin of 30% to 31%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.38 to $0.40, which assumes a share count of between $795 million and $805 million. We expect capital expenditures of $75 million to $85 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 17%. And for the full year, we expect billings and revenue growth to exceed 30% for the second consecutive year. Billings in the range of $5.540 billion to $5.595 billion, which at the midpoint represents 33%, revenue in the range of $4.410 billion to $4.450 billion, which represents growth of 33%. Perhaps for context, we should note at the midpoint, these full year billings and revenue growth rates are 3 points higher than the initial growth rates we provided in early February, despite the start of the war in Ukraine in late February, significant increases in interest rates and increasing uncertainty in the macro environment, and importantly, full year backlog is expected to be above the February estimate of $350 million. Total service revenue in the range of $2.645 billion to $2.655 billion, which represents growth of 27% and implies full year product revenue growth of 42%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%; non-GAAP operating margin of 26% to 27% at the midpoint a year-over-year increase of 30 basis points. And again, for context, at the midpoint, gross and operating margin expectations were 50 and 100 basis points above the February guide, respectively. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.13 to $1.15, which assumes a share count of between $800 million and $810 million. We expect full year capital expenditures of $325 million to $335 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 17%. We expect cash taxes to be $265 million. Before wrapping up, I'd like to offer some preliminary thoughts on 2023 and our midterm targets on the heels of a very strong set of growth in 2021 and in 2022. We continue to successfully balance growth and profitability, while investing in longer-term innovation and go-to-market initiatives to future growth. The strength of our business model includes its diversification, margins that provide capacity for future investment and a rich mix of higher-margin recurring service revenues. As we saw in the highs of pandemic, the diversification helps mitigate the risk of economic slowdowns. Specifically, in 2020, we delivered operating margins of nearly 27%, adjusted free cash flow margin of over 38% and top line growth of 20%. And during the past 12 months, we have really exceeded our target operating margin targets, while increasing our engineering headcount by about 20% and significantly increasing our future sales capacity by over 25%, including a greater than 50% increase in new, non-tenured, salespeople. While we will provide more detailed 2023 guidance when we report our fourth quarter results, it's worth noting this revenue accounts for 60% of total revenue, with gross margins hovering above 85%. We see continued service revenue growth driven by two years of very strong product revenue growth and seven consecutive quarters accelerating short-term deferred revenue growth. With a strong business model and the history of being able to execute, we are confident that our momentum will continue and point to our key growth drivers, including strategic investments, the heightened threat environment, the convergence of networking and security, the cybersecurity consolidation. Cyber securities are not immune to economic slowdowns is expected to remain a relatively safe harbor. As such, we remain on track to achieve all of our medium-term financial targets from our May 2022 Analyst Day, including $10 billion in billings and $8 billion in revenue in 2025, each representing a 22% three-year CAGR from the midpoint of our 2022 guidance. The targets also included an average non-GAAP operating margin of at least 25% for the four years from 2022 to 2025 and a 2025 adjusted free cash flow margin in the mid-to-high 30% range. Illustrating our long-term focus for balancing growth and profitability, our targets remain committed to the Rule of 40 or better. I'll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A. Okay. I think when we talk about normalized buying behavior, I think that we certainly saw some enterprise customers in the U.S. during the supply chain challenges. They were placing orders to get in line to hold their place in line for when the inventory is available. And I think I'll say a year ago or so that, that was an appropriate behavior when there was a lot of uncertainty around the supply chain and maybe they're planning what we're going to do in 2022. I think that somewhat in general now, and maybe Ken will talk more about this, I think people are getting is that the \u2013 certainly, we are, but the supply chain is a little bit easier to forecast and somewhat easier to manage. I don't mean by any stretch easy, but I do think it's easier. And with that, I think you're starting to see the market drift back towards the emphasis start to what I would call more traditional buying, which is when they need it, they're placing the order. Yes. I think we've been messaging throughout the quarter at various conferences that \u2013 and even in the prior quarter that we had a clear expectation that service revenue growth has accelerated. So we're very pleased to see that. I think there's a number of things that are providing a tailwind into that. Customer registering units is part of that. I think also the price increase is making its way first into orders and deferred revenue and now into the income statement. Keeping in mind that we have contracts at sometimes or as long as five years, that will give you a sense of how long the tailwind may relate to price increases as we will continue to cycle through renewals at old prices and replace them with new contracts. So I think we feel good about the direction of the service revenue and the margins that it provides, together with the fact that it's 60% of our business. Yes. I think Alaxala is probably the easiest one to talk about in terms of providing numbers. We've talked about the fact that their revenue stream was probably something in the order of $130 million to $140 million when we acquired them and reminded people that they are a March 31 year-end, so their fourth quarter is a little bit off cycle. I think that it's growth single digits. So I think that probably gives people a good level expectation reminder there that our interest in Alaxala is a lot to run at the IP and some opportunities that we have there to do things more longer term, if you will. In terms of other unique things about product revenue in the quarter, I mean, I think that as the backlog comes into revenue as we go through the end of 2022 here and certainly into 2023 is tend to provide, again, a fairly significant tailwind to what the product revenue growth will be in 2023, assuming we get the drawn in backlog that we may see. Yes. I would probably certainly agree with Ken operate just a little more detail on it. Keeping in mind that our \u2013 we sell in U.S. dollars, so there's really not a direct FX impact there. On the revenue line, obviously, you can get into certain countries where the pressure on discounting, if you will, because of exchange rates can be a little more intense. But on the OpEx, because 30% of our business is in the U.S. and the rest is international. We do get a tailwind from OpEx from the strength of the U.S. And I think you're seeing that in Q3 and you're seeing that in Q4. And probably why it's important is that we've talked for a number of years now around and made reference to 25% operating margin. If you go back four years ago, five years ago, it was probably a target to get to 25% operating margin. And since then, we've talked about averaging 25%, so I think a floor of 25%. It has certainly served us well as a way to help other people understand about how we invest in the business, and as Ken makes reference to it. As we have funds available over that 25% operating margin, it creates opportunities for some, not necessarily all that you're seeing currently of those margin dollars to be reinvested back in innovation and back into our go-to-market strategy. Yes. I think I'll come back to kind of Ken's commentary around backlog, which is really what kind of drives the conversation about bookings. I think a year ago, when we introduced the backlog metric, there was a lot of uncertainty around what the supply chain crisis was going to look like and how it might impact our business and the purpose of providing the backlog disclosure and the booking disclosure then was to kind of round out and help investors understand more about our business model as we go forward. And as we heard in the question earlier from one of the questions, at the beginning of year, what kind of a swag \u2013 that kind of swag backlog growth of $350 million in the first quarter and then it came back and said, in the second quarter, maybe it's going to get closer to $500 million for the full year. And now I think we're looking at a number that's going to be less than that, something in the floor probably seems reasonable from where we're at. And I think with net-net, the message there's two messages to I think we're becoming much more comfortable with our ability to execute in this environment and maybe some easing in the environment itself. And then secondly, I think that it was always our intention. I think we messaged this that these will be short-term metrics that we provide \u2013 and I think they've served us and our investors well for an extended period of time, but it's probably time now that we feel that we've gotten a better control on it to bring us more \u2013 bring us back online, if you will, with what our industry competitors are disclosing and not disclosing. Yes, we're not going down to the detail of talking specifically about bookings, as I just mentioned going forward from our backlog, more than what we've given to this point. Yes. Ken, spot on with that. I probably a couple a little more granularity. I think if you maybe look at it between product gross margin and services gross margin, the product win is the one that's probably more volatile related to what we're seeing. We've certainly heard commentary that maybe things are easing a little bit, the chip manufacturers, but I would say that there's no indication of any sort of cost reduction savings that are coming from either chip manufacturers or the component suppliers. So what we'll see how that plays out. Our strategy has been, and Ken alluded to this, is that we came into this economic cycle a year ago, believing that we had a price performance advantage and that we could raise prices and our target was really to pass along most but not all the price increases, call it plus or minus 1% margin. It's kind of our target every quarter. It doesn't fall that way every quarter because of various variables. And I would imagine that to the extent that prices can remain to be elevated as we move into 2023, that's kind of the starting point for our price strategy into 2023 as well, again, because we have not seen signs that we've lost the pro formas advantage. In fact, we continue to win that way. Service is a little bit different. I mean, the largest cost component in services is labor. And if you look back, we're a company that has its annual merit increase in the first or second month of the year, so you kind of get a rather immediate job on the COGS line from those \u2013 from the compensation increases, which is certainly appropriate and then you have to grow the service revenue into it. And I think that's part of the conversation about why you saw the reference to sequential margin increases. On the revenue side, it gets fairly complex. Well, maybe that complex. But thinking through how price increases that started about a year ago and kind of at a quarterly pace, if you will, how those price increases will make their way first on the balance sheet in deferred revenue and to what extent each item is going to reflect all those price increases and then how it will come off the balance sheet in future periods. So you will get tailwind from the price increases. And I would expect that particular tailwind should continue to, for an extended period of time. Yes. I think we've made a leadership change there around the end of June, beginning of July, we had a retirement. And I think that's just kind of the transition of leaders, if you will, is one was exiting into retirement and we brought so on. But I think we feel very, very good about in terms of their abilities. And I think the other part of it is you're starting to see the lapping effect of Alaxala because all of Alaxala sitting in APAC. And so you're going to see that now roll up on basically the full quarter comparisons that impact. Yes. Ken talked about this in the past, the ability to introduce the new 70F product in the second quarter. We were a little bit hamstrung in Q2 and the beginning of Q3 even back into Q1 really on the low end. And I think we kind of messaged a bit in our conversations over the last quarter or so that we expected low end supply availability to really jump, if you will, in the third quarter, and we did see that. So it's really more of a supply conversation in some ways as much as it is a demand conversation. Yes. I think you're talking about full year fourth quarter, one of the same at this point. And I would really just point to the macro environment and what we've seen really in the \u2013 over the last 90 days in terms of economic activity, if you will, I think when you look at how that manifests somewhat specifically, I think I'm getting a little more cautious in some of the forecasting of close timing on some of the very large deals. We've been very successful over the last few years. You saw some of the numbers about enterprise penetration with our growth in the enterprise. The deals have actually gotten significantly larger as we've gone forward. And I think it's appropriate in that environment to be a little more cautious on what we expect to close rates to be. The business itself is very healthy. If I look at the end of the spectrum, the small enterprise part of the business, for example, it actually outgrew the other two parts of the business in the last quarter by \u2013 it took about a point of mix, I think, from the other two. So I feel \u2013 feel good about the business, but just a little cautious about the macro environment as we go forward, how to forecast what's coming from the sales team. Yes. I don't think we're going to see deal sizes getting smaller one because we're moving into the enterprise. If we were more established there and it was just kind of the same routine over and over, the fact that we're growing in the enterprise, and again, you saw the numbers is going to by itself, increase our average deal size. I certainly do feel that there's caution is corporate America and the rest of the world is probably going through their budgeting cycles right now and looking at what they're planning for, not only the end of 2022 and 2023. I think the other aspect of that, and again, I think this is fairly consistent with the other comments we've probably heard. I don't think it's a good time to really get in a position of forecasting some sort of significant budget flush in the fourth quarter. If it develops, that would be fantastic. But I think prudence is a little bit appropriate here. Thank you. Yes. We talked a link of this before you get on the call and for everybody's benefit, I'll just quickly kind of go through it. Yes, I think when we got into this conversation a year ago, we felt the backlog, which is really the driver of the bookings conversation was something that we thought was important to investors to understand and be able to track how we're performing as a business and what they're seeing in the drivers. As we've moved forward, I think that if you fast forward a year later, I think we feel more comfortable now about some of the backlog forecasting. And earlier, we made reference that backlog may exit the year, something closer to 400 or a little bit north of that. And so with that in mind, I think we're bringing ourselves back into what I would call industry norms, where nobody else really discloses this information, but we thought it was appropriate for the first year. I would also offer one comment about backlog that's important, and we get a lot of conversations around cancellation rates. Our cancellation rate has been extremely consistent at about 4% each and every quarter. I think the pipeline visibility is very good. And the pipeline growth is very strong. And I think that one of the things that we did at the end of the prepared remarks was, we went back to the 2022 mid-term guidance numbers that we gave, I think, a $10 billion booking company in 2025 and $8 million in revenue and margins of 25% or more and basically reiterated that. And I think we're doing that which requires a 22% CAGR from this point forward. We're doing that with the \u2013 after looking at our pipeline, looking at the strength of our pipeline so that it makes sense to us. Yes. I want to be clear, we are expecting backlog to actually increase from Q3 to Q4, not significantly, but slightly, so. Correct. I mean you're always going to get some existing backlog that flows in the buildings, which you're going to get new backlog, net-net, it's going to be an add in total to it for the year. And I think the \u2013 and it's a good question about Europe. I don't want to \u2013 over that Europe form, you saw the revenue numbers and what we don't disclose it. I would say the billings numbers Europe performed very, very well in the quarter and their pipeline remains extremely strong as we go forward. Now we'll see as we get through and get closer to 2023, and I certainly would really agree that there are certain tailwinds that are appropriate for Europe. But to this point, they've done it very, very well. Thank you. Yes. I don't think \u2013 we didn't see anything like we saw good question. We didn't see anything like the two-week pause or10-day pause. We saw the first part of June in the Q3. I think that \u2013 when we look at linearity, you can see the DSOs, and I think it's a pretty good reflection of where we're at with linearity. It has not and probably will never be a 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 business in terms of linearity. You're always going to get about 50% of your business in the final month of the quarter, but nothing really unusual about the activity there. And just so I don't if you can because I've already done that. So tenure is up about 50% in the people. That as a \u2013 we didn't have a given a number, but it runs about 30% of the mix. So it's a significant number of people that we increased that are starting new to the organization. Yes. And I would come back and just talk a little bit about the cancellation rate comment that concern, again, it has been remarkably consistent at 4%, not suggesting there's something there that would be a challenge. And certainly, I think the firewall part of that, which is roughly 1/3 is probably very specific to us and not really a commodity. There's other metrics provided in the past, and we can certainly kind of go through them again over 90% to 95% of all backlogs with existing customers. It's not as if there's people coming off to Street trying to order from us because they're trying to double order or something like that. That's just not plausible about it. And of what's in backlog, I think, again, over 50% looking at Peter or not along with the \u2013 agrees with me, that's been partially delivered. So it's unlikely they're going to cancel something. So as a backlog got older, do we have more concerns about it. We watched aging a little bit. Yes, we did, but now we're starting to see a bit of a plateau here in terms of what the backlog increases are and certainly some easing around to be on the horizon around the supply chain environment. So while we do watch the cancellation rates very, very closely, we are not seeing indicators of concern there. Yes. I think as we continue to \u2013 we've said for several years that as we continue to expand into the enterprise segment, we expect that that's going to bring with the longer-term contracts. And it has shown that. If you go a couple of years, I think average contract rates were closer to 24 months or 25 months, and you're seeing that continued pressure. And I absolutely continue to believe that as we continue to have success expanding the enterprise, and that continues to be a larger part of our business, it will continue to put a bit of tailwind, if you will, on average contract term. I think also SD-WAN has shown to clearly be a longer-term contract that when customers come to the party. So we're not seeing that. I'm happy to see the last few quarters that we've kind of ended that 28%, 29% month and staying at that level. I was actually a little concerned that it was going to continue to grow and get into the low 30s. I'm sorry, backlog. I think the last quarter and maybe I think the fourth quarter it would \u2013 the inference would be that we're at a plateau. Yes."

Ken and Keith\u2019s prepared remarks today for the earnings call will be posted on the quarterly earnings section of our Investor Relations website immediately following today\u2019s call. Lastly, all references are on a year-over-year basis, unless noted otherwise. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ken.\nKen Xie: Thanks Peter. Thank you to everyone for joining today\u2019s call to review our outstanding second quarter 2022 results. Total billings increased 36%; the fifth consecutive quarter of at least 35% year-over-year billings growth. Revenue grew 29% driven by 34% product revenue growth. SD-WAN and OT bookings grew over 60% and 75%, which together accounted for 25% of total second quarter bookings. Our better-than-expected performance demonstrates the strong demand for our cybersecurity innovation. Fortinet is at the forefront of networking and security convergence, enabling our customers to reduce complexity, while securing and connecting hybrid and remote users to advanced security with superior performance. Today we announced the FortiGate 4800F, our latest innovation in converged Network Security. The 4800F is the world\u2019s fastest compact firewall for hyperscale data centers and 5G networks. Powered by Fortinet\u2019s NP7 SPU, the 4800F delivers Security Compute Ratings of on average 5-10 times better performance than competitive solutions, across the six most common and important functions. A leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for WAN Edge Infrastructure, Fortinet continues to take market share for Secure SD-WAN. Our integrated secure SDWAN solution, powered by Fortinet\u2019s SPU SOC4, delivers huge performance, security and efficiencies over traditional offerings. In addition to convergence, consolidation of vendors and product functionality is another major trend, particularly in Network Security. In a recent CISO survey, Gartner found the percentage of companies surveyed who want fewer security providers increased to 75% from only 29% in 2020. With over 30 products lines built mostly by our in-house strong engineering and development innovation, Fortinet is benefiting from this consolidation with our Security Fabric MESH offering. The Fortinet Security MESH platform delivers unparalleled protection with broad, integrated and automated protection across multiple edges, from endpoint, to data center, and hybrid cloud environments. These two major trends, convergence and consolidation, position Fortinet well for long-term growth. Before turning the call over to Keith, I\u2019d like to thank our employees, customers, partners and suppliers worldwide for their continued support and hard work, that are contributing to Fortinet\u2019s strong growth.\nKeith Jensen: Thank you, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Let\u2019s start the more detailed quarterly discussion. Second quarter results were solid and broad-based across geographies, customer sizes, industries, and use cases, driving market share gains and demonstrating the strong support from our three key growth drivers: first, an elevated threat environment; second, the convergence of security and networking; and third, the consolidation of security products across our platform offerings. Total revenue of $1.03 billion was up 29%, passing the $1 billion milestone in quarterly revenue for the first time in our history. Total product revenue growth was up 34%. Core Platform and Platform Extension product revenue growth was up 35% and 33%, respectively. We continued to see robust product revenue growth from a wide range of security use cases, including Secure SD-WAN and Operational Technology, or OT. Total service revenue growth increased sequentially to 25%, resulting in service revenue of $629 million. Support and related service revenue was up 26% to $289 million, while security subscriptions service revenue was up 25%, or 2 points sequentially, to $340 million. Service billings, defined as total billings minus product revenue, were up 36%. The year-over-year growth rate for short-term deferred revenue has increased for six quarters in a row from just under 21% in Q4 of 2020 to just over 31% in Q2 of 2022, the highest short-term deferred revenue growth rate in over six years. The accelerating growth rates for service billings and short-term deferred revenue reflect the earlier pricing actions that quickly appeared in product revenue and that are now beginning to appear in service revenue. The pricing benefit more than offset various service revenue headwinds, including suspending services in Russia, an increase in the average number of days between when a customer purchases and subsequently activates a security service contract, and the impact of contract manufacturers delaying deliveries to later in the quarter, which limits our service revenue on new sales recognized in the quarter. With growth and pricing benefits more than offsetting these headwinds, we expect service revenue growth will continue to accelerate through 2022 and into next year. As summarized on slide 6, total revenue in the Americas increased 23%, EMEA revenue increased 28%, and APAC posted revenue growth of 42%. Despite macro conditions that may be more readily impacting other industries, our pipeline growth remains strong. In particular, EMEA\u2019s pipeline growth indicates continued strength in our European business. Moving to a summary of our success with large enterprises. Large enterprises continue to favor Fortinet\u2019s leading cost for performance advantage and are increasingly more appreciative of our integrated platform. The platform strategy allows customers to converge networking functionality with security capabilities and consolidate multiple point products. Our success with large enterprise customers includes: global 2000 bookings growth of over 65% year-over-year and on a rolling four quarter basis; large enterprise bookings growth of over 55% year-over-year and on a rolling 4 quarter basis; and the number of deals over $1 million increased over 50% to 122 deals and the total billings value of these transactions doubled. Secure SD-WAN bookings grew over 60%, reflecting the convergence of networking and security as well as a strong ROI for our customers. OT bookings were up over 75%, reflecting the continued response to the elevated threat environment. Shifting to billings. Billings of $1.3 billion were up 36%, as Ken pointed, representing the fifth consecutive quarter of billings growth in excess of 30%. I\u2019ll pause here to offer thoughts on product refresh cycles and their impact on our financial results. Specifically, we do not believe new product releases drive a near term spike in our top-line growth; rather, we believe the continual nature of our product releases drives long-term growth. For example, each new ASIC is included in a series of products released over several years. Our most recent ASIC chip, the NP7 Security Processing Unit, was introduced in Q1 of 2020. Including the 4800F announced today, we have released 9 high-end Core Platform products with the NP7 chip. Over the next several quarters we will release several additional midrange and high-end products with the NP7. Lastly, I would note that since the start of 2019, we have released over 23 new FortiGate models. While some of our competitors with much shorter product SKU lists may have shown clear signs of product refresh cycles, our strong long-term performance illustrates an extended series of overlapping product maturity curves. Core Platform billings were up 32% and accounted for 69% of total billings. As shown on slide 7, mid-range FortiGates posted very strong billings growth with the mix shifting 5 points in their favor driven by demand as well as supply availability. Platform Extension billings were up 44% and accounted for 31% of total billings, a mix shift of over one 1.5 points. Average contract term was up one month year-over-year at 29 months, driven by the strength from large enterprise customers and the 50% plus increase in the number of deals greater than $1 million. Worldwide government billings grabbed the largest share of the mix at 15% and were up 45%. The top five verticals accounted for 60% of total billings. Moving back to the income statement. Total gross margin of 76.5% exceeded the midpoint of the guidance range by approximately 125 basis points, even as component, labor and freight costs increased, and the year-over-year revenue mix shifted 2 points to product revenue from higher margin service revenue. Product gross margin of 61.9% was up 20 basis points year-over-year and 450 basis points sequentially as pricing actions, product mix, and lower discounting offset higher component and other costs. Service gross margin of 85.9% was down 100 basis points due to increased costs associated with the expansion of our data center footprint as well as labor cost and other costs; partially offset by benefits from FX and some of the earlier pricing actions. Operating margin of 24.8% exceeded the midpoint of the guidance range by approximately 200 basis points. The year-over-year comparison saw the FX benefit offset by lower gross margins, increased travel and marketing costs and other costs. Headcount increased 27% to 11,508. Looking to the statement of cash flows summarized on slides 8 and 9. Free cash flow was $284 million and was impacted by increases in DSO and cash taxes. DSO increased 14 days year-over-year and 5 days sequentially to 80 days due to the change in billing linearity driven by the timing of inventory deliveries from contract manufacturers. New R&D capitalization rules increased second quarter cash taxes by $85 million to $110 million. Second half cash taxes of approximately $135 million are expected to be more evenly spread across the third and fourth quarters. For the first half of the year, our adjusted free cash flow margin, which excludes real estate spending, was 34%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $39 million, including $21 million for real estate investments. We repurchased approximately 14.4 million shares of our common stock for a cost of $800 million, bringing the total year-to-date shares repurchased to 25.8 million for a total cost of $1.5 billion. The Board increased the share repurchase authorization by $1 billion. The remaining repurchase authorization is now $1.03 billion. Inventory turns of 3.1 times were up a half turn year-over-year and down a half turn sequentially. Moving to bookings and backlog. As a reminder, backlog is excluded from the current quarter billings and revenue. Nonetheless, it is expected to provide increased visibility and a top-line tailwind in future quarters. Bookings were up 42% to $1.4 billion. Total backlog of $350 million is up $72 million sequentially and reflects very strong demand. Of the total backlog, networking equipment accounted for about 50%, while FortiGates accounted for 40%. We believe our backlog is very strong and sticky. Existing customers account for over 95% of total backlog and no single end customer accounts for more than low single digits as a percentage of backlog. There are four deals in backlog, all from previously existing customers, with a remaining balance of over $2 million that together account for 6% of total backlog. Just 4% of ending Q1 backlog was canceled in Q2 and about half of the deals in backlog have been partially fulfilled suggesting that double ordering is not a significant contributor to backlog. Consistent with the first quarter, we shipped approximately 60% of the prior quarter\u2019s backlog in the current quarter, as our operation and R&D teams did an excellent job navigating the tough supply chain environment. Nonetheless, we still expect supply chain constraints to be challenging throughout the remainder of the year. We are continuing to address the supply chain challenges in a number of ways, including by increasing inventory purchase commitments, redesigning products, qualifying additional suppliers, and certain pricing actions. We believe that even with these actions, demand will continue to outstrip supply. As a result, we expect backlog to continue to increase in 2022; and while the situation is very dynamic, we believe we will have access to sufficient inventory to meet our guidance. As we balance our pricing actions with the opportunity for continued market share gains, we have passed along most, but not all cost increases. As such, we expect ongoing gross margin volatility from these increases as well as shifts in our product mix related to inventory availability. Before reviewing our guidance, let\u2019s offer a few Fortinet specific observations in areas you may have heard discussed elsewhere. In Q2, we noted certain larger transactions with increased or elongated negotiating cycles. Also, linearity pushed to later in the quarter, and later in the last month of the quarter, mainly due to supply constraints and the deliveries. Lastly, close rates were strong and, importantly, the aggregate value of deals that pushed out were within our historical norms. Now, I\u2019d like to review our outlook for the third quarter as summarized on slide 10, which is subject to the disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the third quarter, we anticipate our solid third quarter pipeline growth across deal types, sizes and geographies to support the following: Bookings in the range of $1,455 million to $1,485 million, which at the midpoint represents bookings growth of 36%; billings in the range of $1,385 million to $1,415 million, which represents growth of 32%; revenue in the range of $1,105 million to $1,135 million, which represents growth of 29%; non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%; non-GAAP operating margin of 25% to 26%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.26 to $0.28, which assumes a share count of between 810 million and 820 million; we estimate third quarter capital expenditures to be between $105 million and $115 million; we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 17%. For the full year, we anticipate backlog that could approach or possibly exceed $500 million that will be offset by robust industry growth, pipeline strength, and market share gains fueling our growth and support the following: Billings in the range of $5,560 million to $5,640 million, which at the midpoint represents growth of 34%; revenue in the range of $4,350 million to $4,400 million, which represents growth of 31%; total service revenue in the range of $2,620 million to $2,670 million, which represents growth of 27% and implies full-year product revenue growth of 38%; we expect non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%; non-GAAP operating margin of 25% to 26%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.01 to $1.06, which assumes a share count of between 810 million and 820 million; we estimate full year capital expenditures to be between $300 million and $330 million; we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 17%; we expect cash taxes for the year to be $265 million, as I mentioned earlier, cash taxes paid are higher in 2022 due to the new R&D capitalization rules in the U.S. Along with Ken, I would like to thank our partners, customers, suppliers, and all members of the Fortinet team for all of their hard work, execution and success. I\u2019ll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A session.\nPeter Salkowski: Thank you, Keith. As a reminder, during the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question to allow others to participate. With that, Hope, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Essex with GS.\nBrian Essex: Great. Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for taking the questions. Congrats to team on a nice set of results for the quarter. I was wondering if maybe -- and Keith, I certainly appreciate the commentary and the granularity with the full year revenue guide. Can we maybe unpack some of the commentary on the services side and the lower, I guess, services revenue guide for the year? Maybe help us understand what\u2019s going on there. And maybe pair that with your comments on delays in activations and how much insight you might have there that gets folks comfortable that there isn\u2019t pull-forward? Thank you.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I don\u2019t think -- Brian, I don\u2019t think pull forward really applies to the service revenue line, but maybe -- it\u2019s actually a couple of questions at once. I think the answer to your question about service revenue, I think the biggest change from where we started the year is really about Russia. If you think about Russia, we talked at the very beginning, it\u2019s about 1.5% of our total revenue. And it applies to the service revenue line as well. Earlier in the year, we stopped recognizing revenue on existing contracts for services that provide in Russia in conjunction with our suspending of services. At that time, we did not anticipate it would be a full year event, but we are now. And if you kind of think through that 1.5% of service revenues in Russia, so we really backed out now for the full year about $25 million of revenue related to Russia. That\u2019s the largest change there. I think the delay in registrations from when contracts are sold, when they\u2019re actually registered by customers, I think we pretty much got out of the quarter what we expected on that. That seems to be something in the current environment with inventory constraints that we\u2019re going to continue to see. I think the linearity part of it is a little bit new in that because the shipments occurred later in the quarter, there really wasn\u2019t the opportunity to get the service revenue from those Q2 shipments that we would normally get. And so, I think those are really the parts to put together there. On the other side, I would probably point to, again, the short-term deferred revenue billings and the number that we\u2019re putting up here and the growth that you\u2019re seeing with that number as well as service billings itself. And I think the last comment on this, and we haven\u2019t talked about it before, is that the service contracts are really a use it or lose it contract, meaning it\u2019s not that they have the ability to cancel, they just have the ability to postpone the registration for a period of time, whether -- depending upon the geography, whether that\u2019s 90 days or one year or what have you. So, eventually, it comes to revenue, but the timing has been pushed out to that aspect.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Fatima Boolani with Citibank.\nFatima Boolani: Hey. Keith, this one\u2019s for you. Just with respect to some of the backlog detail and commentary that you shared, I want to hone in on the cancellation rates that you quantified for us. I believe you said it was about 4%. Can you give us a sense of what are some of the reasons behind the cancellation? And what gives you confidence that that 4% isn\u2019t going to stretch or escalate into maybe mid to high single digits? Thank you.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think I would point to some of the factors that we\u2019ve talked about before. I think that last quarter, we talked about the cancellation rate being 5%, I think we\u2019re seeing it now 4%. I think it\u2019s unlikely that existing customers, particularly those that have received partial shipments are going to cancel. Also, I don\u2019t want to -- that it\u2019s na\u00efve that as backlog gets older, and it\u2019s also why we provide that 60% of shipments from prior backlog number for The Street to try and understand it. But if that number starts to tick up, obviously, there\u2019s more risk in it. I think it\u2019s important to understand the guidance that we provide really isn\u2019t reflecting in any sort of shift in the backlog that we\u2019re going to ship a lot of things from backlog. So, I think we\u2019re fairly prudent in that regard, and I think we\u2019re also comfortable with described as the stickiness of the backlog number.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Borg with Stifel.\nAdam Borg: Maybe just on the macro. You talked a little bit about the demand environment and highlighted some delayed deals and elongated linearity. Can you maybe go a little bit deeper here and talk about what these customer conversations look like? Are these tied to any particular verticals or geographies? You talked a little bit about large enterprise or larger deals. I\u2019d love to hear about the midsize to smaller deals, too. Thanks.\nKen Xie: It\u2019s Ken. So, we do see a lot of customers, especially enterprise, they\u2019re starting to design some new infrastructure to support and work from anywhere and also expand security beyond the traditional network security and to whether like internal segmentation to prevent nowadays ransomware attack or go to work from home and at the same time, have multiple security products, need to be automated together. So we call the consolidation, both on the product side, on the vendor side. I see this kind of trend will be last for the next few years, will be pretty long-term change. And at the same time, Keith also mentioned elevated security environment also other drive. So, that\u2019s where we see the trend we\u2019re keeping going for the next few years. If you look at the billing number compared to two years ago, I mentioned in my script is -- we have over 35% of billing increase in the last five quarters compared to two years ago, Q1 2020 is only about 14%. So, we do see the change in acceleration and also the convergence consolidation going on in the whole space right now will be pretty much the amount of growth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Saket Kalia with Barclays.\nSaket Kalia: Keith, maybe for you. I\u2019d like to talk a little bit about bookings. Can you just talk about how bookings did versus your expectation this quarter? I think the guide coming into Q2 was for about 40% growth. We came in at 42%, clearly better, but a bigger delta on the billings versus the guide. And so, can you just talk about how to read into that, if there\u2019s anything to consider there with just those two kind of in relation to each other?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I don\u2019t -- I think, obviously, 42% bookings. I think we\u2019ve been over 40% now for 3 quarters, maybe 4 quarters in the bookings line, we feel really, really good about it. I think the one thing that we\u2019re looking at internally, it\u2019s just that the interplay between bookings, backlog and billings and trying to really get a sense of the direction of the business. And the example I kind of gave is we had a very good quarter on the midrange of the product. But some of that was due to availability. Demand was very strong, but it was also because we had the midrange product available. We didn\u2019t have as much product available in the low end. Now, as we shifted to this third quarter, I think we\u2019re probably going to see the low end availability improved fairly dramatically. And so, when you\u2019re looking at billings information that we have historically disclosed and trying to gauge the direction of the business, it gets a little bit distorted now just in terms of what\u2019s available. And I think of the total when you look at bookings and backlog, there\u2019s some of that as well in terms of the characterization of what the booking is versus the characterization of what\u2019s available to ship and what comes in the billings line.\nKen Xie: Also compared to one year ago, maybe a tough comparison because we\u2019re started to see the acceleration about five quarters ago.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Tindle with Raymond James.\nAdam Tindle: Keith, you talked in the prepared remarks about still expecting supply challenges for the rest of the year and to offset you\u2019re thinking increased purchase commitments, qualifying additional suppliers and pricing actions. I wanted to zoom in on that last point on pricing actions to see if you would maybe put a finer point on timing and magnitude for expected pricing actions? And secondly, you sounded positive on elasticity and confident on the elasticity moving forward. But just curious what underpins that confidence, especially in international markets with dollar strengthening in local currencies and fixed budgets, et cetera? Thank you.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. Great question. And I\u2019ll take the last one first because I think it\u2019s probably very important, and I probably forgot the first one already. So one of the things that we do is we track very religiously in our CRM tool when a customer -- if we lose a deal, we want to know why, right? Is it because we could not overcome the incumbency, is it because the channel partner may have had a bias, if you will, to one of our competitors, a feature issue, a functionality issue or something like that, but also very specifically, do we lose on price. And we\u2019ve been tracking that now for over a year. And that percentage, which is low -- lower than the other ones that I just gave in to you, has been extremely consistent. And so with that very consistent loss percentage, if you will, I translate that into price elasticity, which tells me that the question is always how far can you push the envelope. We know we come into the conversation with a significant price and performance advantage, The Street sometimes -- or channels just may say 30% or 40%. We have known that from the beginning of this phase of the economic cycle. And the question has become how far can we push that. But again, keep in mind, our goal is really to try over a longer period of time just match the cost increases and maintain a consistent margin. It\u2019s not that we\u2019re really trying to take down more margin. Now you will get volatility quarter-to-quarter because of the mix and things like that. So, a long-winded way to say, I think I really hang my head on what I\u2019m seeing and we\u2019re tracking on the CRM data about reasons that we lose deals and reasons that we win deals.\nKen Xie: Yes. And also a few other comments about pricing. Our policy tends to be just by the price by small step, but also kind of more open, like we do have a new price book basically released every quarter. Also, the other thing is really like the product we released today, on average for the same function, for the same price range, our product has a performance factor 10 times better than competitors. Like Keith mentioned, on the CRM on the tracking, we don\u2019t see any big loss on kind of changing or even -- if you do not -- actually improved because we still have a huge price advantage compared to competitors. The other thing also may be mentioned to the service. I think one we may try to improve a little bit going forward is really even in the last few quarters, we increased some of the price more on the new product release, but we are not changing the price for the expired product. Basically, the product is still added to the service like 5, 6 -- right? So, that\u2019s one thing we made because the labor cost on the service and supporting, so we may have to increase the price of the outdated product no longer shipping because all the service or the renew still tied to the old product, which is no longer shipping but is the customer still buying the renewal, buying the service based on the old product. So, that\u2019s probably -- we can also help in the improving the service and also helping the margin and compensate our additional costs, especially on the labor.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Turits with KeyBanc.\nMichael Turits: So, Keith, two questions. First, maybe it seems obvious in some ways, but do you feel like -- and this is the first time that you\u2019ve talked about this linearity issue as well as the extension of the negotiation cycle. So, do you simply tie it to macro being worse right now, or do you have any other insights to it? And then, I just wanted to make sure that in your mind, second question, you really think that it\u2019s really primarily services as a result of those things, this shortfall in the year and you\u2019re happy with product?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. So, I think the -- well, putting aside the -- Mike, you broke the rule and you asked two questions and Peter said only one and a follow-up.\nMichael Turits: Sorry about that...\nKeith Jensen: I think what we\u2019re seeing in linearity, unlike a \u201cnormal world\u201d where you can kind of look at linearity and DSO and you can get a sense for whether or not a company is pushing to close deals at the end of the quarter and maybe it\u2019s a more challenging quarter. Because of the timing of when the finish -- when the inventory is delivered from the contract manufacturers, we see a shift in that linearity of when we receive inventory from our contract manufacturers. That shift then it translates into when we can turn around QA, et cetera, and ship it out to our customers and sell it. So, there\u2019s a different aspect of linear that\u2019s come into play here now. So, service contracts that maybe would have been sold in the first month of the quarter, actually got sold in the third month of the quarter. So, we lose service revenue from that. And you see that appearing in the DSO and you see it appearing in the free cash flow. On the negotiating side of it, I think what we saw, and I don\u2019t know if this is common to others -- what we saw was probably the first two weeks of June and maybe there was more conversation around recession and concerns there, if you will, a bit of a pause in terms of deal closure rates for those first 10 days of June and then a reacceleration as we got through the end of June. We did notice or I did notice during that time frame maybe additional parties were being introduced to either as an approver or a negotiator, if you will, on some of the larger deals just to make sure on the customer side that they were making the right decision. And I think that\u2019s why I went on to say in the prepared remarks, not only did we notice this shift, but the close rates, which were important actually were up just a tad in the quarter. So, I think there was just for whatever reason, there was a slight pause there for a couple of weeks in June and everybody came back and got the deals done by -- on the customer side and our side at that last week in June.\nKen Xie: The other reason for a little bit longer closing time really the bigger deal grow faster. So, like I mentioned, the deal over $1 million grew over 50% year-over-year. So, that\u2019s the bigger deals also tend to be -- take a little bit longer time to close. And also, we see more like a deal involving multiple products, not just the FortiGate, but also we call the non-FortiGate, call the platform retention, which also take a little bit long time to test -- evaluate to close. On the supply chain, since really compared to before the pandemic, we probably ship majority -- most of the products by sea. Now we\u2019re pretty much shipping every product by air. That\u2019s where the timing of the supply shipping the product to us is pretty critical automatically. And so last quarter, we did experience a lot of product being shipped in end of the quarter from suppliers to us, that drives the linearity. Even we have the booking -- but we are the way -- like a few weeks or even a couple of months before the product was shipped to the customer more towards the quarter end because the supply shipping goes pretty much in the end of the quarter. So, we do see long term, this will be changing, improving. We\u2019ll keep increasing some of the product inventory and improving the product turn and also balance among not just shipping everything by air, but some by air, some by ocean.\nOperator: Our next question is from Keith Bachman with BMO.\nKeith Bachman: Good segue from Michael\u2019s question. Keith, I want to try to understand, you talked about a few different things impacting the year guide. To put context around it, your revenue guide for \u201822 isn\u2019t changing, which I think is viewed as a disappointment to investors. Now underneath that, services revenues is getting compressed a little bit. And so, as you think about why the revenue estimates are going higher for the year, is there a change in, a, the demand level, whether it\u2019s the elongation because you said, in fact, there was two weeks, sort of weak at the end of June, but it sounds like during the last -- through the 3rd of August, things have normalized, or is it b, supply chain issues that are causing you to not raise your revenue guidance even as you\u2019re raising billings modestly? I\u2019m just trying to understand what are the forces that are impacting the lack of raise, if you will? Is it the demand side and/or is it the supply side?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s necessarily either demand or supply. I would start the conversation off by saying I think the pipeline growth is extremely strong. We feel very, very good about that. I do think there\u2019s a fair amount of uncertainty as we look out beyond the third quarter to the fourth quarter in terms of directions the economies may go, what inflation may do and a little bit of supply chain. I don\u2019t think -- we did, as you point out, cover the shortfall, if you will, in the service revenue -- economies may go, what inflation may do and a little bit of supply chain. I don\u2019t think -- we did, as you point out, cover the shortfall, if you will, in the service revenue, in the product revenue. So I think that\u2019s a fairly good size of us being bullish and feeling very, very good about our competitive advantage. And I think that the other aspect we talked about is just the large deals and how we\u2019re seeing the success in the enterprise and getting a little more dependent on large deals than we have in prior years and some of the close rates around those. I think that while we\u2019re bullish, we think we have competitive advantages. I don\u2019t know as we get to the fourth quarter, if this is really a good time to think about that in a very, very aggressive fashion.\nKeith Bachman: Okay. So, as I just clarify, so it sounds like you want to be a little bit conservative or you don\u2019t want to get ahead of yourself on particularly the Q4 guide, so lead numbers where they are on revenues, in particular?\nKeith Jensen: Yes, I think that\u2019s a fair description.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shaul Eyal with Cowen.\nShaul Eyal: Maybe segueing from the prior question from revenue maybe to OpEx. So, your hiring plans appear to remain largely on track. What\u2019s the current thinking on second half? Is it becoming a little easier in recent months, given some layoffs at some private competitors?\nKen Xie: We want to maintain healthy margins and then also keeping growth and gaining market, agreed hiring is relatively a little bit easier compared to like a few quarters ago, especially in the cybersecurity space. So for us, we feel we have a good pace on hiring, especially we still -- we\u2019re keeping gaining market share. And the margin -- and it\u2019s a healthy margin, basically, both on the gross margin and also on the operating margin side. So, we feel we have pretty solid plan and balance among the growth and margin.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think Ken\u2019s spot on with that. I would probably offer a couple of things to support. One is you continue to hear us talk about our inventory commitments looking out now 6 quarters or more. I think the read through that is that we still feel fairly bullish about it. And the other aspect of it. And the other aspect of it and Ken made reference to it is we talk about 25% operating margins in different ways over the years as being an average or target, what have you. And obviously, to -- in this environment to -- with high inflation, to come in successfully and still be providing guidance for the full year of 25% to 26%, while growing the top line aggressively while taking market share, I think we feel very good about how the sales team, the engineering team, the operation teams and support teams, et cetera, are all working together and driving the growth of the Company and the execution.\nOperator: The next question comes from Hamza Fodderwala with Morgan Stanley.\nHamza Fodderwala: Maybe a question for both, Ken and Keith. Ken, just given the general pressure on budgets in the macro environment, are you seeing a little bit more impetus to -- from customers to want to consolidate to a converged security networking platform like Fortinet? And then for Keith, if you\u2019re seeing any weakness, let\u2019s say, elongating, negotiating cycles and whatnot? Is it more weighted towards the core platform FortiGate side or the platform extension side, which is in access points?\nKen Xie: It\u2019s a very good question. Definitely, we see the convergence among the network and security. Also the pandemic accelerated this kind of change, especially inside the company, campus network and also work from remote anywhere. So that\u2019s where we see that pretty strong growth. And also a lot of connected devices like in the OT space, also, we see very strong growth. Like we mentioned, SD-WAN grew 60% and the OT growth 75%, and we\u2019re still keeping growth and gaining market share there. And at the same time, have to secure the whole infrastructure not only expanding our network security to the networking side, but also like beyond the network security, with the end point, with the cloud with all the other like application level from email, web, working together. So we do see all these -- we keep saying the convergence and consolidation will benefit Fortinet multiple years going forward, it\u2019s more long-term growth driver for us. And we prepared this in the last like 22 years since start company with investment like from ASIC technology for the R&D with most of the product internally developed to integrate, automate together. And so, we do see the time is starting coming and for all this investment starting to see some good return. And also, we feel we have a very healthy business model since IPO now is about 13 years now, want to maintain the balanced growth and also healthy margin. And that is what makes the company to last longer. And at the same time, we\u2019re also kind of keeping invest in the long term to follow the change and also keep up the innovation and quickly customer benefit from our innovation and also the long-term investment.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. And Hamza, I think your speculation about where the larger or the timing comes in is accurate and that it\u2019s going to be in that 1/3 of our business that is large enterprise. One, the dollars are larger, obviously. And so, they\u2019re going to -- customers spend a little more time with the ROI. But I think more importantly, and to your kind of second point, your question on, by adding in more of the platform products into a deal, you\u2019re perhaps a little more likely to run into additional competitors or people internally that are champions of those competitors. And so, there\u2019s a little more than it takes to get across the finish line because they are more complex in that way. I\u2019ll fill the void here. As a reminder, we did 122 deals over $1 million in the quarter, which -- that\u2019s a pretty fantastic number for us.\nOperator: Our next question is from Gray Powell with BTIG.\nGray Powell: So, Keith, I know you hit on this once or twice already, but I just want to make sure I understand a dynamic on the services billings. So, if I back out product revenue from short-term billings, it looks like the annual recurring component of billings actually accelerated pretty nicely. I\u2019m calculating like 29% in Q1, improving to 40% in Q2. I don\u2019t need you to bless the numbers, but directionally, does that seem right to you? And then, if so, how much of that was driven by pricing dynamics that you talked about versus just the natural cadence of the business?\nKeith Jensen: I do think your math is directionally correct, but it\u2019s lot more time to get anything more about how actually it may or may not be because kind of looking at a different way. And I would say, again, if you think about the timing of where -- when a price increase is effective, right? It\u2019s got to go through the process of being preannounced to the channel partners, they get, I think, 60 days of advanced notice and then whether it\u2019s actually start to have an impact on it. But keeping that in mind, you do see the impact on pricing actions fairly quickly on product revenue and on billings, whether it\u2019s a product or whether it is a service item, right? You will see it there. But on service revenue, you won\u2019t see that benefit for an extended period of time. And I think one thing that may help people, if you think back of our shift from 8 by 5 support to 24 by 7 support. We talked about that for several years because when we turned off the 8 by 5 support, with that came a price lift. And the question that we were addressing, seen for 8, 12 quarters probably in a row, was how was that mix shifting and how was that coming into it. And we were providing information back then about all the buildings, so to speak, are in the 24 by 7, but you\u2019re not seeing the revenue mix that way because it\u2019s kind of -- that mix has to evolve over time as you go through the installed base. Price increases for service revenue, this is just another flavor of the same thing that way. You\u2019re going to see the benefit over a much longer period of time on the service revenue line. You will see the benefit in billings much sooner, and that\u2019s why we gave that information earlier, and you kind of -- Gray, you\u2019re looking at it, that\u2019s a very good leading indicator of where service revenue growth is going to go in the future.\nGray Powell: Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. And then just a real quick follow-up. You mentioned $25 million headwinds on service revenue from Russia, which is a new headwind. Does that apply to billings as well, or was that purely a revenue dynamic?\nKeith Jensen: That was a revenue dynamic, and I would probably say 40% of that probably, 30% to 50% of that would have been a billings dynamic, in terms of where we were from the beginning of the year where we\u2019ll end up now.\nOperator: Our next question is from John Weidemoyer with William Blair.\nJohn Weidemoyer: On your platform extension, cloud security capabilities. I\u2019m curious of the type of customer profile that\u2019s interested there. I suspect they\u2019re probably an existing Fortinet customer that\u2019s transitioning to the cloud. And I\u2019m curious if there are also maybe a fabric mesh. And so there might be an all-in customer -- an all-in Fortinet type customer. Can you talk about the characteristics of the people that are going down?\nKen Xie: We do see the cloud security growing well, pretty much on a similar pace as other networking appliance growth. And also, we do see a lot of cloud security come from the service providers, especially carrier service provider, someone also combined with an offer SDWAN and some also with OT, all this together. So that\u2019s what we keep saying, for better security, the new secured whole infrastructure, not just the cloud, but also appliances and some other product infrastructure. So, we do see more and more customers want to consider overall together. So basically, cost security also drive a lot of other part of cybersecurity, other part of infrastructure for cyber security. And also, we do believe long term, the service provider, both in the telecom space, also in the securities integrate and also like even a cloud provider, will play a very, very important role on this security, especially in the service part. And that\u2019s where we also want to keep supporting them. So, that\u2019s where we see that is kind of a still more hybrid environment going forward and especially with more and more device connected with a lot of other, we see kind of the whole infrastructure security more and more important connect, consider all parts of security together is quite important.\nOperator: Our next question is from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho.\nGregg Mizuho: I\u2019d like to ask about your backlog, which has significantly and consistently increased for each of the last three quarters. It\u2019s dramatically above year ago levels. So, Keith, you made it clear that the backlog should further rise by year-end, which is great. But at the same time, it\u2019s not going to grow forever. And it\u2019s common to see dips in the company\u2019s backlog due to seasonality, significant order shipments, cancellations, et cetera. And so, it would just be helpful to get your sense of perhaps when we begin to see ebbs and flows in the backlog metric. If you could offer anything there, that would be helpful.\nKeith Jensen: When supply chain is going to get better Ken. So, I\u2019ll let you handle that one.\nKen Xie: If you compare to end of Q1, we increased backlog $120-some million. And then end of Q2, we increased about $72 million. It\u2019s a little bit better increase, less than end of Q1 and also less than end of Q4. So, there is some kind of improvement on increased backlog. But also, we put a lot of effort to sourcing different parts or different vendor designed products. So, you see the product line we got quite broad right now. And also can help leverage some kind of -- I mean, some alternative of kind of a more broad supply chain for us. So, that\u2019s why I do believe because the demand is still very, very strong, and so we do see probably keeping -- get a little bit better and better. But like Keith said, we probably not expect backlog will reduce in Q3, Q4. But the increase probably will be less each quarter, I\u2019ll put it this way. And then maybe next year, we\u2019ll see -- starting to see some kind of improvement within the backlog. But overall, with our engineering effort, with the kind of the investment we\u2019ve made in the operation in the manufacture, we do see since that get improved a little bit better now.\nKeith Jensen: I think it was a logical place to have questions and Ken\u2019s comments are great. I would just add to that, keep in mind, the -- this is why we provide some of the metrics there. We\u2019re not -- there\u2019s not airplane orders, right? These are relatively small dollar items compared to what you may see in other industries. And that\u2019s why we gave some of the metrics on the size, if you will, and the fact also that their existing customers and many of those have been partially fulfilled. And we all have the same concern and the question is, how do you get comfortable that that backlog is sticky and it\u2019s going to be here when the product and the supply chain loses up. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re giving those metrics for people to get some sort of context. But keep in mind these are comparatively to other industries, construction industry, airline, what have you, these are very small dollar amounts.\nKen Xie: Also, the age of our backlog probably much better than our competitors. Like Keith mentioned in the last 2, 3 quarters, every quarter, even if we increase the backlog and we fulfill probably like 60%, even over 60% of previous quarter backlog. So, that\u2019s making our age in the backlog also pretty short, few months compared to most other competitors sometimes may take 1 to 2 years to deliver. So, that gives us a pretty good position and also the customer trust continue working with us during this supply chain issue. And at the same time, we offer quite a broad product. There\u2019s always some kind of alternative product because suggest out customer to use if 1 or 2 provide some shortage. I think we deliver over 90% of any booking in every quarter, I believe.\nGregg Mizuho: Yes, the bookings...\nKen Xie: Between 90% to 95% of the booking, we deliver the product.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski with Wells Fargo.\nAndrew Nowinski: Congrats on another great quarter. I had a question on free cash flow. So I think you said you expect the low-end supply appliances to dramatically improve in Q3. So is there a margin or free cash flow impact that mix shift in Q3? And then related to that, given the shortfall on services that we saw in Q2 and the negative impact it had on your free cash flow, should we expect free cash flow to rebound in Q3 and Q4, or are you assuming the linearity remains unchanged in those quarters? Thanks.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I\u2019m assuming the linearity is -- I don\u2019t really have any reason to think that\u2019s going to be any different. I\u2019m looking for a reason to find, but I certainly have not found one yet. So, when we look at what our expectations are internally, we don\u2019t guide to free cash flow, we\u2019re trying to give information is helpful to others. I would assume that -- I have no reason to assume anything other than we\u2019ll still see more of the same, if you will. And then, I think the first part of your question was -- you asked about low end and about margin. And maybe I can offer a little bit of commentary there. When you look at our FortiGate firewall product families, the entry level, the low end, you call it, mid-range and high end. In general, the margins increase -- the gross margin increases as you move up from the entry level to the higher end of it. So from that aspect of it, and that\u2019s why the comment in the script that there can be gross margin volatility both from the pricing actions that we\u2019ve taken and the discounting as well, but also the mix of our product. So, in a quarter that we see a higher mix of higher-end firewall shipments, margins will be higher by definition. But there\u2019s many puts and takes in there that we -- when we go through the gross margin guidance that we give, hopefully, we\u2019re considering all the different puts and takes that are in there, not just the mix of the inventory and the pricing actions.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Roger Boyd with UBS.\nRoger Boyd: Keith, I was curious just to go back to the backlog for a second. You had mentioned the split being about 50-50 between FortiGate and networking portfolio. Just wondering if you could talk about how you expect that mix to trend through the end of the year? And I guess, the follow-up to that is what you\u2019re seeing around the supply constraints between those two product portfolios? Thanks.\nKeith Jensen: Yes, I might double check the numbers. I think it was 50%, 50-40 between FortiGate and networking equipment. I have it backwards. Networking equipment is 50% and firewalls 40% and then cash and dollars the remainder of it. I think everything that we\u2019ve seen to read in here can probably know more, the pressure certainly seems to be for the term, more intense on switches and access points than they do on firewalls. And for a lot of the reasons I think we\u2019re more successful with firewalls.\nKen Xie: Yes, I agree. Probably on the direction wise, we do see the FortiGate inventory will keep improving. So probably the percentage, maybe a little bit more on the backlog, probably a little bit more towards the switching and AP side, which is probably the whole industry is suffering some play issue, because we are more able to redesign and also use our own ASIC, which is also helping kind of reduce the backlog and supply on time for the customer. But it\u2019s -- from the beginning of this backlog issue almost one year ago, definitely, we see the shifting a little bit more towards the networking side that have longer backlog.\nOperator: I would now like to turn it back to Peter Salkowski.\nPeter Salkowski: Thank you, Hope.

            "content": "Thanks Peter. Thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our outstanding second quarter 2022 results. Total billings increased 36%; the fifth consecutive quarter of at least 35% year-over-year billings growth. Revenue grew 29% driven by 34% product revenue growth. SD-WAN and OT bookings grew over 60% and 75%, which together accounted for 25% of total second quarter bookings. Our better-than-expected performance demonstrates the strong demand for our cybersecurity innovation. Fortinet is at the forefront of networking and security convergence, enabling our customers to reduce complexity, while securing and connecting hybrid and remote users to advanced security with superior performance. Today we announced the FortiGate 4800F, our latest innovation in converged Network Security. The 4800F is the world's fastest compact firewall for hyperscale data centers and 5G networks. Powered by Fortinet's NP7 SPU, the 4800F delivers Security Compute Ratings of on average 5-10 times better performance than competitive solutions, across the six most common and important functions. A leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for WAN Edge Infrastructure, Fortinet continues to take market share for Secure SD-WAN. Our integrated secure SDWAN solution, powered by Fortinet's SPU SOC4, delivers huge performance, security and efficiencies over traditional offerings. In addition to convergence, consolidation of vendors and product functionality is another major trend, particularly in Network Security. In a recent CISO survey, Gartner found the percentage of companies surveyed who want fewer security providers increased to 75% from only 29% in 2020. With over 30 products lines built mostly by our in-house strong engineering and development innovation, Fortinet is benefiting from this consolidation with our Security Fabric MESH offering. The Fortinet Security MESH platform delivers unparalleled protection with broad, integrated and automated protection across multiple edges, from endpoint, to data center, and hybrid cloud environments. These two major trends, convergence and consolidation, position Fortinet well for long-term growth. Before turning the call over to Keith, I'd like to thank our employees, customers, partners and suppliers worldwide for their continued support and hard work, that are contributing to Fortinet's strong growth. It's Ken. So, we do see a lot of customers, especially enterprise, they're starting to design some new infrastructure to support and work from anywhere and also expand security beyond the traditional network security and to whether like internal segmentation to prevent nowadays ransomware attack or go to work from home and at the same time, have multiple security products, need to be automated together. So we call the consolidation, both on the product side, on the vendor side. I see this kind of trend will be last for the next few years, will be pretty long-term change. And at the same time, Keith also mentioned elevated security environment also other drive. So, that's where we see the trend we're keeping going for the next few years. If you look at the billing number compared to two years ago, I mentioned in my script is -- we have over 35% of billing increase in the last five quarters compared to two years ago, Q1 2020 is only about 14%. So, we do see the change in acceleration and also the convergence consolidation going on in the whole space right now will be pretty much the amount of growth. Also compared to one year ago, maybe a tough comparison because we're started to see the acceleration about five quarters ago. Yes. And also a few other comments about pricing. Our policy tends to be just by the price by small step, but also kind of more open, like we do have a new price book basically released every quarter. Also, the other thing is really like the product we released today, on average for the same function, for the same price range, our product has a performance factor 10 times better than competitors. Like Keith mentioned, on the CRM on the tracking, we don't see any big loss on kind of changing or even -- if you do not -- actually improved because we still have a huge price advantage compared to competitors. The other thing also may be mentioned to the service. I think one we may try to improve a little bit going forward is really even in the last few quarters, we increased some of the price more on the new product release, but we are not changing the price for the expired product. Basically, the product is still added to the service like 5, 6 -- right? So, that's one thing we made because the labor cost on the service and supporting, so we may have to increase the price of the outdated product no longer shipping because all the service or the renew still tied to the old product, which is no longer shipping but is the customer still buying the renewal, buying the service based on the old product. So, that's probably -- we can also help in the improving the service and also helping the margin and compensate our additional costs, especially on the labor. The other reason for a little bit longer closing time really the bigger deal grow faster. So, like I mentioned, the deal over $1 million grew over 50% year-over-year. So, that's the bigger deals also tend to be -- take a little bit longer time to close. And also, we see more like a deal involving multiple products, not just the FortiGate, but also we call the non-FortiGate, call the platform retention, which also take a little bit long time to test -- evaluate to close. On the supply chain, since really compared to before the pandemic, we probably ship majority -- most of the products by sea. Now we're pretty much shipping every product by air. That's where the timing of the supply shipping the product to us is pretty critical automatically. And so last quarter, we did experience a lot of product being shipped in end of the quarter from suppliers to us, that drives the linearity. Even we have the booking -- but we are the way -- like a few weeks or even a couple of months before the product was shipped to the customer more towards the quarter end because the supply shipping goes pretty much in the end of the quarter. So, we do see long term, this will be changing, improving. We'll keep increasing some of the product inventory and improving the product turn and also balance among not just shipping everything by air, but some by air, some by ocean. We want to maintain healthy margins and then also keeping growth and gaining market, agreed hiring is relatively a little bit easier compared to like a few quarters ago, especially in the cybersecurity space. So for us, we feel we have a good pace on hiring, especially we still -- we're keeping gaining market share. And the margin -- and it's a healthy margin, basically, both on the gross margin and also on the operating margin side. So, we feel we have pretty solid plan and balance among the growth and margin. It's a very good question. Definitely, we see the convergence among the network and security. Also the pandemic accelerated this kind of change, especially inside the company, campus network and also work from remote anywhere. So that's where we see that pretty strong growth. And also a lot of connected devices like in the OT space, also, we see very strong growth. Like we mentioned, SD-WAN grew 60% and the OT growth 75%, and we're still keeping growth and gaining market share there. And at the same time, have to secure the whole infrastructure not only expanding our network security to the networking side, but also like beyond the network security, with the end point, with the cloud with all the other like application level from email, web, working together. So we do see all these -- we keep saying the convergence and consolidation will benefit Fortinet multiple years going forward, it's more long-term growth driver for us. And we prepared this in the last like 22 years since start company with investment like from ASIC technology for the R&D with most of the product internally developed to integrate, automate together. And so, we do see the time is starting coming and for all this investment starting to see some good return. And also, we feel we have a very healthy business model since IPO now is about 13 years now, want to maintain the balanced growth and also healthy margin. And that is what makes the company to last longer. And at the same time, we're also kind of keeping invest in the long term to follow the change and also keep up the innovation and quickly customer benefit from our innovation and also the long-term investment. We do see the cloud security growing well, pretty much on a similar pace as other networking appliance growth. And also, we do see a lot of cloud security come from the service providers, especially carrier service provider, someone also combined with an offer SDWAN and some also with OT, all this together. So that's what we keep saying, for better security, the new secured whole infrastructure, not just the cloud, but also appliances and some other product infrastructure. So, we do see more and more customers want to consider overall together. So basically, cost security also drive a lot of other part of cybersecurity, other part of infrastructure for cyber security. And also, we do believe long term, the service provider, both in the telecom space, also in the securities integrate and also like even a cloud provider, will play a very, very important role on this security, especially in the service part. And that's where we also want to keep supporting them. So, that's where we see that is kind of a still more hybrid environment going forward and especially with more and more device connected with a lot of other, we see kind of the whole infrastructure security more and more important connect, consider all parts of security together is quite important. If you compare to end of Q1, we increased backlog $120-some million. And then end of Q2, we increased about $72 million. It's a little bit better increase, less than end of Q1 and also less than end of Q4. So, there is some kind of improvement on increased backlog. But also, we put a lot of effort to sourcing different parts or different vendor designed products. So, you see the product line we got quite broad right now. And also can help leverage some kind of -- I mean, some alternative of kind of a more broad supply chain for us. So, that's why I do believe because the demand is still very, very strong, and so we do see probably keeping -- get a little bit better and better. But like Keith said, we probably not expect backlog will reduce in Q3, Q4. But the increase probably will be less each quarter, I'll put it this way. And then maybe next year, we'll see -- starting to see some kind of improvement within the backlog. But overall, with our engineering effort, with the kind of the investment we've made in the operation in the manufacture, we do see since that get improved a little bit better now. Also, the age of our backlog probably much better than our competitors. Like Keith mentioned in the last 2, 3 quarters, every quarter, even if we increase the backlog and we fulfill probably like 60%, even over 60% of previous quarter backlog. So, that's making our age in the backlog also pretty short, few months compared to most other competitors sometimes may take 1 to 2 years to deliver. So, that gives us a pretty good position and also the customer trust continue working with us during this supply chain issue. And at the same time, we offer quite a broad product. There's always some kind of alternative product because suggest out customer to use if 1 or 2 provide some shortage. I think we deliver over 90% of any booking in every quarter, I believe. Between 90% to 95% of the booking, we deliver the product. Yes, I agree. Probably on the direction wise, we do see the FortiGate inventory will keep improving. So probably the percentage, maybe a little bit more on the backlog, probably a little bit more towards the switching and AP side, which is probably the whole industry is suffering some play issue, because we are more able to redesign and also use our own ASIC, which is also helping kind of reduce the backlog and supply on time for the customer. But it's -- from the beginning of this backlog issue almost one year ago, definitely, we see the shifting a little bit more towards the networking side that have longer backlog."

            "name": "Keith Jensen",
            "content": "Thank you, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's start the more detailed quarterly discussion. Second quarter results were solid and broad-based across geographies, customer sizes, industries, and use cases, driving market share gains and demonstrating the strong support from our three key growth drivers: first, an elevated threat environment; second, the convergence of security and networking; and third, the consolidation of security products across our platform offerings. Total revenue of $1.03 billion was up 29%, passing the $1 billion milestone in quarterly revenue for the first time in our history. Total product revenue growth was up 34%. Core Platform and Platform Extension product revenue growth was up 35% and 33%, respectively. We continued to see robust product revenue growth from a wide range of security use cases, including Secure SD-WAN and Operational Technology, or OT. Total service revenue growth increased sequentially to 25%, resulting in service revenue of $629 million. Support and related service revenue was up 26% to $289 million, while security subscriptions service revenue was up 25%, or 2 points sequentially, to $340 million. Service billings, defined as total billings minus product revenue, were up 36%. The year-over-year growth rate for short-term deferred revenue has increased for six quarters in a row from just under 21% in Q4 of 2020 to just over 31% in Q2 of 2022, the highest short-term deferred revenue growth rate in over six years. The accelerating growth rates for service billings and short-term deferred revenue reflect the earlier pricing actions that quickly appeared in product revenue and that are now beginning to appear in service revenue. The pricing benefit more than offset various service revenue headwinds, including suspending services in Russia, an increase in the average number of days between when a customer purchases and subsequently activates a security service contract, and the impact of contract manufacturers delaying deliveries to later in the quarter, which limits our service revenue on new sales recognized in the quarter. With growth and pricing benefits more than offsetting these headwinds, we expect service revenue growth will continue to accelerate through 2022 and into next year. As summarized on slide 6, total revenue in the Americas increased 23%, EMEA revenue increased 28%, and APAC posted revenue growth of 42%. Despite macro conditions that may be more readily impacting other industries, our pipeline growth remains strong. In particular, EMEA's pipeline growth indicates continued strength in our European business. Moving to a summary of our success with large enterprises. Large enterprises continue to favor Fortinet's leading cost for performance advantage and are increasingly more appreciative of our integrated platform. The platform strategy allows customers to converge networking functionality with security capabilities and consolidate multiple point products. Our success with large enterprise customers includes: global 2000 bookings growth of over 65% year-over-year and on a rolling four quarter basis; large enterprise bookings growth of over 55% year-over-year and on a rolling 4 quarter basis; and the number of deals over $1 million increased over 50% to 122 deals and the total billings value of these transactions doubled. Secure SD-WAN bookings grew over 60%, reflecting the convergence of networking and security as well as a strong ROI for our customers. OT bookings were up over 75%, reflecting the continued response to the elevated threat environment. Shifting to billings. Billings of $1.3 billion were up 36%, as Ken pointed, representing the fifth consecutive quarter of billings growth in excess of 30%. I'll pause here to offer thoughts on product refresh cycles and their impact on our financial results. Specifically, we do not believe new product releases drive a near term spike in our top-line growth; rather, we believe the continual nature of our product releases drives long-term growth. For example, each new ASIC is included in a series of products released over several years. Our most recent ASIC chip, the NP7 Security Processing Unit, was introduced in Q1 of 2020. Including the 4800F announced today, we have released 9 high-end Core Platform products with the NP7 chip. Over the next several quarters we will release several additional midrange and high-end products with the NP7. Lastly, I would note that since the start of 2019, we have released over 23 new FortiGate models. While some of our competitors with much shorter product SKU lists may have shown clear signs of product refresh cycles, our strong long-term performance illustrates an extended series of overlapping product maturity curves. Core Platform billings were up 32% and accounted for 69% of total billings. As shown on slide 7, mid-range FortiGates posted very strong billings growth with the mix shifting 5 points in their favor driven by demand as well as supply availability. Platform Extension billings were up 44% and accounted for 31% of total billings, a mix shift of over one 1.5 points. Average contract term was up one month year-over-year at 29 months, driven by the strength from large enterprise customers and the 50% plus increase in the number of deals greater than $1 million. Worldwide government billings grabbed the largest share of the mix at 15% and were up 45%. The top five verticals accounted for 60% of total billings. Moving back to the income statement. Total gross margin of 76.5% exceeded the midpoint of the guidance range by approximately 125 basis points, even as component, labor and freight costs increased, and the year-over-year revenue mix shifted 2 points to product revenue from higher margin service revenue. Product gross margin of 61.9% was up 20 basis points year-over-year and 450 basis points sequentially as pricing actions, product mix, and lower discounting offset higher component and other costs. Service gross margin of 85.9% was down 100 basis points due to increased costs associated with the expansion of our data center footprint as well as labor cost and other costs; partially offset by benefits from FX and some of the earlier pricing actions. Operating margin of 24.8% exceeded the midpoint of the guidance range by approximately 200 basis points. The year-over-year comparison saw the FX benefit offset by lower gross margins, increased travel and marketing costs and other costs. Headcount increased 27% to 11,508. Looking to the statement of cash flows summarized on slides 8 and 9. Free cash flow was $284 million and was impacted by increases in DSO and cash taxes. DSO increased 14 days year-over-year and 5 days sequentially to 80 days due to the change in billing linearity driven by the timing of inventory deliveries from contract manufacturers. New R&D capitalization rules increased second quarter cash taxes by $85 million to $110 million. Second half cash taxes of approximately $135 million are expected to be more evenly spread across the third and fourth quarters. For the first half of the year, our adjusted free cash flow margin, which excludes real estate spending, was 34%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $39 million, including $21 million for real estate investments. We repurchased approximately 14.4 million shares of our common stock for a cost of $800 million, bringing the total year-to-date shares repurchased to 25.8 million for a total cost of $1.5 billion. The Board increased the share repurchase authorization by $1 billion. The remaining repurchase authorization is now $1.03 billion. Inventory turns of 3.1 times were up a half turn year-over-year and down a half turn sequentially. Moving to bookings and backlog. As a reminder, backlog is excluded from the current quarter billings and revenue. Nonetheless, it is expected to provide increased visibility and a top-line tailwind in future quarters. Bookings were up 42% to $1.4 billion. Total backlog of $350 million is up $72 million sequentially and reflects very strong demand. Of the total backlog, networking equipment accounted for about 50%, while FortiGates accounted for 40%. We believe our backlog is very strong and sticky. Existing customers account for over 95% of total backlog and no single end customer accounts for more than low single digits as a percentage of backlog. There are four deals in backlog, all from previously existing customers, with a remaining balance of over $2 million that together account for 6% of total backlog. Just 4% of ending Q1 backlog was canceled in Q2 and about half of the deals in backlog have been partially fulfilled suggesting that double ordering is not a significant contributor to backlog. Consistent with the first quarter, we shipped approximately 60% of the prior quarter's backlog in the current quarter, as our operation and R&D teams did an excellent job navigating the tough supply chain environment. Nonetheless, we still expect supply chain constraints to be challenging throughout the remainder of the year. We are continuing to address the supply chain challenges in a number of ways, including by increasing inventory purchase commitments, redesigning products, qualifying additional suppliers, and certain pricing actions. We believe that even with these actions, demand will continue to outstrip supply. As a result, we expect backlog to continue to increase in 2022; and while the situation is very dynamic, we believe we will have access to sufficient inventory to meet our guidance. As we balance our pricing actions with the opportunity for continued market share gains, we have passed along most, but not all cost increases. As such, we expect ongoing gross margin volatility from these increases as well as shifts in our product mix related to inventory availability. Before reviewing our guidance, let's offer a few Fortinet specific observations in areas you may have heard discussed elsewhere. In Q2, we noted certain larger transactions with increased or elongated negotiating cycles. Also, linearity pushed to later in the quarter, and later in the last month of the quarter, mainly due to supply constraints and the deliveries. Lastly, close rates were strong and, importantly, the aggregate value of deals that pushed out were within our historical norms. Now, I'd like to review our outlook for the third quarter as summarized on slide 10, which is subject to the disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the third quarter, we anticipate our solid third quarter pipeline growth across deal types, sizes and geographies to support the following: Bookings in the range of $1,455 million to $1,485 million, which at the midpoint represents bookings growth of 36%; billings in the range of $1,385 million to $1,415 million, which represents growth of 32%; revenue in the range of $1,105 million to $1,135 million, which represents growth of 29%; non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%; non-GAAP operating margin of 25% to 26%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.26 to $0.28, which assumes a share count of between 810 million and 820 million; we estimate third quarter capital expenditures to be between $105 million and $115 million; we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 17%. For the full year, we anticipate backlog that could approach or possibly exceed $500 million that will be offset by robust industry growth, pipeline strength, and market share gains fueling our growth and support the following: Billings in the range of $5,560 million to $5,640 million, which at the midpoint represents growth of 34%; revenue in the range of $4,350 million to $4,400 million, which represents growth of 31%; total service revenue in the range of $2,620 million to $2,670 million, which represents growth of 27% and implies full-year product revenue growth of 38%; we expect non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%; non-GAAP operating margin of 25% to 26%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.01 to $1.06, which assumes a share count of between 810 million and 820 million; we estimate full year capital expenditures to be between $300 million and $330 million; we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 17%; we expect cash taxes for the year to be $265 million, as I mentioned earlier, cash taxes paid are higher in 2022 due to the new R&D capitalization rules in the U.S. Along with Ken, I would like to thank our partners, customers, suppliers, and all members of the Fortinet team for all of their hard work, execution and success. I'll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A session. Yes. I don't think -- Brian, I don't think pull forward really applies to the service revenue line, but maybe -- it's actually a couple of questions at once. I think the answer to your question about service revenue, I think the biggest change from where we started the year is really about Russia. If you think about Russia, we talked at the very beginning, it's about 1.5% of our total revenue. And it applies to the service revenue line as well. Earlier in the year, we stopped recognizing revenue on existing contracts for services that provide in Russia in conjunction with our suspending of services. At that time, we did not anticipate it would be a full year event, but we are now. And if you kind of think through that 1.5% of service revenues in Russia, so we really backed out now for the full year about $25 million of revenue related to Russia. That's the largest change there. I think the delay in registrations from when contracts are sold, when they're actually registered by customers, I think we pretty much got out of the quarter what we expected on that. That seems to be something in the current environment with inventory constraints that we're going to continue to see. I think the linearity part of it is a little bit new in that because the shipments occurred later in the quarter, there really wasn't the opportunity to get the service revenue from those Q2 shipments that we would normally get. And so, I think those are really the parts to put together there. On the other side, I would probably point to, again, the short-term deferred revenue billings and the number that we're putting up here and the growth that you're seeing with that number as well as service billings itself. And I think the last comment on this, and we haven't talked about it before, is that the service contracts are really a use it or lose it contract, meaning it's not that they have the ability to cancel, they just have the ability to postpone the registration for a period of time, whether -- depending upon the geography, whether that's 90 days or one year or what have you. So, eventually, it comes to revenue, but the timing has been pushed out to that aspect. Yes. I think I would point to some of the factors that we've talked about before. I think that last quarter, we talked about the cancellation rate being 5%, I think we're seeing it now 4%. I think it's unlikely that existing customers, particularly those that have received partial shipments are going to cancel. Also, I don't want to -- that it's nai\u0308ve that as backlog gets older, and it's also why we provide that 60% of shipments from prior backlog number for The Street to try and understand it. But if that number starts to tick up, obviously, there's more risk in it. I think it's important to understand the guidance that we provide really isn't reflecting in any sort of shift in the backlog that we're going to ship a lot of things from backlog. So, I think we're fairly prudent in that regard, and I think we're also comfortable with described as the stickiness of the backlog number. Yes. I don't -- I think, obviously, 42% bookings. I think we've been over 40% now for 3 quarters, maybe 4 quarters in the bookings line, we feel really, really good about it. I think the one thing that we're looking at internally, it's just that the interplay between bookings, backlog and billings and trying to really get a sense of the direction of the business. And the example I kind of gave is we had a very good quarter on the midrange of the product. But some of that was due to availability. Demand was very strong, but it was also because we had the midrange product available. We didn't have as much product available in the low end. Now, as we shifted to this third quarter, I think we're probably going to see the low end availability improved fairly dramatically. And so, when you're looking at billings information that we have historically disclosed and trying to gauge the direction of the business, it gets a little bit distorted now just in terms of what's available. And I think of the total when you look at bookings and backlog, there's some of that as well in terms of the characterization of what the booking is versus the characterization of what's available to ship and what comes in the billings line. Yes. Great question. And I'll take the last one first because I think it's probably very important, and I probably forgot the first one already. So one of the things that we do is we track very religiously in our CRM tool when a customer -- if we lose a deal, we want to know why, right? Is it because we could not overcome the incumbency, is it because the channel partner may have had a bias, if you will, to one of our competitors, a feature issue, a functionality issue or something like that, but also very specifically, do we lose on price. And we've been tracking that now for over a year. And that percentage, which is low -- lower than the other ones that I just gave in to you, has been extremely consistent. And so with that very consistent loss percentage, if you will, I translate that into price elasticity, which tells me that the question is always how far can you push the envelope. We know we come into the conversation with a significant price and performance advantage, The Street sometimes -- or channels just may say 30% or 40%. We have known that from the beginning of this phase of the economic cycle. And the question has become how far can we push that. But again, keep in mind, our goal is really to try over a longer period of time just match the cost increases and maintain a consistent margin. It's not that we're really trying to take down more margin. Now you will get volatility quarter-to-quarter because of the mix and things like that. So, a long-winded way to say, I think I really hang my head on what I'm seeing and we're tracking on the CRM data about reasons that we lose deals and reasons that we win deals. Yes. So, I think the -- well, putting aside the -- Mike, you broke the rule and you asked two questions and Peter said only one and a follow-up. I think what we're seeing in linearity, unlike a \u201cnormal world\u201d where you can kind of look at linearity and DSO and you can get a sense for whether or not a company is pushing to close deals at the end of the quarter and maybe it's a more challenging quarter. Because of the timing of when the finish -- when the inventory is delivered from the contract manufacturers, we see a shift in that linearity of when we receive inventory from our contract manufacturers. That shift then it translates into when we can turn around QA, et cetera, and ship it out to our customers and sell it. So, there's a different aspect of linear that's come into play here now. So, service contracts that maybe would have been sold in the first month of the quarter, actually got sold in the third month of the quarter. So, we lose service revenue from that. And you see that appearing in the DSO and you see it appearing in the free cash flow. On the negotiating side of it, I think what we saw, and I don't know if this is common to others -- what we saw was probably the first two weeks of June and maybe there was more conversation around recession and concerns there, if you will, a bit of a pause in terms of deal closure rates for those first 10 days of June and then a reacceleration as we got through the end of June. We did notice or I did notice during that time frame maybe additional parties were being introduced to either as an approver or a negotiator, if you will, on some of the larger deals just to make sure on the customer side that they were making the right decision. And I think that's why I went on to say in the prepared remarks, not only did we notice this shift, but the close rates, which were important actually were up just a tad in the quarter. So, I think there was just for whatever reason, there was a slight pause there for a couple of weeks in June and everybody came back and got the deals done by -- on the customer side and our side at that last week in June. Yes. I don't really think it's necessarily either demand or supply. I would start the conversation off by saying I think the pipeline growth is extremely strong. We feel very, very good about that. I do think there's a fair amount of uncertainty as we look out beyond the third quarter to the fourth quarter in terms of directions the economies may go, what inflation may do and a little bit of supply chain. I don't think -- we did, as you point out, cover the shortfall, if you will, in the service revenue -- economies may go, what inflation may do and a little bit of supply chain. I don't think -- we did, as you point out, cover the shortfall, if you will, in the service revenue, in the product revenue. So I think that's a fairly good size of us being bullish and feeling very, very good about our competitive advantage. And I think that the other aspect we talked about is just the large deals and how we're seeing the success in the enterprise and getting a little more dependent on large deals than we have in prior years and some of the close rates around those. I think that while we're bullish, we think we have competitive advantages. I don't know as we get to the fourth quarter, if this is really a good time to think about that in a very, very aggressive fashion. Yes, I think that's a fair description. Yes. I think Ken's spot on with that. I would probably offer a couple of things to support. One is you continue to hear us talk about our inventory commitments looking out now 6 quarters or more. I think the read through that is that we still feel fairly bullish about it. And the other aspect of it. And the other aspect of it and Ken made reference to it is we talk about 25% operating margins in different ways over the years as being an average or target, what have you. And obviously, to -- in this environment to -- with high inflation, to come in successfully and still be providing guidance for the full year of 25% to 26%, while growing the top line aggressively while taking market share, I think we feel very good about how the sales team, the engineering team, the operation teams and support teams, et cetera, are all working together and driving the growth of the Company and the execution. Yes. And Hamza, I think your speculation about where the larger or the timing comes in is accurate and that it's going to be in that 1/3 of our business that is large enterprise. One, the dollars are larger, obviously. And so, they're going to -- customers spend a little more time with the ROI. But I think more importantly, and to your kind of second point, your question on, by adding in more of the platform products into a deal, you're perhaps a little more likely to run into additional competitors or people internally that are champions of those competitors. And so, there's a little more than it takes to get across the finish line because they are more complex in that way. I'll fill the void here. As a reminder, we did 122 deals over $1 million in the quarter, which -- that's a pretty fantastic number for us. I do think your math is directionally correct, but it's lot more time to get anything more about how actually it may or may not be because kind of looking at a different way. And I would say, again, if you think about the timing of where -- when a price increase is effective, right? It's got to go through the process of being preannounced to the channel partners, they get, I think, 60 days of advanced notice and then whether it's actually start to have an impact on it. But keeping that in mind, you do see the impact on pricing actions fairly quickly on product revenue and on billings, whether it's a product or whether it is a service item, right? You will see it there. But on service revenue, you won't see that benefit for an extended period of time. And I think one thing that may help people, if you think back of our shift from 8 by 5 support to 24 by 7 support. We talked about that for several years because when we turned off the 8 by 5 support, with that came a price lift. And the question that we were addressing, seen for 8, 12 quarters probably in a row, was how was that mix shifting and how was that coming into it. And we were providing information back then about all the buildings, so to speak, are in the 24 by 7, but you're not seeing the revenue mix that way because it's kind of -- that mix has to evolve over time as you go through the installed base. Price increases for service revenue, this is just another flavor of the same thing that way. You're going to see the benefit over a much longer period of time on the service revenue line. You will see the benefit in billings much sooner, and that's why we gave that information earlier, and you kind of -- Gray, you're looking at it, that's a very good leading indicator of where service revenue growth is going to go in the future. That was a revenue dynamic, and I would probably say 40% of that probably, 30% to 50% of that would have been a billings dynamic, in terms of where we were from the beginning of the year where we'll end up now. When supply chain is going to get better Ken. So, I'll let you handle that one. I think it was a logical place to have questions and Ken's comments are great. I would just add to that, keep in mind, the -- this is why we provide some of the metrics there. We're not -- there's not airplane orders, right? These are relatively small dollar items compared to what you may see in other industries. And that's why we gave some of the metrics on the size, if you will, and the fact also that their existing customers and many of those have been partially fulfilled. And we all have the same concern and the question is, how do you get comfortable that that backlog is sticky and it's going to be here when the product and the supply chain loses up. And that's why we're giving those metrics for people to get some sort of context. But keep in mind these are comparatively to other industries, construction industry, airline, what have you, these are very small dollar amounts. Yes. I'm assuming the linearity is -- I don't really have any reason to think that's going to be any different. I'm looking for a reason to find, but I certainly have not found one yet. So, when we look at what our expectations are internally, we don't guide to free cash flow, we're trying to give information is helpful to others. I would assume that -- I have no reason to assume anything other than we'll still see more of the same, if you will. And then, I think the first part of your question was -- you asked about low end and about margin. And maybe I can offer a little bit of commentary there. When you look at our FortiGate firewall product families, the entry level, the low end, you call it, mid-range and high end. In general, the margins increase -- the gross margin increases as you move up from the entry level to the higher end of it. So from that aspect of it, and that's why the comment in the script that there can be gross margin volatility both from the pricing actions that we've taken and the discounting as well, but also the mix of our product. So, in a quarter that we see a higher mix of higher-end firewall shipments, margins will be higher by definition. But there's many puts and takes in there that we -- when we go through the gross margin guidance that we give, hopefully, we're considering all the different puts and takes that are in there, not just the mix of the inventory and the pricing actions. Yes, I might double check the numbers. I think it was 50%, 50-40 between FortiGate and networking equipment. I have it backwards. Networking equipment is 50% and firewalls 40% and then cash and dollars the remainder of it. I think everything that we've seen to read in here can probably know more, the pressure certainly seems to be for the term, more intense on switches and access points than they do on firewalls. And for a lot of the reasons I think we're more successful with firewalls."

Ken and Keith's prepared remarks today for the earnings call will be posted on the Quarterly Earnings section of our Investor Relations website immediately following today's call.  Lastly, all references to growth through on a year-over-year basis unless noted otherwise. I will now turn the call over to Ken.\nKen Xie: Thanks, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our outstanding first quarter 2022 results. Our better-than-expected first quarter results demonstrate the strong demand of our cybersecurity innovation. Total revenue growth of 34%, driven by record product revenue growth of 54%. Total billings increased 36%. Our strong results reflect new order that was significantly greater than anticipated, partially offset by an increase in backlog. As a result, bookings increased 50% year-over-year to 1,276 billion, which included booking growth for SD-WAN or 54%, Global 2000 growth of 61%, OT growth of 76%. For the quarter, net new backlog was 9% of bookings as we continue to navigate a challenging supply chain environment. We believe that the hybrid network adhere for foreseeable future, and Fortinet is pushing the boundary of what is possible with innovation to enable customers to successfully operate in today's elevated threat environment. Our solid performance and market share gains are being driven by our effort to make our customers our entire infrastructure more secure and integrate in a zero trust network. Fortinet as secure-driven network approach converged networking functionality with security capability fueled by our powerful for ASIC SPU to provide the best performance and rich functionality. The new FortiOS 7.2 offers multiple new and enhanced service across FortiGuard, FortiCare and FortiTrust such as VPNA, identity, demand unboxing, advanced device protection for OT and IoT environment, associated service and in-line capacity. And Fortinet provides one of the broadest security service offering and an average of half the cost compared to our main competitors. In addition, we have prioritized our most organic research and development efforts on integrating security product into our centralized FortiOS fabric platform, which Gartner refer to as a cybersecurity mesh architecture. Today, we announced a new suite of FortiGate powered by our food ASIC SPU, the FortiGate 3700-F,600-F and 700-F deliver high-performance converged networking and security, with security computer reaching of 5 times on average better performance than competitive offerings. During the quarter, we are pleased to review -- to receive the Gartner Peer Insight Customer Choice Award for both 1H infrastructure and next-generation firewall for three years in a row. Our innovation position Fortinet as one of the most influential cyber security leaders. These growth drivers and organic innovation is accelerating our growth potential to new level. Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners and suppliers worldwide for their continued support and hard work. It is their collective effort and a trust that will contribute into Fortinet's strong growth and market share gains.\nKeith Jensen : Thank you, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Before adding to Ken's comments and going into more detail on our Q1 financial results, I'd like to briefly discuss a wording change in how we describe our business. FortiGate is now referred to as the core platform and non-FortiGate is now referred to as the platform extension. This change helps to emphasize the importance of our FortiOS operating system.  FortiOS drives our entire security platform across multiple platform extension use cases, including Zero Trust access, cloud security, security operations and secure networking. With that in mind, let's start with a more detailed Q1 discussion.  Customer demand was again strong and broad-based across geographies, customer sizes, industries, use cases and security solutions, reflecting three key demand drivers, the elevated threat environment, convergence of security and networking and customers consolidating across our platform offerings. These key growth drivers are contributing to our strong results and accelerating pipeline growth. In short, we believe we are in a period of sustained high growth for the cybersecurity industry and Fortinet. Moving to the Q1 financial results. Total revenue of $955 million, was up 34%, driven by record product revenue growth of 54%. Taking into account an $80 million, sequential increase in product backlog. Product bookings growth was 87%. Product revenue growth was -- broad based with core platform and platform extension product revenue growth at 50% and 59%, respectively. While we continue to see robust product growth from our SD-WAN and operational technology, or OT, the core platform product revenue growth was mainly driven by the wide range of other use cases embedded in our operating system. Service revenue was up 24% to $584 million. Support and related services was up 26% to $271 million, while security subscription services revenue was up 23% to $313 million. To offer one observation about how customers may be responding to the supply chain challenges, we are seeing indications that a subset of customer\u2019s place product orders further in advance, and may have delayed purchases or registrations of the related service contracts. This, together with the timing differences with age product and service revenue recognition, creates a lag between product and service revenue growth rates. We expect quarterly service revenue growth to accelerate throughout the rest of the year. As summarized on Slide 6, total revenue in the Americas increased 32%. EMEA revenue increased 25%. And APAC posted revenue growth of 57%, which includes the contribution from AlaxalA. EMEA's growth includes the impact of suspending operations in Russia. Nonetheless, EMEA easily exceeded their internal targets.  Looking forward, EMEA's pipeline growth indicates continued strength in our EMEA business, despite the situation in Eastern Europe and its potential impact on European economies. Platform extension revenue grew 49% and accounted for 34% of total revenue, up 3 percentage points. Moving to bookings, backlog and billings. We are experiencing exceptionally strong demand, demand that continues to exceed supply by more than historical norms. Bookings were up 50% to $1.3 billion, reflecting exceptional demand and a $116 million quarter-over-quarter increase in total backlog, bringing backlog to $278 million. Larger enterprises continue to favor Fortinet's industry-leading cost for performance advantage and are increasingly more appreciative of our integrated platform strategy. The platform strategy allows customers to converge networking functionality with security capabilities and consolidate multiple point products. The following key metrics illustrate growing demand from enterprise customers. Global 2000 bookings were up over 60%. Large enterprise bookings were up over 65%. Secure SD-WAN bookings grew 54%, reflecting the convergence of networking and security as well as a strong economic case. OT bookings were up 76%, illustrating the continued response to the elevated threat environment. As a reminder, backlog is excluded from the current quarter billings and revenue. However, it is expected to provide increased visibility and a top line tailwind in future quarters. At $1.2 billion, billings were up 36%. Core platform billings were up 30%, and accounted for 67% of total billings. As shown on Slide 7, high end FortiGate posted very strong billings growth with a mix shifting 6 points towards high-end appliances. Platform extension billings were up 50% and accounted for 33% of total billings, up 3 percentage points. Average contract term was consistent year-over-year and down 1-month sequentially at 27 months. Moving back to the income statement. Total gross margin was 74.4% as the revenue mix tilted 5 percentage points to product revenue from higher-margin services. Product gross margin of 57.4% reflects the impact of component and freight cost increases as well as higher less predictable component expedite fee expenses and the impact of consolidating AlaxalA\u2019s results. Service gross margin of 85.2% was impacted by AlaxalA, costs associated with the expansion of our data center footprint and increased labor costs. Operating margin of 22% exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by 200 basis points due to increased sales productivity and efficiencies in other OpEx areas offsetting the gross margin decline. Headcount increased 26% to 10,860. Moving to the statement of cash flow summarized on Slides 8 and 9. Free cash flow was $273 million, representing a margin of 29%. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $123 million, including $93 million for real estate investments. Adjusted for real estate purchases, our free cash flow margin was 38%. Our capital expenditure strategy includes investing in cloud and data center infrastructure, as well as our office and warehouse capacity to support our higher levels of growth. We repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares of our common stock for a cost of $691 million. At the end of the quarter, the remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $830 million, with the authorization set to expire in February 2023. Inventory turns at 3.5x were up nearly 1.5x year-over-year. Now let's spend some time reviewing backlog in a bit more detail. As I mentioned earlier, very strong demand for about $116 million increase in total backlog to $278 million. To put this in perspective, total backlog at the end of the first quarter was approximately 6% of our trailing 12-months total billings. We shipped 60% of the Q4 ending hardware backlog in the quarter. In consistent with prior quarters -- the prior quarter, 73% of the backlog relates to expected future product shipments, while the remaining 27% relates to various services. We believe our backlog is very strong and should provide a billings and revenue tailwind to growth in future periods. And there are several reasons and comments we make to support our view, including: existing customers account for 93% of our backlog. And no single end customer accounts for more than a low single-digit percentage of backlog; there are 10 deals in backlog, 9 from existing customers with the remaining balance of over $1 million that together, account for less than 10% of total backlog.  Remaining balances defined as the original order amount less the partial shipments we've made; just 5% of Q4 backlog was canceled in Q1, suggesting that double ordering is not a significant contributor to our backlog. We do not believe that customers are meaningfully pivoting to software form factors from hardware. The software is frequently a more costly option and may require architectural redesign and investment and changes in form factors and other equipment beyond just the firewalls. We believe our competitors are similarly impacted by the supply chain. And finally, more customers are accepting the supply chain challenges and working with us to mitigate the issues by switching products, adjusting deployment schedules and accelerating evaluations of new products. Similar to others, we are experiencing ongoing supply chain challenges. Our responses to these challenges include: significantly increasing inventory purchase commitments; redesigning products; qualifying additional suppliers; and working closely with our suppliers to further enhance our resiliency and mitigate the effects of disruptions. We expect supply chain constraints to be challenging throughout the remainder of the year. As a result, we expect component and logistics costs remain elevated and backlog to increase through the course of the year.  As we balance our pricing actions with the opportunity for continued market share gains, we have passed along most, but not all cost increases. As such, we expect ongoing pressure to gross margins. While the situation is very dynamic, we believe we will have access to sufficient inventory to meet our guidance. The outlook is also subject to the disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the second quarter, we anticipate bookings in the range of $1.325 billion to $1.385 billion, which at the midpoint represents bookings growth of 40%. And we expect billings in the range of $1.225 billion to $1.265 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 30%. Revenue in the range of $1.005 billion to $1.035 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 74.5% to 76%, non-GAAP operating margin of 22% to 23.5%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.05 to $1.10, which assumes a share count of $165 million to $167 million. We estimate second quarter capital expenditures to be between $75 million and $85 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 17%. For the full year, we anticipate backlog could approach or possibly exceed $500 million, and expect billings in the range of $5.500 billion to $5.508 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 32.5%. The revenue in the range of $4.350 billion to $4.400 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 31%. This assumes the current supply chain environment remains constrained throughout the year. Total service revenue in the range of $2.640 billion to $2.700 billion, which represents growth of approximately 28%, and implies full year product revenue growth of approximately 36%. Given our current view of component costs and other supply chain pressures, we expect non-GAAP gross margin of 74% to 76%; non-GAAP operating margin of 24% to 26%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $5 to $5.15, which assumes a share count of between $166 million and $168 million. We estimate full year capital expenditures of between $270 million and $300 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 17%. We expect cash taxes to be approximately $260 million. Lastly, I want to remind everyone that we'll be holding an Analyst Day on May 10, coinciding with Accelerate 2022. A link to register for the webcast is located on the Events and Presentation page of Fortinet's Investor Relations website. And along with Ken, I'd like to thank our partners, customers, suppliers and all members of the Fortinet team for all their hard work, execution and success.  I'll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A.\nPeter Salkowski:  Operator, we can open the line please. \nOperator:  And our first question is from Fatima Boolani from Citi. Your line is open.\nFatima Boolani: Good afternoon. And thank you for taking the question. Keith, a question for you is on the product revenue performance quarterly, one of the more standout metrics among others in the front. You gave us a sense of the top-down dynamics that are helping with respect to the demand environment, the threat environment and consolidation activity as it relates to discrete products. But from a bottom-up or a more micro perspective, can you talk to us about the net impact of the pricing increases that you've realized in the quarter? And if you can speak to linearity in the quarter, if there might potentially have been some acceleration or pull forward of demand that you might have seen later on in the year? Thank you.\nKeith Jensen: Yes, I think the color I can offer on that is I think linearity was again strong in the quarter. We've been, I think, seeing strong linearity for probably four quarters in a row now, measuring month 1 versus month 2. And we did, we've talked before about the price increases. I think the -- and we've talked previously that after discounting, you probably get 55% or something like that -- pardon me, you get 45% afterwards. That was probably a little bit optimistic on my part. I think I was going to get 45% was a little more discounting than maybe I anticipated through that process. And I forgot your third area that you mentioned, I didn't write it down to, I'm sorry. Linearity pricing, something else.\nFatima Boolani: That\u2019s good enough. Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question is from Brian Essex from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBrian Essex: Great. Thank you very much for taking the question and congrats on the results. Really impressive acceleration. Maybe for my one question, I'll commit to keeping to that. Would like to know where you're seeing -- you've got some nice traction upmarket, it seems. And I'd like to know, how we should think about product as you go upmarket as well as services, the margin involved? And maybe if you can hit on lead times as well. I've heard you've done a pretty good job of keeping lead times much lower than your peers. Is that winning new business upmarket substantially as you go to market?\nKen Xie: Definitely, the Fortinet operating team did a very, very good job and also the model we have, working with a manufacturer, working with a -- doing our own ASIC chip directly is also helping. So that's where compared to a lot of other vendors using like third-party on-time supply, which has more difficult to deal with the current supply chain issue. So we do see like with the price increase sometime like as Keith mentioned, there are some more strong requests for some discount and which also we have actually discount, probably to discount more easy to go to a product side than compared to the service side. There's a certain recognition roof, you cannot discount service too much. But also since we have a large strong product, we use security computing region. So that's where for the same function, our performance tend to be 5 times better than competitors. So we do have a market pricing power, which converts customers to move towards our product. At the same time, thinking for the service, we do offer a very broad service, similar better than competitor, but we probably only had about average about half, especially with all the bond orders since. So that's where we do have the pricing power, both on the product and service. That's where the customer doing this time to towards our solution. And also there's a lot of new cases, which our competitors don't have in solution like whether the SD-WAN, vertical to OT, some other part, which also drives quite a lot of additional growth for us.\nKeith Jensen: Yes, I'd probably offer a little more color behind Ken's comments there, if I could, Brian. I think if you think about the market, let's take the networking equipment, switches and access points. I think the constraint exists all around the board, if you will. I don't know that us versus more traditional networking companies have any more availability in those products than anybody else. And when we look at our backlog, that mix seems to certainly support that. Firewalls, I don't see a lot of customers switching over availability. I offered the comment earlier the script, the prepared remarks that 93% of our existing backlog -- or pardon me, of our backlog is with existing customers. So there's 7% of new logos information in that number, not a very big number. And if I look at new logos in terms of the billings and accounts that we got from the quarter, it was very, very normal in terms of both of the billings and the new logos. I think we're about 5,500 or so on new logo. So I don't really see that, if you will, to the concern. And then if I can pivot back to Panama just quickly, I think your final question was about pull forward and space come up again. But again, I think if we were seeing that in light of these tremendous results I don't think I'd sit here and see a pipeline with such a significant growth is what we're seeing. So I don't really know that I would describe this as any sort of pull forward. Are there customers, large enterprises that came to us in place orders for a longer period deployment schedules. Certainly, and I think some of the comments in the script covered that.\nBrian Essex: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is from Saket Kalia from Barclays. Your line is open.\nSaket Kalia: Okay. Great. Hey guys, thanks for taking my question here. Maybe a question for both of you, Ken and Keith. I feel like we've talked a little bit about some of the redesign efforts with some of the newer appliance families recently. I was wondering if you could just talk about some of those efforts that Fortinet has done to maybe help some of those supply chain issues. And how helpful those changes could be in terms of fulfilling the demand that you're seeing?\nKen Xie: Yes. We start in the redesign effort end of last year without the supply restriction audience. You can see the product we announced today, the 4070-F and even the 600-F, probably would move to like kind of redesign, and then some of them also leverage our new FortiASIC chip. That's really helping customers have a different choice, is so important in some shortage. But also in general, we have a much broader product, both in the -- we call the core product FortiGate core platform and also the platform extension. And so that's gives customers a much better choice. So if silicon products, I'm surely they can easily steer to the next product and -- but still offer much better solution compared to other competitors. So that's where the redesign actually does help in a lot to reduce the supply chain limitation we have and also give customers more choice. So we kind of -- we're keeping that effort and keeping off a very broad product portfolio and which we do feel during the supply chain issue or maybe will last you towards the whole year this year will be definitely helping us and helping customers.\nSaket Kalia: Very helpful. Thanks. \nOperator: And our next question is from Adam Borg from Stifel. Your line is open.\nAdam Borg: Great. And thanks so much for taking the question. Either for Ken or Keith, I'm sorry if I missed it, but in the past few quarters, you've talked about increasing traction in some of your non-traditional verticals. I was just curious, how they performed this go around? And assuming you saw a continued traction there, how are you thinking about making any additional investments to just better capitalize on the opportunities there? Thanks so much.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. Peter has got me on a word limit on the script, so I apologize that I got taken out because I thought it was worthwhile comment. But in any event, yes, we got more of the same. We've been looking at about a 3-year 5-point shift to that other group. The other group is everything outside the top 5, and we got that again in the current quarter. I think that if you look at it in that other group, the one vertical that continues to stand out, and I don't think it's surprising when you think about it, has been manufacturing. And I think that, that really speaks to the threat environment, ransomware, OT, things of that nature, manufacturing is trying to desperately to break into the top five of our verticals and getting them closer and closer every quarter.\nAdam Borg: Great. Thanks so much. \nOperator: And our next question is from Jonathan Ho from William Blair and Company. Your line is open. \nJohn Weidemoyer : Sorry for that. I was on mute. Yes, this is John Weidemoyer for Jonathan. Thanks for taking the question. If I heard you correctly, when you mentioned use cases, SD-WAN and OT, you mentioned -- did you say that are the other use cases contributed more to growth or just grew faster?\nKen Xie: The SD-WAN OT definitely grew faster than the overall company beat there. And also...\nKeith Jensen: I think the growth rates were faster, but the total contribution was greater than the other use cases that we're trying to parse there.\nKen Xie: And also the other prices are strong, also above average.\nJohn Weidemoyer: Okay. I just want to clarify that. And I'm hoping that doesn't count as actually my question, but I'll make it easier one for my question. R&D spending going forward, what are your intentions? Do you anticipate any stepped-up investment? Or do you anticipate pretty much typical what you've done in the past?\nKen Xie: We kind of feel the real estate is kind of considered some long-term investment, but starting doing that like 10, 15 years ago. And that our rental cost probably less than half compared to competitors similar of our size. So that's where the $100 million we save every year, probably where we're putting both the real estate and also the R&D some other investments. Sorry, I misunderstand as R&D is not real estate. Yes, the real yet R&D, definitely, we will continue to invest in a lot of long-term R&D projects. is from the ASIC, which we made the investment more than 20 years, give us a huge advantage on technology and also enable us pretty much become the only vendor that can meet this convergence of our security networking trend to offer our high-speed security whether inside the company, one solution within the data center to drive tremendous growth and also much better we call the secure computing region. And also the service with a large quantity of product being deployed, we can offer the service much cheaper than a competitor for same service, and that's really drive a huge value add to the customer.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think from a business model view point, I think we kind of like where we're at with the level of investment that we're making in R&D, we can move by one point or two in a given period. And if you peel back a little bit and just look at the R&D team, there's certainly a significant number of engineers and percentages that are working on the ASIC and the chips and so forth. But I would also offer that we have more software engineers than we do hardware engineers.  And I think the reason for that is it goes back to some of the early comments in the text about how important the operating system is to us. The ASIC enables the operating system. They have to work together. But there's a significant investment there. And I think also the other places with some of these platform extensions, excuse me, my term, we're seeing the opportunity there, I think, to make some more discrete investments and maybe mature some of those products along a little bit more. Just not suggesting significant changes in total spending, but just giving some insights in terms of where we see spending. \nJohn Weidemoyer: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much. \nOperator: And our next question is from Michael Turits from KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nMichael Turits: I was interested in the comments that you made about the strength of hardware and not same form factors switch over significantly to software. And obviously, your product numbers were great. So can you talk about -- and I know you've done it before, but both Keith and Ken, talk about the sources of the hardware/appliance security demand and what the source are and really how sustainable that strong growth should be for how long into the future?\nKeith Jensen: I think you got to be a little bit both. I think the high end FortiGate taking six points of market share is a pretty good indicator. Obviously, the high-end FortiGates are very much targeted at large enterprises. And I think that dovetails very nicely with some of the growth numbers that we gave on G2000 and on the large enterprises as well. I still think that, that's an opportunity for us where we have sometimes not always viewed as being viewed as the incumbent. But I think if you look at our progress over the years in the enterprise sector, particularly in the U.S., which maybe has a little further to go, we're very, very pleased with that. And I would maybe supplement that in terms of enterprise success with the metric that we've talked about from time to time in the past. I think maybe three or four years ago, we talked about in the U.S. of having an account rep ratio of about 65 accounts to 1 rep in the U.S. And that's not really an enterprise model.  And then we made a comment that continuously that we would work to move that number down within the framework with balanced growth and profitability. That number today is about 13 or 14 accounts per rep. So I don't think it's a coincidence that you're seeing the success in the large enterprise with the large appliances given the level of investment that we've been able to make in that segment of the market.\nKen Xie: Also from our beginning, we more look at how to secure the whole infrastructure, especially for the area. Like in the past, whether in the high-speed environment or kind of a branch or remote access is very, very difficult to involve in security because of speed requirement because all these kind of difficult to manage. So that's what we see with our own ASIC and the long-term investments on ASIC, which will enable us to really get in this new area, the traditional network security cannot solve. So that's where we see huge growth in this area. And at the same time, we do keep in promoting we call the convergence and network security. So that's where we competing power from ASIC and also the new FortiOS keeping upgrade every year. So we do see more and more security case and more security being deployed in the whole infrastructure just beyond the traditional network security deployment.\nOperator: And our next question is from Hamza Fodderwala from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nHamza Fodderwala: Hey guys, thank you for taking my question. And thanks for the great detail earlier in the call. Keith, maybe one for you. Just you attributed the gap in the product and the services growth to customers, at least a slight uptick in early ordering versus last quarter, it sounds like, I think that you mentioned about 60% of the hardware backlog that you had in Q4 was billed in Q1. So in terms of your Q2 billings guide, how do you think about that backlog to billings conversion, particularly in a perhaps less certain macro environment and perhaps a little bit more than uptick in early ordering?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think as it relates to how we think about what the backlog might mean, and we just remind people, we made the switch, I think, in the middle of the fourth quarter, asked our sales team to run the business on bookings and then we\u2019ll convert it to billings here, which means working very, very close with our manufacturing team and our operations team. In terms of what they're seeing in terms of availability and what levers they have to pull. And with that in mind, I think the key now, I spend a lot more time with operations as part of the forecasting guidance process than I do with the sales team. And where we've kind of sold out on that is that I get a weekly update from the sales team in terms of what their expectations of backlog are going to be, and we've been doing that every week this year, and I think some of last year.  And they've shown to be fairly darn accurate. I think what you see right now in the first quarter was very high bookings, which drag along some backlog. But I think that the operations team has done a very good job. One thing that we do now use is this concept of what -- how much was net backlog increased as a percentage of bookings. And that number has hovered right around 8.5% to 9% in the fourth quarter in the first quarter. And so when we want to sanity check, what we're hearing from the operations team, we now have a metric that we didn't have six months ago in terms of a little bit of history, and we apply that metric to it, say, does that seem reasonable for all their hard work when you get done, does it seem like it's a reasonable number, and we think it has been.\nOperator: And our next question is from Adam Tindall from Morgan -- at Raymond James. Your line is open.\nAdam Tindle: Okay, thanks. Good afternoon. Keith, I just wanted to ask a question to try to get to the heart of real-time demand and certainly appreciate all the disclosures you've been giving. I'm looking at bookings, obviously, it's been strong on a year-over-year basis, but from Q4 to Q1 sequentially, it was kind of the same level of increases last year. And if I heard you correctly, you can correct me if I'm wrong, but I think your guidance for Q2 bookings implied maybe down a little bit sequentially. And I'm wondering if that's starting to signal that we're plateauing on incremental growth in demand and returning to a new or a more normal orders cadence?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think the -- I probably want to check the numbers. I'm looking at a bookings number in the first quarter, it was about $12.75 and a bookings number in the second quarter that I think we talked about thinking at the midpoint, $13.55. So I don't know that I'm seeing a deceleration as that you may be concerned about.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. I misheard you on the Q2 guidance. I was just looking at from Q4 to Q1. And maybe another one to tackle while we're at it. You talked about the seasonality shift last quarter, two to three points to the back half of the year. Looks like that might be a little bit more smooth based on the updated Q2 guidance and full year guidance. Maybe just what changed on that expectations for a back half versus now?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think what we ended up on the full year number. Through all the analysis that we do, I think the raise for the full year is roughly the beat that we had in the first quarter plus the raise that we had in the second quarter. And we sanity check that we're looking at our pipeline growth or sales capacity, what we think the price increases are going to deliver some more metrics around the backlog and want to make sure that we getting too far ahead of ourselves and over our skis. And I think that's a pretty good number to be at right now in the current environment. There remains a lot of uncertainty, as you know, out there and getting overly bullish on Q3 and Q4 right now. I think we'd like to see how this plays out a little bit more.\nAdam Tindle: Understood. I'm looking forward to the Analyst Day, I'm sure Peter will plug it.\nPeter Salkowski: On that note, next question, please.\nOperator: And our next question is from Andrew Nowinski from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nAndrew Nowinski: Great. Thank you. And congrats on the nice quarter. I just want to ask about your pipeline because this is the second quarter in a row that you've talked about pipeline strength. At the end of Q4, I think you said you had a strong pipeline entering 2022, and now you're saying you have an accelerating or you're seeing accelerating pipeline growth. I'm just wondering if you could put a finer point on that accelerating growth comment and where you\u2019re seeing that growth accelerating. Thanks. \nKeith Jensen: I don't -- I think it's pervasive. And I -- we look at the three different sources of pipeline, the way we talk about the channel, the marketing team and the direct sales force. I think we're pleased with the contribution from all three of them, no doubt about that. We've talked for an extended period of time a few years about the importance of the channel and investments that we make and partnering with them and working together on that. And I think that the channel is holding up their side of the bargain as well.  I think the marketing team, give them a ton of credit. I love the Fortinet championship event and the continued success for it and how they've now leveraged that in other geographies as well. And the direct sales team continues to perform at a very high level and you're seeing the numbers. And obviously, to the extent that you were able to continue to add headcount, like the metric I gave earlier, more people are going to drive more pipeline. So I don't know that I would isolate it to any one of those three areas of where it's coming from or even geographically. I mean it's been strong throughout. Ken, I don't know\nKen Xie: Yes. I agree. Both additional investment we made in the marketing sales, and also restructure the team make it more efficient and drive quite a lot of additional pipeline for us.\nAndrew Nowinski: Okay guys. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is from Ben Bollin from Cleveland Research. Your line is open.\nBenjamin Bollin: Thanks. I appreciate for taking the question. I was hoping you could address a little bit about how you view service opportunities longer term. You suggested you're expecting some catch-up or acceleration on services through back half based on backlog lead times procurement, but interested in how you think the elevated level of appliance placements this year could influence demand for services even beyond 2022.\nKen Xie: Yes, it's a great question. We do see the service will be -- drive additional growth, additional margin for us going forward, especially the new FortiOS 7.2, we offer quite a lot of new service. And a lot of service today, we don't charge customers. And also, on average, our service cost is about half of our own competitors. So there's a lot of room we can grow the service and improving the margin there.  So that will be -- and also with the other we call the platform extension product, which is upsell, cross-sell, which will also kind of drive quite a lot of additional service on the total solution there. So that's where we do believe the service is -- I think in Q1, you see the product revenue growth so strong. And -- but on the other side, the short-term service revenue, also very strong. That's probably be starting to come in later this year. And at the same time, the additional server will be launched with FortiOS 7.2 like the Fortitrust on the CTA, on identity. There's some other service, the CASB, some other we have, we believe will be additional revenue, additional sales, additional margin for us.\nKeith Jensen: Ben, it's Keith. And just from a modeling point of view, keep in mind that those price increases that we had in the second half of last year and the first quarter of this year, that we get that lift in product revenue immediately. It takes a little bit longer to see it in the services line because of how the timing of rev rec. Then I think you're going to start to see between new sales and renewals, the new price points that have been created for the services will start to have an impact, and that's part of the acceleration that we talked about.\nBenjamin Bollin: Thanks guys. \nOperator: And our next question is from Rob Amen from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst : Hey guys, this is Justin on for Rob. I just wanted to follow up on the OT topic. You guys have quantified the success in selling into this use case for a couple of quarters now. I'm just curious how you view the OT as a driver into 2022 and beyond, especially when you consider the explicit federal government guidance and broader spending intentions around protecting critical infrastructure?\nKen Xie: Yes. The OT definitely sees a bigger market going forward, probably bigger than the SD-WAN, which we see pretty strong growth and also -- so that's where the total OTs catching up. I think in the last point -- OT maybe close to 10% of the business and -- but the growth is very, very strong. So that's where we do see a lot of potential, and we also invest a lot in this area to meet the demand.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks. \nOperator:  Our next question is from Gray Powell from BTIG. Your line is open.\nGray Powell: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. And congratulations on the really strong results. So yes, I guess I was just hoping to drill in on the SD-WAN side. How should we think about the growth of your SD-WAN business this year with just within the context of guidance or maybe relative to the overall company growth -- and then how do you feel about the competitive environment in that category and just your ability to maintain growth at or above market rates the next few years?\nKen Xie: First, I do because SD-WAN will continue to grow like 30%, 40% year-over-year in the probably the next 5 years and because it's a technology definitely can read the travel based on application, all these things is a wire benefit for the consumer for the customer. So for us, we offer the only security combined with SD-WAN and also leverage on ASIC to have a huge performance advantage that give us more function. So that's where we -- so far, the SD-WAN we sell as a part of the platform, the FortiGate platform where we don't even try the service, but that's also additional compared to our other vendors, they do have some kind of service charges regular SD-WAN.  So we do see -- we have a huge advantage, both on the function on the cost and the SD-WAN and will continue keeping gaining market share. We do feel we'll be keeping growing above the market growth. But also we feel this is the product we call convergence of our security and networking together. So SD-WAN is more address on one side, but also will helping drive the land side inside the company, the segmentation is a data center and eventually make the whole infrastructure very secure for the customer.\nGray Powell: Understood. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from Irvin Liu from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nIrvin Liu: Hi, thanks for the question. So I was surprised to hear that 93% of backlog is from your existing customers. But I was wondering if you can help us parse through some of that strength within your existing customers. How much of this is addressing the broader growth of their IT workloads and more attack surfaces versus a like-for-like growth in -- or versus, let's just say, installed base refresh? Or is this more of you displacing other vendors within your current customer base? \nKeith Jensen: Yes. I can't really quantify it. I just haven't looked at it that way. It's a good question, a good approach. If I were to make informed judgments, if you will, I think that expansion is by far the largest opportunity for us. It's just the nature of the business. And I think the refresh and the competitive placements are probably fairly close to each other, I would imagine, for the remainder. There is refresh for us is we have a very long product suite. So we Ken will always have a new product. You saw the three new products come out be announced today. So there's always some sort of refresh activity in our own product that's going on there. But we -- I would also note that we are consistently getting more at bats, if you will, more opportunities with sales, more competitive displacement. So I would imagine just my gut is, again, refreshing competitive displacements are probably in a similar neighborhood, but expansion is the biggest.\nKen Xie: Also, we have the biggest customer installation base in the industry. So we have probably call to 40% of total deployed in the industry, probably more than the number 2, number 3, number 4 add together. So that give us a quite a broad customer base. And I think it's close to 600,000 customers, some of them are only using Fortinet solution in part of infrastructure. So now we do see the benefit expand to the additional infrastructure and also what we call fabric of mesh network, we manage it together. So we do see a lot of expansion beyond the initial deployment.\nIrvin Liu: Thank you. That\u2019s helpful.\nOperator: And our next question is from Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Your line is open.\nGregg Moskowitz: Hey, thank you for taking the question. Keith, just to follow up on early ordering last quarter, you had estimated that low single digits of your Q4 business came from product ordered in advance. How would you size this for the Q1? And then just a clarification, if I may. Because obviously, the backlog went up very impressively. Are switches and access points still about two-thirds of your backlog today? Thank you.\nKeith Jensen: I think the backlog is being closer to 50-50 between networking equipment or I guess, I should call it platform extension because it's in there and the firewalls or the core platform. I think it's kind of balanced out. I do think it's low-end FortiGates that are still dominating in the Fortinet space, if you will. I don't remember quantifying early ordering as a percentage, if you will. It's certainly something we've talked about here internally is our way of measuring that. And I think that's why we kind of provide -- Peter is going to give me some coaching here.\nPeter Salkowski: Well, I think what we said in the fourth quarter last year was that we had -- we knew of some transactions, a couple of deals that we knew were going to be ordered -- that be delivered into 2022 that were ordered part of backlog and we're in the backlog in 2021 at the end of the year. That was a few -- a couple of other million dollar deals that we were doing, too.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think the constraints, if you will, on that is more around when is the supply going to be available because it's in backlog, we can deliver as soon as the supply arrives. But that's just more a function of how we're working with our suppliers or anything else. \nGregg Moskowitz: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And there are no further questions on queue. Do you have any closing remarks?\nPeter Salkowski: Thank you, Laurie. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. As a reminder and a plug, Fortinet will be hosting an Analyst Day on Tuesday, May 10, next week. A link to register for the webcast can be found on the Events and Presentations page of the company's Investor Relations website. If you register now, it's a little quicker next Tuesday. You can also register day of. But again, thank you very much for your time. Appreciate the interest in Fortinet. Everybody, have a great day. Take care. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ken Xie",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our outstanding first quarter 2022 results. Our better-than-expected first quarter results demonstrate the strong demand of our cybersecurity innovation. Total revenue growth of 34%, driven by record product revenue growth of 54%. Total billings increased 36%. Our strong results reflect new order that was significantly greater than anticipated, partially offset by an increase in backlog. As a result, bookings increased 50% year-over-year to 1,276 billion, which included booking growth for SD-WAN or 54%, Global 2000 growth of 61%, OT growth of 76%. For the quarter, net new backlog was 9% of bookings as we continue to navigate a challenging supply chain environment. We believe that the hybrid network adhere for foreseeable future, and Fortinet is pushing the boundary of what is possible with innovation to enable customers to successfully operate in today's elevated threat environment. Our solid performance and market share gains are being driven by our effort to make our customers our entire infrastructure more secure and integrate in a zero trust network. Fortinet as secure-driven network approach converged networking functionality with security capability fueled by our powerful for ASIC SPU to provide the best performance and rich functionality. The new FortiOS 7.2 offers multiple new and enhanced service across FortiGuard, FortiCare and FortiTrust such as VPNA, identity, demand unboxing, advanced device protection for OT and IoT environment, associated service and in-line capacity. And Fortinet provides one of the broadest security service offering and an average of half the cost compared to our main competitors. In addition, we have prioritized our most organic research and development efforts on integrating security product into our centralized FortiOS fabric platform, which Gartner refer to as a cybersecurity mesh architecture. Today, we announced a new suite of FortiGate powered by our food ASIC SPU, the FortiGate 3700-F,600-F and 700-F deliver high-performance converged networking and security, with security computer reaching of 5 times on average better performance than competitive offerings. During the quarter, we are pleased to review -- to receive the Gartner Peer Insight Customer Choice Award for both 1H infrastructure and next-generation firewall for three years in a row. Our innovation position Fortinet as one of the most influential cyber security leaders. These growth drivers and organic innovation is accelerating our growth potential to new level. Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners and suppliers worldwide for their continued support and hard work. It is their collective effort and a trust that will contribute into Fortinet's strong growth and market share gains. Definitely, the Fortinet operating team did a very, very good job and also the model we have, working with a manufacturer, working with a -- doing our own ASIC chip directly is also helping. So that's where compared to a lot of other vendors using like third-party on-time supply, which has more difficult to deal with the current supply chain issue. So we do see like with the price increase sometime like as Keith mentioned, there are some more strong requests for some discount and which also we have actually discount, probably to discount more easy to go to a product side than compared to the service side. There's a certain recognition roof, you cannot discount service too much. But also since we have a large strong product, we use security computing region. So that's where for the same function, our performance tend to be 5 times better than competitors. So we do have a market pricing power, which converts customers to move towards our product. At the same time, thinking for the service, we do offer a very broad service, similar better than competitor, but we probably only had about average about half, especially with all the bond orders since. So that's where we do have the pricing power, both on the product and service. That's where the customer doing this time to towards our solution. And also there's a lot of new cases, which our competitors don't have in solution like whether the SD-WAN, vertical to OT, some other part, which also drives quite a lot of additional growth for us. Yes. We start in the redesign effort end of last year without the supply restriction audience. You can see the product we announced today, the 4070-F and even the 600-F, probably would move to like kind of redesign, and then some of them also leverage our new FortiASIC chip. That's really helping customers have a different choice, is so important in some shortage. But also in general, we have a much broader product, both in the -- we call the core product FortiGate core platform and also the platform extension. And so that's gives customers a much better choice. So if silicon products, I'm surely they can easily steer to the next product and -- but still offer much better solution compared to other competitors. So that's where the redesign actually does help in a lot to reduce the supply chain limitation we have and also give customers more choice. So we kind of -- we're keeping that effort and keeping off a very broad product portfolio and which we do feel during the supply chain issue or maybe will last you towards the whole year this year will be definitely helping us and helping customers. The SD-WAN OT definitely grew faster than the overall company beat there. And also... And also the other prices are strong, also above average. We kind of feel the real estate is kind of considered some long-term investment, but starting doing that like 10, 15 years ago. And that our rental cost probably less than half compared to competitors similar of our size. So that's where the $100 million we save every year, probably where we're putting both the real estate and also the R&D some other investments. Sorry, I misunderstand as R&D is not real estate. Yes, the real yet R&D, definitely, we will continue to invest in a lot of long-term R&D projects. is from the ASIC, which we made the investment more than 20 years, give us a huge advantage on technology and also enable us pretty much become the only vendor that can meet this convergence of our security networking trend to offer our high-speed security whether inside the company, one solution within the data center to drive tremendous growth and also much better we call the secure computing region. And also the service with a large quantity of product being deployed, we can offer the service much cheaper than a competitor for same service, and that's really drive a huge value add to the customer. Also from our beginning, we more look at how to secure the whole infrastructure, especially for the area. Like in the past, whether in the high-speed environment or kind of a branch or remote access is very, very difficult to involve in security because of speed requirement because all these kind of difficult to manage.

There's some other service, the CASB, some other we have, we believe will be additional revenue, additional sales, additional margin for us. Yes. The OT definitely sees a bigger market going forward, probably bigger than the SD-WAN, which we see pretty strong growth and also -- so that's where the total OTs catching up. I think in the last point -- OT maybe close to 10% of the business and -- but the growth is very, very strong. So that's where we do see a lot of potential, and we also invest a lot in this area to meet the demand. First, I do because SD-WAN will continue to grow like 30%, 40% year-over-year in the probably the next 5 years and because it's a technology definitely can read the travel based on application, all these things is a wire benefit for the consumer for the customer. So for us, we offer the only security combined with SD-WAN and also leverage on ASIC to have a huge performance advantage that give us more function.

So SD-WAN is more address on one side, but also will helping drive the land side inside the company, the segmentation is a data center and eventually make the whole infrastructure very secure for the customer. Also, we have the biggest customer installation base in the industry. So we have probably call to 40% of total deployed in the industry, probably more than the number 2, number 3, number 4 add together. So that give us a quite a broad customer base. And I think it's close to 600,000 customers, some of them are only using Fortinet solution in part of infrastructure. So now we do see the benefit expand to the additional infrastructure and also what we call fabric of mesh network, we manage it together. So we do see a lot of expansion beyond the initial deployment."

            "name": "Keith Jensen",
            "content": "Thank you, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Before adding to Ken's comments and going into more detail on our Q1 financial results, I'd like to briefly discuss a wording change in how we describe our business. FortiGate is now referred to as the core platform and non-FortiGate is now referred to as the platform extension. This change helps to emphasize the importance of our FortiOS operating system.  FortiOS drives our entire security platform across multiple platform extension use cases, including Zero Trust access, cloud security, security operations and secure networking. With that in mind, let's start with a more detailed Q1 discussion.  Customer demand was again strong and broad-based across geographies, customer sizes, industries, use cases and security solutions, reflecting three key demand drivers, the elevated threat environment, convergence of security and networking and customers consolidating across our platform offerings. These key growth drivers are contributing to our strong results and accelerating pipeline growth. In short, we believe we are in a period of sustained high growth for the cybersecurity industry and Fortinet. Moving to the Q1 financial results. Total revenue of $955 million, was up 34%, driven by record product revenue growth of 54%. Taking into account an $80 million, sequential increase in product backlog. Product bookings growth was 87%. Product revenue growth was -- broad based with core platform and platform extension product revenue growth at 50% and 59%, respectively. While we continue to see robust product growth from our SD-WAN and operational technology, or OT, the core platform product revenue growth was mainly driven by the wide range of other use cases embedded in our operating system. Service revenue was up 24% to $584 million. Support and related services was up 26% to $271 million, while security subscription services revenue was up 23% to $313 million. To offer one observation about how customers may be responding to the supply chain challenges, we are seeing indications that a subset of customer's place product orders further in advance, and may have delayed purchases or registrations of the related service contracts. This, together with the timing differences with age product and service revenue recognition, creates a lag between product and service revenue growth rates. We expect quarterly service revenue growth to accelerate throughout the rest of the year. As summarized on Slide 6, total revenue in the Americas increased 32%. EMEA revenue increased 25%. And APAC posted revenue growth of 57%, which includes the contribution from AlaxalA. EMEA's growth includes the impact of suspending operations in Russia. Nonetheless, EMEA easily exceeded their internal targets.  Looking forward, EMEA's pipeline growth indicates continued strength in our EMEA business, despite the situation in Eastern Europe and its potential impact on European economies. Platform extension revenue grew 49% and accounted for 34% of total revenue, up 3 percentage points. Moving to bookings, backlog and billings. We are experiencing exceptionally strong demand, demand that continues to exceed supply by more than historical norms. Bookings were up 50% to $1.3 billion, reflecting exceptional demand and a $116 million quarter-over-quarter increase in total backlog, bringing backlog to $278 million. Larger enterprises continue to favor Fortinet's industry-leading cost for performance advantage and are increasingly more appreciative of our integrated platform strategy. The platform strategy allows customers to converge networking functionality with security capabilities and consolidate multiple point products. The following key metrics illustrate growing demand from enterprise customers. Global 2000 bookings were up over 60%. Large enterprise bookings were up over 65%. Secure SD-WAN bookings grew 54%, reflecting the convergence of networking and security as well as a strong economic case. OT bookings were up 76%, illustrating the continued response to the elevated threat environment. As a reminder, backlog is excluded from the current quarter billings and revenue. However, it is expected to provide increased visibility and a top line tailwind in future quarters. At $1.2 billion, billings were up 36%. Core platform billings were up 30%, and accounted for 67% of total billings. As shown on Slide 7, high end FortiGate posted very strong billings growth with a mix shifting 6 points towards high-end appliances. Platform extension billings were up 50% and accounted for 33% of total billings, up 3 percentage points. Average contract term was consistent year-over-year and down 1-month sequentially at 27 months. Moving back to the income statement. Total gross margin was 74.4% as the revenue mix tilted 5 percentage points to product revenue from higher-margin services. Product gross margin of 57.4% reflects the impact of component and freight cost increases as well as higher less predictable component expedite fee expenses and the impact of consolidating AlaxalA's results. Service gross margin of 85.2% was impacted by AlaxalA, costs associated with the expansion of our data center footprint and increased labor costs. Operating margin of 22% exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by 200 basis points due to increased sales productivity and efficiencies in other OpEx areas offsetting the gross margin decline. Headcount increased 26% to 10,860. Moving to the statement of cash flow summarized on Slides 8 and 9. Free cash flow was $273 million, representing a margin of 29%. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $123 million, including $93 million for real estate investments. Adjusted for real estate purchases, our free cash flow margin was 38%. Our capital expenditure strategy includes investing in cloud and data center infrastructure, as well as our office and warehouse capacity to support our higher levels of growth. We repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares of our common stock for a cost of $691 million. At the end of the quarter, the remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $830 million, with the authorization set to expire in February 2023. Inventory turns at 3.5x were up nearly 1.5x year-over-year. Now let's spend some time reviewing backlog in a bit more detail. As I mentioned earlier, very strong demand for about $116 million increase in total backlog to $278 million. To put this in perspective, total backlog at the end of the first quarter was approximately 6% of our trailing 12-months total billings. We shipped 60% of the Q4 ending hardware backlog in the quarter. In consistent with prior quarters -- the prior quarter, 73% of the backlog relates to expected future product shipments, while the remaining 27% relates to various services. We believe our backlog is very strong and should provide a billings and revenue tailwind to growth in future periods. And there are several reasons and comments we make to support our view, including: existing customers account for 93% of our backlog. And no single end customer accounts for more than a low single-digit percentage of backlog; there are 10 deals in backlog, 9 from existing customers with the remaining balance of over $1 million that together, account for less than 10% of total backlog.  Remaining balances defined as the original order amount less the partial shipments we've made; just 5% of Q4 backlog was canceled in Q1, suggesting that double ordering is not a significant contributor to our backlog. We do not believe that customers are meaningfully pivoting to software form factors from hardware. The software is frequently a more costly option and may require architectural redesign and investment and changes in form factors and other equipment beyond just the firewalls. We believe our competitors are similarly impacted by the supply chain. And finally, more customers are accepting the supply chain challenges and working with us to mitigate the issues by switching products, adjusting deployment schedules and accelerating evaluations of new products. Similar to others, we are experiencing ongoing supply chain challenges. Our responses to these challenges include: significantly increasing inventory purchase commitments; redesigning products; qualifying additional suppliers; and working closely with our suppliers to further enhance our resiliency and mitigate the effects of disruptions. We expect supply chain constraints to be challenging throughout the remainder of the year. As a result, we expect component and logistics costs remain elevated and backlog to increase through the course of the year.  As we balance our pricing actions with the opportunity for continued market share gains, we have passed along most, but not all cost increases. As such, we expect ongoing pressure to gross margins. While the situation is very dynamic, we believe we will have access to sufficient inventory to meet our guidance. The outlook is also subject to the disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the second quarter, we anticipate bookings in the range of $1.325 billion to $1.385 billion, which at the midpoint represents bookings growth of 40%. And we expect billings in the range of $1.225 billion to $1.265 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 30%. Revenue in the range of $1.005 billion to $1.035 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 74.5% to 76%, non-GAAP operating margin of 22% to 23.5%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.05 to $1.10, which assumes a share count of $165 million to $167 million. We estimate second quarter capital expenditures to be between $75 million and $85 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 17%. For the full year, we anticipate backlog could approach or possibly exceed $500 million, and expect billings in the range of $5.500 billion to $5.508 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 32.5%. The revenue in the range of $4.350 billion to $4.400 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 31%. This assumes the current supply chain environment remains constrained throughout the year. Total service revenue in the range of $2.640 billion to $2.700 billion, which represents growth of approximately 28%, and implies full year product revenue growth of approximately 36%. Given our current view of component costs and other supply chain pressures, we expect non-GAAP gross margin of 74% to 76%; non-GAAP operating margin of 24% to 26%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $5 to $5.15, which assumes a share count of between $166 million and $168 million. We estimate full year capital expenditures of between $270 million and $300 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 17%. We expect cash taxes to be approximately $260 million. Lastly, I want to remind everyone that we'll be holding an Analyst Day on May 10, coinciding with Accelerate 2022. A link to register for the webcast is located on the Events and Presentation page of Fortinet's Investor Relations website. And along with Ken, I'd like to thank our partners, customers, suppliers and all members of the Fortinet team for all their hard work, execution and success.  I'll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A. Yes, I think the color I can offer on that is I think linearity was again strong in the quarter. We've been, I think, seeing strong linearity for probably four quarters in a row now, measuring month 1 versus month 2. And we did, we've talked before about the price increases. I think the -- and we've talked previously that after discounting, you probably get 55% or something like that -- pardon me, you get 45% afterwards. That was probably a little bit optimistic on my part. I think I was going to get 45% was a little more discounting than maybe I anticipated through that process. And I forgot your third area that you mentioned, I didn't write it down to, I'm sorry. Linearity pricing, something else. Yes, I'd probably offer a little more color behind Ken's comments there, if I could, Brian. I think if you think about the market, let's take the networking equipment, switches and access points. I think the constraint exists all around the board, if you will. I don't know that us versus more traditional networking companies have any more availability in those products than anybody else. And when we look at our backlog, that mix seems to certainly support that. Firewalls, I don't see a lot of customers switching over availability. I offered the comment earlier the script, the prepared remarks that 93% of our existing backlog -- or pardon me, of our backlog is with existing customers. So there's 7% of new logos information in that number, not a very big number. And if I look at new logos in terms of the billings and accounts that we got from the quarter, it was very, very normal in terms of both of the billings and the new logos. I think we're about 5,500 or so on new logo. So I don't really see that, if you will, to the concern. And then if I can pivot back to Panama just quickly, I think your final question was about pull forward and space come up again. But again, I think if we were seeing that in light of these tremendous results I don't think I'd sit here and see a pipeline with such a significant growth is what we're seeing. So I don't really know that I would describe this as any sort of pull forward. Are there customers, large enterprises that came to us in place orders for a longer period deployment schedules. Certainly, and I think some of the comments in the script covered that. Yes. Peter has got me on a word limit on the script, so I apologize that I got taken out because I thought it was worthwhile comment. But in any event, yes, we got more of the same. We've been looking at about a 3-year 5-point shift to that other group. The other group is everything outside the top 5, and we got that again in the current quarter. I think that if you look at it in that other group, the one vertical that continues to stand out, and I don't think it's surprising when you think about it, has been manufacturing. And I think that, that really speaks to the threat environment, ransomware, OT, things of that nature, manufacturing is trying to desperately to break into the top five of our verticals and getting them closer and closer every quarter. I think the growth rates were faster, but the total contribution was greater than the other use cases that we're trying to parse there. Yes. I think from a business model view point, I think we kind of like where we're at with the level of investment that we're making in R&D, we can move by one point or two in a given period. And if you peel back a little bit and just look at the R&D team, there's certainly a significant number of engineers and percentages that are working on the ASIC and the chips and so forth. But I would also offer that we have more software engineers than we do hardware engineers.  And I think the reason for that is it goes back to some of the early comments in the text about how important the operating system is to us. The ASIC enables the operating system. They have to work together. But there's a significant investment there. And I think also the other places with some of these platform extensions, excuse me, my term, we're seeing the opportunity there, I think, to make some more discrete investments and maybe mature some of those products along a little bit more. Just not suggesting significant changes in total spending, but just giving some insights in terms of where we see spending. I think you got to be a little bit both. I think the high end FortiGate taking six points of market share is a pretty good indicator. Obviously, the high-end FortiGates are very much targeted at large enterprises. And I think that dovetails very nicely with some of the growth numbers that we gave on G2000 and on the large enterprises as well. I still think that, that's an opportunity for us where we have sometimes not always viewed as being viewed as the incumbent. But I think if you look at our progress over the years in the enterprise sector, particularly in the U.S., which maybe has a little further to go, we're very, very pleased with that. And I would maybe supplement that in terms of enterprise success with the metric that we've talked about from time to time in the past. I think maybe three or four years ago, we talked about in the U.S. of having an account rep ratio of about 65 accounts to 1 rep in the U.S. And that's not really an enterprise model.  And then we made a comment that continuously that we would work to move that number down within the framework with balanced growth and profitability. That number today is about 13 or 14 accounts per rep. So I don't think it's a coincidence that you're seeing the success in the large enterprise with the large appliances given the level of investment that we've been able to make in that segment of the market. Yes. I think as it relates to how we think about what the backlog might mean, and we just remind people, we made the switch, I think, in the middle of the fourth quarter, asked our sales team to run the business on bookings and then we'll convert it to billings here, which means working very, very close with our manufacturing team and our operations team. In terms of what they're seeing in terms of availability and what levers they have to pull. And with that in mind, I think the key now, I spend a lot more time with operations as part of the forecasting guidance process than I do with the sales team. And where we've kind of sold out on that is that I get a weekly update from the sales team in terms of what their expectations of backlog are going to be, and we've been doing that every week this year, and I think some of last year.  And they've shown to be fairly darn accurate. I think what you see right now in the first quarter was very high bookings, which drag along some backlog. But I think that the operations team has done a very good job. One thing that we do now use is this concept of what -- how much was net backlog increased as a percentage of bookings. And that number has hovered right around 8.5% to 9% in the fourth quarter in the first quarter. And so when we want to sanity check, what we're hearing from the operations team, we now have a metric that we didn't have six months ago in terms of a little bit of history, and we apply that metric to it, say, does that seem reasonable for all their hard work when you get done, does it seem like it's a reasonable number, and we think it has been. Yes. I think the -- I probably want to check the numbers. I'm looking at a bookings number in the first quarter, it was about $12.75 and a bookings number in the second quarter that I think we talked about thinking at the midpoint, $13.55. So I don't know that I'm seeing a deceleration as that you may be concerned about. Yes. I think what we ended up on the full year number. Through all the analysis that we do, I think the raise for the full year is roughly the beat that we had in the first quarter plus the raise that we had in the second quarter. And we sanity check that we're looking at our pipeline growth or sales capacity, what we think the price increases are going to deliver some more metrics around the backlog and want to make sure that we getting too far ahead of ourselves and over our skis. And I think that's a pretty good number to be at right now in the current environment. There remains a lot of uncertainty, as you know, out there and getting overly bullish on Q3 and Q4 right now. I think we'd like to see how this plays out a little bit more. I don't -- I think it's pervasive. And I -- we look at the three different sources of pipeline, the way we talk about the channel, the marketing team and the direct sales force. I think we're pleased with the contribution from all three of them, no doubt about that. We've talked for an extended period of time a few years about the importance of the channel and investments that we make and partnering with them and working together on that. And I think that the channel is holding up their side of the bargain as well.  I think the marketing team, give them a ton of credit. I love the Fortinet championship event and the continued success for it and how they've now leveraged that in other geographies as well. And the direct sales team continues to perform at a very high level and you're seeing the numbers. And obviously, to the extent that you were able to continue to add headcount, like the metric I gave earlier, more people are going to drive more pipeline. So I don't know that I would isolate it to any one of those three areas of where it's coming from or even geographically. I mean it's been strong throughout. Ken, I don't know Ben, it's Keith. And just from a modeling point of view, keep in mind that those price increases that we had in the second half of last year and the first quarter of this year, that we get that lift in product revenue immediately. It takes a little bit longer to see it in the services line because of how the timing of rev rec. Then I think you're going to start to see between new sales and renewals, the new price points that have been created for the services will start to have an impact, and that's part of the acceleration that we talked about. Yes. I can't really quantify it. I just haven't looked at it that way. It's a good question, a good approach. If I were to make informed judgments, if you will, I think that expansion is by far the largest opportunity for us. It's just the nature of the business. And I think the refresh and the competitive placements are probably fairly close to each other, I would imagine, for the remainder. There is refresh for us is we have a very long product suite. So we Ken will always have a new product. You saw the three new products come out be announced today. So there's always some sort of refresh activity in our own product that's going on there. But we -- I would also note that we are consistently getting more at bats, if you will, more opportunities with sales, more competitive displacement. So I would imagine just my gut is, again, refreshing competitive displacements are probably in a similar neighborhood, but expansion is the biggest. I think the backlog is being closer to 50-50 between networking equipment or I guess, I should call it platform extension because it's in there and the firewalls or the core platform. I think it's kind of balanced out. I do think it's low-end FortiGates that are still dominating in the Fortinet space, if you will. I don't remember quantifying early ordering as a percentage, if you will. It's certainly something we've talked about here internally is our way of measuring that. And I think that's why we kind of provide -- Peter is going to give me some coaching here. Yes. I think the constraints, if you will, on that is more around when is the supply going to be available because it's in backlog, we can deliver as soon as the supply arrives. But that's just more a function of how we're working with our suppliers or anything else."

In Q4, total billing grow 8.5% to $1.9 billion, driven by increased focus on Secure Op, SASE, and improved execution for our sales team. We closed six eight-figure deals across five industry verticals. All six of these transactions, including all three of our SASE, Secure Ops, and secure networking solutions [Indiscernible] our value of an integrated platform and that span across on-premise and cloud, as well as our FortiASIC technology advantages. Putting a total addressable market across secure op, SASE, and secure networking, expect an increase from $150 billion in 2024 to $208 billion by 2027. Our customer base consists of 76% of Fortune 100, including nine of the top 10 technology companies, nine of the top 10 manufacturers, and nine of the top 10 healthcare. Our Secure Ops billing grow 44%, accounted for 11% of total billing, with strong performance from several solutions, including EDR, SIEM, email security, and NDR, to automatically detect, investigate, and respond to threats. Unified SASE billing grow 19%, accounted for 21% of total billing. We believe Fortinet is the only company with a Unified SASE solution, all integrated into a single FortiOS, that including a full networking and security stack, consisting of a market-leading SD-WAN, ZTNA, secure web gateway, CASB, and firewall as a service, designed for on-premise and cloud. Our FortiSASE solution is gaining momentum quickly, as we closed our first eight-figure SASE deal for 350,000 seats. In Q4, we added 40 new features to our SASE solution, including support for over 150 PoP location worldwide, and the ability to protect thin edge device. We see a huge opportunity to attach FortiSASE to our tens of thousands SD-WAN customers. Secure networking accounts for 60% of billing, and represent our largest addressable market. Gartner expects the secure networking market to overtake the traditional networking market by 2030. Fortinet is the number one network security vendor, with over half the global firewall deployment. In addition to physical firewall, we offer virtual, cloud native, and firewall as a service solution, all based on our FortiOS operation system, consolidate over 30 networking and security functions together. Converged security and networking require more specialized computing power than traditional networking. Our FortiASIC power, FortiGate, delivers 3x to 10x more performance as indicated by secure computing region with every new FortiGate product release. The latest FortiASIC SP5, based on FortiGate 70G, with dual 5G in ruggedized format, secure device within operation technology environment. It is off a great start as a Fortune 50 company signed a eight figure operation technology deal, feature this new FortiGate in the fourth quarter. Also included with our FortiOS operation system is a Forti featured access point controller. Recently, we announced a new secure access point product, making us the first vendor to announce a business grade Wi-Fi 7 product. Fortinet has consistently been an innovative cybersecurity company, and this earning call won't be complete without a few words about our AI. We have invested heavily in AI across every function and product. For over a decade, Fortinet has used machine learning and AI to provide advanced threat intelligence across more than 40 products from network, endpoint, and application security. Our solution applies AI and machine learning across expanded digital tech service automatically, containing and remediating incident within seconds, where the industry average for detection and remediation takes several days. We have also been applying Gen AI technology across our entire product line, allowing customers to optimize the security effectiveness and operation efficiency. FortiAI is already available on FortiSIEM and FortiSOAR and more product will be adding this function in the coming months. Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners, and suppliers worldwide for their continuous support and hard work.\nKeith Jensen: Thank you, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. As Ken mentioned, billings grew 8.5%, driven by improved sales execution and early returns on our SASE and SecOp investments. The quarter benefited from what we saw as a muted seasonal budget flush and certain deals that had pushed from earlier quarters, closing in the fourth quarter, driving a record six transactions, each of which were over $10 million. For these exceptionally large transactions, secure networking was 75% of the billings mix, while SecOps and SASE combined for another 20% plus, illustrating these companies' long-term commitment to both firewall and consolidation strategies. Taking a closer look at three of these eight-figure deals, one of these deals included mid-seven figures for SecOps and another mid-seven figures for SASE. The SASE solution covers a planned 350,000 user deployment at a top U.S. school district to provide a safe learning environment for students, regardless of their physical location. We won this deal because of our operating system's ability to integrate 30-plus networking and security functions across SecOps, SASE, and secure networking into a single, unified platform, providing consistent policies and automated responses. Our vision encompasses creating a secure foundation for our customers, allowing them to navigate today's evolving digital landscape with confidence while empowering them to embrace innovation without compromising security. Illustrating this vision, in another eight-figure deal, a large U.S. enterprise selected Fortinet to support their hybrid cloud architecture as they transition more of their workloads to the cloud. This competitive displacement reduced complexity and the customers' total cost of ownership while showcasing our ability to consolidate security functions onto our FortiOS platform. In a third eight-figure win, a large financial institution in the U.S. expanded their partnership with us with their first enterprise agreement with Fortinet. This EA includes the recently announced FortiGate Rugged 70G to secure their remote working and ATM environments. Built with AI-powered security, the Rugged 70G brings our customers the latest secure networking innovations while at the same time simplifying infrastructure and driving efficiencies. In addition to exceeding the customer's performance expectations in a multi-vendor bake-off, we were successful by demonstrating the versatility of our single operating system and FortiOS platform across multiple use cases. Over the past several years, we have successfully addressed large customer buying preferences by increasing our investments in EA programs. In the fourth quarter, these contracts represented nearly 10% of our billings, with a three-year CAGR of over 80%. Today, with over 35% of our billings beyond traditional and sometimes cyclical firewalls, Fortinet has become an increasingly diversified business over the past decade. Most recently, the diversification has included prioritizing investments in SASE, SecOps, and other software and cloud-based solutions. A key element of this diversification is our single operating system strategy. FortiOS is the foundation of our comprehensive and innovative solutions that drive the convergence of networking and security while also consolidating multiple security capabilities. Attempting to piece together best-of-breed solutions from multiple vendors can result in significant security gaps, slower AI-driven technology adoption, and a slower pace of identifying, reporting, and resolving security incidents. Organizations increasingly recognize that an integrated security solution run by a single operating system is the best way to improve their security posture. Consolidation allows security solutions to share data and communicate with each other, reducing complexity, improving security effectiveness, easing the need for skilled labor, and lowering the total cost of ownership. Consolidation drove our SecOps business to 44% growth, with strong growth from EDR, SIEM, email security, and NDR. Importantly, 94% of our SecOps business was from existing customers, as companies looked to execute their vendor consolidation strategy with Fortinet. Digging a little deeper into the 11% of billings that SecOps contributed to our business, the mid-enterprise segment is growing the fastest as these companies respond to the cybersecurity labor shortage and look to reduce complexity. Geographically, international emerging is leading the way for SecOps, likely reflecting stronger economic conditions and extending the success of their 2022 pilot project. Extending the single operating system and consolidation strategy further, our single vendor SASE solution, billings increased 19% and accounted for 21% of total billings. Our SASE pipeline is up over 150% as more of our sales reps are building pipeline. As expected, the SMB segment was the largest mix of SASE customers at 55%, increasing eight points quarter-over-quarter. Fortinet has one of the least complex and most customer-friendly SASE pricing models. Our one bundle and one operating system solution provides all the standard capabilities, including secure web gateway and firewall as a service for secure internet access, Zero Trust Network Access and SD-WAN from our points of presence, providing secure private access, as well as CASB and data loss protection. Our single vendor SASE solution also includes integration to SOC as a service and FortiClient, which provides a customer with endpoint protection and vulnerability scanning. Regarding our focus and investments in SASE and SecOps, SD-WAN customers represented 37% of new SASE customers. Over 90% of our global sales force has completed mandatory sales training for both SASE and SecOps. In 2023, 60,000 customers and partners attended at least one of our 27 training workshops. Lastly, we've increased our worldwide points of presence coverage to over 150 locations. Turning now to the quarterly financial results, total billings were $1.86 billion, up 8.5%, driven by improved sales execution and a strong rebound in the large enterprise segment, together with 6,400 new logos. On a billings-by-geo basis, the U.S. led the way with mid-teens growth driven by strong performance in the U.S. enterprise. In terms of industry verticals, government and financial services, each with growth of approximately 25% were our top two industry verticals, while service provider and retail remained under pressure. The average contract term was 30 months, up two months year-over-year and sequentially. Adjusting for the six eight-figure deals, the normalized contract term was consistent year-over-year and sequentially at 28 months. Turning to revenue and margins, total revenue grew 10% to $1.42 billion, driven by strong services revenue growth. Service revenue of $927 million grew 25%, accounting for 66% of total revenue, a mixed shift of eight points. Service revenue growth was driven by strength in SecOps, SASE, and other security subscriptions. Product bookings were up, however product revenue decreased 10% to $488 million due to a tough compare. Product revenue grew 43% in the prior year period, benefiting from the drawdown of backlog. Total gross margin of 78.5% was up 90 basis points and exceeded the high end of the guidance range by 200 basis points, driven by the increase in service gross margin and the eight-point mixed shift from product revenue to service revenue. Service gross margins were up 140 basis points as service revenue growth outpaced labor costs and benefited from the mixed shift towards higher margin security subscription services. Product gross margins were down 510 basis points as we continued to see margin pressure related to inventory levels and product transitions. Operating margin was very strong at 32%, three and a half points above the high end of our guidance range and operating income of $454 million was $40 million above the high end of the implied guidance range, reflecting aggressive cost management. Looking to the state of the cash flow, summarized on slides 17 and 19, total cash taxes paid in the quarter were $341 million. Including $210 million estimated tax payments that were deferred from earlier quarters in accordance with U.S. and California one-time regulatory relief, resulting in free cash flow of $165 million. Capital expenditures were $27 million. We repurchased approximately 16.8 million shares at a cost of $895 million for an average cost per share of $53.29. Moving to an overview of our 2023 full year results, billing surpassed the $6 billion mark, totaling $6.4 billion and up 14%. Total revenue grew 20% to $5.3 billion, and we added over 25,000 new customers. Service revenue grew 28% to $3.4 billion, driven by a 33% increase in security subscriptions. Product revenue grew 8% to $1.9 billion, on a very tough compare after going 42% in 2022. Gross margin was up 110 basis points to 77.4%, benefiting from the revenue mix shift to service revenue. Operating margin also increased 110 basis points to a calendar year record of 28.4%, resulting in operating income of $1.5 billion. The GAAP operating margin of over 23% continues to be one of the highest in the industry. Earnings per share increased 37% to $1.63. Free cash flow was a record at over $1.7 billion. Free cash flow margin was 33%. Including real estate investments, the adjusted free cash flow margin came in at 35%. For the year, we repurchased approximately 20 million shares at a cost of $1.5 billion, for an average cost per share of $55.25. And to summarize on slide 20, Fortinet has returned $5.3 billion to shareholders via share repurchases in the past three years. Earlier this year, the board increased the share repurchase authorization by an additional $500 million, bringing our remaining share repurchase authorization to approximately $1 billion. Moving on to guidance. As we look to 2024, several factors impact guidance, including the firewall industry cycle, remnants of 2022 and 2023 supply chain activity, and customer buying behavior. Prior firewall product life cycles have lasted approximately four years, with eight quarters of higher growth followed by eight quarters of slower growth. Looking at our bookings, the current product cycle decline started approximately four quarters ago in Q1 of 2023, suggesting that we should experience the bottom of the cycle in early 2024.suggesting that we should experience the bottom of the cycle in early 2024. Worldwide supply chain challenges resulted in elevated purchasing and record backlog, distorting year-over-year growth comparisons, and creating a period of project and product digestion. The backlog drawdown in the first half of 2023 provided a mid-to-high single-digit percentage tailwind to billings and low double-digit tailwind to product revenue growth for that period. The year-over-year product revenue comparisons in the first half of 2024 will be the most challenged, while we expect service revenues to grow sequentially in the low single digits in the first quarter and to grow sequentially at low to mid-single digits for the remainder of 2024. In addition, we expect product revenue growth will continue to be impacted by project and product digestion in 2024, and we believe the selling environment should improve in the second half of 2024 and into 2025. As a reminder, our first quarter and full year outlook, which are summarized on slides 23 and 24, subject to the disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the first quarter, we expect billings in the range of $1.390 billion to $1.450 billion, which at the midpoint represents a decline of 5.5%, revenue in the range of $1.300 billion to $1.360 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 5.4%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 76.5% to 77.5%, non-GAAP operating margin of 25.5% to 26.5%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.37 to $0.39, which assumes a share count of between $775 million and $785 million. Capital expenditures of $220 million to $250 million including a real estate transaction that closed earlier in the quarter. A non-GAAP tax rate of 17%, and cash taxes of $30 million. For the full year, we expect billings in the range of $6.400 billion to $6.600 billion, revenue in the range of $5.715 billion to $5.815 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 9%. Service revenue in the range of $3.920 billion to $3.970 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 17%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 76% to 78%, non-GAAP operating margin of 25.5% to 27.5%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.65 to $1.70, which assumes a share count of between $785 million and $795 million. Capital expenditures of $370 million to $420 million, non-GAAP tax rate of 17%, and cash taxes of $520 million. I look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters, and I'll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A session.\nPeter Salkowski: Thank you. As a reminder, during the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question to allow others to participate. Operator, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani with Citi.\nFatima Boolani: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. Keith, I really appreciate you flushing out some of the factors that are going to be creating volatility in your top-line performance, but what I wanted to focus on was how you are able to hold the line on the expense structure in light of the volatility both on the revenue and billings front. So if you can just help us appreciate how you're able to manage for profitability, and then by extension, these top-line volatilities, how should we think about the free cash flow cadence against your assumptions on the OPEC structure along with the fact that you have seen lumpy, very large deals that have positively influenced duration for now? Thank you.\nKeith Jensen: Yes, I think kind of going backwards in terms of the very large deals that we talked about, I think experience has showed us in the second half or the middle part of last year that we're well served not to get too far ahead of ourselves in terms of forecasting those deals. And it's difficult to understand when they're actually going to close and what the specific terms are going to be with those. So I think we kind of set those aside, and you saw that in some of the performance in the fourth quarter. In terms of margins, I think that sometimes the business model is easier than people think it is when it comes to margin because services provide so much of the business. If the business model is two-thirds services and it's throwing out a very rich margin, even in a period of time where you're going through the firewall refresh cycle, you're still seeing your margins hold up fairly nicely. I think there's also significant economies of scale involved in the services line, whether it's the support or the security subscriptions. And then the last thing I would offer is that I think the breadth of both the SecOps Solutions and the SASE Solutions together are serving to spread some of the incremental costs for the hosting solutions and bringing those to market.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Hamza Fodderwala with Morgan Stanley.\nHamza Fodderwala: Good evening. Thank you for taking my question. Ken, over the last several years, we've seen some pretty significant increases in network traffic, whether it be more cloud adoption, more work from home, etcetera, and that's led to pretty healthy firewall refresh over the last several years. I'm curious, and I know it's very early innings, but how do you see sort of the adoption of generative AI, particularly in some of these hybrid contexts, impacting network traffic going forward? And do you think that that's going to incent more firewall refresh to secure that growing network traffic? Thank you.\nKen Xie: Long-term, definitely we see that gen AI will increase the traffic a lot and also automate a lot of security operations. We also see the refresh of the firewall cycle. We do provide some kind of a [Indiscernible] data there. But we also see a lot of new opportunity. We now come at the refresh. Like we mentioned in the script, some of the OT technology area and even supporting some work from home and also some other enterprise internal segmentation replacing the traditional switch with a network security firewall that we call the convergence, also starting to get more and more adopted by the big enterprise. So that's also the new market compared to refreshed traditional firewall. But I agree with you, the next phase connection, the traffic will keep increasing, especially more devices will be connected online and also more people will work remotely. And at the same time, the AI also kind of generates quite a lot of additional data, which also kind of need to be secured. So we see a pretty good potential for the long-term growth.\nHamza Fodderwala: Thank you.\nKen Xie: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Brian Essex with JPMorgan. Brian, your line is now open.\nBrian Essex: Great. Thank you very much. And thank you for taking the question. I guess maybe for Ken, could you dig in a little bit to the SASE performance of the quarter? If I recall correctly, and I don't know what kind of metrics you can break out to give us a little bit more color behind that. But if I recall, you're doing quite well with kind of the SD-WAN component. And we're trying to kind of pivot to better penetrate the secure service edge component. Maybe a little bit of color as you've pivoted towards, I guess, focusing a little bit more on SecOps and SASE what is the nature of the deals look like this quarter? What do you see in the pipeline for SASE? And are you getting better traction with secure service edge? And does that include SD-WAN or is it relatively agnostic to SD-WAN? Thank you.\nKen Xie: I think you probably can recall in the last earnings call, we started more focus on SASE SecureOps and started tracking that separately. And also, we also mentioned 90% of our field sales force also being trained certified for SASE SecureOps. And also, all the six eight-figure deals, including all the three, secure networking, SASE and the SecureOps. So, we do see it grow faster, especially during the current kind of environment of refresh cycle. We do see the SASE, which is more consumption model, and also SecureOps, which can lower the operation cost probably faster than the traditional secure networking area. So that's where we kind of redirect some focus, resource, more focus on these two areas. We see a pretty huge success, grow both the pipeline and also even the deal. We closed some of the first eight figure SASE deal, which also makes us feel pretty excited. I think we have some advantage, actually, leverage the SD-WAN huge deployment we have, all the firewalls, huge deployment, and also the single OS-based SASE solution, which integrates all the SD-WAN, all the SASE functions into a single FortiOS, which is a huge advantage for whether the customer themself or even for some service provider, offer the SASE service to their customer base. So it's a pretty strong growth. We see it's a pretty good move we have.\nKeith Jensen: Yes, Brian, I would kind of follow that up with some of the results, if you will, of what Ken just talked about. And to your point, I think you're kind of asking us, if you focus more on the SSE element of SASE and less on SD-WAN, what does that mean. I think that we have a pretty interesting horse race developing internally, if you look at what you would probably think of as the SSE component and the SecOps business, both growing in the 40% range. SecOps won the quarter. We'll see how SASE does, but they're very, very close at this point in time in terms of growth. And then I think the other metric we gave, we talked about the pipeline growth, and that 150% would really be around what you would think of as the SSE component.\nBrian Essex: Got it. That's really helpful. We'll keep it to one and keep it efficient, but thank you so much, both of you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America.\nTal Liani: Hi, guys. I'll ask two questions together. It's easier. CapEx is going up materially next year, this year. What is the outlook for free cash flow margin? What happens to free cash flow this year? Can you actually drill down to the CapEx? What drives the increase? And then what happens to free cash flow margin? The second question I have is on the business. This quarter, billings were supposed to be weak, but they're very strong. Next quarter, we expected roughly 5%, 6% declines, and that's what you're guiding to. So that means maybe there was some pull forward, but kind of in line-is. What happens this quarter that billings is so strong versus expectations? What drove the strength? And why don't we see it continue into the next quarter? Thanks.\nKeith Jensen: You want to take CapEx or deals? Hi, Tal. How are you? Thanks for calling in. On CapEx, I think we'll continue to build out both things that we need for our engineering team as we look forward, and best places to work and labs and so forth. So I think you're seeing an element of that. But also our ability to continue to deliver the wide range of hosted solutions. I think those are the things that are driving CapEx. And as we said before, we know that there's a bias here of making real estate investment decisions with a high as a long-term investor, and with that the ROI over a longer period of time has always been very enticing to us. And I think your second question on the spike that we saw in performance that we're very pleased with in the fourth quarter, and then what does that translate to in the first quarter, a couple of things. One is, as we talked about during the call that the comps in the first quarter of 2024 are probably among the most challenging on the billings line and the product revenue line that we think we're going to see. And then I think also the reentry one doing six eight-figure deals in the fourth quarter and being a record, obviously put a lot of tailwind into that fourth quarter number. We like eight-figure deals, but I don't know that we're really in the business of forecasting them each and every quarter as we go forward.\nKen Xie: Also, we kind of own probably a high percentage of some infrastructure, some real estate, and some of our competitors. That actually gave us much lower cost, operation cost going forward, which also will help drive the future growth, especially on a service like a SASE. And that also gives us a better margin long-term.\nTal Liani: And then free cash flow specifically because your stock trades on free cash flow, should we expect free cash flow to go down, or is it -- can you offset the increase in CapEx with something else?\nKeith Jensen: Well, obviously, there's a lot of levers that come into free cash flow. I think that where we look at in terms of where the street was for free cash flow in 2024 for the full year, I think that's in the ballpark at this early stage. We don't really guide to free cash flow, as you know. But I think the puts and takes, one is CapEx, which is not all that far away from what we saw in 2023. But then you have the operating profits, the buildings throughout, etcetera. You know all the components that go into it.\nTal Liani: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs.\nGabriela Borges: Good afternoon. Thank you. I'm looking to better understand the SASE dynamics that you're seeing at the lower end of the market versus the higher end. So maybe any commentary on the S&B part of the SASE pipeline, what you're seeing in terms of willingness and readiness to convert, what you're seeing in terms of competition, and what you're seeing in terms of average deal sizes in terms of uplift when you get a SASE deal versus a regular firewall deal. Thank you.\nKen Xie: S&B is pretty interesting. We do quite well in the SMB market, even for the traditional firewall, bigger than any other competitors. But also SMB has a pretty low percentage of a customer actually using any network security because of whether the management costs or some other people cost, all these kinds of things. So that's where SASE applied there, definitely helping some SMB customers. But also we see kind of the long-term combined both where to work from home, we're pretty strong like a couple years ago in the retail branch office solution there, also helping us kind of like doing well in SMB. And also the new product refresh, which leveraged SP5, we're only half the way, probably towards the second half of this year, we have more product come in using the new SP5. That's also keeping a hands-up position there. It's kind of like I said, it's a SASE more kind of consumption model. In a current environment, probably it would be more attractive compared to a CapEx model. So that's where we see both SMB enterprise, they do have some more interest to do this kind of OpEx model. Maybe John Whittle.\nJohn Whittle: I would just say that the success we had in enterprise, this is John Whittle, by the way, with the number of eight-figure deals and having over a half million customers out there, really bodes well both in enterprise and in the SMB market because we've got so many customers out there that are testing our product and so many customers that are providing feedback along the way to improve our products that it's a real testament to the products and gives both enterprises and the SMB comfort in buying our products going forward. And you can kind of put yourself into a customer's shoes and say, okay, some of the most discerning customers are spending eight figures on these products and services, and we have strength in SMB and upmarket. I think that bodes really well for kind of the smaller segments of the market and the larger segments of the market going forward. I think that's a real headline from this quarter in terms of the real success we had with some of the most discerning customers out there.\nGabriela Borges: Thank you for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays.\nSaket Kalia: Okay, great. Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions here and well done. Keith, maybe for you, I just want to talk about the shape of billings a little bit here in 2024. I think at the midpoint for this year, billings is about 2%, give or take at the midpoint. How should we sort of think about the exit rate on billings this year? I know that was something we talked about in prior quarters. I'm not sure if that's something that we could just revisit. And then maybe relatedly, it was great to get the segment detail, by the way, across the three segments. How are we sort of thinking about the rough growth ranges for those three segments as part of this guide?\nKeith Jensen: Yes, I think on the billings trend, if you will, I would go back to our prior conversations about, the backlog created a headwind, if you will, in the first half of the year. And I think you heard some of the tone of that, if you will, right before I gave the guidance this year. And that would suggest that, our expectations are that, billings growth rates should be improving as we move through on a quarterly basis, as we move through the year. I think we probably made it a little bit tougher on the sales team for the fourth quarter of 2024 by having such a strong fourth quarter of 2023. But I think they're going to do fairly well there. And then, I'm sorry, the second part of the question, Saket was?\nSaket Kalia: It was just on the three segments, right, secure networking, SASE, and SecOps. It was helpful to get sort of the growth ranges for this quarter. Not going to hold you to it, but how do you think about sort of the relative growth rates for those three segments this year?\nKeith Jensen: And maybe I'll answer that in the context of average contract term or duration, because I know there's a lot of concern or questions have been raised about, will that shorten the contract term? And you heard the data that we gave during the call. These two segments, we have a business that basically runs on average contract terms. We call it two years, two and a quarter, if you will. A SASE and SecOps business mix would probably be billing one year in advance when you look at the competitors and so forth. So that kind of gives you the range. It's going to take a while for SASE and SecOps to really impact that contract term or duration. And I think the read-through to that in terms of, we're excited about the opportunity with SASE and SecOps. If we have outsized growth there, we'll be very pleased with it. But I don't know that we're hanging our head on something completely out of the realm of reality, if you will, for 2024 for SASE or SecOps.\nKen Xie: Yes, for the three segments, I don't have the latest market data, but from Q3, the firewall market is kind of flat here. Q4, we probably will read out company reporting. But we do see probably still under some pressure this year, especially the first half of this year. But I do believe the long-term converging story will hold quite well because the company also needs to manage the kind of application level, which is how to use network security to do that. So that's where long-term we do see the firewall market or the network security market will continue to grow, I feel, probably around 10% year-over-year in the next maybe three to five years. SASE and SecOps come from maybe smaller base, which also grow faster. And we also have a lot of existing customers. I want to adopt all this together with us. They probably already are firewall customers, D1 customers. They can easily adopt additional solutions, additional products. So that's where we see the other two sectors grow faster than the company average and probably continue to grow faster in the next few quarters.\nSaket Kalia: Very helpful. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Andrew Nowinski with Wells Fargo.\nAndrew Nowinski: Great. Thank you for taking the questions. So I was just wondering if you could, and we've talked a lot about your other pillars. I was wondering if we could touch on SecOps and maybe what's driving that. Is that related to the recent SEC regulation? And then second, I was wondering if you look at your billing guidance for the year, where do you see the most risk as it relates to that guidance in terms of the three pillars and the performance you're expecting from those three pillars?\nKen Xie: Yes, the SecOps is actually helping customers more like better security and more efficient and also lower the total management costs. That's where I need to have multiple solutions, multiple products integrated together, automated together. So that's what we see in the current environment of our company. And because small, they do see the SecOps already. The area they probably work on the investment there. And also we do see the merging of networking and security together, which also SecOps plays a quite important role to make sure the two operations can be operated together, which we are needing in this area. So that's where SecOps, we see pretty strong growth. SASE is more like consumption model. We also see kind of fit the current environment well. Even the cost could be a little bit higher than the appliance. But it gives the customer flexibility. And so that's where we see that. John, you want to answer?\nJohn Whittle: Yes, and I think for SecOps, what we're seeing is the threat landscape out there is driving a lot of the customer behavior as well. You see these ransomware attacks that are really debilitating to customers. And so prevention is important, but time to detection and time to remediation is critical. And it's real money. And these are really important issues for our customers. And also I would note, we've really been building this solution over many, many years. But we really just started to focus on it as a separate pillar three months ago. And then we had a record Q4. And so I think that degree of focus internally coupled with how we can actually help our customers, putting our customers first, really is driving a lot of the success there. And that new focus, we're pretty much sticking to the plan. The plan's working. We're sticking to the plan. And so we see a lot of opportunity there.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thank you so much. I think I've got one for John Whittle and one for Keith. First, just for you, John, given your recent appointment as Fortinet's first ever COO, can you talk about your perspective stepping into the role and how you plan to help drive Fortinet's business forward? And Keith, for you, in your guidance comments, you said for the full year that you expect the selling environment to improve in the back half and into 2025. And I'm not saying I disagree with you, but I'm just curious why you say that. And if it's just relative to the comments that you also made on the firewall cycle dynamics or if it's something else, more broadly in the economy that you're expecting. Thanks.\nJohn Whittle: Thanks for the question. I'm really excited about the role. I've been working here for 17 years through a lot of growth, and my focus over those 17 years has really been learning from Ken and Michael and the team. And it's like an MBA on steroids. They're brilliant business people in addition to focusing on the innovation and the technology, which I think is a core differentiator for Fortinet. We are an innovation-first company. And I think our culture is really around what I call almost a straightforward baritocracy. And Ken and Michael drive this throughout the organization. It's very straightforward. It's work hard, work smart, innovate and put the customer first and deliver results. And so I really like the culture. Obviously, I've been here 17 years. Some people say I need to get more creative with my career, but I really \u2013 it really gets me excited to make a difference. And it's a positive difference. We're protecting our customers so they can get about their business. So I really like that. And in terms of how I can contribute, up until now I've focused on legal and corp dev. I'm taking over corporate real estate. I'm adding systems, manufacturing and logistics. And so I have a broad set of responsibilities. I also have always worked very closely with the sales teams. I will not be managing the sales teams, but I will continue to work closely. Teamwork is one of our top three culture items here. And we're not really boxed in here in a way. In a way, we really work together. And so we've got great sales leaders, and I look forward to working with them. We've got a huge opportunity to grow. We want to grow and capture that opportunity by putting the customer first. I want to support that. And to the extent I can help the team, I want to do that. To Fatima's question earlier, we're also very disciplined on the cost side. And as Keith said, we have this services model where we have a lot of visibility based on the deferred revenue on the top line. But we also are very disciplined at kind of managing and monitoring the costs on a real-time basis. And, sometimes you can control the costs, more quickly than other things. And so what I've noticed is, we're very good at kind of managing that on a real-time basis, and we'll continue to do that as well.\nBrad Zelnick: Welcome, John.\nJohn Whittle: Thank you.\nKen Xie: Thank you, John. And John also helped us form the company culture in the very beginning, which is the teamwork and also openness and also innovation. So we'll continue to maintain this culture and keep growing the company together.\nKeith Jensen: And then quickly, Brad, on the other \u2013 I mean, yes, obviously, the view of the firewall cycles has some part of it. But I think probably more of the point is the digestion of products and projects. And if you look back at where the peak was of firewall purchasing and you kind of play that out, you should be coming to a logical end of deployment cycles.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO.\nKeith Bachman: Hi. Many thanks. And Peter and Keith, thank you again for the disclosures on the segments within billings. It's very helpful. Two questions. One is on strategy and one is on guidance. Ken, on the strategy question, I wanted to ask you on your perspective on the Unified SASE, excluding SD-WAN and SecOps. There's two broad variables that I think about. One is go-to-market and one is product or R&D. You've clearly increased the go-to-market efforts surrounding unified SASE and SecOps. I'm wondering, do you feel the need to also incrementally focus on the product side or incremental R&D, if you will, to strengthen the portfolio for things such as improving your positioning within the Gardner Magic Quadrant or however you want to think about it. So is it more go-to-market that you think incremental efforts or it's both incremental, both the R&D side and as well as the go-to-market? And just in the interest of time, I'll ask my second question. Keith, on the guidance, given the performance in the quarter, and I'm really focused on the year, not the March quarter, it does seem very conservative. You very much outperformed your expectations associated with the December quarter. And you're guiding for kind of 2%. And even if you normalize for the backlog burn, you're sort of mid-single digits, maybe a little bit better than that. And so I guess I'm just trying to reconcile that it seems like very conservative guidance. And perhaps the way to ask the question is, how do you think about the product side as we get to the back half of the year? Do you think that industry demand returns to normal levels, or do you still think there's some pressure on the product side or anything else you want to draw comments on associated with what seems to be conservative buildings guide? Thank you very much.\nKen Xie: Yes, a very good question about SASE. Definitely we want to do both, even more than that. So we definitely see the opportunity changing our go-to-market strategy because a few months ago, we were more dependent on the service provider carrier trying to do a SASE. I helped them do a SASE. Now it's more go-to-market, direct ourselves, and at the same time working with our service provider, but also more important, really, internal R&D, internal investment in the infrastructure. Like we mentioned, now we have over 150 pub worldwide, probably can match any other competitor, and same kind of function, the innovation, and also put all the SASE in a single OS, and then a lot of functions that are using ASIC will accelerate, and that also make our SASE solution much better, more advantaged compared to other competitors, and also more easy to deploy, more easy to manage. So we see that's a huge opportunity for SASE. It's not just SASE using the traditional cloud approach, but also on-premise SASE, the private SASE. So we see a lot of opportunity for SASE going forward, both on the technology, which we also work at, our innovation, developing technology, and at the same time, the go-to-market strategy, once we focus, we see huge success behind.\nKeith Jensen: And just on the guidance, Keith, appreciate the thought after kind of a tough middle of the year last year for us, or for me. I think keep in mind that we do probably have between $150 million and $200 million of headwind related to backlog, or year-over-year comparisons, if you want a backlog impact in the year. I think also in some of the commentary that we provided right before guidance, where we talked about the relative impact, specifically the product revenue, and what you should see from service revenue for the year. You can kind of get a sense of what we're thinking about for product revenue. I think I do see that some opportunities on the service revenue line with things that come from SecOps and SASE in the year, but I think all-in-all, I think where we're at right now, in terms of the full year guidance number, is an appropriate number for us.\nKeith Bachman: Okay, all right, many thanks. Congratulations, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.\nIttai Kidron: Thanks, guys. A couple for me. First, on the comp side, as you move into 2024, can you share a little bit more color on the changes you're making or have made to the sales comp and what kind of incentives have you laid in place in a way that's different than 2023? And then on the competitive front, just given where your position on SecOps and SASE, I think you've talked about kind of more meat enterprise on the SecOps and more SMB is the largest category in SASE. Can you talk specifically on who do you see more as competition in those categories? Because you don't seem to kind of stretch the entire customer profile or regions, frankly. So we'd love to get a little bit more color into who do you see more versus less in those categories. Thank you.\nKen Xie: Yes, we kind of keep improving the sales comp plan and also trying to line up what the company goal and what's the field sales and also how we can move kind of a tie together and success together so that there's some modification of the comp plan which move towards the company long-term both on the growth and the margin and also reflect more on some kind of a service based kind of model there behind. So that and also kind of keeping investing in the sales force and also kind of making the structure more efficient that's other area and also training the sales and make sure because there's a lot of new area whether the SASE and SecOps do need a lot of training that's also the big enhancement we are kind of going through right now.\nKeith Jensen: Yes, I'd probably add to that as well just a couple of things on the comp plan conversation. This is the time of year where comp plans go out and I think every company seems to make some changes. I think the real thing that jumps out at me this year is that I think after the 2023 results the quotas are probably a little bit lower on an individual basis than they have been in the past, and we probably put some things to work in the other direction on it. But to Ken's point, we really want to make sure that we're investing in building on the sales team and making the adjustments in the quota for 2024, I think is appropriate. On the SMB and SASE, probably -- the SASE and SecOps conversation. And I think it goes back to some of Gabriela's question before, at this stage, they're really shaping up in terms of having different customer mixes. The SMB portion of SASE was about 55% of the business. And we're not surprised to see us having very, very early success there. We're pleased with the development and the feedback we're getting from third parties about the success of the SASE product. But that, together with our SD-WAN customers is the logical place to see success. On the flip side, SecOps is almost the opposite, but large enterprises providing about 55% of the business. And I think the read through to that is all about consolidation. Where you're really going to have successes and it ties into the mix of repeat customers, i.e., firewall customers are now buying the SecOp product being very, very high. And that's what we would expect both of those business segments.\nKen Xie: And maybe for all three sales and also sometimes even for a partner, if they sell all 3 solutions, secure networking, SASE and SecOps, they get more comp compared to only sell 1 or 2 solutions. So that's the additional incentive we offer to the field.\nIttai Kidron: Maybe as a follow-up, Keith, how much of the opportunity here in SecOps and SASE is outside of our customer footprint. Is the vast majority of traction here just with your existing installed base? Or it also pulls you outside.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. Given as John pointed out, we have over 500,000 customers. So I'm okay with an installed base, right? And I don't think that's anything new for several years. We've talked about new logos representing large numbers, hundreds -- thousands of new logos, but they've never really been more than 10% of the business. So I don't think that this is really going to change with that. I expect that -- the firewall is such a compelling product because the price of performance advantage because of how more and more security have embedded into the operating system and the ASIC empowers that, that I'm not a salesperson if I was, I'm probably looking for those opportunities in the white space accounts. And then you want them like any other enterprise company to come back and sell more into that company. And that's really what you're seeing with the SecOps and SASE products that Ken and John have been talking about.\nIttai Kidron: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Adam Tindle with Raymond James.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. Let me see if I can get everybody involved here. So Ken, I wanted to start with SASE and SecOps was obviously a key pivot point on the last call. As you focus on that more internally, could you summarize your competitive advantage technologically in those areas? And John, logistics from a sales perspective, I know it's been kind of kicked around a percent of quota retirement might be related to those areas. What did you land on for logistics? And lastly, for Keith, expectations for sales productivity as a result of that pivot towards SASE and SecOps. Just wondering your early observations on what you've seen because it looks like you do expect total margins down, but I think it's somewhat related to gross margin, not much efficiency drain. So it's just what you're seeing from a sales productivity perspective as you pivot to those areas. Thank you.\nKen Xie: Yes. For SASE, we are the only company, we believe, has all the SASE function, SD-WAN, all the CASB, web service, all in a single operating system can be deployed on our premise [ph] using ASIC [indiscernible] or in a cloud form there. So that's a huge advantage, both for the customer, for the service provider. I think on the SecureOps side, we also most the product we internally develop whether from endpoint or from all these different like e-mail application, web, all this is because when we internally develop it integrate, automate much better than other competitor, more comp acquisition, which is a separate product that's more difficult to integrate, automate together. So that's the two huge advantage we have. We usually call the SecureOps more like a fabric approach. I've been doing that for 10 years, which is pretty successful, but now we have the same time which customer wants to hear is the SecureOp, which they see the huge advantage that drives a huge growth going forward and also the field training and also kind of help a lot. So that's the advantage we have, whether the SASE single OS approach can use as AC [ph] to accelerate and then the secure app is integrated automate together much better than other competitors gave us huge advantage.\nJohn Whittle: In terms of the quota retirement question, Keith may have additional comments on that, but there's really no change there.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think OTE and numbers targets are very much the same. I think on sales productivity in terms of what we saw in 2023, as we move through the year, obviously, productivity kind of came down. It seems to have leveled off now as we exit 2023. And I think that the modeling, if you will, is pretty much a similar expectation for 2024 in terms of where we exited 2023. On the -- there's a part of that I think in terms of what SASE and SecOps dramatically changed those numbers. I kind of go back to the earlier conversation about contract term share at some level if the mix shifts and becomes 50-50 or 60-40 to get the direction, then we probably have something to talk about, although I'd probably be talking a lot more about the fantastic growth in the SecOps and SASE than the fact that they had to pay salespeople to make that growth happen.\nOperator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Peter Salkowski for closing remarks.\nPeter Salkowski: Thank you, Liz. I'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call. Fortinet will be attending an investor conference hosted by Morgan Stanley during the first quarter. The fireside chat website link will be posted on the Events and Presentations section of the Fortinet Investor website starting soon. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out. Have a great rest of your day. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining our call. In Q4, total billing grow 8.5% to $1.9 billion, driven by increased focus on Secure Op, SASE, and improved execution for our sales team. We closed six eight-figure deals across five industry verticals. All six of these transactions, including all three of our SASE, Secure Ops, and secure networking solutions [Indiscernible] our value of an integrated platform and that span across on-premise and cloud, as well as our FortiASIC technology advantages. Putting a total addressable market across secure op, SASE, and secure networking, expect an increase from $150 billion in 2024 to $208 billion by 2027. Our customer base consists of 76% of Fortune 100, including nine of the top 10 technology companies, nine of the top 10 manufacturers, and nine of the top 10 healthcare. Our Secure Ops billing grow 44%, accounted for 11% of total billing, with strong performance from several solutions, including EDR, SIEM, email security, and NDR, to automatically detect, investigate, and respond to threats. Unified SASE billing grow 19%, accounted for 21% of total billing. We believe Fortinet is the only company with a Unified SASE solution, all integrated into a single FortiOS, that including a full networking and security stack, consisting of a market-leading SD-WAN, ZTNA, secure web gateway, CASB, and firewall as a service, designed for on-premise and cloud. Our FortiSASE solution is gaining momentum quickly, as we closed our first eight-figure SASE deal for 350,000 seats. In Q4, we added 40 new features to our SASE solution, including support for over 150 PoP location worldwide, and the ability to protect thin edge device. We see a huge opportunity to attach FortiSASE to our tens of thousands SD-WAN customers. Secure networking accounts for 60% of billing, and represent our largest addressable market. Gartner expects the secure networking market to overtake the traditional networking market by 2030. Fortinet is the number one network security vendor, with over half the global firewall deployment. In addition to physical firewall, we offer virtual, cloud native, and firewall as a service solution, all based on our FortiOS operation system, consolidate over 30 networking and security functions together. Converged security and networking require more specialized computing power than traditional networking. Our FortiASIC power, FortiGate, delivers 3x to 10x more performance as indicated by secure computing region with every new FortiGate product release. The latest FortiASIC SP5, based on FortiGate 70G, with dual 5G in ruggedized format, secure device within operation technology environment. It is off a great start as a Fortune 50 company signed a eight figure operation technology deal, feature this new FortiGate in the fourth quarter. Also included with our FortiOS operation system is a Forti featured access point controller. Recently, we announced a new secure access point product, making us the first vendor to announce a business grade Wi-Fi 7 product. Fortinet has consistently been an innovative cybersecurity company, and this earning call won't be complete without a few words about our AI. We have invested heavily in AI across every function and product. For over a decade, Fortinet has used machine learning and AI to provide advanced threat intelligence across more than 40 products from network, endpoint, and application security. Our solution applies AI and machine learning across expanded digital tech service automatically, containing and remediating incident within seconds, where the industry average for detection and remediation takes several days. We have also been applying Gen AI technology across our entire product line, allowing customers to optimize the security effectiveness and operation efficiency. FortiAI is already available on FortiSIEM and FortiSOAR and more product will be adding this function in the coming months. Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners, and suppliers worldwide for their continuous support and hard work. Long-term, definitely we see that gen AI will increase the traffic a lot and also automate a lot of security operations. We also see the refresh of the firewall cycle. We do provide some kind of a [Indiscernible] data there. But we also see a lot of new opportunity. We now come at the refresh. Like we mentioned in the script, some of the OT technology area and even supporting some work from home and also some other enterprise internal segmentation replacing the traditional switch with a network security firewall that we call the convergence, also starting to get more and more adopted by the big enterprise. So that's also the new market compared to refreshed traditional firewall. But I agree with you, the next phase connection, the traffic will keep increasing, especially more devices will be connected online and also more people will work remotely. And at the same time, the AI also kind of generates quite a lot of additional data, which also kind of need to be secured. So we see a pretty good potential for the long-term growth. Thank you. I think you probably can recall in the last earnings call, we started more focus on SASE SecureOps and started tracking that separately. And also, we also mentioned 90% of our field sales force also being trained certified for SASE SecureOps. And also, all the six eight-figure deals, including all the three, secure networking, SASE and the SecureOps. So, we do see it grow faster, especially during the current kind of environment of refresh cycle. We do see the SASE, which is more consumption model, and also SecureOps, which can lower the operation cost probably faster than the traditional secure networking area. So that's where we kind of redirect some focus, resource, more focus on these two areas. We see a pretty huge success, grow both the pipeline and also even the deal. We closed some of the first eight figure SASE deal, which also makes us feel pretty excited. I think we have some advantage, actually, leverage the SD-WAN huge deployment we have, all the firewalls, huge deployment, and also the single OS-based SASE solution, which integrates all the SD-WAN, all the SASE functions into a single FortiOS, which is a huge advantage for whether the customer themself or even for some service provider, offer the SASE service to their customer base. So it's a pretty strong growth. We see it's a pretty good move we have. Also, we kind of own probably a high percentage of some infrastructure, some real estate, and some of our competitors. That actually gave us much lower cost, operation cost going forward, which also will help drive the future growth, especially on a service like a SASE. And that also gives us a better margin long-term. S&B is pretty interesting. We do quite well in the SMB market, even for the traditional firewall, bigger than any other competitors. But also SMB has a pretty low percentage of a customer actually using any network security because of whether the management costs or some other people cost, all these kinds of things. So that's where SASE applied there, definitely helping some SMB customers. But also we see kind of the long-term combined both where to work from home, we're pretty strong like a couple years ago in the retail branch office solution there, also helping us kind of like doing well in SMB. And also the new product refresh, which leveraged SP5, we're only half the way, probably towards the second half of this year, we have more product come in using the new SP5. That's also keeping a hands-up position there. It's kind of like I said, it's a SASE more kind of consumption model. In a current environment, probably it would be more attractive compared to a CapEx model. So that's where we see both SMB enterprise, they do have some more interest to do this kind of OpEx model. Maybe John Whittle. Yes, for the three segments, I don't have the latest market data, but from Q3, the firewall market is kind of flat here. Q4, we probably will read out company reporting. But we do see probably still under some pressure this year, especially the first half of this year. But I do believe the long-term converging story will hold quite well because the company also needs to manage the kind of application level, which is how to use network security to do that. So that's where long-term we do see the firewall market or the network security market will continue to grow, I feel, probably around 10% year-over-year in the next maybe three to five years. SASE and SecOps come from maybe smaller base, which also grow faster. And we also have a lot of existing customers. I want to adopt all this together with us. They probably already are firewall customers, D1 customers. They can easily adopt additional solutions, additional products. So that's where we see the other two sectors grow faster than the company average and probably continue to grow faster in the next few quarters. Yes, the SecOps is actually helping customers more like better security and more efficient and also lower the total management costs. That's where I need to have multiple solutions, multiple products integrated together, automated together. So that's what we see in the current environment of our company. And because small, they do see the SecOps already. The area they probably work on the investment there. And also we do see the merging of networking and security together, which also SecOps plays a quite important role to make sure the two operations can be operated together, which we are needing in this area. So that's where SecOps, we see pretty strong growth. SASE is more like consumption model. We also see kind of fit the current environment well. Even the cost could be a little bit higher than the appliance. But it gives the customer flexibility. And so that's where we see that. John, you want to answer? Thank you, John. And John also helped us form the company culture in the very beginning, which is the teamwork and also openness and also innovation. So we'll continue to maintain this culture and keep growing the company together. Yes, a very good question about SASE. Definitely we want to do both, even more than that. So we definitely see the opportunity changing our go-to-market strategy because a few months ago, we were more dependent on the service provider carrier trying to do a SASE. I helped them do a SASE. Now it's more go-to-market, direct ourselves, and at the same time working with our service provider, but also more important, really, internal R&D, internal investment in the infrastructure. Like we mentioned, now we have over 150 pub worldwide, probably can match any other competitor, and same kind of function, the innovation, and also put all the SASE in a single OS, and then a lot of functions that are using ASIC will accelerate, and that also make our SASE solution much better, more advantaged compared to other competitors, and also more easy to deploy, more easy to manage. So we see that's a huge opportunity for SASE. It's not just SASE using the traditional cloud approach, but also on-premise SASE, the private SASE. So we see a lot of opportunity for SASE going forward, both on the technology, which we also work at, our innovation, developing technology, and at the same time, the go-to-market strategy, once we focus, we see huge success behind. Yes, we kind of keep improving the sales comp plan and also trying to line up what the company goal and what's the field sales and also how we can move kind of a tie together and success together so that there's some modification of the comp plan which move towards the company long-term both on the growth and the margin and also reflect more on some kind of a service based kind of model there behind. So that and also kind of keeping investing in the sales force and also kind of making the structure more efficient that's other area and also training the sales and make sure because there's a lot of new area whether the SASE and SecOps do need a lot of training that's also the big enhancement we are kind of going through right now. And maybe for all three sales and also sometimes even for a partner, if they sell all 3 solutions, secure networking, SASE and SecOps, they get more comp compared to only sell 1 or 2 solutions. So that's the additional incentive we offer to the field. Yes. For SASE, we are the only company, we believe, has all the SASE function, SD-WAN, all the CASB, web service, all in a single operating system can be deployed on our premise [ph] using ASIC [indiscernible] or in a cloud form there. So that's a huge advantage, both for the customer, for the service provider. I think on the SecureOps side, we also most the product we internally develop whether from endpoint or from all these different like e-mail application, web, all this is because when we internally develop it integrate, automate much better than other competitor, more comp acquisition, which is a separate product that's more difficult to integrate, automate together.

            "name": "Keith Jensen",
            "content": "Thank you, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. As Ken mentioned, billings grew 8.5%, driven by improved sales execution and early returns on our SASE and SecOp investments. The quarter benefited from what we saw as a muted seasonal budget flush and certain deals that had pushed from earlier quarters, closing in the fourth quarter, driving a record six transactions, each of which were over $10 million. For these exceptionally large transactions, secure networking was 75% of the billings mix, while SecOps and SASE combined for another 20% plus, illustrating these companies' long-term commitment to both firewall and consolidation strategies. Taking a closer look at three of these eight-figure deals, one of these deals included mid-seven figures for SecOps and another mid-seven figures for SASE. The SASE solution covers a planned 350,000 user deployment at a top U.S. school district to provide a safe learning environment for students, regardless of their physical location. We won this deal because of our operating system's ability to integrate 30-plus networking and security functions across SecOps, SASE, and secure networking into a single, unified platform, providing consistent policies and automated responses. Our vision encompasses creating a secure foundation for our customers, allowing them to navigate today's evolving digital landscape with confidence while empowering them to embrace innovation without compromising security. Illustrating this vision, in another eight-figure deal, a large U.S. enterprise selected Fortinet to support their hybrid cloud architecture as they transition more of their workloads to the cloud. This competitive displacement reduced complexity and the customers' total cost of ownership while showcasing our ability to consolidate security functions onto our FortiOS platform. In a third eight-figure win, a large financial institution in the U.S. expanded their partnership with us with their first enterprise agreement with Fortinet. This EA includes the recently announced FortiGate Rugged 70G to secure their remote working and ATM environments. Built with AI-powered security, the Rugged 70G brings our customers the latest secure networking innovations while at the same time simplifying infrastructure and driving efficiencies. In addition to exceeding the customer's performance expectations in a multi-vendor bake-off, we were successful by demonstrating the versatility of our single operating system and FortiOS platform across multiple use cases. Over the past several years, we have successfully addressed large customer buying preferences by increasing our investments in EA programs. In the fourth quarter, these contracts represented nearly 10% of our billings, with a three-year CAGR of over 80%. Today, with over 35% of our billings beyond traditional and sometimes cyclical firewalls, Fortinet has become an increasingly diversified business over the past decade. Most recently, the diversification has included prioritizing investments in SASE, SecOps, and other software and cloud-based solutions. A key element of this diversification is our single operating system strategy. FortiOS is the foundation of our comprehensive and innovative solutions that drive the convergence of networking and security while also consolidating multiple security capabilities. Attempting to piece together best-of-breed solutions from multiple vendors can result in significant security gaps, slower AI-driven technology adoption, and a slower pace of identifying, reporting, and resolving security incidents. Organizations increasingly recognize that an integrated security solution run by a single operating system is the best way to improve their security posture. Consolidation allows security solutions to share data and communicate with each other, reducing complexity, improving security effectiveness, easing the need for skilled labor, and lowering the total cost of ownership. Consolidation drove our SecOps business to 44% growth, with strong growth from EDR, SIEM, email security, and NDR. Importantly, 94% of our SecOps business was from existing customers, as companies looked to execute their vendor consolidation strategy with Fortinet. Digging a little deeper into the 11% of billings that SecOps contributed to our business, the mid-enterprise segment is growing the fastest as these companies respond to the cybersecurity labor shortage and look to reduce complexity. Geographically, international emerging is leading the way for SecOps, likely reflecting stronger economic conditions and extending the success of their 2022 pilot project. Extending the single operating system and consolidation strategy further, our single vendor SASE solution, billings increased 19% and accounted for 21% of total billings. Our SASE pipeline is up over 150% as more of our sales reps are building pipeline. As expected, the SMB segment was the largest mix of SASE customers at 55%, increasing eight points quarter-over-quarter. Fortinet has one of the least complex and most customer-friendly SASE pricing models. Our one bundle and one operating system solution provides all the standard capabilities, including secure web gateway and firewall as a service for secure internet access, Zero Trust Network Access and SD-WAN from our points of presence, providing secure private access, as well as CASB and data loss protection. Our single vendor SASE solution also includes integration to SOC as a service and FortiClient, which provides a customer with endpoint protection and vulnerability scanning. Regarding our focus and investments in SASE and SecOps, SD-WAN customers represented 37% of new SASE customers. Over 90% of our global sales force has completed mandatory sales training for both SASE and SecOps. In 2023, 60,000 customers and partners attended at least one of our 27 training workshops. Lastly, we've increased our worldwide points of presence coverage to over 150 locations. Turning now to the quarterly financial results, total billings were $1.86 billion, up 8.5%, driven by improved sales execution and a strong rebound in the large enterprise segment, together with 6,400 new logos. On a billings-by-geo basis, the U.S. led the way with mid-teens growth driven by strong performance in the U.S. enterprise. In terms of industry verticals, government and financial services, each with growth of approximately 25% were our top two industry verticals, while service provider and retail remained under pressure. The average contract term was 30 months, up two months year-over-year and sequentially. Adjusting for the six eight-figure deals, the normalized contract term was consistent year-over-year and sequentially at 28 months. Turning to revenue and margins, total revenue grew 10% to $1.42 billion, driven by strong services revenue growth. Service revenue of $927 million grew 25%, accounting for 66% of total revenue, a mixed shift of eight points. Service revenue growth was driven by strength in SecOps, SASE, and other security subscriptions. Product bookings were up, however product revenue decreased 10% to $488 million due to a tough compare. Product revenue grew 43% in the prior year period, benefiting from the drawdown of backlog. Total gross margin of 78.5% was up 90 basis points and exceeded the high end of the guidance range by 200 basis points, driven by the increase in service gross margin and the eight-point mixed shift from product revenue to service revenue. Service gross margins were up 140 basis points as service revenue growth outpaced labor costs and benefited from the mixed shift towards higher margin security subscription services. Product gross margins were down 510 basis points as we continued to see margin pressure related to inventory levels and product transitions. Operating margin was very strong at 32%, three and a half points above the high end of our guidance range and operating income of $454 million was $40 million above the high end of the implied guidance range, reflecting aggressive cost management. Looking to the state of the cash flow, summarized on slides 17 and 19, total cash taxes paid in the quarter were $341 million. Including $210 million estimated tax payments that were deferred from earlier quarters in accordance with U.S. and California one-time regulatory relief, resulting in free cash flow of $165 million. Capital expenditures were $27 million. We repurchased approximately 16.8 million shares at a cost of $895 million for an average cost per share of $53.29. Moving to an overview of our 2023 full year results, billing surpassed the $6 billion mark, totaling $6.4 billion and up 14%. Total revenue grew 20% to $5.3 billion, and we added over 25,000 new customers. Service revenue grew 28% to $3.4 billion, driven by a 33% increase in security subscriptions. Product revenue grew 8% to $1.9 billion, on a very tough compare after going 42% in 2022. Gross margin was up 110 basis points to 77.4%, benefiting from the revenue mix shift to service revenue. Operating margin also increased 110 basis points to a calendar year record of 28.4%, resulting in operating income of $1.5 billion. The GAAP operating margin of over 23% continues to be one of the highest in the industry. Earnings per share increased 37% to $1.63. Free cash flow was a record at over $1.7 billion. Free cash flow margin was 33%. Including real estate investments, the adjusted free cash flow margin came in at 35%. For the year, we repurchased approximately 20 million shares at a cost of $1.5 billion, for an average cost per share of $55.25. And to summarize on slide 20, Fortinet has returned $5.3 billion to shareholders via share repurchases in the past three years. Earlier this year, the board increased the share repurchase authorization by an additional $500 million, bringing our remaining share repurchase authorization to approximately $1 billion. Moving on to guidance. As we look to 2024, several factors impact guidance, including the firewall industry cycle, remnants of 2022 and 2023 supply chain activity, and customer buying behavior. Prior firewall product life cycles have lasted approximately four years, with eight quarters of higher growth followed by eight quarters of slower growth. Looking at our bookings, the current product cycle decline started approximately four quarters ago in Q1 of 2023, suggesting that we should experience the bottom of the cycle in early 2024.suggesting that we should experience the bottom of the cycle in early 2024. Worldwide supply chain challenges resulted in elevated purchasing and record backlog, distorting year-over-year growth comparisons, and creating a period of project and product digestion. The backlog drawdown in the first half of 2023 provided a mid-to-high single-digit percentage tailwind to billings and low double-digit tailwind to product revenue growth for that period. The year-over-year product revenue comparisons in the first half of 2024 will be the most challenged, while we expect service revenues to grow sequentially in the low single digits in the first quarter and to grow sequentially at low to mid-single digits for the remainder of 2024. In addition, we expect product revenue growth will continue to be impacted by project and product digestion in 2024, and we believe the selling environment should improve in the second half of 2024 and into 2025. As a reminder, our first quarter and full year outlook, which are summarized on slides 23 and 24, subject to the disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the first quarter, we expect billings in the range of $1.390 billion to $1.450 billion, which at the midpoint represents a decline of 5.5%, revenue in the range of $1.300 billion to $1.360 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 5.4%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 76.5% to 77.5%, non-GAAP operating margin of 25.5% to 26.5%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.37 to $0.39, which assumes a share count of between $775 million and $785 million. Capital expenditures of $220 million to $250 million including a real estate transaction that closed earlier in the quarter. A non-GAAP tax rate of 17%, and cash taxes of $30 million. For the full year, we expect billings in the range of $6.400 billion to $6.600 billion, revenue in the range of $5.715 billion to $5.815 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 9%. Service revenue in the range of $3.920 billion to $3.970 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 17%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 76% to 78%, non-GAAP operating margin of 25.5% to 27.5%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.65 to $1.70, which assumes a share count of between $785 million and $795 million. Capital expenditures of $370 million to $420 million, non-GAAP tax rate of 17%, and cash taxes of $520 million. I look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters, and I'll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A session. Yes, I think kind of going backwards in terms of the very large deals that we talked about, I think experience has showed us in the second half or the middle part of last year that we're well served not to get too far ahead of ourselves in terms of forecasting those deals. And it's difficult to understand when they're actually going to close and what the specific terms are going to be with those. So I think we kind of set those aside, and you saw that in some of the performance in the fourth quarter. In terms of margins, I think that sometimes the business model is easier than people think it is when it comes to margin because services provide so much of the business. If the business model is two-thirds services and it's throwing out a very rich margin, even in a period of time where you're going through the firewall refresh cycle, you're still seeing your margins hold up fairly nicely. I think there's also significant economies of scale involved in the services line, whether it's the support or the security subscriptions. And then the last thing I would offer is that I think the breadth of both the SecOps Solutions and the SASE Solutions together are serving to spread some of the incremental costs for the hosting solutions and bringing those to market. Yes, Brian, I would kind of follow that up with some of the results, if you will, of what Ken just talked about. And to your point, I think you're kind of asking us, if you focus more on the SSE element of SASE and less on SD-WAN, what does that mean. I think that we have a pretty interesting horse race developing internally, if you look at what you would probably think of as the SSE component and the SecOps business, both growing in the 40% range. SecOps won the quarter. We'll see how SASE does, but they're very, very close at this point in time in terms of growth. And then I think the other metric we gave, we talked about the pipeline growth, and that 150% would really be around what you would think of as the SSE component. You want to take CapEx or deals? Hi, Tal. How are you? Thanks for calling in. On CapEx, I think we'll continue to build out both things that we need for our engineering team as we look forward, and best places to work and labs and so forth. So I think you're seeing an element of that. But also our ability to continue to deliver the wide range of hosted solutions. I think those are the things that are driving CapEx. And as we said before, we know that there's a bias here of making real estate investment decisions with a high as a long-term investor, and with that the ROI over a longer period of time has always been very enticing to us. And I think your second question on the spike that we saw in performance that we're very pleased with in the fourth quarter, and then what does that translate to in the first quarter, a couple of things. One is, as we talked about during the call that the comps in the first quarter of 2024 are probably among the most challenging on the billings line and the product revenue line that we think we're going to see. And then I think also the reentry one doing six eight-figure deals in the fourth quarter and being a record, obviously put a lot of tailwind into that fourth quarter number. We like eight-figure deals, but I don't know that we're really in the business of forecasting them each and every quarter as we go forward. Well, obviously, there's a lot of levers that come into free cash flow. I think that where we look at in terms of where the street was for free cash flow in 2024 for the full year, I think that's in the ballpark at this early stage. We don't really guide to free cash flow, as you know. But I think the puts and takes, one is CapEx, which is not all that far away from what we saw in 2023. But then you have the operating profits, the buildings throughout, etcetera. You know all the components that go into it. Yes, I think on the billings trend, if you will, I would go back to our prior conversations about, the backlog created a headwind, if you will, in the first half of the year. And I think you heard some of the tone of that, if you will, right before I gave the guidance this year. And that would suggest that, our expectations are that, billings growth rates should be improving as we move through on a quarterly basis, as we move through the year. I think we probably made it a little bit tougher on the sales team for the fourth quarter of 2024 by having such a strong fourth quarter of 2023. But I think they're going to do fairly well there. And then, I'm sorry, the second part of the question, Saket was? And maybe I'll answer that in the context of average contract term or duration, because I know there's a lot of concern or questions have been raised about, will that shorten the contract term? And you heard the data that we gave during the call. These two segments, we have a business that basically runs on average contract terms. We call it two years, two and a quarter, if you will. A SASE and SecOps business mix would probably be billing one year in advance when you look at the competitors and so forth. So that kind of gives you the range. It's going to take a while for SASE and SecOps to really impact that contract term or duration. And I think the read-through to that in terms of, we're excited about the opportunity with SASE and SecOps. If we have outsized growth there, we'll be very pleased with it. But I don't know that we're hanging our head on something completely out of the realm of reality, if you will, for 2024 for SASE or SecOps. And then quickly, Brad, on the other \u2013 I mean, yes, obviously, the view of the firewall cycles has some part of it. But I think probably more of the point is the digestion of products and projects. And if you look back at where the peak was of firewall purchasing and you kind of play that out, you should be coming to a logical end of deployment cycles. And just on the guidance, Keith, appreciate the thought after kind of a tough middle of the year last year for us, or for me. I think keep in mind that we do probably have between $150 million and $200 million of headwind related to backlog, or year-over-year comparisons, if you want a backlog impact in the year. I think also in some of the commentary that we provided right before guidance, where we talked about the relative impact, specifically the product revenue, and what you should see from service revenue for the year. You can kind of get a sense of what we're thinking about for product revenue. I think I do see that some opportunities on the service revenue line with things that come from SecOps and SASE in the year, but I think all-in-all, I think where we're at right now, in terms of the full year guidance number, is an appropriate number for us. Yes, I'd probably add to that as well just a couple of things on the comp plan conversation. This is the time of year where comp plans go out and I think every company seems to make some changes. I think the real thing that jumps out at me this year is that I think after the 2023 results the quotas are probably a little bit lower on an individual basis than they have been in the past, and we probably put some things to work in the other direction on it. But to Ken's point, we really want to make sure that we're investing in building on the sales team and making the adjustments in the quota for 2024, I think is appropriate. On the SMB and SASE, probably -- the SASE and SecOps conversation. And I think it goes back to some of Gabriela's question before, at this stage, they're really shaping up in terms of having different customer mixes. The SMB portion of SASE was about 55% of the business. And we're not surprised to see us having very, very early success there. We're pleased with the development and the feedback we're getting from third parties about the success of the SASE product. But that, together with our SD-WAN customers is the logical place to see success. On the flip side, SecOps is almost the opposite, but large enterprises providing about 55% of the business. And I think the read through to that is all about consolidation. Where you're really going to have successes and it ties into the mix of repeat customers, i.e., firewall customers are now buying the SecOp product being very, very high. And that's what we would expect both of those business segments. Yes. Given as John pointed out, we have over 500,000 customers. So I'm okay with an installed base, right? And I don't think that's anything new for several years. We've talked about new logos representing large numbers, hundreds -- thousands of new logos, but they've never really been more than 10% of the business. So I don't think that this is really going to change with that. I expect that -- the firewall is such a compelling product because the price of performance advantage because of how more and more security have embedded into the operating system and the ASIC empowers that, that I'm not a salesperson if I was, I'm probably looking for those opportunities in the white space accounts. And then you want them like any other enterprise company to come back and sell more into that company. And that's really what you're seeing with the SecOps and SASE products that Ken and John have been talking about. Yes. I think OTE and numbers targets are very much the same. I think on sales productivity in terms of what we saw in 2023, as we move through the year, obviously, productivity kind of came down. It seems to have leveled off now as we exit 2023. And I think that the modeling, if you will, is pretty much a similar expectation for 2024 in terms of where we exited 2023. On the -- there's a part of that I think in terms of what SASE and SecOps dramatically changed those numbers. I kind of go back to the earlier conversation about contract term share at some level if the mix shifts and becomes 50-50 or 60-40 to get the direction, then we probably have something to talk about, although I'd probably be talking a lot more about the fantastic growth in the SecOps and SASE than the fact that they had to pay salespeople to make that growth happen."

            "name": "John Whittle",
            "content": "I would just say that the success we had in enterprise, this is John Whittle, by the way, with the number of eight-figure deals and having over a half million customers out there, really bodes well both in enterprise and in the SMB market because we've got so many customers out there that are testing our product and so many customers that are providing feedback along the way to improve our products that it's a real testament to the products and gives both enterprises and the SMB comfort in buying our products going forward. And you can kind of put yourself into a customer's shoes and say, okay, some of the most discerning customers are spending eight figures on these products and services, and we have strength in SMB and upmarket. I think that bodes really well for kind of the smaller segments of the market and the larger segments of the market going forward. I think that's a real headline from this quarter in terms of the real success we had with some of the most discerning customers out there. Yes, and I think for SecOps, what we're seeing is the threat landscape out there is driving a lot of the customer behavior as well. You see these ransomware attacks that are really debilitating to customers. And so prevention is important, but time to detection and time to remediation is critical. And it's real money. And these are really important issues for our customers. And also I would note, we've really been building this solution over many, many years. But we really just started to focus on it as a separate pillar three months ago. And then we had a record Q4. And so I think that degree of focus internally coupled with how we can actually help our customers, putting our customers first, really is driving a lot of the success there. And that new focus, we're pretty much sticking to the plan. The plan's working. We're sticking to the plan. And so we see a lot of opportunity there. Thanks for the question. I'm really excited about the role. I've been working here for 17 years through a lot of growth, and my focus over those 17 years has really been learning from Ken and Michael and the team. And it's like an MBA on steroids. They're brilliant business people in addition to focusing on the innovation and the technology, which I think is a core differentiator for Fortinet. We are an innovation-first company. And I think our culture is really around what I call almost a straightforward baritocracy. And Ken and Michael drive this throughout the organization. It's very straightforward. It's work hard, work smart, innovate and put the customer first and deliver results. And so I really like the culture. Obviously, I've been here 17 years. Some people say I need to get more creative with my career, but I really \u2013 it really gets me excited to make a difference. And it's a positive difference. We're protecting our customers so they can get about their business. So I really like that. And in terms of how I can contribute, up until now I've focused on legal and corp dev. I'm taking over corporate real estate. I'm adding systems, manufacturing and logistics. And so I have a broad set of responsibilities. I also have always worked very closely with the sales teams. I will not be managing the sales teams, but I will continue to work closely. Teamwork is one of our top three culture items here. And we're not really boxed in here in a way. In a way, we really work together. And so we've got great sales leaders, and I look forward to working with them. We've got a huge opportunity to grow. We want to grow and capture that opportunity by putting the customer first. I want to support that. And to the extent I can help the team, I want to do that. To Fatima's question earlier, we're also very disciplined on the cost side. And as Keith said, we have this services model where we have a lot of visibility based on the deferred revenue on the top line. But we also are very disciplined at kind of managing and monitoring the costs on a real-time basis. And, sometimes you can control the costs, more quickly than other things. And so what I've noticed is, we're very good at kind of managing that on a real-time basis, and we'll continue to do that as well. Thank you. In terms of the quota retirement question, Keith may have additional comments on that, but there's really no change there."

Good afternoon and thank you to everyone for joining our call. In Q3, we exceeded street expectations in our operation margin and free cash flow. However, building and product revenue fell below our expectation due to a slowdown in secure networking growth, along with challenging in sales execution and marketing efficiency. In response to the slowdown in secure networking market, we are shifting our marketing and sales team's focus towards a faster-growing secured operation as SASE market over the next few quarters. How while maintaining our consistent focus on leading innovation in secure networking and the convergence of security and networking where we have been a leader for 23 years. While we anticipate limit ear-term growth in secure networking market, it is very important for Fortinet. As we believe, enable us our platform strategy with a massive footprint in the market leader as the market leader in both firewall revenue and units shipped. The secure networking market is valued at $62 billion [ph] and is projected to increase high single digits annually to $86 billion [ph] by 2027. Our consistent focus on [indiscernible] our industry-leading DOS which supported over 30 network function networking and security application combined with our ASIC-driven performance capability which provides flight to 10x better performance on average than competitors continue to drive our market share gains. Secure networking remain a vital part of our strategy and a market that we believe will return to double-digit annual growth over time. We have been innovating for some time in the faster-growing segment of secure operations and SASE. Security operations also known as setup is a $46 billion market growing at mid-teens annually to $78 billion by 2027. Fortinet our platform is comprehensive and integrated offering EDR, SIM, SAR, MD and other integrated solutions. Consolidation in the security demand seamless integration and underlying secured tools. Fortinet strength lies in its innovation and its ability to enable automation through a high degree of product integration. Our AI and product and power automatic stock business second, all underpinned by a single consolidated management and analytics platform. In addition to SecOp [ph], we have continued to increase our focus on SASE. A $17 billion market expected to grow at a 20% compose growth rate to $36 billion by 2027. We believe Fortinet is the only company with a SASE service solution that can perform all functions in the cloud or email and is on with a common operation system. Including 4 networking and security set, market-leading SD-WAN, vWAN and the management council. Our SASE service solution is supported by Google Cloud. With over 100 worldwide SASE cloud location together with our own 30-plus point present and the data centers. For our client-based use case, we are salary SASE service function using our ASIC technology. For instance, we recently announced a Fortinet 1.8G with a security process a side. Which support our full SASE offering which including SD-WAN, firewall, Secure SD-WAN gateway, big lock prevention and boost secure computing region 6 to 54x better than our competition. We anticipate that success in SASE market will first come from upselling SASE service to our installed base of tens of thousands of AT1 customers. And from attracting new customers looking to leverage a single-vendor integrated SASE service solution. Our industry leadership in both firewall and SD-WAN -- the 2 largest components of SASE provides us with a significant competitive advantage. We have a track record of successful execution and believe we are the only company with strong SASE service and the setup solution combined in the same operation system. This differentiation sets us apart and provide us with a significant competitor advantage over peers. While we expect top line growth to be modest for the next few quarters due to challenging networking comparison and our business transformation realignment towards security operation and SASE. We anticipate growth return to double digits by the second half of 2024. We remain committed to generating healthy operating margin of 25% or greater in 2024 and 2025. Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners and suppliers worldwide for their continued support and hard work. Keith?\nKeith Jensen: Thank you, Ken and good afternoon, everyone. As Ken mentioned, we are confident in our integrated 400S driven platform strategy which is summarized on Slides 6 through 10 of the earnings slide deck. As we look forward, we believe shifting our R&D and go-to-market investments in the faster-growing SASE and SecOp markets is consistent with near-term market opportunities. As shown on Slide 10, SASE and SecOps account for 20% and 10%, respectively, of our business today. And as shown on Slide 7, these markets are expected to grow in the mid- to high teens annually. Secure Networking which currently accounts for 70% of our business, is expected to experience lower growth following 2 years of very robust growth. As a result, for the near term, we expect to deliver healthy profitability along with more modest growth. With execution and continued investment in the SASE and SecOps markets, we believe we can return to delivering mid- to high teens top level growth -- top line growth and while continuing to deliver operating margins of 25% or greater. In other words, a return to balance growth and profitability which has led us to achieve the rule of 40 status in 12 or 15 years, as shown on Slide 19. In a moment, I'll expand on the strategic shift by sharing a few of the tactical steps and investments. But first, I'd like to review some highlights from the quarter. We continue to add new logos at an impressive rate and saw top line performance in small enterprise and software was strong while operating margin and free cash flow were above expectations. We added over 6,400 new logos, supported by small enterprise customers which grew bookings by 19%. Our efforts to manage personnel and other costs drove our operating margin to 27.8%, 230 basis points above the high end of the guidance range. Free cash flow was strong at $481 million, representing a margin of 36%. Looking at billings. Starting from the third quarter of 2022, we saw a 3-year compounded annual billings growth rate or CAGR of 26%, illustrating our ability to drive strong and sustained growth over an extended period. In Q3, however, billings of $1.49 billion represented growth of 6% as we experienced 1 month shorter contract duration and importantly, lackluster appliance demand resulting from elevated product growth in earlier periods. In terms of industry verticals, education and government buildings were strong, while service provider and retail buildings were weak. Small enterprise billings growth was strong, while growth rates with larger enterprises disappointed. Phil's growth varied by GEO with international emerging showing strong growth, while our much larger GEOs of Europe and the U.S. were weaker. Turning to revenue and margins. Total revenue of 16% Prometal revenue grew 16% to $1.33 billion which compares to our 3-year CAGR of 27%. The 3-year CAGR was largely consistent with our 14-year CAGR illustrated on Slide 18. Product revenue of $466 million, representing a 3-year CAGR of 28% was down 1%, reflecting product lead times and backlog aligning with historical levels and the lighter levels of network security demand can refer to. Service revenues of $869 million grew 28%, representing a 3-year CAGR of 27%. Service revenue accounted for 65% of total revenues driven by 34% growth in higher-margin security subscriptions which represents 57% of total service revenue. We mentioned the 3-year CAGR to illustrate how consistent they are. With the same CAGR starting from our 2009 IPO which were illustrated on Slide 18, each of the 3-year CAGRs, billings, product revenue, service revenue and total revenue are within 5 points of the 14-year CAGR for the same top line metrics, adding to our confidence in returning to higher growth levels. Product gross margins were down 310 basis points as we saw margin pressure related to inventory levels. Service gross margin was up 60 basis points as service revenue growth outpaced higher levels of cloud and hosting costs. Total gross margin of 76.9% was up 70 basis points driven by the increase in service gross margins and the 6-point shift from product revenue to service revenue. Operating margin of 27.8% exceeded the high end of the guidance range and operating income of $371 million was $33 million higher than consensus and $20 million above the high on the high end of our guidance range, reflecting our efforts to control spending. Looking to the statement of cash flow, summers on Slides 15 through 17. Free cash flow increased 22% to $481 million, representing a free cash flow margin of 36% or 9 points above consensus. Operating cash flow increased $68 million to 41% of revenue. Capital expenditures of $70 million, including $50 million of real estate investments. Cash taxes paid in the quarter were $26 million. As a reminder, free cash flow benefited from regulatory relief in the form of deferred estimated and other tax payments in the second and third quarters, totaling $192 million and $18 million, respectively. In the fourth quarter, we expect cash taxes to total $345 million, including the $210 million of deferred tax payments. We repurchased 10.4 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of $605 million in the third quarter. In October, we purchased an additional 7.7 million shares for $444 million. And our remaining share repurchase authorization stood at approximately $980 million at the end of October. Now I'd like to share a couple of key SASE wins for us in the quarter. In a 7-figure upsell win an existing financial services customer initiated their single vendor SASE solution for 50,000 users. Fortinet was able to displace another incumbent as the customer continue their consolidation journey with us, supplementing their earlier SecOps, cloud and network security purchases. And in a 6-figure deal, an existing SD-WAN customer continued their strategic transition to SaaS and cloud-based applications by adding our SASE solution for 2,000 users. We believe existing SD-WAN customers such as this one, offer a rich cross-sell opportunity for our SASE solution. It's worth noting these deals closed before our recently announced partnership with Google Cloud which significantly expands our PoP coverage by adding over 100 locations and prior to Gartner's release of the inaugural single vendor SASE Magic Quadrant, where we were named a challenger. By 2025, 1/3 of new SASE deployments are expected to be single vendor. I should also note Fortinet is recognized in 9 Gardner Magic Quadrants as shown on Slide 3. Now I'd like to expand on Ken's strategic commentary with some of the tactical investments we're making to increasingly focus our efforts on SASE and SecOps in the areas of research and development and solution delivery, in addition to the new Google Cloud partnership I just mentioned and our own data center investments, we're continuing to integrate single SASE features into 40s [ph] and continuing to expand our SecOp capabilities with AI technology and additional functions in enhanced integration. And finalizing co-development agreements with existing large enterprise customers to accelerate continuous improvement of our integrated enterprise level SASE solution. Our go-to-market strategy, our investments include actively promoting our challenger position in Gartner a single vendor SASE Magic Quadrant, focusing on third-party certification of our broad and integrated solutions. Including SSE and SD-WAN and aggressively marketing Fortinet competitive advantages and the key components of SASE, SecOps and network security as summarized on Slide 10. Certifying 5,500 foot net sales professional of SecOps solutions after all ready certifying these same sellers in SASE which is the largest sales enablement motion in company history. Investing in sales comp plans to include incentives to sell SASE and SecOps capabilities to existing and new customers. Expanding partner roles deeper into channel partners specializing in SASE and SecOps. And developing channel training and is focused on differentiating Fortinet's is comprehensive and integrated SASE and SecOps capabilities. We believe Fortinet remains well positioned in the cybersecurity market and the market shift to platform strategies is in early stages. According to Gartner, 75% of companies are pursuing a vendor consolidation strategy, reflecting the evolving landscape of cybersecurity in a highly fragmented industry with thousands of vendors. As shown on Slide 9, Pertinent brings consolidation across SecOps, SASE and network security the 3 key growth drivers in our strategy. Organizations are recognizing that an integrated security solution with a single operating system is the best method to improve their security posture as this approach allows each security solution to share data and communicate with each other, reducing complexity and improving security effectiveness. Attending to piece together best-of-breed solutions from multiple vendors can result in slower AI-driven technology adoption, significant security gaps and a slower pace of identifying, reporting and resolving security incidents. Moving to guidance. we continue to see increased deal scrutiny and longer sales cycles which is constraining our near-term results. We expect these longer sales cycles to continue along with the associated budgetary scrutiny and our fourth quarter guidance takes us into consideration. As a reminder, our fourth quarter and full year outlook which are summarized on Slides 20 and 21, is subject to the disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. In the fourth quarter, we expect billings in the range of $1.560 billion to $1.700 billion which at the midpoint represents a decline of 5%. Revenue in the range of $1.380 billion to $1.440 billion which at the midpoint represents growth of 10%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75.5% to 76.5%; non-GAAP operating margin of 27.5% to 28.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.42 to $0.44 which assumes a share count of between 780 million to 790 million; capital expenditures of $40 million to $60 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of 17%. And cash taxes, as I mentioned, are $345 million [ph]. For the full year, we expect billings in the range of $6.095 billion to $6.235 billion which at the midpoint represents growth of 10%. The Revenue in the range of $5.270 billion to $5.330 billion which is the midpoint represents growth of 20%. Service revenue range of $3.355 billion to $3.375 billion which at the midpoint represents a growth of 28%. The service revenue guidance implies product revenue growth of 9%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 76% to 77% and non-GAAP operating margin of 26.5% to 27.5%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.54 to $1.56 which assumes a share count of between 790 million and 800 million. Capital expenditures of $220 million to $240 million; non-GAAP tax rate of 17% and cash taxes of $430 million. As we look forward to 2024 and transition from a period of elevated product growth, we can offer a few thoughts looking forward. In the near term, we will continue to focus on improving profitability. We expect product gross margins to be pressured in 2024. Nonetheless, we expect healthy operating margins that are 25% or greater. We expect to gradually increase billings growth through the year and approach double-digit growth by the second half of 2024, reflecting the progressively easier comps due to the easing of the headwind and from backlog draws in the first half of 2023 and the benefit of our SASE and SecOps focus. We expect contract term to remain below our high water marks of 2022. We Consistent with prior years, we expect that the timing of service revenue growth trends will lag product growth trends. Longer term, we remain confident in our solutions and our ability to adopt our strategy to shifts in the market. taking market share as we increase our investments in SASE and SecOps, ultimately returning to balanced growth and profitability. I look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters. And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A.\nPeter Salkowski: Operator -- as a reminder, during the Q&A session, we ask you to please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question to allow others to participate. Operator, you can open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Hamza Fodderwala from Morgan Stanley.\nHamza Fodderwala: Ken, maybe just for you. To what extent are you seeing SASE start to eat into firewall and network security budgets? Because clearly, there's a bigger focus there. There is a dedicated go-to-market effort there. So -- do you think that SASE is starting to cannibalize the firewall market to some degree?\nKen Xie: I think it's a little bit different business model. SASE is more the service OpEx compared to the networking dip CapEx, during the slow economy environment, customers definitely move towards service-based OpEx. So it will be also since some of service providers kind of a little bit slower to adopt some of the SASE that -- we have been involved in SASE a long time. And some of the service provider kind of slower than we expected. So that's where we kind of changed some of the strategy more aggressively going ourselves at the same time, still working closely with the partner.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Essex from JPMorgan.\nBrian Essex: I guess maybe, Keith, for you, as we look at the trajectory of product declines this quarter in billings growth -- and I guess guidance implies that this is a billings trough this quarter. What observations might you have from other, we'll call them, spending cycles where you've hit negative product or low single-digit product revenue growth and a degree of recovery that you've seen after those spending cycles? And what gives you the level of confidence in your ability to, I guess, return to double-digit growth for either product or billings or both in the second half, understanding you're going to have easier comps as well?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. Brian, great question, I should say. One of the slides that we added to the investor presentation for this earnings call actually maps out the what you can see is a cycle -- more cyclical nature of the business than maybe we've talked about in the past with product revenue. For example, in 2017, I think we had product revenue growth of 5% and that was somewhat of a low watermark. The market may have been due and I think there's some analyst studies out there from other members of Wall Street that have kind of suggested that the market was due for a little bit of a pause in firewalls. And I think we're seeing that now. And perhaps there was some delay of that pause because of supply chain issues and so forth, something that may have more naturally occurred in 2021 or in 2022. I think in terms of confidence, broadly, I think that was the intention of looking at the CAGRs and the success of the company that Canada has led the company through since its IPO and what those CAGRs are. And if you look at that combined with that new slide in the deck, you understand that there's going to be -- there has been the past been volatility in the industry and in the company. But over the longer stretch, you see some very attractive CAGRs in that.\nKen Xie: Long term, we still don't believe the convergence of network into network security will be happening which also valid by like [indiscernible], by 2030 the network security secure networking will be larger than the traditional networking, especially in the compass environment, in the enterprise. And so we do believe it's a huge market opportunity. We have a unique advantage with our integrated operating system with our ASIC acceleration, we are keeping gaining market share in both network and also in the SASE market.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Fatima Boolani from Citi.\nFatima Boolani: Keith, in your prepared commentary, you specifically called out the service provider and retail vertical perhaps exceptionally weak in their buying. And Ken was just sort of alluding to some of the challenges that are stemming from service provider buying behavior -- but I was hoping you could provide a little bit more detail as to why have the spending patterns in these particular verticals become so dramatically weak -- and was this in the scope of your assumptions as you were thinking about the pipe? Just wanted to get a better understanding of how and why the buying intentions have sort of rolled over in these 2 areas specifically?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think the service provider commentary has probably been reported by a number of other companies through this earnings cycle. I don't think that's -- the headline itself is not a surprise. I think the significance of the slowdown in the service provider, at least for what we saw in our business was a surprise, particularly because it's a worldwide service provider number, not just in the U.S. But as I also noted in the prepared comments, we saw weakness in both the U.S. and the Europe, European markets. and that applies to service provider and to the retail sector. I think the retail sector probably is perhaps a little bit more prone to some of the digestion of SD-WAN projects that are still working their way through and maybe that's a little bit different. As well as some of the economic headlines were probably a little bit disconcerting to the retail sector in the earlier part of the quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tal Liani from BofA.\nTal Liani: Thank you. I have 2 questions on the same topic. If you go back to the last 2 years, you talked a lot about non-appliance sales, meaning upsell SD-WAN which is a head on service and then non-FortiGate. And when things start to slow, we only blame the appliances. So the question is in retrospect, when you look at things and you look at the other parts of the business and you look at the add-on sales and the other features, are they all based on you -- the ability of us selling appliances, meaning even if it's a non-FortiGate, it's being attached to a FortiGate sale and that's why it's going down with it or an SD-WAN, et cetera. So first, just to understand kind of the total exposure of the company from all the successful products that you were able to sell over the last 2 years and now in retrospect, just to understand how is the exposure to appliance? And the next -- the second question which is related to it is if really it's about applying sales, what is the outlook for 2024 when it comes to do you have any big refresh cycle what could drive outside of easy comps that our comps are getting easier through the year? Is there anything that you're planning on your end to drive some kind of a replacement or a refresh of the appliances?\nKen Xie: Yes, it's Ken. I think for SD-WAN, they do need a place to be in place to deliver all these SD-WAN functions there. We really offer SD-WAN as part of the [indiscernible] Function for free and we started launching the SD-WAN service last quarter. So it's still in the ramp-up stage. We do believe one to all the service, we're keeping accelerating like the SASE market will be growing faster than the secure networking market. I think that's where for certain like -- I think there's a chunk on the presentation shows some of the product and service which is in on Page 19, you can see some of the cycle up and down there. Also, some of I do believe relate to the new ASIC and also product launch because we just started the new cycle of the new ISP5 [ph]; we have a one or two product as starting launching which gave us like a 5 to 10x better performance and more function at the same cost. Which also combined with the supply chain kind of elevated shipment of building in the last 2, 3 years. Because it's combined together, I feel have affected our price sales in the last few months. But I do believe this since we'll go back to normal probably in second half of next year. After the new product being fully launched after the supply digestion but inventory directions kind of go through because we do see the long-term convergence story is still holding well. We have a big position with better integrated OS with salvation. And our plan as a part of the whole solution. It's a hybrid solution, both our part cloud, especially we call the universal SASE. So that's -- there's some kind of cycle, if you refer to the Page 19 of the presentation, we kind of probably go through that cycle right now.\nKeith Jensen: Yes, Tal, I'll maybe add to Ken's comments. I think you're correct in that, your interest that the vast majority of the time, our first sales to customers a firewall. It can be a virtual firewall or it could be a physical appliance. And really, that is the beachhead that then go sell these other security functions and products. I think what you're seeing is in part of the shift of strategy and we talk about making the investments in note SASE but also SecOps. It's really that SecOps product family like EDR and SIM and so as such, that you're seeing is doubling down on the investments there because while it's not the largest of the 3 market segments, it is the fastest growing. And I think we have the opportunity to participate in those markets more, particularly now that some of our products have reached a greater level of maturity.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Saket Kalia from Barclays.\nSaket Kalia: Okay, great. Ken, I'm going to ask 2 together. So maybe for the first one, Ken, for you. Just maybe thinking about the long term and specifically in the SASE part of the business, when do you feel like Fortinet will have a solution that can compete head-to-head with other SASE solutions? Maybe the answer is now, right but I just want to hear how you think about it. And how big do you think this part of the business can be longer term? That's the first question. The second question for you, Keith, is it's great to see the operating margin being. Maybe you could just talk about how you're thinking about sort of midterm profitability -- because clearly, the business can generate higher margins than 25%. How do you sort of think about that balance now kind of given some of the changes here?\nKen Xie: Yes. The first answer is, yes, now we are ahead at competing. And we also believe we have a much better solution, better integrated and at the same time, much better cost ROI compared to other competitors of SASE. And also the universal SASE is very unique because they offer both in the cloud, on the plans of Compass all the same solution which allows the customer a more like our solution instead of sometimes you have to deal with traffic, whether enough is office have to fold the part because our solution you can process some traffic locally on campus within their appliance.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. So you had a great point about whether you're talking about free cash flow, you're talking about operating margin. The company does very, very well on the bottom line. And the strategy has been to continue to reinvest that back robustly in both innovation in the form of R&D spending but also in go-to-market, whether that's marketing, whether that's selling. I think we're looking at right now with the sort of firewall market. Obviously, we're trying to bring new solutions to better solutions to our sellers to sell when the firewall is a little bit slower. But I do think it's a workout conversation and looking at the sales coverage, if you will. We've talked for several years about how many -- in North America, for example, how many accounts do we want per rep. We started with 65, I think, 4 or 5 years ago. We were talking about that. That number is now down to 10. And at 10, you're probably reaching a point of where you're -- on the enterprise side, you're probably reaching a pretty good coverage model for our business. You could probably go a little bit lower but that feels pretty good. I think there's another opportunity right now immediately in front of us in terms of how do we continue to support our channel partners, be they distributors or be they resellers and make sure that we're getting the right level of mind share from them. So I would suspect there will be some investments in that part of the business as we go forward. At the same time, I think there's some opportunities here and Ken's talked about it with us about how to be more efficient in how we're spending our money, whether that's in selling and marketing or back office functions or what have you. So -- we're not trying to guide to 2024 today, obviously but we did think that it was important to provide at least some early thoughts in terms of maybe a floor for what 2024 should look like for us on the bottom line.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick from Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. I appreciate that as you lean into SASE and security operations, your most obvious advantage is in having an industry-leading installed base. But for those of us that have always viewed Fortinet's distinct advantage is the price performance of your purpose-built hardware and you've also had a go to market, both direct and indirect that know how to showcase that. I'm just trying to get my head around all the changes in distribution, both direct and indirect which I appreciate, Keith, you made comments about sales enablement. But how do you think about the investment in dollars in time needed to get distribution properly ramped? And can you ever achieve the same level of sales productivity that you've enjoyed when the motion was more box-centric?\nKen Xie: We do believe in this fast-growing SASE SecOps market, the sales training, sales restructuring. At the same time, more efficient marketing is very, very important. And also, we are continue working closely with our channel partner with our distribution network to reaching more broad customer base. So we're also thinking the large cross-sell opportunity is huge and especially go through our partner network there. So I don't feel the investment we've made in the past will be any issue or kind of any slow us down. We do believe we are actually helping us to expand in this more service basis SASE market and also more consolidation secure approach.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. And I would just build on Ken's comment, Brad and all good and fair questions. It's not by accident. We're talking about SASE. If you go back and think about it a little bit, we've been talking about it and in a number of different ways, Ken has talked about the PoP strategy which now you see us accelerating that PoP strategy with the cloud providers to come to market more quickly. The Gartner Magic Quadrant, I think, of the catalyst for the single vendor strategy and having us in the challenger quadrant gives us the bonafides if you will, to have a lot of conversations. The single vendor strategy, that installed base that you referred to, we went back and looked over the last 2 quarters, we've done several hundred SASE deals already. And to be quite honest, that was without any real wood behind the arrow in terms of marketing support and sales support. It was really just how it grew. And it's interesting. I would have expected those first sales that would have been clearly dominated by SD-WAN. They were not SD-WAN customers. They were often times, there were just as many brand new customers coming to us for the SASE solution as they were SD-WAN customers or somewhere and at the third part of the pie were customers that are bars for other firewall use cases. So, I don't -- in the expectation that our -- we're going to be successful initially in the smaller part of the market. I don't think we disagree with that. When I look at that same mix of SASE customers, nearly 50% of those SASE customers that we signed already would be in the SMB space. And then, the remainder was kind of divided up between the larger enterprises and the mid-enterprise. So, I don't think we got here by accident. We maybe just not to talk about it publicly but I think we're well positioned now because of the investments that we've made in the data centers, the PoPs, the operating system like Gartner Magic Quadrant, the fact in a single vendor in the installed base. I think this is the right strategic shift for us to make at this point.\nBrad Zelnick: And just a quick follow-up and I know it's a topic we've spoken about in the past. But as SASE increases as part of the mix? And I know strategically, you've partnered with Google to help deliver the infrastructure. How should we think about the CapEx required to do this in a competitive way over the longer term?\nKen Xie: We do have a good partnership with Google. At the same time, some other service providers like digital royalty. And we also built some of our own like data center PoP over 30 owned by ourself which has really given us a more cost advantage. So we're containing that strategy but as do need time to ramp up. So Google is a very quick solution for us, for customers. And also, we feel we separate -- we kind of realign the market into 3 different segments. Secure networking, SASE and SecureOp is much clearer, much better lineup with the customer need and also with different customer demand. So that's much better, more clear compared to the previous one we have whether the FortiGate or some other like enhanced non-FortiGate product. We feel this is a clear 3 segment line up quite well with the customer demand. So we're starting tracking based on this one, also we started compensate sales and the train sales and marketing along these 3 separate segments of the market. That will be more clearly to us internal for customers to a partner to very kind of drive what customers really need in the current environment.\nKeith Jensen: To Ken's point, look, we were -- last quarter, we were talking about 20 PoPs because we're building them ourselves, right? Now you're talking about over 100 locations, well over 100 locations. So I think there's a go-to-market opportunity there that this brings to us. I think longer term -- and we know that one of our competitors, this is the approach they take and we have pretty good visibility, obviously, to what their margins are and their investments there. And there's another player in the space that's much more building their own PoPs, if you will. PoPs individually are not huge things, right? I mean they are single-digit number of racks that really have a PoP, I think. So I do believe you need some forward-stage data centers. And I think that's consistent with our strategy that we've talked about, about increasing more and more hosted delivery services and particularly in SecOps. So I think this is not something that we're going to surprise people with in terms of our CapEx spending.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Tindle from Raymond James.\nAdam Tindle: Keith, it sounds like you're confident in profitability and free cash flow which makes sense. Obviously, the model has proved itself over the years. So I wanted to ask about capital allocation. The balance sheet is already very healthy. You've got a lot of capacity. Right now, the market is pivoting towards universal SASE and SecOps, as you mentioned. Curious how the conversations have gone internally to potentially accelerate your pivot towards that with larger M&A. And conversely, if we look at the after-hours action here, the ROI on share repurchase is looking potentially very strong the opportunity to potential step up share repurchases? Just in general, how you're thinking about using the balance sheet as a weapon during a time where the business and stock is pressured?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think we included a comment in the -- in my prepared remarks that the available -- we still have -- as of the start of the month, start of the week, I guess, we had $980 million of available authorization for the buyback. And I think you saw some of the numbers that we provided in the prepared remarks about being fairly aggressive during the quarter itself as well in terms of buying back stock. Canada so let me go shopping for companies very often. So I'll defer to him in terms of his thoughts on that.\nKen Xie: We're definitely keeping looking. I think right now, the multiple probably more reasonable than the last 1 to 2 years. And also, we do realize the marketing also changing pretty quick. We'll continue to do the internal innovation. We feel we are the strongest on the internal innovation engineering among all the space, player. But on the same time, we also were open to looking for some other companies which we can work together, join together.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. And one quick follow-up, just to make sure Peter kicks me off the call next time for this one. But it will be in the weeds, Keith, sorry. I want to ask about supply. We've been monitoring inventory commitments. They've been elevated for a little while now. Obviously, demand is deteriorating faster than expected. And we're just trying to think about how to manage inventory and future inventory given this new state of demand. where that might manifest itself in results. I think you mentioned product gross margin pressure. I wonder if that was related to that. But any comments on kind of managing this oncoming inventory relative to the current demand?\nKeith Jensen: Yes, it is related to the inventory levels. And I think we've been managing it for the better part of the second half of this year. And that's some of the commentary you're getting as we look into 2024 in terms of where the pressure may come from.\nAdam Tindle: Any way to quantify it though?\nKeith Jensen: Quantify, no.\nKen Xie: Yes, we feel still in a healthy level and we tend to keep about 6 months' inventory. That's where like when 2, 3 years ago, the supply chain should happen, we are in market position because also a lot of time, our customer need some urgent delivery of certain products. So we're probably still keeping the similar policy there. but also we're in a refresh cycle of our new products, especially end. I think so far, we -- I think we also kind of resurprised in the last 2, 3 years. now since starting to stabilize and so changing from a shortage a little bit more towards even some oversupplied. So we feel we are in a pretty good position because we more handle is operation manufacturer directly. So we handle it better than most of our other competitors on the inventory right now. Yes, we also don't see a big issue about the current inventory level.\nOperator: Next question comes from Adam Borg from Stifel.\nAdam Borg: Maybe just on the sales execution issues that you talked about in the script, maybe go a little deeper on what exactly -- what exactly happened and a little bit more about the steps you're taking. And maybe just as a follow-up, just on the SASE partnership with [ GCT ]. I know it's obviously just been a couple of weeks but maybe talk about early customer feedback from initial conversations?\nKen Xie: Yes. We -- if you look in the last 2, 3 years, we're growing a lot of business also hired a lot of salespeople -- and the last 2, 3 years, we probably doubled the business. And at the same time, during the supply chain, you should somehow certain sales feel it too easy to get deal because as always a shortage of certain product there. So that's where we feel we need to enhance the training enablement and -- at the same time, I also need to be more disciplined about the performance. So that's -- at the same time, we also -- when we're shifting this to more like a service-based SASE kind of consolidation cross-sell multi-cell secure part sales also need to keep in learning. At the same time, the market need to be kind of more efficient and also kind of a projection to the new growth opportunity. So that's the focus we have right now. So we are definitely keeping looking to be more efficient in both the sales and marketing going forward.\nAdam Borg: Great. And what about the early feedback on [indiscernible].\nKen Xie: Yes, it's very good that give us a very quick start to match any other competitor on the location, number of [indiscernible] number up and they also have a broad coverage, so it's a good partnership. At the same time, we continue to working with some other partners. We also will continue to build ourselves. And the long term, we feel we have more advantage than some of our competitors because we always have a strategy invest in some long-term or long-term investment strategy, including some real estate, some other parts which give us a much better long-term return.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Patrick Colville from Scotia Bank.\nUnidentified Analyst: All right. Ken, Keith, Peter. My question is about being, I guess, kind of qualitative guidance you guys gave for 2024 billings. If I remember correctly, in last quarter, it was expect kind of high teens busing growth exiting fiscal '24. Was the commentary this quarter expect double-digit growth exiting 2024?\nKeith Jensen: Let's try I'm following the math.\nUnidentified Analyst: I'm just trying to -- so last quarter, you guys gave some kind of like a forward look for 2024 billings. And if I remember rightly, the kind of forward look was expect exiting billings growth to be in high teens. Earlier in your kind of prepared remarks, there was a comment which was expect double-digit growth in the second half. I guess -- are we going from high teens to double digit? Is that the change?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think that's prudent given what we've just seen in terms of the third quarter performance.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joseph Gallo from Jefferies.\nJoseph Gallo: I've got a two-parter, one for each of you. And Keith, as a follow-up to that last question, appreciate the commentary on bottom line floor for '24. Can you just talk about the methodology of top line guidance? Is this a rip the Band-Aid off guide? Or what underpins the confidence and visibility on a reacceleration of billings. Is it SASE turning on or just hardware digestion only taking 2 to 3 quarters? And then, Ken, given what you're seeing with AI, do you believe adoption of AI workloads eventually shift workloads back to on-premise and drives a higher need for firewalls long term?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. And I wasn't quite sure if the question was about the Q4 guide or the 2024 commentary about numbers.\nJoseph Gallo: More for next year but both. Has the methodology for your top line guidance change following the past 2 quarters?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I would say that, while we just deal with actually giving guidance for the fourth quarter, Absolutely. I think the assumed close rates, if you will, are dramatic. I think they're the lowest assumed close rates I've seen that I've used in over 5 years here for context. And they're obviously lower than what I saw in the -- what I used for the first half of the year. And I think that -- I would say there are indicators that the pipeline quality is better in the fourth quarter. But in given light of what we've done for the last 2 quarters, I don't think that should put much stock in that. So I'm content to just assume a much lower close rate than I have more recently. 2024 are not really giving guidance. I think that, again, we're talking about buildings here and I know we're all aware of it but really focus perhaps more on the impact of backlog and what it did to billings in Q1 of last year and Q2 of last year and how that eased throughout the year. So you're really going to see comps change I don't know that we're necessarily assuming a dramatic growth ramp of bookings, if you will, at this early stage for 2024. We do expect it's going to improve as we bring SASE online more successfully and secure operations. But I think it's really part of what you're hearing there is really getting clarity on how the backlog impacted 2023 numbers.\nKen Xie: Yes. it's a very good interesting question about the AI and the security. I have to see definitely AI, we're starting kind of getting the security more quickly, both by that good guy bad guy. But in the genetic AI side, I feel, in some degree, the back a probably more leverage some of that one and the Protect side, still more using what we have been doing in the last 10, 20 years, more like a precision AI and make sure we block the type of not blocking traffic but also to generate -- also helping the porting cost and also helping the secure operation. So it's definitely the AI, we're keeping driving the security growth and both in the cloud and also our appliance. We do see our plans also long term very healthy growth, especially we cause convergence of networking to networking security, especially in enterprise, in the compass environment. And we see that trend will continue to grow well and our unique advantage leverage integrated ASIC will continue to lead in the market and keeping gaining market share. So long term, I don't see any slowdown of the appliance to get into the cybersecurity space.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gray Powell from BTIG.\nGray Powell: All right. Great. Thank you for working in here. I really appreciate it. So maybe a clarification and a follow-up. So you laid out the breakdown for billings or the new breakdown between secure networking, SASE and SecOps. Did you all talk about the relative growth rates that you're seeing today for each segment? And then within secured networking, is there a way to think about how much of the slowdown you're seeing there is related to the core firewall business versus some of the networking components like switches and access points and stuff that may have been more -- that may have benefited more from like supply chain and budget flush and things like that?\nKen Xie: Yes. Actually, we do give the market growth for these 3 segments going forward. And we also believe we're growing faster than the market growth, gaining share in all the 3 segments. Related to the firewall FortiGate versus some other AP switch. We do see more headwind in AP switch for the AP switch because a lot of supply chain issues kind of pretty much over. And so it's -- so that's probably more headwind compared to the firewall secure networking for side.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Heath from KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nEric Heath: Great. And thanks, Peter, for getting me in here. Keith, just for you, curious how the economics to the top line for Fortinet change when a customer is kind of doing an apples-to-apples switch over from kind of the firewall customer over to SASE. And then secondarily, with the shift away from farewell, that probably means more of a shift to annualized billings. So curious how you're thinking about duration and that impact to free cash flow going forward?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. The second one is probably easier. I don't -- we have such a large footprint right now in the firewall business that it's going to take a while for any significant changes in the SASE billings if you really think about it coming into and having an impact on our total term. I don't know that we gave the number but we know that we've come back to a more. We're coming down about a month year-over-year in terms of contract term in 2023 compared to 2022, we went from 28 months roughly last year to about 27 months this year. Maybe I could be off by a month. And you saw the impact in the financials. We've talked about that will one month impacts the billings number. I think it's going to take a while for SASE. As I mentioned, we've already done several under SASE deals. We expect to be more successful early on with 1 in SMB spaces and two, with our installed base. So I would imagine that but it's going to take a while to really have an impact on free cash flow.\nKen Xie: Yes, we also will be keeping salaried training for internal sales force also to our partner for this new SASE SecOp operation which is a little bit different than the traditional secure networking side. So that we also feel the -- with a huge installation base. We have SD-WAN firewall which we're leading. We're number one pretty much in all this area, we feel the huge potential to upsell cross-sell the SASE and secure up once the sales force unevens the partner for the train.\nOperator: At this time, the Q&A session has now ended. I will now turn the call over to Peter Salkowski for closing remarks.\nPeter Salkowski: Thank you, Anton. I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today.

            "content": "Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon and thank you to everyone for joining our call. In Q3, we exceeded street expectations in our operation margin and free cash flow. However, building and product revenue fell below our expectation due to a slowdown in secure networking growth, along with challenging in sales execution and marketing efficiency. In response to the slowdown in secure networking market, we are shifting our marketing and sales team's focus towards a faster-growing secured operation as SASE market over the next few quarters. How while maintaining our consistent focus on leading innovation in secure networking and the convergence of security and networking where we have been a leader for 23 years. While we anticipate limit ear-term growth in secure networking market, it is very important for Fortinet. As we believe, enable us our platform strategy with a massive footprint in the market leader as the market leader in both firewall revenue and units shipped. The secure networking market is valued at $62 billion [ph] and is projected to increase high single digits annually to $86 billion [ph] by 2027. Our consistent focus on [indiscernible] our industry-leading DOS which supported over 30 network function networking and security application combined with our ASIC-driven performance capability which provides flight to 10x better performance on average than competitors continue to drive our market share gains. Secure networking remain a vital part of our strategy and a market that we believe will return to double-digit annual growth over time. We have been innovating for some time in the faster-growing segment of secure operations and SASE. Security operations also known as setup is a $46 billion market growing at mid-teens annually to $78 billion by 2027. Fortinet our platform is comprehensive and integrated offering EDR, SIM, SAR, MD and other integrated solutions. Consolidation in the security demand seamless integration and underlying secured tools. Fortinet strength lies in its innovation and its ability to enable automation through a high degree of product integration. Our AI and product and power automatic stock business second, all underpinned by a single consolidated management and analytics platform. In addition to SecOp [ph], we have continued to increase our focus on SASE. A $17 billion market expected to grow at a 20% compose growth rate to $36 billion by 2027. We believe Fortinet is the only company with a SASE service solution that can perform all functions in the cloud or email and is on with a common operation system. Including 4 networking and security set, market-leading SD-WAN, vWAN and the management council. Our SASE service solution is supported by Google Cloud. With over 100 worldwide SASE cloud location together with our own 30-plus point present and the data centers. For our client-based use case, we are salary SASE service function using our ASIC technology. For instance, we recently announced a Fortinet 1.8G with a security process a side. Which support our full SASE offering which including SD-WAN, firewall, Secure SD-WAN gateway, big lock prevention and boost secure computing region 6 to 54x better than our competition. We anticipate that success in SASE market will first come from upselling SASE service to our installed base of tens of thousands of AT1 customers. And from attracting new customers looking to leverage a single-vendor integrated SASE service solution. Our industry leadership in both firewall and SD-WAN -- the 2 largest components of SASE provides us with a significant competitive advantage. We have a track record of successful execution and believe we are the only company with strong SASE service and the setup solution combined in the same operation system. This differentiation sets us apart and provide us with a significant competitor advantage over peers. While we expect top line growth to be modest for the next few quarters due to challenging networking comparison and our business transformation realignment towards security operation and SASE. We anticipate growth return to double digits by the second half of 2024. We remain committed to generating healthy operating margin of 25% or greater in 2024 and 2025. Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners and suppliers worldwide for their continued support and hard work. Keith? I think it's a little bit different business model. SASE is more the service OpEx compared to the networking dip CapEx, during the slow economy environment, customers definitely move towards service-based OpEx. So it will be also since some of service providers kind of a little bit slower to adopt some of the SASE that -- we have been involved in SASE a long time. And some of the service provider kind of slower than we expected. So that's where we kind of changed some of the strategy more aggressively going ourselves at the same time, still working closely with the partner. Long term, we still don't believe the convergence of network into network security will be happening which also valid by like [indiscernible], by 2030 the network security secure networking will be larger than the traditional networking, especially in the compass environment, in the enterprise. And so we do believe it's a huge market opportunity. We have a unique advantage with our integrated operating system with our ASIC acceleration, we are keeping gaining market share in both network and also in the SASE market. Yes, it's Ken. I think for SD-WAN, they do need a place to be in place to deliver all these SD-WAN functions there. We really offer SD-WAN as part of the [indiscernible] Function for free and we started launching the SD-WAN service last quarter. So it's still in the ramp-up stage. We do believe one to all the service, we're keeping accelerating like the SASE market will be growing faster than the secure networking market. I think that's where for certain like -- I think there's a chunk on the presentation shows some of the product and service which is in on Page 19, you can see some of the cycle up and down there. Also, some of I do believe relate to the new ASIC and also product launch because we just started the new cycle of the new ISP5 [ph]; we have a one or two product as starting launching which gave us like a 5 to 10x better performance and more function at the same cost. Which also combined with the supply chain kind of elevated shipment of building in the last 2, 3 years. Because it's combined together, I feel have affected our price sales in the last few months. But I do believe this since we'll go back to normal probably in second half of next year. After the new product being fully launched after the supply digestion but inventory directions kind of go through because we do see the long-term convergence story is still holding well. We have a big position with better integrated OS with salvation. And our plan as a part of the whole solution. It's a hybrid solution, both our part cloud, especially we call the universal SASE. So that's -- there's some kind of cycle, if you refer to the Page 19 of the presentation, we kind of probably go through that cycle right now. Yes. The first answer is, yes, now we are ahead at competing. And we also believe we have a much better solution, better integrated and at the same time, much better cost ROI compared to other competitors of SASE. And also the universal SASE is very unique because they offer both in the cloud, on the plans of Compass all the same solution which allows the customer a more like our solution instead of sometimes you have to deal with traffic, whether enough is office have to fold the part because our solution you can process some traffic locally on campus within their appliance. We do believe in this fast-growing SASE SecOps market, the sales training, sales restructuring. At the same time, more efficient marketing is very, very important. And also, we are continue working closely with our channel partner with our distribution network to reaching more broad customer base. So we're also thinking the large cross-sell opportunity is huge and especially go through our partner network there. So I don't feel the investment we've made in the past will be any issue or kind of any slow us down. We do believe we are actually helping us to expand in this more service basis SASE market and also more consolidation secure approach. We do have a good partnership with Google. At the same time, some other service providers like digital royalty. And we also built some of our own like data center PoP over 30 owned by ourself which has really given us a more cost advantage. So we're containing that strategy but as do need time to ramp up. So Google is a very quick solution for us, for customers. And also, we feel we separate -- we kind of realign the market into 3 different segments. Secure networking, SASE and SecureOp is much clearer, much better lineup with the customer need and also with different customer demand. So that's much better, more clear compared to the previous one we have whether the FortiGate or some other like enhanced non-FortiGate product. We feel this is a clear 3 segment line up quite well with the customer demand. So we're starting tracking based on this one, also we started compensate sales and the train sales and marketing along these 3 separate segments of the market. That will be more clearly to us internal for customers to a partner to very kind of drive what customers really need in the current environment. We're definitely keeping looking. I think right now, the multiple probably more reasonable than the last 1 to 2 years. And also, we do realize the marketing also changing pretty quick. We'll continue to do the internal innovation. We feel we are the strongest on the internal innovation engineering among all the space, player. But on the same time, we also were open to looking for some other companies which we can work together, join together. Yes, we feel still in a healthy level and we tend to keep about 6 months' inventory. That's where like when 2, 3 years ago, the supply chain should happen, we are in market position because also a lot of time, our customer need some urgent delivery of certain products. So we're probably still keeping the similar policy there. but also we're in a refresh cycle of our new products, especially end. I think so far, we -- I think we also kind of resurprised in the last 2, 3 years. now since starting to stabilize and so changing from a shortage a little bit more towards even some oversupplied. So we feel we are in a pretty good position because we more handle is operation manufacturer directly. So we handle it better than most of our other competitors on the inventory right now. Yes, we also don't see a big issue about the current inventory level. Yes. We -- if you look in the last 2, 3 years, we're growing a lot of business also hired a lot of salespeople -- and the last 2, 3 years, we probably doubled the business. And at the same time, during the supply chain, you should somehow certain sales feel it too easy to get deal because as always a shortage of certain product there. So that's where we feel we need to enhance the training enablement and -- at the same time, I also need to be more disciplined about the performance. So that's -- at the same time, we also -- when we're shifting this to more like a service-based SASE kind of consolidation cross-sell multi-cell secure part sales also need to keep in learning. At the same time, the market need to be kind of more efficient and also kind of a projection to the new growth opportunity. So that's the focus we have right now. So we are definitely keeping looking to be more efficient in both the sales and marketing going forward. Yes, it's very good that give us a very quick start to match any other competitor on the location, number of [indiscernible] number up and they also have a broad coverage, so it's a good partnership. At the same time, we continue to working with some other partners. We also will continue to build ourselves. And the long term, we feel we have more advantage than some of our competitors because we always have a strategy invest in some long-term or long-term investment strategy, including some real estate, some other parts which give us a much better long-term return. Yes. it's a very good interesting question about the AI and the security. I have to see definitely AI, we're starting kind of getting the security more quickly, both by that good guy bad guy. But in the genetic AI side, I feel, in some degree, the back a probably more leverage some of that one and the Protect side, still more using what we have been doing in the last 10, 20 years, more like a precision AI and make sure we block the type of not blocking traffic but also to generate -- also helping the porting cost and also helping the secure operation. So it's definitely the AI, we're keeping driving the security growth and both in the cloud and also our appliance. We do see our plans also long term very healthy growth, especially we cause convergence of networking to networking security, especially in enterprise, in the compass environment. And we see that trend will continue to grow well and our unique advantage leverage integrated ASIC will continue to lead in the market and keeping gaining market share. So long term, I don't see any slowdown of the appliance to get into the cybersecurity space. Yes. Actually, we do give the market growth for these 3 segments going forward. And we also believe we're growing faster than the market growth, gaining share in all the 3 segments. Related to the firewall FortiGate versus some other AP switch. We do see more headwind in AP switch for the AP switch because a lot of supply chain issues kind of pretty much over. And so it's -- so that's probably more headwind compared to the firewall secure networking for side. Yes, we also will be keeping salaried training for internal sales force also to our partner for this new SASE SecOp operation which is a little bit different than the traditional secure networking side. So that we also feel the -- with a huge installation base. We have SD-WAN firewall which we're leading. We're number one pretty much in all this area, we feel the huge potential to upsell cross-sell the SASE and secure up once the sales force unevens the partner for the train."

            "name": "Keith Jensen",
            "content": "Thank you, Ken and good afternoon, everyone. As Ken mentioned, we are confident in our integrated 400S driven platform strategy which is summarized on Slides 6 through 10 of the earnings slide deck. As we look forward, we believe shifting our R&D and go-to-market investments in the faster-growing SASE and SecOp markets is consistent with near-term market opportunities. As shown on Slide 10, SASE and SecOps account for 20% and 10%, respectively, of our business today. And as shown on Slide 7, these markets are expected to grow in the mid- to high teens annually. Secure Networking which currently accounts for 70% of our business, is expected to experience lower growth following 2 years of very robust growth. As a result, for the near term, we expect to deliver healthy profitability along with more modest growth. With execution and continued investment in the SASE and SecOps markets, we believe we can return to delivering mid- to high teens top level growth -- top line growth and while continuing to deliver operating margins of 25% or greater. In other words, a return to balance growth and profitability which has led us to achieve the rule of 40 status in 12 or 15 years, as shown on Slide 19. In a moment, I'll expand on the strategic shift by sharing a few of the tactical steps and investments. But first, I'd like to review some highlights from the quarter. We continue to add new logos at an impressive rate and saw top line performance in small enterprise and software was strong while operating margin and free cash flow were above expectations. We added over 6,400 new logos, supported by small enterprise customers which grew bookings by 19%. Our efforts to manage personnel and other costs drove our operating margin to 27.8%, 230 basis points above the high end of the guidance range. Free cash flow was strong at $481 million, representing a margin of 36%. Looking at billings. Starting from the third quarter of 2022, we saw a 3-year compounded annual billings growth rate or CAGR of 26%, illustrating our ability to drive strong and sustained growth over an extended period. In Q3, however, billings of $1.49 billion represented growth of 6% as we experienced 1 month shorter contract duration and importantly, lackluster appliance demand resulting from elevated product growth in earlier periods. In terms of industry verticals, education and government buildings were strong, while service provider and retail buildings were weak. Small enterprise billings growth was strong, while growth rates with larger enterprises disappointed. Phil's growth varied by GEO with international emerging showing strong growth, while our much larger GEOs of Europe and the U.S. were weaker. Turning to revenue and margins. Total revenue of 16% Prometal revenue grew 16% to $1.33 billion which compares to our 3-year CAGR of 27%. The 3-year CAGR was largely consistent with our 14-year CAGR illustrated on Slide 18. Product revenue of $466 million, representing a 3-year CAGR of 28% was down 1%, reflecting product lead times and backlog aligning with historical levels and the lighter levels of network security demand can refer to. Service revenues of $869 million grew 28%, representing a 3-year CAGR of 27%. Service revenue accounted for 65% of total revenues driven by 34% growth in higher-margin security subscriptions which represents 57% of total service revenue. We mentioned the 3-year CAGR to illustrate how consistent they are. With the same CAGR starting from our 2009 IPO which were illustrated on Slide 18, each of the 3-year CAGRs, billings, product revenue, service revenue and total revenue are within 5 points of the 14-year CAGR for the same top line metrics, adding to our confidence in returning to higher growth levels. Product gross margins were down 310 basis points as we saw margin pressure related to inventory levels. Service gross margin was up 60 basis points as service revenue growth outpaced higher levels of cloud and hosting costs. Total gross margin of 76.9% was up 70 basis points driven by the increase in service gross margins and the 6-point shift from product revenue to service revenue. Operating margin of 27.8% exceeded the high end of the guidance range and operating income of $371 million was $33 million higher than consensus and $20 million above the high on the high end of our guidance range, reflecting our efforts to control spending. Looking to the statement of cash flow, summers on Slides 15 through 17. Free cash flow increased 22% to $481 million, representing a free cash flow margin of 36% or 9 points above consensus. Operating cash flow increased $68 million to 41% of revenue. Capital expenditures of $70 million, including $50 million of real estate investments. Cash taxes paid in the quarter were $26 million. As a reminder, free cash flow benefited from regulatory relief in the form of deferred estimated and other tax payments in the second and third quarters, totaling $192 million and $18 million, respectively. In the fourth quarter, we expect cash taxes to total $345 million, including the $210 million of deferred tax payments. We repurchased 10.4 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of $605 million in the third quarter. In October, we purchased an additional 7.7 million shares for $444 million. And our remaining share repurchase authorization stood at approximately $980 million at the end of October. Now I'd like to share a couple of key SASE wins for us in the quarter. In a 7-figure upsell win an existing financial services customer initiated their single vendor SASE solution for 50,000 users. Fortinet was able to displace another incumbent as the customer continue their consolidation journey with us, supplementing their earlier SecOps, cloud and network security purchases. And in a 6-figure deal, an existing SD-WAN customer continued their strategic transition to SaaS and cloud-based applications by adding our SASE solution for 2,000 users. We believe existing SD-WAN customers such as this one, offer a rich cross-sell opportunity for our SASE solution. It's worth noting these deals closed before our recently announced partnership with Google Cloud which significantly expands our PoP coverage by adding over 100 locations and prior to Gartner's release of the inaugural single vendor SASE Magic Quadrant, where we were named a challenger. By 2025, 1/3 of new SASE deployments are expected to be single vendor. I should also note Fortinet is recognized in 9 Gardner Magic Quadrants as shown on Slide 3. Now I'd like to expand on Ken's strategic commentary with some of the tactical investments we're making to increasingly focus our efforts on SASE and SecOps in the areas of research and development and solution delivery, in addition to the new Google Cloud partnership I just mentioned and our own data center investments, we're continuing to integrate single SASE features into 40s [ph] and continuing to expand our SecOp capabilities with AI technology and additional functions in enhanced integration. And finalizing co-development agreements with existing large enterprise customers to accelerate continuous improvement of our integrated enterprise level SASE solution. Our go-to-market strategy, our investments include actively promoting our challenger position in Gartner a single vendor SASE Magic Quadrant, focusing on third-party certification of our broad and integrated solutions. Including SSE and SD-WAN and aggressively marketing Fortinet competitive advantages and the key components of SASE, SecOps and network security as summarized on Slide 10. Certifying 5,500 foot net sales professional of SecOps solutions after all ready certifying these same sellers in SASE which is the largest sales enablement motion in company history. Investing in sales comp plans to include incentives to sell SASE and SecOps capabilities to existing and new customers. Expanding partner roles deeper into channel partners specializing in SASE and SecOps. And developing channel training and is focused on differentiating Fortinet's is comprehensive and integrated SASE and SecOps capabilities. We believe Fortinet remains well positioned in the cybersecurity market and the market shift to platform strategies is in early stages. According to Gartner, 75% of companies are pursuing a vendor consolidation strategy, reflecting the evolving landscape of cybersecurity in a highly fragmented industry with thousands of vendors. As shown on Slide 9, Pertinent brings consolidation across SecOps, SASE and network security the 3 key growth drivers in our strategy. Organizations are recognizing that an integrated security solution with a single operating system is the best method to improve their security posture as this approach allows each security solution to share data and communicate with each other, reducing complexity and improving security effectiveness. Attending to piece together best-of-breed solutions from multiple vendors can result in slower AI-driven technology adoption, significant security gaps and a slower pace of identifying, reporting and resolving security incidents. Moving to guidance. we continue to see increased deal scrutiny and longer sales cycles which is constraining our near-term results. We expect these longer sales cycles to continue along with the associated budgetary scrutiny and our fourth quarter guidance takes us into consideration. As a reminder, our fourth quarter and full year outlook which are summarized on Slides 20 and 21, is subject to the disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. In the fourth quarter, we expect billings in the range of $1.560 billion to $1.700 billion which at the midpoint represents a decline of 5%. Revenue in the range of $1.380 billion to $1.440 billion which at the midpoint represents growth of 10%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75.5% to 76.5%; non-GAAP operating margin of 27.5% to 28.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.42 to $0.44 which assumes a share count of between 780 million to 790 million; capital expenditures of $40 million to $60 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of 17%. And cash taxes, as I mentioned, are $345 million [ph]. For the full year, we expect billings in the range of $6.095 billion to $6.235 billion which at the midpoint represents growth of 10%. The Revenue in the range of $5.270 billion to $5.330 billion which is the midpoint represents growth of 20%. Service revenue range of $3.355 billion to $3.375 billion which at the midpoint represents a growth of 28%. The service revenue guidance implies product revenue growth of 9%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 76% to 77% and non-GAAP operating margin of 26.5% to 27.5%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.54 to $1.56 which assumes a share count of between 790 million and 800 million. Capital expenditures of $220 million to $240 million; non-GAAP tax rate of 17% and cash taxes of $430 million. As we look forward to 2024 and transition from a period of elevated product growth, we can offer a few thoughts looking forward. In the near term, we will continue to focus on improving profitability. We expect product gross margins to be pressured in 2024. Nonetheless, we expect healthy operating margins that are 25% or greater. We expect to gradually increase billings growth through the year and approach double-digit growth by the second half of 2024, reflecting the progressively easier comps due to the easing of the headwind and from backlog draws in the first half of 2023 and the benefit of our SASE and SecOps focus. We expect contract term to remain below our high water marks of 2022. We Consistent with prior years, we expect that the timing of service revenue growth trends will lag product growth trends. Longer term, we remain confident in our solutions and our ability to adopt our strategy to shifts in the market. taking market share as we increase our investments in SASE and SecOps, ultimately returning to balanced growth and profitability. I look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters. And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A. Yes. Brian, great question, I should say. One of the slides that we added to the investor presentation for this earnings call actually maps out the what you can see is a cycle -- more cyclical nature of the business than maybe we've talked about in the past with product revenue. For example, in 2017, I think we had product revenue growth of 5% and that was somewhat of a low watermark. The market may have been due and I think there's some analyst studies out there from other members of Wall Street that have kind of suggested that the market was due for a little bit of a pause in firewalls. And I think we're seeing that now. And perhaps there was some delay of that pause because of supply chain issues and so forth, something that may have more naturally occurred in 2021 or in 2022. I think in terms of confidence, broadly, I think that was the intention of looking at the CAGRs and the success of the company that Canada has led the company through since its IPO and what those CAGRs are. And if you look at that combined with that new slide in the deck, you understand that there's going to be -- there has been the past been volatility in the industry and in the company. But over the longer stretch, you see some very attractive CAGRs in that. Yes. I think the service provider commentary has probably been reported by a number of other companies through this earnings cycle. I don't think that's -- the headline itself is not a surprise. I think the significance of the slowdown in the service provider, at least for what we saw in our business was a surprise, particularly because it's a worldwide service provider number, not just in the U.S. But as I also noted in the prepared comments, we saw weakness in both the U.S. and the Europe, European markets. and that applies to service provider and to the retail sector. I think the retail sector probably is perhaps a little bit more prone to some of the digestion of SD-WAN projects that are still working their way through and maybe that's a little bit different. As well as some of the economic headlines were probably a little bit disconcerting to the retail sector in the earlier part of the quarter. Yes, Tal, I'll maybe add to Ken's comments. I think you're correct in that, your interest that the vast majority of the time, our first sales to customers a firewall. It can be a virtual firewall or it could be a physical appliance. And really, that is the beachhead that then go sell these other security functions and products. I think what you're seeing is in part of the shift of strategy and we talk about making the investments in note SASE but also SecOps. It's really that SecOps product family like EDR and SIM and so as such, that you're seeing is doubling down on the investments there because while it's not the largest of the 3 market segments, it is the fastest growing. And I think we have the opportunity to participate in those markets more, particularly now that some of our products have reached a greater level of maturity. Yes. So you had a great point about whether you're talking about free cash flow, you're talking about operating margin. The company does very, very well on the bottom line. And the strategy has been to continue to reinvest that back robustly in both innovation in the form of R&D spending but also in go-to-market, whether that's marketing, whether that's selling. I think we're looking at right now with the sort of firewall market. Obviously, we're trying to bring new solutions to better solutions to our sellers to sell when the firewall is a little bit slower. But I do think it's a workout conversation and looking at the sales coverage, if you will. We've talked for several years about how many -- in North America, for example, how many accounts do we want per rep. We started with 65, I think, 4 or 5 years ago. We were talking about that. That number is now down to 10. And at 10, you're probably reaching a point of where you're -- on the enterprise side, you're probably reaching a pretty good coverage model for our business. You could probably go a little bit lower but that feels pretty good. I think there's another opportunity right now immediately in front of us in terms of how do we continue to support our channel partners, be they distributors or be they resellers and make sure that we're getting the right level of mind share from them. So I would suspect there will be some investments in that part of the business as we go forward. At the same time, I think there's some opportunities here and Ken's talked about it with us about how to be more efficient in how we're spending our money, whether that's in selling and marketing or back office functions or what have you. So -- we're not trying to guide to 2024 today, obviously but we did think that it was important to provide at least some early thoughts in terms of maybe a floor for what 2024 should look like for us on the bottom line. Yes. And I would just build on Ken's comment, Brad and all good and fair questions. It's not by accident. We're talking about SASE. If you go back and think about it a little bit, we've been talking about it and in a number of different ways, Ken has talked about the PoP strategy which now you see us accelerating that PoP strategy with the cloud providers to come to market more quickly. The Gartner Magic Quadrant, I think, of the catalyst for the single vendor strategy and having us in the challenger quadrant gives us the bonafides if you will, to have a lot of conversations. The single vendor strategy, that installed base that you referred to, we went back and looked over the last 2 quarters, we've done several hundred SASE deals already. And to be quite honest, that was without any real wood behind the arrow in terms of marketing support and sales support. It was really just how it grew. And it's interesting. I would have expected those first sales that would have been clearly dominated by SD-WAN. They were not SD-WAN customers. They were often times, there were just as many brand new customers coming to us for the SASE solution as they were SD-WAN customers or somewhere and at the third part of the pie were customers that are bars for other firewall use cases. So, I don't -- in the expectation that our -- we're going to be successful initially in the smaller part of the market. I don't think we disagree with that. When I look at that same mix of SASE customers, nearly 50% of those SASE customers that we signed already would be in the SMB space. And then, the remainder was kind of divided up between the larger enterprises and the mid-enterprise. So, I don't think we got here by accident. We maybe just not to talk about it publicly but I think we're well positioned now because of the investments that we've made in the data centers, the PoPs, the operating system like Gartner Magic Quadrant, the fact in a single vendor in the installed base. I think this is the right strategic shift for us to make at this point. To Ken's point, look, we were -- last quarter, we were talking about 20 PoPs because we're building them ourselves, right? Now you're talking about over 100 locations, well over 100 locations. So I think there's a go-to-market opportunity there that this brings to us. I think longer term -- and we know that one of our competitors, this is the approach they take and we have pretty good visibility, obviously, to what their margins are and their investments there. And there's another player in the space that's much more building their own PoPs, if you will. PoPs individually are not huge things, right? I mean they are single-digit number of racks that really have a PoP, I think. So I do believe you need some forward-stage data centers. And I think that's consistent with our strategy that we've talked about, about increasing more and more hosted delivery services and particularly in SecOps. So I think this is not something that we're going to surprise people with in terms of our CapEx spending. Yes. I think we included a comment in the -- in my prepared remarks that the available -- we still have -- as of the start of the month, start of the week, I guess, we had $980 million of available authorization for the buyback. And I think you saw some of the numbers that we provided in the prepared remarks about being fairly aggressive during the quarter itself as well in terms of buying back stock. Canada so let me go shopping for companies very often. So I'll defer to him in terms of his thoughts on that. Yes, it is related to the inventory levels. And I think we've been managing it for the better part of the second half of this year. And that's some of the commentary you're getting as we look into 2024 in terms of where the pressure may come from. Quantify, no. Let's try I'm following the math. Yes. I think that's prudent given what we've just seen in terms of the third quarter performance. Yes. And I wasn't quite sure if the question was about the Q4 guide or the 2024 commentary about numbers. Yes. I would say that, while we just deal with actually giving guidance for the fourth quarter, Absolutely. I think the assumed close rates, if you will, are dramatic. I think they're the lowest assumed close rates I've seen that I've used in over 5 years here for context. And they're obviously lower than what I saw in the -- what I used for the first half of the year. And I think that -- I would say there are indicators that the pipeline quality is better in the fourth quarter. But in given light of what we've done for the last 2 quarters, I don't think that should put much stock in that. So I'm content to just assume a much lower close rate than I have more recently. 2024 are not really giving guidance. I think that, again, we're talking about buildings here and I know we're all aware of it but really focus perhaps more on the impact of backlog and what it did to billings in Q1 of last year and Q2 of last year and how that eased throughout the year. So you're really going to see comps change I don't know that we're necessarily assuming a dramatic growth ramp of bookings, if you will, at this early stage for 2024. We do expect it's going to improve as we bring SASE online more successfully and secure operations. But I think it's really part of what you're hearing there is really getting clarity on how the backlog impacted 2023 numbers. Yes. The second one is probably easier. I don't -- we have such a large footprint right now in the firewall business that it's going to take a while for any significant changes in the SASE billings if you really think about it coming into and having an impact on our total term. I don't know that we gave the number but we know that we've come back to a more. We're coming down about a month year-over-year in terms of contract term in 2023 compared to 2022, we went from 28 months roughly last year to about 27 months this year. Maybe I could be off by a month. And you saw the impact in the financials. We've talked about that will one month impacts the billings number. I think it's going to take a while for SASE. As I mentioned, we've already done several under SASE deals. We expect to be more successful early on with 1 in SMB spaces and two, with our installed base. So I would imagine that but it's going to take a while to really have an impact on free cash flow."

Lastly, all references to growth there on a year-over-year basis unless noted otherwise. I will now turn the call over, Ken.\nKen Xie : Thanks, Peter. Thank you Were we weren't for joining today's call to review our second quarter 2023 results. Total revenue in the second quarter increased 26%, driven by strong revenue growth service, which 30% for the second consecutive quarter, with 34% growth in existing subscription and scription and non-FortiGate product row over 45%, which is nearly $2 billion annual run rate, building growth of 18%, leads to more normalized product revenue growth of 18%.  We believe our building performance reflect large enterprise concern with the macro environment in addition to some uniquely indigestion after two years of elevated 30%-plus product building growth during the supply chain shortage.  According to IDC's latest quarterly security tracker, in addition to having the number one unit in firewall category for 10 consecutive year with over 50% market share, Fortinet is now the market share leader in both unit and revenue. Based on the latest Westland Advisory on Security and Cybersecurity report, Fortinet was named but only ITOT network protection platform leader. We are currently one of the top and the fastest growing OT security vendor in the market that Westland Advisor expect to grow to $33 billion by 2030.  Including our success line with our broad integrated platform, our proprietary ASIC security processor, and our ability to converge network and security both on prem and in the cloud across a single fully OS operating system, to leverage these advantages and drive future growth in addition to our leading network security solution, we have increased our go-to-market investment in universal setting as demand IoT security, cloud security and security operations. And we were dedicated more resource to support hybrid infrastructure and hybrid world.  Today we are announced new FortiGate 90G, our first next generation firewall after [Indiscernible] with the new security process of flat FortiASIC, that delivers industry-leading security function, performance, stability and power efficiency and cost effective price.  The FortiGate manages the fully integrated with our FortiGuard AI-power security service, and has secure computing reaching up to 16 times greater than average of our competitors similar price model are using over 90% less power than competing solution.  We also announced two new SD-WAN service under the performance monitoring service to simplify operation and enhance digital experience as well overlay service to facilitate rapid deployment, redundancy and a seamless interconnection of location with for FortiSASE using SBA technology. This new SD-WAN service showcase our commitment to expanding our service leverage our leading installation base for additional future growth.  We see our single vendor SASE solution opening a large new market, and one where our sizable SD-WAN installed base can be leveraged as a significant market access point. Together with newly announced SD-WAN service, we plan to accelerate our global point of presence pop deployment, with a dual strategy of investing in our own pops as well as working with service providers.  Fortinet recently announced results of our IT-dependent analysis by Forrester, of the cost saving and benefits of the current FortiGate next gen firewall and FortiGuard AI powered secure surveys within enterprise datacenter, which include more than 300% return on investment over three years, pay back in six months and 90% reduction in time spent on manual updates.  In addition, an independent analysis by Enterprise Strategic Group established that the customer who deployed Fortinet Security operation solution, such as FortiEDRand for the FortiNDR reduce their time to detect and respond to incidents from an average of three weeks to one hour.  This demonstrates the substantial impact that artificial intelligence machine learning and the integration of a Fortinet Secure op fabric product that have operations ability to secure today's rapidly expanding attack surface.  Finally, new developments in AI such as generative engine show a lot of promise to various applications of the security. We believe AI technologies can help us significantly improve productivity, and can be scaled to a large customer base in areas such as malware detection, thread hunting, event correlation and automation, as well as safety network design and troubleshooting.  Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners and suppliers worldwide for the continuous support and power. Keith. \nKeith Jensen : Thank you, Ken. And good afternoon everyone. Let's start with the key highlights from the second quarter. Billings growth was 18% as well as product revenue growth, service revenue growth held firm at 30%, resulting in total revenue growth of 26%, OT and SD-WAN revenue continue to perform well as revenue from these products were up 60% and 40%, respectively.  In a sign of our strength in the small and midsized customer segments, we added a record 6,500 new logos. Operating margins of 26.9% exceeded the high end of the guidance range by 140 basis points. Free cash flow was strong at $438 million, representing a margin of 34%, benefiting from the deferral of certain cash tax payments to the fourth quarter.  Looking at buildings in more detail buildings of $1.54 billion were led by non-FortiGate billings over 30% growth, representing 34% of total billings. Non-FortiGate billings growth was driven by networking FortiGate VM, NAC [ph] and cloud. And as Ken mentioned, non-FortiGate is nearing a $2 billion annual revenue run-rate.  In terms of industry verticals, government and manufacturing topped the list as a percentage of total billings, with manufacturing up almost 50%, government and construction were up over 30%, while service provider and retail were up 1% and down 5% respectively. Retail was impacted by a very difficult compare, as the industry vertical nearly doubled in the year earlier period.  Billings growth vary by GIOS with international emerging leading, followed by Europe and the LatAm. APAC and to a lesser extent U.S. enterprise were challenged by difficult prior year comparisons. Deals over $1 million increased from 122 deals to 134 deals.  Turning to revenue and margins. Total revenue grew 26% to $1.29 billion, driven by non-FortiGate growth of over 45% and service revenue growth of 30%. This was the second consecutive quarter of greater than 30% service revenue growth.  Security subscriptions represent over 55% of all service revenue and continue to streak a strong increasing sequential quarterly growth dating back to Q1 of '22 of 23% to Q2 of '23 at 34%. Product revenue of $473 million increased 18%. Product lead times and backlogs are expected to approach normal levels in the third quarter.  Total gross margin of 77.9% was up 140 basis points driven by 160 basis point increase in product gross margin to 63.5%. Product gross margin has benefited from earlier pricing actions and easing cost pressures and were partially offset by certain inventory charges. Service revenues were 63% of total revenues and delivered gross margin of 86.2%. Higher service revenue, offset higher labor costs and increased cloud delivery costs, as we continue to expand our cloud SASE delivery models.  We see our single vendor SASE solution opening a large new market and one where our sizable SD-WAN install base can be leveraged as a significant market access point. We plan to accelerate our point of presence or POP deployment, with a dual strategy Ken mentioned investing in our own POPs, as well as working with third party providers to accelerate our deployment.  Operating income of $348 million, grew 36% outpacing revenue grew by more than 10 points as operating discipline resulted in significant operating leverage. Operating margins of 26.9% exceeded the high-end of the guidance range and was up 210 basis points due to the strong gross margin performance and operational efficiencies.  Earnings per share increased 58% to $0.38 per share, and also exceeded the high-end of the guidance.  Looking into the statement of cash flow summaries on Slide 7 and 8, free cash flow increased 55% to $438 million. The adjusted free cash flow, which excludes real estate investments was $498 million, representing it 38.5% adjusted free cash flow margin. Free cash flow benefited from the deferral of approximately $190 million in cash tax payments. As mentioned last quarter, these tax payments together with other deferred 2023 tax payments are due to be paid in the fourth quarter.  Capital expenditures were $77 million, including $59 million of real estate investments. Cash taxes on the quarter were $38 million. The board recently increased the company's share repurchase authorization by 500 million. And the total available share buyback authorization is now approximately $2 billion.  Now I'd like to share a few significant wins from the quarter that exemplifies the strength of our broad and integrated platform. First, a global pharmaceutical leader signed an eight-figure deal without Fortinet Cybersecurity Fabric, investing in our OT aware secure networking architecture, as well as our AI ops and threat intelligence solution.  Recognizing the market shift to a platform-based approach to security, this company selected Fortinet to secure its highly regulated and sensitive medical data that continues to drive global operational and financial efficiencies through our broad integrated and automated platform approach to cybersecurity.  In another deal, one of the largest U.S. school districts which had recently refreshed its datacenter firewalls to FortiGate was seeking to improve its network security posture with a NAC solution that offers better visibility to the devices connected to the network. Fortinet competed against multiple peers, and was able to win did a FortiNAC's ease of implementation, centralized management capability and superior risk remediation, as well as the tight integration to the district's existing Fortinet security fabric.  This high seven-figure deal was the largest NAC deal in Fortinet's history.  Finally, in the seven-figure displacement in our largest FortiSASE deal ever, a large bank on its digital transformation journey, who was searching for a single vendor SASE solution for its hybrid workforce. This selected our FortiSASE solution for over 5,000 users, as it integrates SD-WAN and SASE into a holistic solution and delivers comprehensive security, both from the cloud and on prem, while ensuring consistent security policies for all users regardless of their location, and wherever applications are being accessed. These transactions illustrate how Fortinet's platform strategy, integrated operating systems and proprietary ASIC technology continues to resonate with customers.  Given the heightened interest in AI technology, we could not do this call without discussing Fortinet's investment and innovations in AI. Fortinet has been at the forefront of AI and machine learning innovation for many years, leveraging deep learning and artificial neural networks to power our products and security services, enabling a faster, stronger and more accurate defense for our customers.  One of our first AI-powered use cases was the introduction of the virtual FortiGuard Threat Analyst. FortiGuard addresses threats in real time with machine learning, coordinated protection and is extensively used in malware detection and threat hunting. Every time the threat is identified, FortiGuard generates threat intelligence that automatically updates defense signatures across the fabric.  In cloud environments where scale and speed are critical, AI and machine learning can help security teams keep pace with threats on multiple fronts. All of this happens seamlessly and behind the scenes. Today, our platform Guest and Analyzer on average more than 100 billion events every day, to deliver over 1 billion security updates daily across the Fortinet security fabric and ecosystem.  While many of our competitors OEM their security from different security vendors. Our AI-driven FortiGuard threat intelligence has been built in house, which allows us to use AI across different sources. Adversaries increasingly are using AI in their playbooks to drive cyberattacks, which only increase the rapidly evolving cybersecurity threat landscape.  We continue to invest in AI and machine learning technologies across our products, including generative AI, natural language models, and other implementations to enhance, simplify and automate security for our customers.  Before moving to guidance, I'd like to offer some observations about the second quarter and about the industry. Regarding the second quarter, we believe macro and certainly impacted our billing performance to average contract duration, and in the second half of June, and the elevated level of enterprise deals pushing the future quarters.  We saw shorter contract duration, with the average term decreasing by 1.5 months to 28 months, creating a 4 to 5 point billings headwind year-over-year. Normalizing billings growth with a change in contract duration, yields billings growth in the low-20% range. Having some level of enterprise deals pushed to future quarters, it's not unusual. In Q2 '23 however, an unusually large volume of deals that we expected to close in June, instead push to future periods. From a market perspective, CIOs continue to prioritize and invest in securing their organizations in the face of rising cybersecurity threats. We see new regulatory requirements, such as the recently announced -- those recently announced by the SEC and the EU Cyber Resilience Act announced earlier this year. They will continue to provide market tailwinds as organizations further increase their cybersecurity investments to comply with new stringent cyber regulations.  The cybersecurity industry remains highly relevant as CIOs prioritize cyber spending within the overall IT budgets. As such, the longer term demand drivers for Fortinet net remained very solid.  That said, we do see a return to more normal seasonality for Fortinet in the back half of the year. That's tailwind such as the supply chain driven growth subsides. And we cycled prior period price increases.  Moving on to guidance. As a reminder, our third quarter full year outlook, which are summarized on Slides 11, and 12, are subject to the disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call.  For the third quarter we expect billings in the range of $1,560 million to $1,620 million which at the midpoint represents growth at 13% and is consistent with our quarter-over-quarter seasonality prior to the pandemic. Revenue in the range of $1,315 million to $1,375 million which at the midpoint represents growth of 17%.  Non-GAAP gross margin of 75.5% or 76.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 24.5% to 25.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.35 to $0.37. This assumes a share count of between $795 million and $805 million. Capital expenditures of $100 million to $130 million non-GAAP tax rate of 17% cash taxes of $25 million. And as previously mentioned, backlog is expected to approach normal levels in Q3.  For the full year, we expect billings in the range of $6,490 million to $6,590 million, which at the midpoint represents growth of 17% and apply slightly below normal seasonality in Q4. Revenue in the range of $5,350 million to $5,450 million, which at the midpoint represents growth of 22.3%. Service revenue in the range of $3,350 million to $3,410 million with the midpoint represents growth at 28.2%. The service revenues guidance implies product revenue growth at 13.5%.  Non-GAAP gross margin of 75.25% to 76.25%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 25.25% to 26.25%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.49 to $1.53, which assumes a share count of between $795 million and $805 million. Capital expenditures of $335 million to $385 million due to our continued cloud data center and facilities investments. Non-GAAP tax rate of 17%, cash taxes of $460 million with approximately $380 million in the fourth quarter.  We continue to execute our long-term strategy and remain confident in the strategy and our solutions. While it's a little early to be providing guidance for next year, we would expect our near term performance or represents a short term trough. Given our confidence in our solutions, our offerings -- and taking into account that growth comparisons will ease as we move through 2024 that this early stage we would expect billings growth to approach high-teens by the fourth quarter of 2024.  And with that, I'll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A session.\nPeter Salkowski : Thank you, Keith. Operator -- just one quick reminder before doing the Q&A, if you can please limit yourself to one question and one follow up question. Operator, you can open the call. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from [Indiscernible]. Your line is open. \nUnidentified Analyst: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Ken, I think you noted that -- and Keith commented to it as well, reflected -- I guess, the billings performance and guidance reflects enterprise concern about the macro. Could you give a little bit more color there on what you saw from a macro perspective?  And I think you pointed to a weak service provider business. I think investors might draw parallels to what they saw at Juniper last week on the carrier side. Maybe if you could include a few thoughts on how dynamics there may be similar or different with regard to what you see? And then I have a follow-up.\nKen Xie : Sure. I think for the carrier service provider, we do see they're probably a little bit behind on offer some surveys because the carrier service provider, if you look back 10-15 years ago, is our biggest market. It's like about 30% market share comes from the carrier service provider. But nowadays, security need additional service like some SASE, all these function -- function in the SASE, which service provider kind of behind, so we're still working with them and closely try to help them accelerate the service.  At the same time, we're also starting to invest a little bit more self, which also, like together with the new service we announced today, the two new SD-WAN service, we feel invest in certain infrastructure that will help in drive a lot of new service going forward in the security space, and also in helping service providers to kind of accelerate some of their security service beyond the traditional security service.\nKeith Jensen : Yes. I would probably add to Ken's comments, particularly as we talk about service providers and some of the other verticals and customer segments. And I think there are some lessons that we can see from, for example, manufacturing, which did extremely well in the quarter. They continue to have -- I feel they think they're under pressure in the threat environment, so you see them spending fairly richly. It's still a surprise,  If you look at the government sector which was strong also, they have governments in the -- they have budgets on the slowing economy that maybe some of the other industries don't. And at the other end of the spectrum, Ken talked about service provider, and people I think are aware of that story there more broadly. But also retail, I think retail is really a very clear indicator of a vertical that can be one of the first that is sometimes impacted by a slowing economy. But also, Ken made reference to this in his comments, this concept of digestion. A lot of purchasing around SD-WAN technologies and implementations.  A year ago, you saw very, very high growth a year ago. And now going through a digestion period, such as the point that it's actually negative growth in the retail vertical.\nKen Xie : We're also interested in some cloud provider also started getting in the security space, which also kind of confused some of the enterprise customer. So that's also sometimes they take a little more time to evaluate our different solutions. So we do believe this is a hybrid approach on-premise in the cloud that will be best for the customer, even the cloud probably much more expensive or cost an average about 3x to 5x more expensive compared to on-premise, but it's -- combined altogether probably will be the best solution for customers.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. That's helpful. And maybe a quick follow-up for Keith, I think you talked about a reinflection to high teens billings growth next year. How does performance this quarter and your outlook for the rest of the year impacted 2025, I guess, $10 billion billings target that you've previously thrown out there?\nKeith Jensen : Yeah. I think that as we go through the second half of the year and we enter into our normal planning cycle for 2024, I think that will be a logical output at that point in time to think through what we're seeing in terms of our 2025 targets. \nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you very much for your question. Our next question comes from Gabriela Borges with GS. Your line is open. \nGabriela Borges : Hi, good afternoon. Thank you. Keith, I want to say on the medium-term outlook, your comment on high-teens billings growth by 4Q '24, if I heard it right. Maybe just talk us through how you thought about derisking the six-month and the 18-month kind of outlook? And what are some of the leading indicators you are looking to determine when billings growth and product revenue will trough? Thank you. \nKeith Jensen : I don't know, Ken, if you want to talk about longer-term trends in the industry and now avoid [ph] guides for 2024, if you do that.\nKen Xie: Look back to like a -- certainly, yes, with the industry, network security still have a pretty good pace of growth, probably between 10% to 20% on average in the last like 30 years. And we feel we have a very unique, huge advantage solution, which we -- we only want to build our own ASIC. You can see the product we announced today, which has probably averaged about 10x better performance, more function compared to competitive solution and also much less energy consumption, probably like a 90% less energy consumption.  So that's where the new SP5 actually -- the first product announced actually is that we have a 14 application engine integrated the ASIC chip, probably more than double compared to the previous version. That's also helping drive the next few quarter growth, which each -- probably every quarter, we may plan to announce a new product, you can see 5. That's a huge advantage and then it also drives the long-term convergence of networking to network security, which can agreed by 2030, the network security will be larger than the traditional network in there. So that's what continue to network security side growth. On the other side, we also mentioned a few other areas. We see kind of the non-FortiGate part also growing pretty strong, so 45%. It's part of it because consolidation, part of because certain like security budget allocation to certain cloud spending can be allocated to some security. And the other part also, kind of like how to manage on different kind of vertical and also some inventory side. That's also we try to balance. We do believe things will be recovered in the later part of next year. And because -- the last two years, we see quite a strong product revenue growth, second quarter over 50%, which is not quite normal. But it's -- once we get more normal, so that will be pretty much return to the average in the last 20-30 years, which is about 10% to 20%.\nKeith Jensen : Yeah. And as I kind of take that commentary and pull it forward a little bit and say, Q3 and Q4, and I suspect I'll get a fair amount of chance -- opportunities to talk about the guidance setting process for Q3 and Q4. I guess I would start off by saying we've certainly seen over the last two or three years in various environments we've been in. You got to be pretty nimble in terms of your assumptions and what you're looking for. And with that in mind, I think I called out in the comments, you see the level of deals that pushed in the second part of June. It was a new development. We always have linearity of the deals closed to see the deals push. And I think 1 comment I would offer is that as you look -- as I look to the Q3 guidance setting and the roll-up, the assumptions for Q3 were to close rates and terms and things of that nature and push. I would say, look a lot more like the assumptions that we saw in actual results for Q2 than maybe what we saw with some higher rates, better rates earlier on. So I think there's some caution built into that, if you will. I think also if you kind of look at the results, where the guidance ends up, you can look at top line growth in Q3 versus Q2 that I think is in the low-single digit growth sequentially. And that's pretty much in the range of where we've seen Q2 to Q3 historically, and we would expect that again.  And then maybe just a little more caution in the fourth quarter where -- and again, I made a comment earlier that the seasonality assumption that falls out of the guidance for the full year and is applied to the fourth quarter actually suggests a lower level of growth in the fourth quarter than we've seen in other periods. Offering a certain degree of caution, number one, but also acknowledging that Q4 last year was a very strong quarter and pretty tough compare.\nKen Xie : Also, we do see some strong growth in the new area like SD-WAN OT, which grew 40% and 60%, total come on 25% of billings. And also the 5G growth not quite start yet, so we all have the best product for all these new solutions. So that's the additional growth, right, as we're keeping developing.\nGabriela Borges : That all makes sense. Thank you. And just to clarify, is it safe to assume that 4Q, or are you assuming that 4Q billings will be the trough for billings growth?\nKeith Jensen: Yeah. I'd have to go back and look at the actual compares because the compares start easy and I don't want to mix up bookings and billings in this conversation because the timing is a little bit different. But I think that the growth in billings in Q4 and Q1 of -- Q4 of last year and Q1 of this year were very, very strong.\nKen Xie : Also, you can refer to the finance presentation #10 page, which we go back to 13 years since we IPO-ed 13 years ago. So there's some kind of a growth, some kind of margin information.\nGabriela Borges : Yeah, I do like that Slide 10. Thank you for calling that out. Okay, thank you. \nKen Xie : Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you, very much. Our next question will come from Tal Liani with Bank of America. Your line is open. \nTal Liani : Yes. Thank you. I'm going to ask my two questions together, with your permission. The first one is Palo Alto is posting their quarterly call for Friday evening, which is always a bad sign historically for that quarter. And then you are reporting weaker than expected, although you were very positive last quarter. I remember the calls.  So does it mean that the environment deteriorated in the last three months? And if the environment deteriorated, what is the source for it? Meaning, is it the backlog drawdown issue that we were concerned with before? Or is it that customers are deciding not to buy, push out? I'm trying to understand the meaning of both you and Palo Alto, two successful companies kind of comments. The second question is, Keith, in your remarks, you said that projects were pushed out. But if it were pushed out, why do we see a deceleration -- continued deceleration into 3Q and 4Q? Because I can back out your 4Q guidance, and billings is declining from 18% to 13% to 11%. And if it was a push out, then we would have seen a recovery in the second half from pushouts from 2Q. So how do you connect your comments about pushouts versus cancellation to the numbers to the guidance? Thanks. \nKeith Jensen : Yeah. I'll go first, and then Ken can talk about what his friend down the street is doing or not doing, to his knowledge. As I kind of alluded to, I'm not -- yes, I had pushouts in the quarter. I'm happy with what I saw in terms of July on deals getting closed, but I've retained concept of continuing pushouts in Q3 and Q4. I'm not here to suggest that there's going to be a quarter recovery in that. I think that this is going to be -- take a little bit longer through this economy kind of normalizes and this digestion process goes on.  So I think it's really -- yes, picking up something in Q3 from Q2, but I'm also anticipating I'm going to see some things move from Q3 to Q4. And also the compares, if you go back and look at in Q3 and Q4 on the billings line, those are pretty attractive numbers that we put up in Q3 and Q4 of last year. What's he up to?\nKen Xie : I don't know why Palo Alto is like at Friday afternoon, which is probably -- I'm not one want to answer the question. But on the industry, we do see some company, especially large companies, to be more tight on the budget, and also kind of take a little bit long time to closing. It's not just that this quarter, basically pretty much starting early this year, there is some sign of that one.  How long will last? It's tough to say, but it's -- nearly the security is basically an underspend, then they probably will be starting to go back up after probably a few quarters. On the other side, if you see when the big environment starting kind of tough or tight, they tend to be more hand on the current product, current solution and then buy more service, which we also try to help new customers net whatever they have on hand to offer more service, like the SD-WAN service we announced today. So, let's see, the service revenue starting kind of doing well, leverage or kind of the last few years. The product revenue growth, which we already be the #1 in the product revenue in the whole network security space, which is over 28% market share, and also unit shipment is over 52% market share. So I think we'll continue to keep leading in the space and with new technology solutions, like the FortiGate 90G we announced today. But it's -- for us, more focused on long term. So we do believe the long-term convergence of network to network security, we feel we have the best technology product to meet that challenge. And at the same time, the short-term environment, we tend to be also see as an opportunity to keep gaining market share.\nTal Liani : Got it. It's -- can you talk about -- I know you don't provide backlog, but can you talk about the backlog trends and how much of what we're seeing last quarter, this quarter, next quarter is still supported by backlog versus the environment itself? We are all looking through this. The question is whether first half of '24, for example, we can get to single-digit growth instead of the double digits? You talk about the end of the year. So I'm not asking you for guidance for first half, but trying to understand how much of current trends are supported by backlog.\nKen Xie : Yeah, the backlogs are already back to normal now, back to that before the supply chain issue. And you can see last year towards the middle to the end, we already see the FortiGate. We already solved the issue. The majority of most of that will come from some network-related products. That's also been eased up in the first half of this year. Backlog kind of back to normal before the supply chain addition. And they do have certain cancellation. Ideally the cancellation, probably double digit?\nKeith Jensen : Yeah. I think Ken is giving you not the accounting answer on backlog numbers, but the CEO version that he's done worrying about it, and he knows the company can manage their way through it. From a numbers viewpoint, we still have some backlog that we -- that will pick up. Some low single-digit benefit in Q3. And then to Ken's point, we think that largely, as you get out of Q3, we'll have a -- we'll be back to very close to normal backlog numbers. \nTal Liani : Great. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you for your question. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrad Zelnick : Thanks very much for taking my questions. I want to ask one of Tal's questions maybe a little bit differently. A lot of what you shared suggests your market position remains strong, and we've always thought that the price performance advantage of your architecture should enable you to actually take share in a tougher environment.  I guess what many you're trying to figure out is if it's tough for Fortinet, does that implicitly mean it's tougher for others out there? And is there anything maybe you can share on competition, that would be helpful perhaps win rates or pricing dynamics that you're seeing in the market?\nKen Xie : I think we do have the best solution at special level of the ASIC chip. So the product revenue still grew by 18% compared to, I think, checkpoints of minus 12%, I believe, and some other vendors is low single digit so we still feel we're keeping gaining market share. On the other side, we also see some consolidation, so it's leverage our installation base. We see some of the other products that are kind of helping sell. But on the other side, probably two other kind of maybe timing-related issue when you can see the last two years on the product revenue growth, if we go on Page 3 or Page 4? [Indiscernible] finance statement here. Because you see, the product revenue growth is probably like 40%, 50% in some quarter, but over 30% in the last two years.  So I do believe some kind of inventory is being held by certain customers or some other partner or kind of service provider channel. And we're also kind of changing the policy, service grace period policy early this year, I think, in March or April. Which instead of give some of the channel like one year, they can enable service, we tighten that up to like 90 days, which can help in reduce the -- some inventory level in certain partner there. At the same time, we do announce the ISP side early this year, and today is the first product available based on the new ASIC SP5 which probably like four times, five times better performance and more application being accelerated, and at the same time, the same cost. And it's kind of -- I do believe certain partners, certain customer may be also waiting for some of the new products leverages technology, so that maybe also has certain kind of impact.\nKeith Jensen : Yeah. Brad, it was a great question and kind of follow on with Ken there. When I look at the win rates for, say, our top 3 competitors, right, they are in the firewall market, I'm not really seeing a change in the win rates, loss rates. They were quite consistent, maybe improved in one of the three cases that -- of the names that we know. I think that what -- what we don't know is how much is specific to us was that we had deals teed up for the last couple of weeks of the quarter that we're on a path to close and they did not close. So how -- the question comes is that something about the macro and the enterprises that are pushing out spending a little bit? Or is it some area that we need to reprove on in terms of how we go at our own internal inspection and forecasting and look at the detailed deals, right? We'll know more about that as time plays out.\nKen Xie : Yeah, the regional slowdown is more because of very strong growth when years ago, almost double, and now it's going to slow down. The carrier service provider is still not ramp up yet, so we do hope they will ramp up soon.\nBrad Zelnick : Thanks for the color, Ken. And just my follow-up, Keith. As we think about pricing, which has been a tailwind across the whole market, I think, given supply constraints over the last couple of years. Can you give us any update of what the trends are now as supply eases? And what's embedded in your your assumptions for your guide on billings for this year and next?\nKeith Jensen : Yeah. I think that what we look at -- go back our approach we've had for many years when we introduced a new product, and you heard about the 90G today. Our starting point is even though it has superior functionality capacity throughput, et cetera, is we generally price that along the lines of its predecessor. I think one thing that we're seeing as we move into the second half of this year, some opportunities to take, maybe some targeted pricing actions around use cases. For example, maybe if you get really far down the low end of the market where you're dealing with some low-cost franchisee models, maybe we would take some opportunities there to perhaps offer some incentives to our channel partners and such to participate in that market.  So I think the margins are obviously very, very strong on the product side, and we have that benefit there. So I do think it gives us the opportunity to make certain investments in the second half of this year, whether you want to call it price less or discounts or rebates or incentives to the channel partners.\nBrad Zelnick : Thank you, very helpful.\nOperator: Thank you for your call. Our next question is from Eunji Song with Morgan Stanley.\nEunji Song : Hi. Thank you, guys so much for taking my question today. In terms of cancellation rates, could you guys give us any directional color on backlog cancellation rates? And what's assumed in your guidance by year-end? And I have a follow-up after.\nKeith Jensen : Last quarter, I think cancellation maybe we said was high single digits? This quarter, we say it's low, low double digits, right? And as backlog continues to subside as Ken pointed out a moment ago, it's not really going to make that much of a difference whether that cancellation rate goes from low double digits to mid-teens or something, or even 20.\nEunji Song : Got it. Thank you. And just as a follow-up, what percentage of revenue came from SD-WAN and OT security this quarter?\nKen Xie : We see together over 25%, pretty similar to last few quarters, but also growing pretty strong, 40% SD-WAN, 60% OT.\nPeter Salkowski : We have over 25% of the bookings number. I don't think we've given a revenue number for that. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Saket Kalia -- excuse me, from Barclays.\nSaket Kalia : Okay. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions, here. Ken, maybe just to double-click on the competitive question a little bit, but zero in on one segment. I'm wondering how you're seeing SASE vendors in this market? Meaning, do you feel like the -- maybe backing up. Keith, very helpful comment just on how the competitive win rates trend versus the other traditional network security providers. But when you look at SASE, do you feel like the growing prevalence of SASE is impacting firewall appliance decisions at all?\nKen Xie : I think it's a little bit different market. Somehow the service provider, the traditional telecom service provider or the service provider, we are a little bit behind in the last five to 10 years. So that gave the SASE provided opportunity to offer the service. But I do believe a lot of the telecom service provider, cloud provider, they have a huge advantage on infrastructure and the cost advantage to offer some additional security service, so which we're also working closely with them. And at the same time, we also invest some of our own kind infrastructure because also, a lot of our additional service beyond SASE like the SD-WAN, the other FortiGuard, [Indiscernible] and FortiCare service also need some of the infrastructure, which we're making more profit model, cost-efficient model. Compared to some other SASE providers, they have to whether lease or whatever, which tend to -- would like double, triple the cost compared to the similar service owning the infrastructure.  But it's the new service offered by the SASE provider. We do see mid sort of enterprise need, which we also started to invest more in this area.\nSaket Kalia : Got it. Got it. Keith, maybe for you for my follow-up. Very helpful commentary just on the billings duration in the quarter. I think that definitely helps bridge the gap with at least the guide on billings in Q2. But maybe looking forward, how are you thinking about billings duration for the second half of this year? And I don't know, is there a way to kind of do the same exercise, like what would billings have been if the duration would have been in line with your original plan?\nKeith Jensen : I mean, the spreadsheet for the second part of that question Saket. So I will come back ---\nSaket Kalia : No, no problem. We can take it offline.\nKeith Jensen : No, that's fine. I think there's been conversation over the last, say, three or four quarters about would duration slow down. And we commented that we had seen some slowdown in duration. Not 1 month a quarter, but it would kind of bounce around a little bit.  The point I'm making is when you're measuring year-over-year growth, we lost 1.5 points of duration, which works out to be about 4 or 5 points growth. So when you're making the comparison on a growth basis, it really is a factor there.  And then if you want to get in the SASE part of it, remember, that product is not impacted by duration, only services are, so you get a partial impact. I think if you're looking forward, as I made the point, as we look at Q3 and Q4, the duration assumption that, I would say, is in that pool of things that I looked at what we saw in Q2 in terms of actual results and how those -- some of those metrics and assumptions that go into the guidance setting process differed from what I've been saying for the prior few quarters and place a very heavy reliance on what I saw in Q2, whether that deal's a push or whether a term or a bucket of other things. So without going into specifics, I would probably answer that question that way.\nSaket Kalia : Very helpful.\nKen Xie : Yeah, some additional point of SASE is very -- especially a lot of companies starting return to work, return to office. So we do see a lot of like, call it, universal SASE, which is supporting both on-premise in the office and also work from home because if you back in office, forward all of office traffic to the part of SASE provided and the process, then back to the office not make much sense.  And at the same time, we see a lot of leverage or SD-WAN leadership there. We do see a lot of required the single vendor SASE. And also some bigger company also, they try to do the call the private SASE solution. So instead of process SASE traffic in the service provider part, they want to own process in their own kind of datacenter infrastructure, which also we do believe will be a big potential market going forward. \nSaket Kalia : Thanks, guys. Thank you. \nKen Xie : Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Shaul Eyal with TD Cowen. Your line is open. \nShaul Eyal : Thank you for taking the question. Good afternoon. Keith or Ken, can you maybe talk about the performance that you've seen with your go-to-market as it relates to your top sellers? Was there anything non-balance this quarter?\nKeith Jensen : I'm not quite sure -- are you looking for the distribution of salespeople hitting quota? Or -- I'm not sure I follow the question you're try to get at, Shaul.\nShaul Eyal : So actually, I'm looking for your value-added resellers, your notable ones, the biggest one, and whether performance was even or balanced or not, during the quarter?\nKeith Jensen : I don't have that data handy, to be honest with you. \nKen Xie : Yeah, we do see some release from exclusive network, which probably one of biggest picture also. We also want their biggest distributor, probably 30% business top on, but they're a little bit more ---\nKeith Jensen : Sorry, resellers I'm sorry. I don't know. You're answering the right question. [Indiscernible] distributors, yeah.\nKen Xie : Yeah, I think it's a similar common, as we are seeing.\nKeith Jensen : Yeah. I don't think that -- of our business, if you will, shifted at all significantly. We look at our top three and our top six distributors, we're fairly concentrated in that regard. That mix doesn't really change all that much, maybe point or 2 in the quarter. That wasn't something that we saw that's just out there at us.\nKen Xie : Yeah. Also, even go back to the history also going forward, also pretty similar kind of a forecast, I believe.\nKeith Jensen : Yes.\nShaul Eyal : Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Joseph Gallo with Jefferies. Your line is open. \nJoseph Gallo : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Given the breadth of your platform, you have a better vantage point than most. When you talk to CISOs, where is the relative health in the cyber budgets? And where are you seeing the most resistance?  And then given your optimistic comments on '24, what lends confidence that this is only a one to two quarter digestion period? Is there any historical context to support that?\nKeith Jensen : In terms of CISO spending, obviously, there's -- the things that were getting media attention out there now, I suspect that we sit down with a CISO that we talking about it. Whether that's SASE or something with some of the AI technologies, what have you.  But I don't think that CISOs and CIOs get away from having to take care of -- tending their knitting, if you will, with their infrastructure. There are obviously to be new use cases for firewalls. Opportunities, if you will. There's use cases still exists on-prem that need to be secured. There's new cases in the cloud, the Edge, et cetera. I think it's a very difficult career position to be at CISO right now with the budgets and threats that are after them. As it relates to 2024, I think whenever -- pardon me, 2024, we'll go through our planning cycle more religiously as we do the second half of the year. I think the point that Ken and I were making is really, as we move back to a more normal buying pattern after we move through the supply chain in the pandemic and so forth, that's what the industry has been historically and we would have every expectation that we'd be able to get back in that sweet spot, if you will.  And I would also note that as the -- it's not a static comparison. And by that, I mean the compares get easier in every quarter as you go through 2024.\nKen Xie : The CISO, we talk to this to have a certain shortage of people they can leverage to supporting the work for home or hybrid work environment, and so that's why they tend to a little bit more try to use in certain service kind of approach. On the other side, we do see the need to make sure that the new infrastructure, whether supporting back to office or supporting like we call it universal SASE versus the T&A [ph] environment, because there's like so many tech service starting kind of this impact and process new area like OT security. That's kind of -- but also certain security budget, they also because some companies, they commit certain cloud spending. Sometimes that is not commit spending for certain security, we also see some of that case. So that's what's happening.  So that's where we also kind of keeping ahead and helping the situation which is also -- most of the CISO fuel help supporting the operation is a pretty big to help -- help them to solve the issue there. And also leverage some kind of AI, some new technology and also kind of more broadly deployed network security inside the infrastructure. It's also supporting hybrid work environment. It's also quite a high priority for them.\nJoseph Gallo : Thanks. That's very helpful. And then, I guess, as we work through this digestion period, how should we think about investments in hiring? You've outperformed in the first half on profit, but your guide doesn't necessarily reflect a continuation of that. Where should we think of the incremental investments from here and the classic growth versus profit debate as billings moderate? Thanks \nKen Xie : We're still hiring and -- but also, the high probably will be a little bit behind on the top-line growth. Make sure we're keeping the -- improving the productivity efficiency. But also, we probably will also try to enhance certain hygiene process, which we kind of not quite do in the last two-three years during the pandemic, which certain low performance. We probably need to be kind of more disciplined through -- to have certain performance review of kind of participant.\nKeith Jensen : Yeah. I would use that to kind of come back to, I think, Shaul's question and make a couple of points. I think that as Ken kind of pointed out, we've had a lot of salespeople. We certainly have sales capacity to deliver on the numbers. At the same time, I think we've been very faithful to -- when we talk about 25% operating margin, and you see us continually coming in above that. So we have the opportunity there to invest more. And on that note, I think that the conversations with the channel partners, the distributors that we're having, I think they're much more informative, detailed at the right levels now than they were two years ago. There's a lot more cooperation information sharing with the distributors.  And I think a byproduct of that is I think there's some opportunities for us maybe to invest in our channel partners in a variety of different ways as we go through this next 12 to -- probably six to 12 months.\nKen Xie : Yeah. I kind of keeping refer to the Page 10. The last 13 years, the gross margin. So that's where we have the margin, and we've been GAAP profit of the three years since IPO. So if we need to invest in the growth, we definitely have the margin to do that. But on the other side, we also want to keep a healthy, healthy model and take care both on the growth and margin.\nJoseph Gallo : Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski with Wells Fargo. Mr. Nowiski, your line is open. \nAndrew Nowinski : Thank you. I want to ask about the geographic demand trends. So you saw -- I think you saw strength in international regions in Europe. I was just wondering how sustainable do you think that demand is in those regions? Or are they just maybe one to two quarters behind the U.S. in terms of seeing the impact from the macro?\nKeith Jensen : Yeah. I think that we have a competitive advantage when you look at Europe and parts of the international emerging, where we are oftentimes viewed as being the incumbent to have number one market share. So in an environment in which maybe the IT budgets start to suffer more in Europe than they do in the U.S., which is not what we're seeing currently, right? Currently, we're seeing the IT budgets are lower in the U.S. than they are in Europe based on some recent surveys.  I think we're better prepared to work our way through that in Europe because of our dominant position in that market.\nAndrew Nowinski : Okay. Got it. And then I think you talked about seeing strength in the SMB segment, adding about 6,500 new logos. I guess I was wondering, as it relates to your universal SASE solution, can you just talk about maybe how you're competing against, if at all, against Microsoft's new Entra solutions that are targeting that market?\nKen Xie : Yeah, we kind of more leverage our huge installation base and also the technology, the product, which address the network security. Microsoft definitely have some good customer base in the enterprise side. But on the network security, which is addressed more beyond the sort of enterprise, definitely, we have some advantage there. And also we're not seeing Microsoft have any solution to address network security area. So we do believe there's an opportunity for both companies. \nAndrew Nowinski : Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Peter Salkowski for closing remarks.\nPeter Salkowski : Thank you, Trace. I'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call. Fortinet will be attending investor conferences hosted by Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Oppenheimer, Rosenblat and Stifel during the third quarter. Fireside chat webcast links will be posted in the Events and Presentations section of Fortinet's Investor Relations website. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to contact me. Have a good rest of your day. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ken Xie",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter. Thank you Were we weren't for joining today's call to review our second quarter 2023 results. Total revenue in the second quarter increased 26%, driven by strong revenue growth service, which 30% for the second consecutive quarter, with 34% growth in existing subscription and scription and non-FortiGate product row over 45%, which is nearly $2 billion annual run rate, building growth of 18%, leads to more normalized product revenue growth of 18%.  We believe our building performance reflect large enterprise concern with the macro environment in addition to some uniquely indigestion after two years of elevated 30%-plus product building growth during the supply chain shortage.  According to IDC's latest quarterly security tracker, in addition to having the number one unit in firewall category for 10 consecutive year with over 50% market share, Fortinet is now the market share leader in both unit and revenue. Based on the latest Westland Advisory on Security and Cybersecurity report, Fortinet was named but only ITOT network protection platform leader. We are currently one of the top and the fastest growing OT security vendor in the market that Westland Advisor expect to grow to $33 billion by 2030.  Including our success line with our broad integrated platform, our proprietary ASIC security processor, and our ability to converge network and security both on prem and in the cloud across a single fully OS operating system, to leverage these advantages and drive future growth in addition to our leading network security solution, we have increased our go-to-market investment in universal setting as demand IoT security, cloud security and security operations. And we were dedicated more resource to support hybrid infrastructure and hybrid world.  Today we are announced new FortiGate 90G, our first next generation firewall after [Indiscernible] with the new security process of flat FortiASIC, that delivers industry-leading security function, performance, stability and power efficiency and cost effective price.  The FortiGate manages the fully integrated with our FortiGuard AI-power security service, and has secure computing reaching up to 16 times greater than average of our competitors similar price model are using over 90% less power than competing solution.  We also announced two new SD-WAN service under the performance monitoring service to simplify operation and enhance digital experience as well overlay service to facilitate rapid deployment, redundancy and a seamless interconnection of location with for FortiSASE using SBA technology. This new SD-WAN service showcase our commitment to expanding our service leverage our leading installation base for additional future growth.  We see our single vendor SASE solution opening a large new market, and one where our sizable SD-WAN installed base can be leveraged as a significant market access point. Together with newly announced SD-WAN service, we plan to accelerate our global point of presence pop deployment, with a dual strategy of investing in our own pops as well as working with service providers.  Fortinet recently announced results of our IT-dependent analysis by Forrester, of the cost saving and benefits of the current FortiGate next gen firewall and FortiGuard AI powered secure surveys within enterprise datacenter, which include more than 300% return on investment over three years, pay back in six months and 90% reduction in time spent on manual updates.  In addition, an independent analysis by Enterprise Strategic Group established that the customer who deployed Fortinet Security operation solution, such as FortiEDRand for the FortiNDR reduce their time to detect and respond to incidents from an average of three weeks to one hour.  This demonstrates the substantial impact that artificial intelligence machine learning and the integration of a Fortinet Secure op fabric product that have operations ability to secure today's rapidly expanding attack surface.  Finally, new developments in AI such as generative engine show a lot of promise to various applications of the security. We believe AI technologies can help us significantly improve productivity, and can be scaled to a large customer base in areas such as malware detection, thread hunting, event correlation and automation, as well as safety network design and troubleshooting.  Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners and suppliers worldwide for the continuous support and power. Keith. Sure. I think for the carrier service provider, we do see they're probably a little bit behind on offer some surveys because the carrier service provider, if you look back 10-15 years ago, is our biggest market. It's like about 30% market share comes from the carrier service provider. But nowadays, security need additional service like some SASE, all these function -- function in the SASE, which service provider kind of behind, so we're still working with them and closely try to help them accelerate the service.  At the same time, we're also starting to invest a little bit more self, which also, like together with the new service we announced today, the two new SD-WAN service, we feel invest in certain infrastructure that will help in drive a lot of new service going forward in the security space, and also in helping service providers to kind of accelerate some of their security service beyond the traditional security service. We're also interested in some cloud provider also started getting in the security space, which also kind of confused some of the enterprise customer. So that's also sometimes they take a little more time to evaluate our different solutions. So we do believe this is a hybrid approach on-premise in the cloud that will be best for the customer, even the cloud probably much more expensive or cost an average about 3x to 5x more expensive compared to on-premise, but it's -- combined altogether probably will be the best solution for customers. Look back to like a -- certainly, yes, with the industry, network security still have a pretty good pace of growth, probably between 10% to 20% on average in the last like 30 years. And we feel we have a very unique, huge advantage solution, which we -- we only want to build our own ASIC. You can see the product we announced today, which has probably averaged about 10x better performance, more function compared to competitive solution and also much less energy consumption, probably like a 90% less energy consumption.  So that's where the new SP5 actually -- the first product announced actually is that we have a 14 application engine integrated the ASIC chip, probably more than double compared to the previous version. That's also helping drive the next few quarter growth, which each -- probably every quarter, we may plan to announce a new product, you can see 5. That's a huge advantage and then it also drives the long-term convergence of networking to network security, which can agreed by 2030, the network security will be larger than the traditional network in there. So that's what continue to network security side growth. On the other side, we also mentioned a few other areas. We see kind of the non-FortiGate part also growing pretty strong, so 45%. It's part of it because consolidation, part of because certain like security budget allocation to certain cloud spending can be allocated to some security. And the other part also, kind of like how to manage on different kind of vertical and also some inventory side. That's also we try to balance. We do believe things will be recovered in the later part of next year. And because -- the last two years, we see quite a strong product revenue growth, second quarter over 50%, which is not quite normal. But it's -- once we get more normal, so that will be pretty much return to the average in the last 20-30 years, which is about 10% to 20%. Also, we do see some strong growth in the new area like SD-WAN OT, which grew 40% and 60%, total come on 25% of billings. And also the 5G growth not quite start yet, so we all have the best product for all these new solutions. So that's the additional growth, right, as we're keeping developing. Also, you can refer to the finance presentation #10 page, which we go back to 13 years since we IPO-ed 13 years ago. So there's some kind of a growth, some kind of margin information. Thank you. I don't know why Palo Alto is like at Friday afternoon, which is probably -- I'm not one want to answer the question. But on the industry, we do see some company, especially large companies, to be more tight on the budget, and also kind of take a little bit long time to closing. It's not just that this quarter, basically pretty much starting early this year, there is some sign of that one.  How long will last? It's tough to say, but it's -- nearly the security is basically an underspend, then they probably will be starting to go back up after probably a few quarters. On the other side, if you see when the big environment starting kind of tough or tight, they tend to be more hand on the current product, current solution and then buy more service, which we also try to help new customers net whatever they have on hand to offer more service, like the SD-WAN service we announced today. So, let's see, the service revenue starting kind of doing well, leverage or kind of the last few years. The product revenue growth, which we already be the #1 in the product revenue in the whole network security space, which is over 28% market share, and also unit shipment is over 52% market share. So I think we'll continue to keep leading in the space and with new technology solutions, like the FortiGate 90G we announced today. But it's -- for us, more focused on long term. So we do believe the long-term convergence of network to network security, we feel we have the best technology product to meet that challenge. And at the same time, the short-term environment, we tend to be also see as an opportunity to keep gaining market share. Yeah, the backlogs are already back to normal now, back to that before the supply chain issue. And you can see last year towards the middle to the end, we already see the FortiGate. We already solved the issue. The majority of most of that will come from some network-related products. That's also been eased up in the first half of this year. Backlog kind of back to normal before the supply chain addition. And they do have certain cancellation. Ideally the cancellation, probably double digit? I think we do have the best solution at special level of the ASIC chip. So the product revenue still grew by 18% compared to, I think, checkpoints of minus 12%, I believe, and some other vendors is low single digit so we still feel we're keeping gaining market share. On the other side, we also see some consolidation, so it's leverage our installation base. We see some of the other products that are kind of helping sell. But on the other side, probably two other kind of maybe timing-related issue when you can see the last two years on the product revenue growth, if we go on Page 3 or Page 4? [Indiscernible] finance statement here. Because you see, the product revenue growth is probably like 40%, 50% in some quarter, but over 30% in the last two years.  So I do believe some kind of inventory is being held by certain customers or some other partner or kind of service provider channel. And we're also kind of changing the policy, service grace period policy early this year, I think, in March or April. Which instead of give some of the channel like one year, they can enable service, we tighten that up to like 90 days, which can help in reduce the -- some inventory level in certain partner there. At the same time, we do announce the ISP side early this year, and today is the first product available based on the new ASIC SP5 which probably like four times, five times better performance and more application being accelerated, and at the same time, the same cost. And it's kind of -- I do believe certain partners, certain customer may be also waiting for some of the new products leverages technology, so that maybe also has certain kind of impact. Yeah, the regional slowdown is more because of very strong growth when years ago, almost double, and now it's going to slow down. The carrier service provider is still not ramp up yet, so we do hope they will ramp up soon. We see together over 25%, pretty similar to last few quarters, but also growing pretty strong, 40% SD-WAN, 60% OT. I think it's a little bit different market. Somehow the service provider, the traditional telecom service provider or the service provider, we are a little bit behind in the last five to 10 years. So that gave the SASE provided opportunity to offer the service. But I do believe a lot of the telecom service provider, cloud provider, they have a huge advantage on infrastructure and the cost advantage to offer some additional security service, so which we're also working closely with them. And at the same time, we also invest some of our own kind infrastructure because also, a lot of our additional service beyond SASE like the SD-WAN, the other FortiGuard, [Indiscernible] and FortiCare service also need some of the infrastructure, which we're making more profit model, cost-efficient model. Compared to some other SASE providers, they have to whether lease or whatever, which tend to -- would like double, triple the cost compared to the similar service owning the infrastructure.  But it's the new service offered by the SASE provider. We do see mid sort of enterprise need, which we also started to invest more in this area. Yeah, some additional point of SASE is very -- especially a lot of companies starting return to work, return to office. So we do see a lot of like, call it, universal SASE, which is supporting both on-premise in the office and also work from home because if you back in office, forward all of office traffic to the part of SASE provided and the process, then back to the office not make much sense.  And at the same time, we see a lot of leverage or SD-WAN leadership there. We do see a lot of required the single vendor SASE. And also some bigger company also, they try to do the call the private SASE solution. So instead of process SASE traffic in the service provider part, they want to own process in their own kind of datacenter infrastructure, which also we do believe will be a big potential market going forward. Thank you. Yeah, we do see some release from exclusive network, which probably one of biggest picture also. We also want their biggest distributor, probably 30% business top on, but they're a little bit more --- Yeah, I think it's a similar common, as we are seeing. Yeah. Also, even go back to the history also going forward, also pretty similar kind of a forecast, I believe. The CISO, we talk to this to have a certain shortage of people they can leverage to supporting the work for home or hybrid work environment, and so that's why they tend to a little bit more try to use in certain service kind of approach. On the other side, we do see the need to make sure that the new infrastructure, whether supporting back to office or supporting like we call it universal SASE versus the T&A [ph] environment, because there's like so many tech service starting kind of this impact and process new area like OT security. That's kind of -- but also certain security budget, they also because some companies, they commit certain cloud spending. Sometimes that is not commit spending for certain security, we also see some of that case. So that's what's happening.  So that's where we also kind of keeping ahead and helping the situation which is also -- most of the CISO fuel help supporting the operation is a pretty big to help -- help them to solve the issue there. And also leverage some kind of AI, some new technology and also kind of more broadly deployed network security inside the infrastructure. It's also supporting hybrid work environment. It's also quite a high priority for them. We're still hiring and -- but also, the high probably will be a little bit behind on the top-line growth. Make sure we're keeping the -- improving the productivity efficiency. But also, we probably will also try to enhance certain hygiene process, which we kind of not quite do in the last two-three years during the pandemic, which certain low performance. We probably need to be kind of more disciplined through -- to have certain performance review of kind of participant. Yeah. I kind of keeping refer to the Page 10. The last 13 years, the gross margin. So that's where we have the margin, and we've been GAAP profit of the three years since IPO. So if we need to invest in the growth, we definitely have the margin to do that. But on the other side, we also want to keep a healthy, healthy model and take care both on the growth and margin. Yeah, we kind of more leverage our huge installation base and also the technology, the product, which address the network security. Microsoft definitely have some good customer base in the enterprise side. But on the network security, which is addressed more beyond the sort of enterprise, definitely, we have some advantage there. And also we're not seeing Microsoft have any solution to address network security area. So we do believe there's an opportunity for both companies."

            "content": "Thank you, Ken. And good afternoon everyone. Let's start with the key highlights from the second quarter. Billings growth was 18% as well as product revenue growth, service revenue growth held firm at 30%, resulting in total revenue growth of 26%, OT and SD-WAN revenue continue to perform well as revenue from these products were up 60% and 40%, respectively.  In a sign of our strength in the small and midsized customer segments, we added a record 6,500 new logos. Operating margins of 26.9% exceeded the high end of the guidance range by 140 basis points. Free cash flow was strong at $438 million, representing a margin of 34%, benefiting from the deferral of certain cash tax payments to the fourth quarter.  Looking at buildings in more detail buildings of $1.54 billion were led by non-FortiGate billings over 30% growth, representing 34% of total billings. Non-FortiGate billings growth was driven by networking FortiGate VM, NAC [ph] and cloud. And as Ken mentioned, non-FortiGate is nearing a $2 billion annual revenue run-rate.  In terms of industry verticals, government and manufacturing topped the list as a percentage of total billings, with manufacturing up almost 50%, government and construction were up over 30%, while service provider and retail were up 1% and down 5% respectively. Retail was impacted by a very difficult compare, as the industry vertical nearly doubled in the year earlier period.  Billings growth vary by GIOS with international emerging leading, followed by Europe and the LatAm. APAC and to a lesser extent U.S. enterprise were challenged by difficult prior year comparisons. Deals over $1 million increased from 122 deals to 134 deals.  Turning to revenue and margins. Total revenue grew 26% to $1.29 billion, driven by non-FortiGate growth of over 45% and service revenue growth of 30%. This was the second consecutive quarter of greater than 30% service revenue growth.  Security subscriptions represent over 55% of all service revenue and continue to streak a strong increasing sequential quarterly growth dating back to Q1 of '22 of 23% to Q2 of '23 at 34%. Product revenue of $473 million increased 18%. Product lead times and backlogs are expected to approach normal levels in the third quarter.  Total gross margin of 77.9% was up 140 basis points driven by 160 basis point increase in product gross margin to 63.5%. Product gross margin has benefited from earlier pricing actions and easing cost pressures and were partially offset by certain inventory charges. Service revenues were 63% of total revenues and delivered gross margin of 86.2%. Higher service revenue, offset higher labor costs and increased cloud delivery costs, as we continue to expand our cloud SASE delivery models.  We see our single vendor SASE solution opening a large new market and one where our sizable SD-WAN install base can be leveraged as a significant market access point. We plan to accelerate our point of presence or POP deployment, with a dual strategy Ken mentioned investing in our own POPs, as well as working with third party providers to accelerate our deployment.  Operating income of $348 million, grew 36% outpacing revenue grew by more than 10 points as operating discipline resulted in significant operating leverage. Operating margins of 26.9% exceeded the high-end of the guidance range and was up 210 basis points due to the strong gross margin performance and operational efficiencies.  Earnings per share increased 58% to $0.38 per share, and also exceeded the high-end of the guidance.  Looking into the statement of cash flow summaries on Slide 7 and 8, free cash flow increased 55% to $438 million. The adjusted free cash flow, which excludes real estate investments was $498 million, representing it 38.5% adjusted free cash flow margin. Free cash flow benefited from the deferral of approximately $190 million in cash tax payments. As mentioned last quarter, these tax payments together with other deferred 2023 tax payments are due to be paid in the fourth quarter.  Capital expenditures were $77 million, including $59 million of real estate investments. Cash taxes on the quarter were $38 million. The board recently increased the company's share repurchase authorization by 500 million. And the total available share buyback authorization is now approximately $2 billion.  Now I'd like to share a few significant wins from the quarter that exemplifies the strength of our broad and integrated platform. First, a global pharmaceutical leader signed an eight-figure deal without Fortinet Cybersecurity Fabric, investing in our OT aware secure networking architecture, as well as our AI ops and threat intelligence solution.  Recognizing the market shift to a platform-based approach to security, this company selected Fortinet to secure its highly regulated and sensitive medical data that continues to drive global operational and financial efficiencies through our broad integrated and automated platform approach to cybersecurity.  In another deal, one of the largest U.S. school districts which had recently refreshed its datacenter firewalls to FortiGate was seeking to improve its network security posture with a NAC solution that offers better visibility to the devices connected to the network. Fortinet competed against multiple peers, and was able to win did a FortiNAC's ease of implementation, centralized management capability and superior risk remediation, as well as the tight integration to the district's existing Fortinet security fabric.  This high seven-figure deal was the largest NAC deal in Fortinet's history.  Finally, in the seven-figure displacement in our largest FortiSASE deal ever, a large bank on its digital transformation journey, who was searching for a single vendor SASE solution for its hybrid workforce. This selected our FortiSASE solution for over 5,000 users, as it integrates SD-WAN and SASE into a holistic solution and delivers comprehensive security, both from the cloud and on prem, while ensuring consistent security policies for all users regardless of their location, and wherever applications are being accessed. These transactions illustrate how Fortinet's platform strategy, integrated operating systems and proprietary ASIC technology continues to resonate with customers.  Given the heightened interest in AI technology, we could not do this call without discussing Fortinet's investment and innovations in AI. Fortinet has been at the forefront of AI and machine learning innovation for many years, leveraging deep learning and artificial neural networks to power our products and security services, enabling a faster, stronger and more accurate defense for our customers.  One of our first AI-powered use cases was the introduction of the virtual FortiGuard Threat Analyst. FortiGuard addresses threats in real time with machine learning, coordinated protection and is extensively used in malware detection and threat hunting. Every time the threat is identified, FortiGuard generates threat intelligence that automatically updates defense signatures across the fabric.  In cloud environments where scale and speed are critical, AI and machine learning can help security teams keep pace with threats on multiple fronts. All of this happens seamlessly and behind the scenes. Today, our platform Guest and Analyzer on average more than 100 billion events every day, to deliver over 1 billion security updates daily across the Fortinet security fabric and ecosystem.  While many of our competitors OEM their security from different security vendors. Our AI-driven FortiGuard threat intelligence has been built in house, which allows us to use AI across different sources. Adversaries increasingly are using AI in their playbooks to drive cyberattacks, which only increase the rapidly evolving cybersecurity threat landscape.  We continue to invest in AI and machine learning technologies across our products, including generative AI, natural language models, and other implementations to enhance, simplify and automate security for our customers.  Before moving to guidance, I'd like to offer some observations about the second quarter and about the industry. Regarding the second quarter, we believe macro and certainly impacted our billing performance to average contract duration, and in the second half of June, and the elevated level of enterprise deals pushing the future quarters.  We saw shorter contract duration, with the average term decreasing by 1.5 months to 28 months, creating a 4 to 5 point billings headwind year-over-year. Normalizing billings growth with a change in contract duration, yields billings growth in the low-20% range. Having some level of enterprise deals pushed to future quarters, it's not unusual. In Q2 '23 however, an unusually large volume of deals that we expected to close in June, instead push to future periods. From a market perspective, CIOs continue to prioritize and invest in securing their organizations in the face of rising cybersecurity threats. We see new regulatory requirements, such as the recently announced -- those recently announced by the SEC and the EU Cyber Resilience Act announced earlier this year. They will continue to provide market tailwinds as organizations further increase their cybersecurity investments to comply with new stringent cyber regulations.  The cybersecurity industry remains highly relevant as CIOs prioritize cyber spending within the overall IT budgets. As such, the longer term demand drivers for Fortinet net remained very solid.  That said, we do see a return to more normal seasonality for Fortinet in the back half of the year. That's tailwind such as the supply chain driven growth subsides. And we cycled prior period price increases.  Moving on to guidance. As a reminder, our third quarter full year outlook, which are summarized on Slides 11, and 12, are subject to the disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call.  For the third quarter we expect billings in the range of $1,560 million to $1,620 million which at the midpoint represents growth at 13% and is consistent with our quarter-over-quarter seasonality prior to the pandemic. Revenue in the range of $1,315 million to $1,375 million which at the midpoint represents growth of 17%.  Non-GAAP gross margin of 75.5% or 76.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 24.5% to 25.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.35 to $0.37. This assumes a share count of between $795 million and $805 million. Capital expenditures of $100 million to $130 million non-GAAP tax rate of 17% cash taxes of $25 million. And as previously mentioned, backlog is expected to approach normal levels in Q3.  For the full year, we expect billings in the range of $6,490 million to $6,590 million, which at the midpoint represents growth of 17% and apply slightly below normal seasonality in Q4. Revenue in the range of $5,350 million to $5,450 million, which at the midpoint represents growth of 22.3%. Service revenue in the range of $3,350 million to $3,410 million with the midpoint represents growth at 28.2%. The service revenues guidance implies product revenue growth at 13.5%.  Non-GAAP gross margin of 75.25% to 76.25%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 25.25% to 26.25%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.49 to $1.53, which assumes a share count of between $795 million and $805 million. Capital expenditures of $335 million to $385 million due to our continued cloud data center and facilities investments. Non-GAAP tax rate of 17%, cash taxes of $460 million with approximately $380 million in the fourth quarter.  We continue to execute our long-term strategy and remain confident in the strategy and our solutions. While it's a little early to be providing guidance for next year, we would expect our near term performance or represents a short term trough. Given our confidence in our solutions, our offerings -- and taking into account that growth comparisons will ease as we move through 2024 that this early stage we would expect billings growth to approach high-teens by the fourth quarter of 2024.  And with that, I'll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A session. Yes. I would probably add to Ken's comments, particularly as we talk about service providers and some of the other verticals and customer segments. And I think there are some lessons that we can see from, for example, manufacturing, which did extremely well in the quarter. They continue to have -- I feel they think they're under pressure in the threat environment, so you see them spending fairly richly. It's still a surprise,  If you look at the government sector which was strong also, they have governments in the -- they have budgets on the slowing economy that maybe some of the other industries don't. And at the other end of the spectrum, Ken talked about service provider, and people I think are aware of that story there more broadly. But also retail, I think retail is really a very clear indicator of a vertical that can be one of the first that is sometimes impacted by a slowing economy. But also, Ken made reference to this in his comments, this concept of digestion. A lot of purchasing around SD-WAN technologies and implementations.  A year ago, you saw very, very high growth a year ago. And now going through a digestion period, such as the point that it's actually negative growth in the retail vertical. Yeah. I think that as we go through the second half of the year and we enter into our normal planning cycle for 2024, I think that will be a logical output at that point in time to think through what we're seeing in terms of our 2025 targets. I don't know, Ken, if you want to talk about longer-term trends in the industry and now avoid [ph] guides for 2024, if you do that. Yeah. And as I kind of take that commentary and pull it forward a little bit and say, Q3 and Q4, and I suspect I'll get a fair amount of chance -- opportunities to talk about the guidance setting process for Q3 and Q4. I guess I would start off by saying we've certainly seen over the last two or three years in various environments we've been in. You got to be pretty nimble in terms of your assumptions and what you're looking for. And with that in mind, I think I called out in the comments, you see the level of deals that pushed in the second part of June. It was a new development. We always have linearity of the deals closed to see the deals push. And I think 1 comment I would offer is that as you look -- as I look to the Q3 guidance setting and the roll-up, the assumptions for Q3 were to close rates and terms and things of that nature and push. I would say, look a lot more like the assumptions that we saw in actual results for Q2 than maybe what we saw with some higher rates, better rates earlier on. So I think there's some caution built into that, if you will. I think also if you kind of look at the results, where the guidance ends up, you can look at top line growth in Q3 versus Q2 that I think is in the low-single digit growth sequentially. And that's pretty much in the range of where we've seen Q2 to Q3 historically, and we would expect that again.  And then maybe just a little more caution in the fourth quarter where -- and again, I made a comment earlier that the seasonality assumption that falls out of the guidance for the full year and is applied to the fourth quarter actually suggests a lower level of growth in the fourth quarter than we've seen in other periods. Offering a certain degree of caution, number one, but also acknowledging that Q4 last year was a very strong quarter and pretty tough compare. Yeah. I'd have to go back and look at the actual compares because the compares start easy and I don't want to mix up bookings and billings in this conversation because the timing is a little bit different. But I think that the growth in billings in Q4 and Q1 of -- Q4 of last year and Q1 of this year were very, very strong. Yeah. I'll go first, and then Ken can talk about what his friend down the street is doing or not doing, to his knowledge. As I kind of alluded to, I'm not -- yes, I had pushouts in the quarter. I'm happy with what I saw in terms of July on deals getting closed, but I've retained concept of continuing pushouts in Q3 and Q4. I'm not here to suggest that there's going to be a quarter recovery in that. I think that this is going to be -- take a little bit longer through this economy kind of normalizes and this digestion process goes on.  So I think it's really -- yes, picking up something in Q3 from Q2, but I'm also anticipating I'm going to see some things move from Q3 to Q4. And also the compares, if you go back and look at in Q3 and Q4 on the billings line, those are pretty attractive numbers that we put up in Q3 and Q4 of last year. What's he up to? Yeah. I think Ken is giving you not the accounting answer on backlog numbers, but the CEO version that he's done worrying about it, and he knows the company can manage their way through it. From a numbers viewpoint, we still have some backlog that we -- that will pick up. Some low single-digit benefit in Q3. And then to Ken's point, we think that largely, as you get out of Q3, we'll have a -- we'll be back to very close to normal backlog numbers. Yeah. Brad, it was a great question and kind of follow on with Ken there. When I look at the win rates for, say, our top 3 competitors, right, they are in the firewall market, I'm not really seeing a change in the win rates, loss rates. They were quite consistent, maybe improved in one of the three cases that -- of the names that we know. I think that what -- what we don't know is how much is specific to us was that we had deals teed up for the last couple of weeks of the quarter that we're on a path to close and they did not close. So how -- the question comes is that something about the macro and the enterprises that are pushing out spending a little bit? Or is it some area that we need to reprove on in terms of how we go at our own internal inspection and forecasting and look at the detailed deals, right? We'll know more about that as time plays out. Yeah. I think that what we look at -- go back our approach we've had for many years when we introduced a new product, and you heard about the 90G today. Our starting point is even though it has superior functionality capacity throughput, et cetera, is we generally price that along the lines of its predecessor. I think one thing that we're seeing as we move into the second half of this year, some opportunities to take, maybe some targeted pricing actions around use cases. For example, maybe if you get really far down the low end of the market where you're dealing with some low-cost franchisee models, maybe we would take some opportunities there to perhaps offer some incentives to our channel partners and such to participate in that market.  So I think the margins are obviously very, very strong on the product side, and we have that benefit there. So I do think it gives us the opportunity to make certain investments in the second half of this year, whether you want to call it price less or discounts or rebates or incentives to the channel partners. Last quarter, I think cancellation maybe we said was high single digits? This quarter, we say it's low, low double digits, right? And as backlog continues to subside as Ken pointed out a moment ago, it's not really going to make that much of a difference whether that cancellation rate goes from low double digits to mid-teens or something, or even 20. I mean, the spreadsheet for the second part of that question Saket. So I will come back --- No, that's fine. I think there's been conversation over the last, say, three or four quarters about would duration slow down. And we commented that we had seen some slowdown in duration. Not 1 month a quarter, but it would kind of bounce around a little bit.  The point I'm making is when you're measuring year-over-year growth, we lost 1.5 points of duration, which works out to be about 4 or 5 points growth. So when you're making the comparison on a growth basis, it really is a factor there.  And then if you want to get in the SASE part of it, remember, that product is not impacted by duration, only services are, so you get a partial impact. I think if you're looking forward, as I made the point, as we look at Q3 and Q4, the duration assumption that, I would say, is in that pool of things that I looked at what we saw in Q2 in terms of actual results and how those -- some of those metrics and assumptions that go into the guidance setting process differed from what I've been saying for the prior few quarters and place a very heavy reliance on what I saw in Q2, whether that deal's a push or whether a term or a bucket of other things. So without going into specifics, I would probably answer that question that way. I'm not quite sure -- are you looking for the distribution of salespeople hitting quota? Or -- I'm not sure I follow the question you're try to get at, Shaul. I don't have that data handy, to be honest with you. Sorry, resellers I'm sorry. I don't know. You're answering the right question. [Indiscernible] distributors, yeah. Yeah. I don't think that -- of our business, if you will, shifted at all significantly. We look at our top three and our top six distributors, we're fairly concentrated in that regard. That mix doesn't really change all that much, maybe point or 2 in the quarter. That wasn't something that we saw that's just out there at us. Yes. In terms of CISO spending, obviously, there's -- the things that were getting media attention out there now, I suspect that we sit down with a CISO that we talking about it. Whether that's SASE or something with some of the AI technologies, what have you.  But I don't think that CISOs and CIOs get away from having to take care of -- tending their knitting, if you will, with their infrastructure. There are obviously to be new use cases for firewalls. Opportunities, if you will. There's use cases still exists on-prem that need to be secured. There's new cases in the cloud, the Edge, et cetera. I think it's a very difficult career position to be at CISO right now with the budgets and threats that are after them. As it relates to 2024, I think whenever -- pardon me, 2024, we'll go through our planning cycle more religiously as we do the second half of the year. I think the point that Ken and I were making is really, as we move back to a more normal buying pattern after we move through the supply chain in the pandemic and so forth, that's what the industry has been historically and we would have every expectation that we'd be able to get back in that sweet spot, if you will.  And I would also note that as the -- it's not a static comparison. And by that, I mean the compares get easier in every quarter as you go through 2024. Yeah. I would use that to kind of come back to, I think, Shaul's question and make a couple of points. I think that as Ken kind of pointed out, we've had a lot of salespeople. We certainly have sales capacity to deliver on the numbers. At the same time, I think we've been very faithful to -- when we talk about 25% operating margin, and you see us continually coming in above that. So we have the opportunity there to invest more. And on that note, I think that the conversations with the channel partners, the distributors that we're having, I think they're much more informative, detailed at the right levels now than they were two years ago. There's a lot more cooperation information sharing with the distributors.  And I think a byproduct of that is I think there's some opportunities for us maybe to invest in our channel partners in a variety of different ways as we go through this next 12 to -- probably six to 12 months. Yeah. I think that we have a competitive advantage when you look at Europe and parts of the international emerging, where we are oftentimes viewed as being the incumbent to have number one market share. So in an environment in which maybe the IT budgets start to suffer more in Europe than they do in the U.S., which is not what we're seeing currently, right? Currently, we're seeing the IT budgets are lower in the U.S. than they are in Europe based on some recent surveys.  I think we're better prepared to work our way through that in Europe because of our dominant position in that market."

We'll then open the call for questions. During the Q&A session, we do ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one followup question to allow others to participate. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, and these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Please refer to our SEC filings, in particular, the risk factors in our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for more information. All forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation and specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also, all references to financial metrics that we make today are non-GAAP unless stated otherwise. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are located in the earnings press release and in the presentation that accompany today's remarks, both of which are posted on the Investor Relations website. Ken and Keith's prepared remarks for today's earnings call will be posted on the quarterly earnings section of our Investor Relations website immediately following today's call. Lastly, all references to growth are on a year-over-year basis unless noted otherwise. I'll now turn the call over to Ken.\nKen Xie: Thanks, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our outstanding first quarter 2023 results. For the first quarter, revenue growth was 32% due to strong growth in both product and service revenue. With 35% product revenue growth, we continue to gain market share while being a leading product revenue company in the cyber security industry. This strong product revenue growth will help drive future service revenue growth. Quarterly service revenue grew over 30% for the first time in six years. We believe we have a significant opportunity to upsell value-added security services to our large installed base. In the first quarter, SD-WAN and OT bookings together continued to account for over 25% of total bookings, and our goal is to become the 1 in Network firewall, Secure SD-WAN, and OT security markets over the next couple of years. Fortinet is leading the trend of network and security convergence and cyber security consolidation. Gartner expects that by the year 2030 the secure networking market will be larger than traditional networking. Traditional networking lacks awareness and control of content, applications, users, devices, and location and is still using the same network protocol that was developed 50 years ago. Fortinet\u2019s secure networking solution has expanded from Next Generation Firewalls to SD-WAN, SD-Branch, 5G, internal segmentation, ZTNA and Universal SASE, and we believe, the secure networking market can achieve double-digit growth annually for the foreseeable future. In today\u2019s environment, organizations are looking to consolidate their multiple security vendors and functions that are deployed across their expanding attack surface to lower their TCO and management costs while improving visibility and automating real time threat detection and response. Fortinet\u2019s latest release of FortiOS 7.4 together with the FortiSP5 ASIC leads the industry with better integration and automation as well as faster acceleration while lowering total cost ownership. FortiOS enables organizations to deploy the Fortinet Security Fabric to every edge, allowing security to dynamically scale and adapt as the network evolves. Last month, we announced Universal SASE, which supports hybrid infrastructure and enables the same networking and security features that are available in our appliances to be delivered as-a-service, all within a single console. Many of our service provider partners are collaborating with us on this offering. Also, we announced enhancements to several of our Fortinet Security Fabric solutions, including endpoint security, cloud security, SoC, and SOAR. As networking and security continue to converge and customers looking to consolidate vendors and point products, we believe we are well positioned to achieve our 2025 billings target of $10 billion while generating an annual non-GAAP operating margin of at least 25% for each of the next three years. Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners, and suppliers worldwide for their continued support and hard work. Keith?\nKeith Jensen: Thank you, Ken, and good afternoon everyone. Let\u2019s start with the key highlights from our strong first quarter performance. Our strong first quarter results reflect a continued demand for our broad portfolio of cybersecurity and networking solutions and the demand for consolidation and convergence that is delivered by our integrated, single platform strategy. Total revenue growth of 32% was led by strong product revenue growth and service revenue growth accelerating to over 30%. Billings increased 30%, our eighth consecutive quarter of at least 30% billings growth. Secure SD-WAN and OT bookings once again accounted for over 25% of total bookings. Our strong top-line results reflect continued customer demand across both Core and Enhanced Platform Technologies, and highlights the diversification of our business model by solutions, geographies, customer segments, and industry verticals. We continued to deliver balanced growth and profitability with better than industry average top-line growth and strong profitability despite the continued economic uncertainty. The first quarter operating margin of 26.5% represents the highest first quarter operating margin in our 14-year history as a publicly traded company. Free cash flow was $647 million, representing a margin of 51%, up 23 percentage points. Both the quarterly free cash flow and free cash flow margin are Fortinet post-IPO records. Last month we hosted nearly 3,000 customers and partners at our very successful Accelerate Conference and I\u2019d like to recap three key themes: one the expanding firewall deployments environment; two, convergence; and three, consolidation. So starting first, today's rapidly evolving threat landscape and connectivity demands a comprehensive approach to firewalls and network security, including a combination of hardware, virtualized software, and security services. In fact, Gartner anticipates that by 2026, more than 60 percent of organizations will have more than one type of firewall deployment, which will prompt adoption of hybrid mesh firewalls. Fortinet is well-positioned to capitalize on this expansion of firewall deployments and form factors as we have been delivering hybrid mesh firewalls for years on a single operating system. Second, the company was founded over 20 years ago on the belief that the convergence of security and networking will become an industry standard. Gartner shares this belief noting they expect the size of the secure networking market to overtake the traditional networking market by 2030. We believe secure networking at scale works most effectively on ASIC technologies. Since its inception Fortinet has been developing proprietary ASIC technologies to build application-specific solutions to support convergence as traditional CPU-based solutions are less efficient at supporting both networking and security. Third, vendor and product functionality consolidation strategies continue to become more commonplace. Looking to Gartner here again, they note 75% of organizations are pursuing a cybersecurity vendor consolidation strategy in 2022, up from 29% in 2020. Our integrated FortiOS platform allows customers to converge networking functionality with security capabilities, while consolidating cybersecurity products and functionality. With FortiASIC\u2019s significant computing power advantage, FortiOS can consolidate more security functions and solutions while maintaining our performance and cost advantage. Specifically, FortiOS supports many security applications, including network firewall, SD-WAN, SASE, 5G, WiFi security, ZTNA, VPN, and SSL with a variety of use cases for each security application. For example, firewall use cases include data center, branches, edges, virtual, cloud native, micro-segmentation, both East/West and North/South and firewall-as-a-service. Our convergence and consolidation strategy provides security across our customers\u2019 entire digital infrastructure, while lowering their operating costs. Now let\u2019s now take a closer look at the first quarter. Billings grew 30% to $1.5 billion, driven by Enhanced Platform Technology solutions. In terms of industry verticals, government and financial services top the list as a percentage of total billings, with financial services up over 40%. Construction, media, and utilities were all up at least 50%. Billings growth benefited from a better-than-expected backlog contribution. While the backlog cancellation rate increased quarter-over-quarter, it was lower than we had forecasted in our model. We continue to believe there is an elevated cancellation risk in future periods for networking equipment backlog. Bookings grew double digits in the quarter, off a challenging comparison of 50% growth in the first quarter of last year. We continue to see success with our strategy to expand further into the large enterprise segment with the number of deals over $1 million increasing 38% to 124 deals and billings on these deals increasing 50%. One of these deals was an 8-figure expansion and upsell opportunity at a Fortune 50 retailer. The retailer was looking to replace their firewall point solutions with a holistic cybersecurity solution. After purchasing FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer in the fourth quarter of last year, this customer selected FortiGate VMs after a very competitive process for their 2,000 store locations as part of our new FortiFlex program. FortiFlex is a new points-based consumption program supporting hybrid mesh firewall deployments as well as a variety of other security solutions. The customer selected Fortinet due to the substantial value offered by our unified platform and their significant technical requirements. In the first quarter, we added approximately 6,100 new logos \u2013 reflecting the support of our channel partners through their investments and the investments we\u2019ve made in them. Average contract term was flat year-over-year at 27 months and down 1 month quarter-over-quarter. Turning now to revenue, total revenue grew 32% to $1.26 billion, driven by strong demand for Core and Enhanced Platform Technologies, increasing 23% and 50%, respectively. Product revenue of $501 million increased 35%, despite the very difficult comparison to last year\u2019s first quarter at 54% with its very strong contribution from acquisitions. Product revenue growth was driven by strong growth in Enhanced Platform Technologies, improving supply chain dynamics, and our earlier pricing actions. Service revenue was up over 30% to $762 million, the highest growth rate in services since 2016. The average number of days between when a customer purchases and subsequently activates a security service contract declined slightly sequentially and remained elevated on a year-over-year basis. Service revenue growth was closely aligned with our short-term deferred revenue growth rate in recent periods. Short-term deferred revenue growth was over 30% for the fourth consecutive quarter. Total gross margin of 76.3% was up 190 basis points including a 440 basis point increase in product gross margin to 61.8%. Product gross margins benefited from earlier pricing actions, improved discounting, and easing cost pressures. Service gross margin of 85.9% ticked up 70 basis points as price increases offset increased investments in data centers and Points of Presence, or PoPs. Operating margin of 26.5% was up 450 basis points due to the strong gross margin performance, a foreign exchange benefit, and revenue growth that was 10 points higher than our 22% headcount growth. As previously noted, 26.5% is our highest ever first quarter operating margin as a public company. Looking to the Statement of Cash Flows summarized on Slides 7 and 8, free cash flow was a quarterly Fortinet record at $647 million and benefited from elevated receivables in the fourth quarter of last year and the subsequent cash collections, as well as the record-setting operating margin, and the timing of CapEx projects. Adjusted free cash flow, which excludes the real estate investments, was $662 million, representing a 52% adjusted free cash flow margin and our highest margin since our 2009 IPO. We have come to expect some quarterly variances in our free cash flow results with the first quarter often stronger due to the seasonally stronger fourth quarter billings. Capital expenditures were $30 million, including $15 million of real estate investments. This was lower than expected due to the timing of real estate activities. Cash taxes were $21 million. The Board increased the Company\u2019s share repurchase authorization by $1 billion, and the total available share buyback authorization is now approximately $1.5 billion for repurchases through February 2024. Looking forward, we are excited about the growth drivers that we have discussed previously as well as our new single-vendor Universal SASE offering. Our Universal SASE offering delivers a comprehensive solution that extends the convergence of networking and security from the edge to remote users while helping teams drive operational efficiency and reducing complexity and costs by consolidating vendors. In fact, Gartner predicts that by 2025, one-third of new SASE deployments will be based on a single-vendor SASE offering, up from 10% in 2022. As we bring Universal SASE to market, we expect to make various investments including increasing our PoPs. Our guidance reflects the impact of these investments to both our gross margin and capital expenditure estimates. Moving to guidance, I\u2019d like to review our outlook for the second quarter and full year summarized on Slides 10 and 11, which is subject to the disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the second quarter, we expect billings in the range of $1 billion 560 million to $1 billion 600 million, which at the midpoint represents growth of 21%, revenue in the range of $1 billion 280 million to $1 billion $320 million, which at the midpoint represents growth of 26%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75.5% to 76.5%, non-GAAP operating margin of 24.5% to 25.5%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.33 to $0.35, which assumes a share count of between 790 million and 800 million, capital expenditures of $80 million to $110 million, a non-GAAP tax rate of 17%, cash taxes of $35 million, which is lower than our prior expectation as the deadline for certain tax payments has been extended to the fourth quarter. The second quarter guidance assumes backlog decreases during the quarter. For the full year, we expect billings in the range of $6 billion 750 million to $6 billion 810 million, which at the midpoint represents growth of 21%. This guidance assumes a low-single digit impact on billings growth from backlog. Revenue in the range of $5 billion 425 million to $5 billion 485 million, which at the midpoint represents growth of 23.5%, service revenue in the range of $3 billion $370 million to $3 billion $400 million, which at the midpoint represents growth of 28%. The service revenue guidance implies product revenue growth of 16%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%, non-GAAP operating margin of 25% to 26%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.44 to $1.48, which assumes a share count of between 795 and 805 million, Capital expenditures of $400 million to $450 million due to the continued cloud, data center, and facilities investments. Non-GAAP tax rate of 17%, cash taxes of $390 million with approximately $300 million in the fourth quarter. The full year estimates assume backlog returns to historical levels later this year. As we wrap up the prepared remarks, maybe one additional observation. Over many years the Fortinet team and its partners have offered a very solid and consistent level of execution across a wide range of economic cycles and other challenges. Like many others, we see a level of economic uncertainty in front of us and we look forward to this possible challenge in delivering on our goals. I\u2019ll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A session.\nPeter Salkowski: Thank you. As a reminder, during the Q&A session we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one followup question to allow others to participate. Chris, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Essex from JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nBrian Essex: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter particularly in a tough macro. Maybe Keith for you, nice acceleration in services revenue this quarter, and I know Ken talked about more effectively selling or selling value added services, secure services into your install base. How much was due to that better attach rate of secure services versus changes in registration policy or pricing increases in the quarter?\nKeith Jensen:\nFortiGuard,: By that I mean, the customer did register a little bit faster in the first quarter, but that lag or that registration policy change that we implemented in the first quarter, I would specifically call out is not really having an impact in the first quarter, nor did we really expect one. So kind of in order, I think it was selling into the install base price increases and then some light improvements in the registration behavior.\nFortiGuard: By that I mean, the customer did register a little bit faster in the first quarter, but that lag or that registration policy change that we implemented in the first quarter, I would specifically call out is not really having an impact in the first quarter, nor did we really expect one. So kind of in order, I think it was selling into the install base price increases and then some light improvements in the registration behavior.\nPay-As-You-Go: By that I mean, the customer did register a little bit faster in the first quarter, but that lag or that registration policy change that we implemented in the first quarter, I would specifically call out is not really having an impact in the first quarter, nor did we really expect one. So kind of in order, I think it was selling into the install base price increases and then some light improvements in the registration behavior.\nKen Xie: Yes, also with the new FortiOS 7.4 that started launching, we started to have a more function. We can also enable much more new service going forward for both the current customer installation base and also for new customers.\nBrian Essex: Got it. That's helpful. Maybe as a follow up piece, I think you commented on lower than expected cancellation rate. I know the question will be asked, impact on billings from backlog training and what some of your assumptions are, particularly given what you see in the macro? I know you talked about you expect to be at normalized rates for backlog by the end of the year, but maybe if you could contextualize or quantify that to the extent that you're able to?\nKeith Jensen: Yes, I think in the guidance particularly as we look at the full year, it's kind of difficult to figure out exactly which quarter some of that backlog is going to end up in or be canceled. But for the full year, I think we talked about low single digit growth that would be coming from the backlog. I do think that the risk to cancellations increases as the year progresses, and by that I mean if a customer has only been in backlog for a week or a month or something like that, there seems somewhat less probability that they're going to cancel. But the longer it takes to deliver on that backlog, I think the cancellation risk continues to increase.\nKen Xie: Also a point is very, you mentioned go back normal end of the year, we see later this year. It could be middle, could be towards the end, but in Q1 I'd say the operation team did a great job to reduce the backlog, which is also helping secure more customer and unload some cancellation rate.\nBrian Essex: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you both very much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for the next question. This question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nGabriela Borges: Good afternoon. Thank you. I have one for Ken or for Keith, it's a followup question on forecasting, which is, we've heard so much noise in the industry around supply chain and COVID catalyst product cycles. How do you all think about true demand and potentially planner and the risk of demand going faster than expected, given you've had a very strong couple of years? Thank you.\nKen Xie: I think probably some of them will refer to the traditional network security, secure some enterprise, deployment enterprise, but we do see that our solution has a much broader use case and also expand much bigger market opportunities than the traditional enterprise firewall. And also the IT/OT is also see one of our strong growth, continue to helping drive both the new customer and also expanding the current existing customer. Also in the ICE and B [ph] space is a relatively greenfield. We also see pretty healthy faster growth probably even faster than the traditional enterprise, which is more replacement. I think all this I see contributing to pretty healthy, I keep saying double digit growth in the future for the whole security space.\nGabriela Borges: Yes, that, that makes sense. Thank you. And Ken the followup is for you, which is, as you start to execute more on the convergence of selling into the networking budget or the convergence of networking plus security, when you look at the classic networking competitors, how do you think about the barrier or the limitation for classic networking vendors to get more into security and become more competitive in the convergence over time?\nKen Xie: I would say from the quality architecture it's very different because security needs much more complete power and to handle the lot of unstructured data, which the traditional networking company, probably more based on some structured data handle, some fixed mix protocol and much less company power needed to process data compared with the network security. So that's where, and also we would have to implement the function and new function come up every year in the software first and then keep enhancing, improving performance leverage ASIC and that's also, we don't see networking company doing some of that. They probably maybe bit slow on where to come up the new function for the security space, all kind of have a different architecture to really supporting the secure computing needed for now security. So that's -- so far, have not seen the traditional networking company really come close. May be they did some acquisition, but so far I don't see they really come up too much since -- to meet a new demand from customer both on the function and also on the service, on the infrastructure change.\nGabriela Borges: Thanks for the detail. Congrats on the quarter.\nKen Xie: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for the next question. The next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani of Citi. Your line is open.\nFatima Boolani: Thank you. Good afternoon. I appreciate you taking my questions. Ken just a technology vision question for you. You are very, and the team is very bullish on the SASE opportunity that was very apparent at the Accelerate conference as well. But I'm curious as to why you're taking the effort to build out data centers and points of presence to deliver your universal SASE strategy versus maybe some of your peers and competitors who are maybe relying on third party providers and hyperscalers? And then I have a quick follow up, please.\nKen Xie: Yes. First of all, SASE kind of a vision is little bit different than some of competitors. We do believe need to be universal, need to be more broadly deployed and also more leveraged, a lot of service provider infrastructure. It's kind of a hybrid environment inside of a cloud only SASE solution. And we do keep on expanding some of our path because there's a, definitely, there's some user like whether depend on working from home as a mother or SASE to secure some of their traffic here. But on other side, there's a huge base of customer need to using SASE, our kind of service model, leverage both service provider out their current infrastructure and even onsite appliance. And so that's where in certain point we also see our FortiSwitch and FortiAP are kind of have a agent to helping for the traffic for the Forti [indiscernible] to process all this SASE traffic there. So that's where, that's the reason we kind of put SASE in a single OS, both on the networking side of function like [indiscernible] brand strategy and other plus the security like a CASB DLP, [indiscernible] service, all these things. So that's where we have a more integrated, more broadly distributed and leverage whatever the hyper infrastructure size solution there. That's also the reason we continue to build some other PoP. It's a little bit different than some other leverage certain cloud provider because we do see the cloud provider potentially also can be the service provider to offer SASE and also from the [indiscernible] I point of view even have a little bit more investment from the beginning to build on PoP our self, but long-term will be more profit model, so we have a better margin so that, so we will take some time to make sure we build a healthy ecosystem, both with our partner and also with the investment for long-term benefit.\nFatima Boolani: I appreciate that detail, Ken. Keith, just quickly for you, kind of a tactical question on the billings outlook. You're raising the full year by less than half of the beat and raised when I think about the first half. And so maybe from a bottom up perspective, can you walk us through what sort of underpinning that conservatism? I can appreciate the macro is jittery, but if you can kind of give us some more tangible considerations you're thinking about in terms of a bottom up perspective on getting to that billing guide for this whole year? Thank you.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I would say one just kind of as a general thought, I think that raising it to some extent I think probably gives you a little bit of a message that we feel good about our strategy and the execution that level that we can bring to the market. But more specifically and more tactically as we look through the second half of the year, there's probably a little more rigor and effort, if you will, in trying to look at what we see coming in the second half of the year. And I would give you that probably the two headlines that we're looking at. One is we're still very, very pleased with the pipeline. The pipeline continues to be well above anything that we're talking about, growth rates for the company for the full year. But I think the nuance that and maybe it's not even a nuance really that's coming into play now it is more about close rates. It's not just as simple as taking your pipeline and assuming you're going to have close rates that were at the same level they were in prior periods, and that's when we use the term close rates, not a suggestion that deals are getting lost, but this continual cycle that we seem to be in, where some of the larger enterprise deals in particular are taking longer, they're pushing out a lot of pushes. It's not that there's been an increase in losses, but the continual push. And so with that in mind, I think a fair amount of attention of looking at the full year guidance on what we really think our close rates may be for the second half of this year.\nFatima Boolani: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for the next question. This question comes from the line of Saket Kalia of Barclays. Your line is open.\nSaket Kalia: Okay, great. Hey, good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking my questions here. Ken, maybe just to start with you, great to see Fortinet sales of the whole breadth of the platform, particularly within the enterprise. Could you just maybe talk about anything that you can do to make it easier for customers to consolidate spending with Fortinet? Whether that's an enterprise license agreement or any other thing that sort of makes it easier to combine, consolidate those vendors, which was a theme I think was talked about earlier?\nKen Xie: Yes we definitely see some healthy growth of enterprise agreement. And also we're working closely with our channel partner with our service provider also leverage their connection, their resource to build a healthy ecosystem to grow together. But I also see from enterprise level, they also see the benefit of consolidation, definitely. And also not just consolidate some of security product, but also on the expanded infrastructure go beyond the traditional network security. So that's also, we see pretty healthy growth like a cure, and we do see that we could enhanced technology side also has pretty healthy growth. Yes, the sales force also, you can see the number of 1 million deal both on the number and also on the dollar wise has a pretty healthy growth continue to accelerate and grow beyond the total building growths. So that's, that's a pretty healthy trend we see going forward to helping customer consolidate.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. And Saket, maybe just, this is Keith, just to go along a level deeper on what Ken is talking about there, and I'll give you maybe four quick examples. So yes, enterprise agreement is something that we've been doing now for probably a couple years. We track those in some ways as a different line of business in terms of the growth rates and particularly as we've moved into the enterprise, I think it's been very important to be there and we've been very successful with it. I think another illustration of trying to make it easier for customers was the example of the large retailer we gave in the call today. And we talked about the points program, right? Which is an easier way, I think, sometimes for them to, to get on board and consume more of the products. And I think also then when we sell, making sure that we're, our salespeople are well trained on the value proposition that we're offering, not just on the cost of the appliance or the throughput or the performance, but also what it means to the customers management costs and overhead costs as well. And so I think those types of things are all going into play here to support what Ken is talking about, about making it easier for customers to consume more products.\nSaket Kalia: Got it. That's super helpful. Keith, maybe for my followup for you, great to see that 30% growth and acceleration in services revenue. Maybe the question is, how do you think about what portion of your existing subscription base hasn't seen that cumulative impact of the price increases you've done yet. Right? Like clearly the price increases on product have been fully baked, but how much of the base, or maybe how long will it take for the subscription base to fully realize that pricing as well?\nKeith Jensen: Yes, great question and I think it didn't really look at the numbers closely this quarter we did last quarter. A couple things to keep in mind, the average contract term, call it 27 months, if all the contracts are 27 months, you could do that math, if they're not, some are one and some are three year contracts in terms of the renewals that are coming through. So, pardon me, one in five year contracts. Sorry, Peter. Thank you for that. So it does have a long tail and again, I'll refer you back to how many quarters or how a few years that we talked about seeing the uplift that came when we converted to 24 x 7 support from 8 x 5 that was something that continued to provide a benefit for several years. I think the tail gets smaller obviously as you go further out. I think the majority of what's -- of the existing contracts more than 50% are under the new pricing.\nSaket Kalia: Very helpful. Thanks guys.\nOperator: And thank you. One moment for the next question. This next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal of TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nShaul Eyal: Thank you. Good afternoon. Congrats on results and guidance in tough macro. Keith maybe starting with you, can you comment, can you provide us with some color about the financial vertical performance this quarter?\nKeith Jensen: Yes, it is well, financial services have always been one of our, I like to say, always been for a long time. They were in the top three and it can be a bit future famine there with some very large deals in the quarter. But I don't think there was anything that was -- it was number two in this particular quarter. Thank you, Peter. I don't think there were any really large deals that drove that number. I think it was, we saw growth and success not only in the U.S., but also internationally, particularly in Europe. And so I think it was a strong quarter for us in that area.\nShaul Eyal: Got it, got it. From a product mix perspective, so the entry level performed the best versus the high end. Is that just a mix or a macro reflection? And, and also did you have any eight digit wins this quarter?\nKeith Jensen: So we talked about it, yes, we did.\nShaul Eyal: Okay.\nKeith Jensen: I think we talked about one in the script just a moment ago and I think we commented that was an eight figure deal, if I'm not mistaken, right, without giving a specific number. Yes and I don't recall if there was a second eight figure deal if there was a second.\nKen Xie: Yes. Also our SMB [ph] had a pretty healthy growth. Like I said, the SMB is a more greenfield for the network security. We do see more and more SMB need and network security to protect their business, especially comes from some other ransomware attack. On enterprise because it's a kind of more replacement and also a lot of enterprise kind of maybe the bigger [indiscernible] how we're more dependent on the service. So that impacts some of the high end. And also the other benefit for some of the low and middle range is really most I would say most IC one and some of the OT deployment are maybe towards the low end, middle range.\nShaul Eyal: Got it. Thank you. I appreciate it. Well done.\nKen Xie: Thank you.\nOperator: And thank you. One moment for the next question. This question comes from Rob Owens of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nRob Owens: Thank you very much and good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I want to start around OpEx or the correlated operating margin and a very strong first quarter here, I think you mentioned it was the strongest Q1 that you've had since you're public. If I go back through results since you've been public, Q1 has never really been the high watermark from an operating margin standpoint. So walk me through your thought process as the rest of this year plays out was there some aberration in Q1 that really helped drive that or just a lot of conservatism as we look ahead?\nKeith Jensen: Yes, I think that we called out three things and maybe focusing on two; one, we had a very strong gross margin in the quarter and I'll elaborate on that in a moment. And then also FX, continues to provide a tailwind. More commentary about the gross margin, particularly the product gross margin as we move through, the supply chain challenges and then into inflation, et cetera. Over the last couple of years, I think we've talked publicly that our goal was to try and keep the product gross margin around 61% or so. The fourth quarter came in, obviously very low. We did not anticipate that we'd be able to time our price increases and the cost increases perfectly. So they went through the income statement in the same quarter, so to speak. And with that, I think you saw a little bit of pressure in the fourth quarter and then you saw it kind of revert in the first quarter. I think longer-term, we also look at product gross margin as an opportunity sometimes for us to continue to invest in growth. And I think we saw the first quarter gross margin, certainly well above that band that I just talked about. And with that in mind, and as we start to see some of the costs moving out of the equation, and we introduce new products, I think we'll be looking at that in terms of is there an opportunity there to make certain investments in growth while maintaining the margin commitments that we've talked about.\nRob Owens: Great. And then as a followup, I did want to touch on the OT business and the strength you're seeing there? Can you talk a little bit from a go-to-market standpoint and some of the channel programs, because it does seem like there's some new large channel partners out there that are very excited about the opportunities? Thanks.\nKeith Jensen: Yes, I think OT, we do look at, I mean, you're always trying to organize your sales force around verticals, geographies, or what have you. And I think when we started to see the opportunity in OT several years ago, Patrice and Ken made a decision to start separating that out and having really a separate sales function and some people that specialize in that. I do think that we probably got some first mover advantages by doing that, particularly as we look at Europe and then quickly followed thereafter by the U.S. And yes, there are some large names that are in that space that are providing technology, not security technology, but technologies in the OT space that have been very receptive, if you will, to conversations and opportunities to meet with us.\nOperator: Thank you very much. One moment for our next question. The next question comes from Adam Borg of Stifel. Your line is open.\nAdam Borg: Awesome. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Just for Ken or Keith, obviously it's great to see the strong collections and the record free cash flow. And you also talked about contract terms being consistent year-on-year, and I was just curious though, just given the tougher macro, are you seeing any pushback by customers around willingness to pay upfront? And then I have a follow up.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. Well, first of all, I want to revel in the $600 million of free cash flow, which I've been doing it for some of more quarters, but I'm trying to let people know that a lot of the things fell our way in the quarter. There's always, the conversation in part of the sales cycle, if you will, the customers got a one-year, three-year, five-year deal. And certainly in a rising -- in an environment where interest rates have gone up, I think there's a lot more, many more conversations that exist, around payment terms and things like that. I do believe that, just as we just talked about in the second quarter of 2020 when COVID hit, we have a very strong balance sheet. We obviously have very strong margins, and it's appropriate for us to look at that, to that as opportunities to leverage our balance sheet and sometimes that may be in the form of extended payment terms or what have you, and our income statement in the form of, how we want to go about discounting and supporting growth. So I think that again, the strength that we've had, we have the ability to do those things. If the question is around what are we seeing from some of the enterprise customers, and Ken is seeing a lot of this as well, do we see deals that go from five years to three years? Sure. Is it more than we've seen in the past? I'd kind of look back at the contract term data point that we gave and say maybe, but not a lot kind of a thing. And on payment terms, the channel has always offered a financing function. I think they prefer to provide the financing function and then I think we provide support to the financing function to the channel by making capital available to them through payment terms.\nAdam Borg: That's really helpful. And maybe just as a quick followup, head count was up a little bit over 600 people, quarter-over-quarter up over 21.5% year-on-year. Just curious how we're thinking about headcount growth either in 2Q or later this year, again, just given the macro? Thanks again.\nKen Xie: Yes, we are, overall we look at both headcount and headcount cost, probably the same pace, company grow the top line, and also try to, at the same time try to improve in some efficiency there. So we're now looking for headcount growth above the top line, even with few, there's a few some question in the area. We also need to do some more investment, on time investment. But companies so far, we feel we have a pretty healthy finance model and this also could be the opportunity to also gain in some market share.\nAdam Borg: Great. Thanks again.\nKen Xie: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] This question comes from Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer and Company. Your line is open.\nIttai Kidron: Thanks guys, and nice results. My first question I guess is on the U.S. enterprise, so not U.S. in general, but just the enterprise vertical, clearly one of the most important growth opportunities for you long-term. Can you talk about progress over there, win rates displacements, and is the macro making things easier or more difficult for you specifically in the U.S.?\nKen Xie: First we continue to invest in the U.S. enterprise. We also see it's a huge growth potential for us because we have relatively small market share and with all the strong product technology we have. On the other side, the big environment definitely slowed down some of the enterprise making certain decisions whether to refresh or something like that. But on the other side our solution has a better lower total cost ownership and also can expand beyond the traditional network security and also helping customers to consolidate. So I think all this combined together, we do see the U.S. enterprise definitely is a strong grow area for us.\nIttai Kidron: Okay, thanks. And then maybe followup on the competitive side and Ken, maybe you can talk about what have you seen out of your competitors in the U.S. and kind of abnormal activity from discounting or otherwise?\nKen Xie: I think during the slowdown of some of the big environment, definitely the competitors starting do more aggressive whether on some discount or offer some free for some turn of the free some percentage of free service. But from all angle, we see we have much better product position, much broad like infrastructure coverage and better service, and also both on the performance angle. The product definitely has performed much better for the same function, same cost, and same time. The cost service also has much more value and costs lower than competitors. So for us, we have not experienced like price pressure or discount pressure. It is more about how we can increase the coverage, increase the lease and pipeline, and also to meet the customer need in this big environment change.\nKeith Jensen: Yes, I would think that with, when Ken talks about the figures is fantastic. I think keep in mind, we don't, we have a very, as we kind of talked about prepared market, a very diverse customer base, if you will, between being international, between being very large, mid, small, and MSSPs, et cetera. So I don't want put a policy in place that covers every geography and it covers every customer size. And I think what you're really talking about here is something that for us represents 15% of our business, maybe just a little bit less. And because it's at that size, it's something that we can really more, I think, target our responses to as we get deeper into the selling function as opposed to some broad announcement that we're going to give away services for two years or something like that.\nIttai Kidron: Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for the next question. This question comes to the line of Angie Song with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nAngie Song: Hi, thank you guys so much for taking my question. I'm on for Hamza Fodderwala of Morgan Stanley. So could you just share a little bit more about your current interest around the SASE or current customer interest around the SASE product and what are some of the responses around this so far?\nKen Xie: It's a pretty strong growth. And also we're working with a lot of our service providers, both on the infrastructure side or our security service side, and offer the SASE because we do believe SASE should be a ecosystem with a lot of player instead of just a vendor offer their own SASE. Because a lot of I'd say probably most the customer, they prefer some of their data in process controlled themselves whether some privacy SASE or some data sovereignty, keeping the data within certain geo. So that's where we see the SASE approach, we call universal SASE gave the customer flexibility to offer both cloud based on primary space or kind of leverage service providing infrastructure will be more benefit for industry long-term. So that's where -- even sometime we kind of take a little bit more time to develop all the SASE function in the single always. But that's making more easy for the customer, for the service provider to deploy SASE to fit their need at their environment. So we see a very, very healthy pipeline and the strong growth kind of our salary growth. And that's also based on kind of a more healthy margin kind of model instead of do see money, all of our growth. So we want to maintain that model and also working closely with our partner to offer kind of a SASE together to the customer.\nAngie Song: Got it. Thank you. And just one more around profitability. So how are you guys thinking about -- us growth slows down over the next few years, and where do we to see that margin leverage?\nKeith Jensen: Angie, can you repeat that? You cut out in the beginning of that question.\nAngie Song: Yes, no worries. So the question is around profitability, and I was just wondering what you guys are thinking about upside to profitability as growth slows down, and where should we expect to see that margin leverage?\nKen Xie: We see the midterm model would be $10 billion building by 2025 and with non-GAAP operating margin at least 25% for each year in the next three years.\nAngie Song: Got it. Thank you.\nKeith Jensen: Yes, I think the one thing, Angie, and I think answer about this before as well, keep in mind, two-thirds of the business roughly is service revenue. And that's producing a gross margin that's in the mid-80s. So, and that's, those are longer-term contracts. So I think the business model is such that we'd have time to react if there was something really dramatic that happened in the industry. But part of that's, for that to happen, I think you'd probably have to see some sort of shift in the behavior of the bad actors, the nation states, the organized crime groups, et cetera. And we don't see that's on the landscape.\nAngie Song: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] This next question comes from the line of Tal Liani of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nTal Liani: Hey guys. What we've seen with good companies in the last two quarters is that, they make great numbers, but when you look at the composition, new customers are slowing down and sales to existing customers are going up. And we've seen it through multiple companies in the space. So the question is whether you can provide us with some data on sales to existing customers versus new customers, and how is the current environment on customer acquisition, on new customer acquisition? Thanks.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. So as a reminder, Tal good to hear from you again, if you think of the business being, extremely diversified, whether that's geographically or by customer segments, one-third small, one-third mid, one-third large. We specifically called out in the script that we added over 6,000 new logos in the quarter. So obviously and that's probably a growth rate that's, easily into double digits. New logos take a while to really produce revenue for us, it tends to be, less than 10% of total revenue from the new logos. So it creates the opportunity to continue to sell into them. Kind of to Ken's comment a moment ago into your question here, do we see large enterprises in the U.S. still moving forward robustly with all their various digital transformation projects? I think that the, the word on the street is, that slowed down a little bit. And in that environment, I do think that incumbents sometimes have an advantage, but also a cost of performance argument and debate is something that you see customers perhaps more receptive to in the current macro environment\nTal Liani: And in the current macro environment is the duration of contracts going down or is\u2026\nKeith Jensen: It was flat year-over-year down one month, quarter-over-quarter.\nTal Liani: Got it. Okay, thanks.\nKeith Jensen: Which somebody reminds me of the room very politely. Every first quarter is down one month.\nTal Liani: Got it. Sequential. Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for the next question. This question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nAndrew Nowinski: Okay. Thank you. And congrats on a nice quarter. So I wanted to ask about your SASE offering as well. You talked at the Accelerate Conference about I think having eight to 10 new use cases, driving demand for the firewall, but I'm wondering if SASE could be one of those use cases as well, meaning, is the firewall appliance a critical component of your SASE offering?\nKen Xie: Yes, SASE definitely is the one the, the use case especially the universal SASE or sometime they called a private SASE for some customer, they some service provider, they want to have a more control of their data. So that's we see is both SASE like the service model, customer benefit service provider has a big value-added that one, but at the same time gave the flexibility of what your full of force some traffic to the cloud or to the pop or have a process on premise and by the appliance. So that's, we see the huge benefit of universal SASE solution, which is very different than some other SASE player and a lot of customers and the partner were interest to at this universal SASE approach.\nAndrew Nowinski: Thanks, Ken. And then maybe a question for Keith just as it relates to your CapEx, you talked about a component of that being used to build out more pops to support the SASE offering, but is that something like, how should we think about CapEx in that investment beyond 2023 as you continue building out your network?\nKeith Jensen: Well, Ken and I are smiling at each other. We've had this conversation that they're I think I've been here for nine years as of this week. One thing I've come to appreciate is that Ken behaves like a long-term investor, and with that in mind owning critical real estate assets tends to have a better payback than leasing them over an extended period of time. Whether that's in R&D facilities, whether that's in manufacturing or warehouse facilities, or that as you, as we move into that, into the SaaS market as well as other cloud offerings it's not just investments in SASE, if you will, but it's also investments in larger data centers in order to deliver various, cloud-based services and solutions. And I think you've heard us talk about that the last several earnings calls and the guys of, data centers having an impact on margins for services and CapEx spending. So I don't think there should be a surprise there, but I think it is a, an indication of our looking to expand into, more fully into some of these other markets.\nAndrew Nowinski: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And thank you. One moment for our final question. Our last question comes from the line of Shrenik Kothari from Baird. Your line is open.\nShrenik Kothari: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. So for Ken or Keith I think Keith, you mentioned about the, the financial services up over 40%, which is surprisingly strong and contrary to what we are hearing from your peers and competitors. So can you expand a bit about upon the underlying drivers? I know you touched upon it but I just wanted to expand on the geographical diversity or is it increased kind of impetus for vendor consolidation that is benefiting you guys in that vertical? So if you can just elaborate and then I have a quick follow up.\nKeith Jensen: Yes, I would say it's all the above. It's happening geographically. I think it's happening with customers that we took down earlier that are expanding with us, with additional firewalls and additional security or additional services as well. I think the market, if you will, financial services, if you step back and look at what's happening there, specifically the firewalls over the last several years, there's probably two legacy vendors there that when they're contracts are up for renewal and we've talked about this for a long period of time, now they're exposed. And it creates an opportunity to come in for a competitive displacement. And I think that some of the other comments or questions today is, is it more difficult in this environment for competitive placements? I mean, sure, you got to work a lot harder to make it happen. You got to make your value proposition more well known. But I think, again I think it's expansion. I think it's opportunity to displace incumbents and I don't think it's specific to any one particular geography.\nKen Xie: Yes. Also from technology angel, we have a two huge advantage. One is for the internal segmentation of secure data center. So because the ASIC advantage we have, we can deploy in the very high speed environment which a lot of us find service provider, they do need secure their kind of internal segmentation there. The other part, really some of finance service also starting to supporting work from home, working from remotely, which we also have a large super solution with our ASIC based like a small appliance supporting this kind of our broad infrastructure approach combined with that, like SD-WAN or the other 5G, 4G network and security together. So that gave us huge advantage from the product angle.\nShrenik Kothari: Got it, got it. Thanks a lot, Ken, Keith just a quick follow-up. And you guys, of course, started upon the expansion opportunity in the form factors. Of course, your peers and parties have spoken about unit expansion pressure and how the product unit growth is kind of normalizing. But just wondering, given that give examples of this 8-figure expansion and upsell opportunity replacing kind of firewall with a holistic solution. Can you talk about like expansion drivers broadly like \u2013 are you seeing mostly upsell and expansion in form factors versus the units? Just imparted to get some clarification there.\nKen Xie: Probably both. Yes, we do see the expanding of both the unit and also upsell cross-sell of the entire for the Security Fabric, which has 53 product. So that's where both our internal sales force also partners setting were lot [indiscernible] across for the whole fabric. At the same time, because we combine networking security and more function together multiply case, which also the unit shipment also starting keeping grow quite nicely.\nShrenik Kothari: Got it. Thanks a lot. Ken, I appreciate it.\nKen Xie: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes the Q&A segment. I'll now turn it back over to Peter Salkowski for closing remarks.\nPeter Salkowski: Thank you, Chris. Apologies to the seven people we left in the queue. I'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call. Fortinet will be attending investor conferences hosted by JPMorgan and Bank of America during the second quarter. Fireside chat, webcast links will be posted on the Events and Presentations section of the Fortinet Investor Relations website. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. Have a great rest of your day. Thank you.\nOperator: And thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ken Xie",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our outstanding first quarter 2023 results. For the first quarter, revenue growth was 32% due to strong growth in both product and service revenue. With 35% product revenue growth, we continue to gain market share while being a leading product revenue company in the cyber security industry. This strong product revenue growth will help drive future service revenue growth. Quarterly service revenue grew over 30% for the first time in six years. We believe we have a significant opportunity to upsell value-added security services to our large installed base. In the first quarter, SD-WAN and OT bookings together continued to account for over 25% of total bookings, and our goal is to become the 1 in Network firewall, Secure SD-WAN, and OT security markets over the next couple of years. Fortinet is leading the trend of network and security convergence and cyber security consolidation. Gartner expects that by the year 2030 the secure networking market will be larger than traditional networking. Traditional networking lacks awareness and control of content, applications, users, devices, and location and is still using the same network protocol that was developed 50 years ago. Fortinet's secure networking solution has expanded from Next Generation Firewalls to SD-WAN, SD-Branch, 5G, internal segmentation, ZTNA and Universal SASE, and we believe, the secure networking market can achieve double-digit growth annually for the foreseeable future. In today's environment, organizations are looking to consolidate their multiple security vendors and functions that are deployed across their expanding attack surface to lower their TCO and management costs while improving visibility and automating real time threat detection and response. Fortinet's latest release of FortiOS 7.4 together with the FortiSP5 ASIC leads the industry with better integration and automation as well as faster acceleration while lowering total cost ownership. FortiOS enables organizations to deploy the Fortinet Security Fabric to every edge, allowing security to dynamically scale and adapt as the network evolves. Last month, we announced Universal SASE, which supports hybrid infrastructure and enables the same networking and security features that are available in our appliances to be delivered as-a-service, all within a single console. Many of our service provider partners are collaborating with us on this offering. Also, we announced enhancements to several of our Fortinet Security Fabric solutions, including endpoint security, cloud security, SoC, and SOAR. As networking and security continue to converge and customers looking to consolidate vendors and point products, we believe we are well positioned to achieve our 2025 billings target of $10 billion while generating an annual non-GAAP operating margin of at least 25% for each of the next three years. Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners, and suppliers worldwide for their continued support and hard work. Keith? Yes, also with the new FortiOS 7.4 that started launching, we started to have a more function. We can also enable much more new service going forward for both the current customer installation base and also for new customers. Also a point is very, you mentioned go back normal end of the year, we see later this year. It could be middle, could be towards the end, but in Q1 I'd say the operation team did a great job to reduce the backlog, which is also helping secure more customer and unload some cancellation rate. I think probably some of them will refer to the traditional network security, secure some enterprise, deployment enterprise, but we do see that our solution has a much broader use case and also expand much bigger market opportunities than the traditional enterprise firewall. And also the IT/OT is also see one of our strong growth, continue to helping drive both the new customer and also expanding the current existing customer. Also in the ICE and B [ph] space is a relatively greenfield. We also see pretty healthy faster growth probably even faster than the traditional enterprise, which is more replacement. I think all this I see contributing to pretty healthy, I keep saying double digit growth in the future for the whole security space. I would say from the quality architecture it's very different because security needs much more complete power and to handle the lot of unstructured data, which the traditional networking company, probably more based on some structured data handle, some fixed mix protocol and much less company power needed to process data compared with the network security. So that's where, and also we would have to implement the function and new function come up every year in the software first and then keep enhancing, improving performance leverage ASIC and that's also, we don't see networking company doing some of that. They probably maybe bit slow on where to come up the new function for the security space, all kind of have a different architecture to really supporting the secure computing needed for now security. So that's -- so far, have not seen the traditional networking company really come close. May be they did some acquisition, but so far I don't see they really come up too much since -- to meet a new demand from customer both on the function and also on the service, on the infrastructure change. Thank you. Yes. First of all, SASE kind of a vision is little bit different than some of competitors. We do believe need to be universal, need to be more broadly deployed and also more leveraged, a lot of service provider infrastructure. It's kind of a hybrid environment inside of a cloud only SASE solution. And we do keep on expanding some of our path because there's a, definitely, there's some user like whether depend on working from home as a mother or SASE to secure some of their traffic here. But on other side, there's a huge base of customer need to using SASE, our kind of service model, leverage both service provider out their current infrastructure and even onsite appliance. And so that's where in certain point we also see our FortiSwitch and FortiAP are kind of have a agent to helping for the traffic for the Forti [indiscernible] to process all this SASE traffic there. So that's where, that's the reason we kind of put SASE in a single OS, both on the networking side of function like [indiscernible] brand strategy and other plus the security like a CASB DLP, [indiscernible] service, all these things. So that's where we have a more integrated, more broadly distributed and leverage whatever the hyper infrastructure size solution there. That's also the reason we continue to build some other PoP. It's a little bit different than some other leverage certain cloud provider because we do see the cloud provider potentially also can be the service provider to offer SASE and also from the [indiscernible] I point of view even have a little bit more investment from the beginning to build on PoP our self, but long-term will be more profit model, so we have a better margin so that, so we will take some time to make sure we build a healthy ecosystem, both with our partner and also with the investment for long-term benefit. Yes we definitely see some healthy growth of enterprise agreement. And also we're working closely with our channel partner with our service provider also leverage their connection, their resource to build a healthy ecosystem to grow together. But I also see from enterprise level, they also see the benefit of consolidation, definitely. And also not just consolidate some of security product, but also on the expanded infrastructure go beyond the traditional network security. So that's also, we see pretty healthy growth like a cure, and we do see that we could enhanced technology side also has pretty healthy growth. Yes, the sales force also, you can see the number of 1 million deal both on the number and also on the dollar wise has a pretty healthy growth continue to accelerate and grow beyond the total building growths. So that's, that's a pretty healthy trend we see going forward to helping customer consolidate. Yes. Also our SMB [ph] had a pretty healthy growth. Like I said, the SMB is a more greenfield for the network security. We do see more and more SMB need and network security to protect their business, especially comes from some other ransomware attack. On enterprise because it's a kind of more replacement and also a lot of enterprise kind of maybe the bigger [indiscernible] how we're more dependent on the service. So that impacts some of the high end. And also the other benefit for some of the low and middle range is really most I would say most IC one and some of the OT deployment are maybe towards the low end, middle range. Thank you. Yes, we are, overall we look at both headcount and headcount cost, probably the same pace, company grow the top line, and also try to, at the same time try to improve in some efficiency there. So we're now looking for headcount growth above the top line, even with few, there's a few some question in the area. We also need to do some more investment, on time investment. But companies so far, we feel we have a pretty healthy finance model and this also could be the opportunity to also gain in some market share. Thank you. First we continue to invest in the U.S. enterprise. We also see it's a huge growth potential for us because we have relatively small market share and with all the strong product technology we have. On the other side, the big environment definitely slowed down some of the enterprise making certain decisions whether to refresh or something like that. But on the other side our solution has a better lower total cost ownership and also can expand beyond the traditional network security and also helping customers to consolidate. So I think all this combined together, we do see the U.S. enterprise definitely is a strong grow area for us. I think during the slowdown of some of the big environment, definitely the competitors starting do more aggressive whether on some discount or offer some free for some turn of the free some percentage of free service. But from all angle, we see we have much better product position, much broad like infrastructure coverage and better service, and also both on the performance angle. The product definitely has performed much better for the same function, same cost, and same time. The cost service also has much more value and costs lower than competitors. So for us, we have not experienced like price pressure or discount pressure. It is more about how we can increase the coverage, increase the lease and pipeline, and also to meet the customer need in this big environment change. It's a pretty strong growth. And also we're working with a lot of our service providers, both on the infrastructure side or our security service side, and offer the SASE because we do believe SASE should be a ecosystem with a lot of player instead of just a vendor offer their own SASE. Because a lot of I'd say probably most the customer, they prefer some of their data in process controlled themselves whether some privacy SASE or some data sovereignty, keeping the data within certain geo. So that's where we see the SASE approach, we call universal SASE gave the customer flexibility to offer both cloud based on primary space or kind of leverage service providing infrastructure will be more benefit for industry long-term. So that's where -- even sometime we kind of take a little bit more time to develop all the SASE function in the single always. But that's making more easy for the customer, for the service provider to deploy SASE to fit their need at their environment. So we see a very, very healthy pipeline and the strong growth kind of our salary growth. And that's also based on kind of a more healthy margin kind of model instead of do see money, all of our growth. So we want to maintain that model and also working closely with our partner to offer kind of a SASE together to the customer. We see the midterm model would be $10 billion building by 2025 and with non-GAAP operating margin at least 25% for each year in the next three years. Yes, SASE definitely is the one the, the use case especially the universal SASE or sometime they called a private SASE for some customer, they some service provider, they want to have a more control of their data. So that's we see is both SASE like the service model, customer benefit service provider has a big value-added that one, but at the same time gave the flexibility of what your full of force some traffic to the cloud or to the pop or have a process on premise and by the appliance. So that's, we see the huge benefit of universal SASE solution, which is very different than some other SASE player and a lot of customers and the partner were interest to at this universal SASE approach. Yes. Also from technology angel, we have a two huge advantage. One is for the internal segmentation of secure data center. So because the ASIC advantage we have, we can deploy in the very high speed environment which a lot of us find service provider, they do need secure their kind of internal segmentation there. The other part, really some of finance service also starting to supporting work from home, working from remotely, which we also have a large super solution with our ASIC based like a small appliance supporting this kind of our broad infrastructure approach combined with that, like SD-WAN or the other 5G, 4G network and security together. So that gave us huge advantage from the product angle. Probably both. Yes, we do see the expanding of both the unit and also upsell cross-sell of the entire for the Security Fabric, which has 53 product. So that's where both our internal sales force also partners setting were lot [indiscernible] across for the whole fabric. At the same time, because we combine networking security and more function together multiply case, which also the unit shipment also starting keeping grow quite nicely. Yes. Thank you."

            "name": "Keith Jensen",
            "content": "Thank you, Ken, and good afternoon everyone. Let's start with the key highlights from our strong first quarter performance. Our strong first quarter results reflect a continued demand for our broad portfolio of cybersecurity and networking solutions and the demand for consolidation and convergence that is delivered by our integrated, single platform strategy. Total revenue growth of 32% was led by strong product revenue growth and service revenue growth accelerating to over 30%. Billings increased 30%, our eighth consecutive quarter of at least 30% billings growth. Secure SD-WAN and OT bookings once again accounted for over 25% of total bookings. Our strong top-line results reflect continued customer demand across both Core and Enhanced Platform Technologies, and highlights the diversification of our business model by solutions, geographies, customer segments, and industry verticals. We continued to deliver balanced growth and profitability with better than industry average top-line growth and strong profitability despite the continued economic uncertainty. The first quarter operating margin of 26.5% represents the highest first quarter operating margin in our 14-year history as a publicly traded company. Free cash flow was $647 million, representing a margin of 51%, up 23 percentage points. Both the quarterly free cash flow and free cash flow margin are Fortinet post-IPO records. Last month we hosted nearly 3,000 customers and partners at our very successful Accelerate Conference and I'd like to recap three key themes: one the expanding firewall deployments environment; two, convergence; and three, consolidation. So starting first, today's rapidly evolving threat landscape and connectivity demands a comprehensive approach to firewalls and network security, including a combination of hardware, virtualized software, and security services. In fact, Gartner anticipates that by 2026, more than 60 percent of organizations will have more than one type of firewall deployment, which will prompt adoption of hybrid mesh firewalls. Fortinet is well-positioned to capitalize on this expansion of firewall deployments and form factors as we have been delivering hybrid mesh firewalls for years on a single operating system. Second, the company was founded over 20 years ago on the belief that the convergence of security and networking will become an industry standard. Gartner shares this belief noting they expect the size of the secure networking market to overtake the traditional networking market by 2030. We believe secure networking at scale works most effectively on ASIC technologies. Since its inception Fortinet has been developing proprietary ASIC technologies to build application-specific solutions to support convergence as traditional CPU-based solutions are less efficient at supporting both networking and security. Third, vendor and product functionality consolidation strategies continue to become more commonplace. Looking to Gartner here again, they note 75% of organizations are pursuing a cybersecurity vendor consolidation strategy in 2022, up from 29% in 2020. Our integrated FortiOS platform allows customers to converge networking functionality with security capabilities, while consolidating cybersecurity products and functionality. With FortiASIC's significant computing power advantage, FortiOS can consolidate more security functions and solutions while maintaining our performance and cost advantage. Specifically, FortiOS supports many security applications, including network firewall, SD-WAN, SASE, 5G, WiFi security, ZTNA, VPN, and SSL with a variety of use cases for each security application. For example, firewall use cases include data center, branches, edges, virtual, cloud native, micro-segmentation, both East/West and North/South and firewall-as-a-service. Our convergence and consolidation strategy provides security across our customers' entire digital infrastructure, while lowering their operating costs. Now let's now take a closer look at the first quarter. Billings grew 30% to $1.5 billion, driven by Enhanced Platform Technology solutions. In terms of industry verticals, government and financial services top the list as a percentage of total billings, with financial services up over 40%. Construction, media, and utilities were all up at least 50%. Billings growth benefited from a better-than-expected backlog contribution. While the backlog cancellation rate increased quarter-over-quarter, it was lower than we had forecasted in our model. We continue to believe there is an elevated cancellation risk in future periods for networking equipment backlog. Bookings grew double digits in the quarter, off a challenging comparison of 50% growth in the first quarter of last year. We continue to see success with our strategy to expand further into the large enterprise segment with the number of deals over $1 million increasing 38% to 124 deals and billings on these deals increasing 50%. One of these deals was an 8-figure expansion and upsell opportunity at a Fortune 50 retailer. The retailer was looking to replace their firewall point solutions with a holistic cybersecurity solution. After purchasing FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer in the fourth quarter of last year, this customer selected FortiGate VMs after a very competitive process for their 2,000 store locations as part of our new FortiFlex program. FortiFlex is a new points-based consumption program supporting hybrid mesh firewall deployments as well as a variety of other security solutions. The customer selected Fortinet due to the substantial value offered by our unified platform and their significant technical requirements. In the first quarter, we added approximately 6,100 new logos \u2013 reflecting the support of our channel partners through their investments and the investments we've made in them. Average contract term was flat year-over-year at 27 months and down 1 month quarter-over-quarter. Turning now to revenue, total revenue grew 32% to $1.26 billion, driven by strong demand for Core and Enhanced Platform Technologies, increasing 23% and 50%, respectively. Product revenue of $501 million increased 35%, despite the very difficult comparison to last year's first quarter at 54% with its very strong contribution from acquisitions. Product revenue growth was driven by strong growth in Enhanced Platform Technologies, improving supply chain dynamics, and our earlier pricing actions. Service revenue was up over 30% to $762 million, the highest growth rate in services since 2016. The average number of days between when a customer purchases and subsequently activates a security service contract declined slightly sequentially and remained elevated on a year-over-year basis. Service revenue growth was closely aligned with our short-term deferred revenue growth rate in recent periods. Short-term deferred revenue growth was over 30% for the fourth consecutive quarter. Total gross margin of 76.3% was up 190 basis points including a 440 basis point increase in product gross margin to 61.8%. Product gross margins benefited from earlier pricing actions, improved discounting, and easing cost pressures. Service gross margin of 85.9% ticked up 70 basis points as price increases offset increased investments in data centers and Points of Presence, or PoPs. Operating margin of 26.5% was up 450 basis points due to the strong gross margin performance, a foreign exchange benefit, and revenue growth that was 10 points higher than our 22% headcount growth. As previously noted, 26.5% is our highest ever first quarter operating margin as a public company. Looking to the Statement of Cash Flows summarized on Slides 7 and 8, free cash flow was a quarterly Fortinet record at $647 million and benefited from elevated receivables in the fourth quarter of last year and the subsequent cash collections, as well as the record-setting operating margin, and the timing of CapEx projects. Adjusted free cash flow, which excludes the real estate investments, was $662 million, representing a 52% adjusted free cash flow margin and our highest margin since our 2009 IPO. We have come to expect some quarterly variances in our free cash flow results with the first quarter often stronger due to the seasonally stronger fourth quarter billings. Capital expenditures were $30 million, including $15 million of real estate investments. This was lower than expected due to the timing of real estate activities. Cash taxes were $21 million. The Board increased the Company's share repurchase authorization by $1 billion, and the total available share buyback authorization is now approximately $1.5 billion for repurchases through February 2024. Looking forward, we are excited about the growth drivers that we have discussed previously as well as our new single-vendor Universal SASE offering. Our Universal SASE offering delivers a comprehensive solution that extends the convergence of networking and security from the edge to remote users while helping teams drive operational efficiency and reducing complexity and costs by consolidating vendors. In fact, Gartner predicts that by 2025, one-third of new SASE deployments will be based on a single-vendor SASE offering, up from 10% in 2022. As we bring Universal SASE to market, we expect to make various investments including increasing our PoPs. Our guidance reflects the impact of these investments to both our gross margin and capital expenditure estimates. Moving to guidance, I'd like to review our outlook for the second quarter and full year summarized on Slides 10 and 11, which is subject to the disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the second quarter, we expect billings in the range of $1 billion 560 million to $1 billion 600 million, which at the midpoint represents growth of 21%, revenue in the range of $1 billion 280 million to $1 billion $320 million, which at the midpoint represents growth of 26%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75.5% to 76.5%, non-GAAP operating margin of 24.5% to 25.5%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.33 to $0.35, which assumes a share count of between 790 million and 800 million, capital expenditures of $80 million to $110 million, a non-GAAP tax rate of 17%, cash taxes of $35 million, which is lower than our prior expectation as the deadline for certain tax payments has been extended to the fourth quarter. The second quarter guidance assumes backlog decreases during the quarter. For the full year, we expect billings in the range of $6 billion 750 million to $6 billion 810 million, which at the midpoint represents growth of 21%. This guidance assumes a low-single digit impact on billings growth from backlog. Revenue in the range of $5 billion 425 million to $5 billion 485 million, which at the midpoint represents growth of 23.5%, service revenue in the range of $3 billion $370 million to $3 billion $400 million, which at the midpoint represents growth of 28%. The service revenue guidance implies product revenue growth of 16%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%, non-GAAP operating margin of 25% to 26%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.44 to $1.48, which assumes a share count of between 795 and 805 million, Capital expenditures of $400 million to $450 million due to the continued cloud, data center, and facilities investments. Non-GAAP tax rate of 17%, cash taxes of $390 million with approximately $300 million in the fourth quarter. The full year estimates assume backlog returns to historical levels later this year. As we wrap up the prepared remarks, maybe one additional observation. Over many years the Fortinet team and its partners have offered a very solid and consistent level of execution across a wide range of economic cycles and other challenges. Like many others, we see a level of economic uncertainty in front of us and we look forward to this possible challenge in delivering on our goals. I'll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A session. FortiGuard,: By that I mean, the customer did register a little bit faster in the first quarter, but that lag or that registration policy change that we implemented in the first quarter, I would specifically call out is not really having an impact in the first quarter, nor did we really expect one. So kind of in order, I think it was selling into the install base price increases and then some light improvements in the registration behavior. Yes, I think in the guidance particularly as we look at the full year, it's kind of difficult to figure out exactly which quarter some of that backlog is going to end up in or be canceled. But for the full year, I think we talked about low single digit growth that would be coming from the backlog. I do think that the risk to cancellations increases as the year progresses, and by that I mean if a customer has only been in backlog for a week or a month or something like that, there seems somewhat less probability that they're going to cancel. But the longer it takes to deliver on that backlog, I think the cancellation risk continues to increase. Yes. I would say one just kind of as a general thought, I think that raising it to some extent I think probably gives you a little bit of a message that we feel good about our strategy and the execution that level that we can bring to the market. But more specifically and more tactically as we look through the second half of the year, there's probably a little more rigor and effort, if you will, in trying to look at what we see coming in the second half of the year. And I would give you that probably the two headlines that we're looking at. One is we're still very, very pleased with the pipeline. The pipeline continues to be well above anything that we're talking about, growth rates for the company for the full year. But I think the nuance that and maybe it's not even a nuance really that's coming into play now it is more about close rates. It's not just as simple as taking your pipeline and assuming you're going to have close rates that were at the same level they were in prior periods, and that's when we use the term close rates, not a suggestion that deals are getting lost, but this continual cycle that we seem to be in, where some of the larger enterprise deals in particular are taking longer, they're pushing out a lot of pushes. It's not that there's been an increase in losses, but the continual push. And so with that in mind, I think a fair amount of attention of looking at the full year guidance on what we really think our close rates may be for the second half of this year. Yes. And Saket, maybe just, this is Keith, just to go along a level deeper on what Ken is talking about there, and I'll give you maybe four quick examples. So yes, enterprise agreement is something that we've been doing now for probably a couple years. We track those in some ways as a different line of business in terms of the growth rates and particularly as we've moved into the enterprise, I think it's been very important to be there and we've been very successful with it. I think another illustration of trying to make it easier for customers was the example of the large retailer we gave in the call today. And we talked about the points program, right? Which is an easier way, I think, sometimes for them to, to get on board and consume more of the products. And I think also then when we sell, making sure that we're, our salespeople are well trained on the value proposition that we're offering, not just on the cost of the appliance or the throughput or the performance, but also what it means to the customers management costs and overhead costs as well. And so I think those types of things are all going into play here to support what Ken is talking about, about making it easier for customers to consume more products. Yes, great question and I think it didn't really look at the numbers closely this quarter we did last quarter. A couple things to keep in mind, the average contract term, call it 27 months, if all the contracts are 27 months, you could do that math, if they're not, some are one and some are three year contracts in terms of the renewals that are coming through. So, pardon me, one in five year contracts. Sorry, Peter. Thank you for that. So it does have a long tail and again, I'll refer you back to how many quarters or how a few years that we talked about seeing the uplift that came when we converted to 24 x 7 support from 8 x 5 that was something that continued to provide a benefit for several years. I think the tail gets smaller obviously as you go further out. I think the majority of what's -- of the existing contracts more than 50% are under the new pricing. Yes, it is well, financial services have always been one of our, I like to say, always been for a long time. They were in the top three and it can be a bit future famine there with some very large deals in the quarter. But I don't think there was anything that was -- it was number two in this particular quarter. Thank you, Peter. I don't think there were any really large deals that drove that number. I think it was, we saw growth and success not only in the U.S., but also internationally, particularly in Europe. And so I think it was a strong quarter for us in that area. So we talked about it, yes, we did. I think we talked about one in the script just a moment ago and I think we commented that was an eight figure deal, if I'm not mistaken, right, without giving a specific number. Yes and I don't recall if there was a second eight figure deal if there was a second. Yes, I think that we called out three things and maybe focusing on two; one, we had a very strong gross margin in the quarter and I'll elaborate on that in a moment. And then also FX, continues to provide a tailwind. More commentary about the gross margin, particularly the product gross margin as we move through, the supply chain challenges and then into inflation, et cetera. Over the last couple of years, I think we've talked publicly that our goal was to try and keep the product gross margin around 61% or so. The fourth quarter came in, obviously very low. We did not anticipate that we'd be able to time our price increases and the cost increases perfectly. So they went through the income statement in the same quarter, so to speak. And with that, I think you saw a little bit of pressure in the fourth quarter and then you saw it kind of revert in the first quarter. I think longer-term, we also look at product gross margin as an opportunity sometimes for us to continue to invest in growth. And I think we saw the first quarter gross margin, certainly well above that band that I just talked about. And with that in mind, and as we start to see some of the costs moving out of the equation, and we introduce new products, I think we'll be looking at that in terms of is there an opportunity there to make certain investments in growth while maintaining the margin commitments that we've talked about. Yes, I think OT, we do look at, I mean, you're always trying to organize your sales force around verticals, geographies, or what have you. And I think when we started to see the opportunity in OT several years ago, Patrice and Ken made a decision to start separating that out and having really a separate sales function and some people that specialize in that. I do think that we probably got some first mover advantages by doing that, particularly as we look at Europe and then quickly followed thereafter by the U.S. And yes, there are some large names that are in that space that are providing technology, not security technology, but technologies in the OT space that have been very receptive, if you will, to conversations and opportunities to meet with us. Yes. Well, first of all, I want to revel in the $600 million of free cash flow, which I've been doing it for some of more quarters, but I'm trying to let people know that a lot of the things fell our way in the quarter. There's always, the conversation in part of the sales cycle, if you will, the customers got a one-year, three-year, five-year deal. And certainly in a rising -- in an environment where interest rates have gone up, I think there's a lot more, many more conversations that exist, around payment terms and things like that. I do believe that, just as we just talked about in the second quarter of 2020 when COVID hit, we have a very strong balance sheet. We obviously have very strong margins, and it's appropriate for us to look at that, to that as opportunities to leverage our balance sheet and sometimes that may be in the form of extended payment terms or what have you, and our income statement in the form of, how we want to go about discounting and supporting growth. So I think that again, the strength that we've had, we have the ability to do those things. If the question is around what are we seeing from some of the enterprise customers, and Ken is seeing a lot of this as well, do we see deals that go from five years to three years? Sure. Is it more than we've seen in the past? I'd kind of look back at the contract term data point that we gave and say maybe, but not a lot kind of a thing. And on payment terms, the channel has always offered a financing function. I think they prefer to provide the financing function and then I think we provide support to the financing function to the channel by making capital available to them through payment terms. Yes, I would think that with, when Ken talks about the figures is fantastic. I think keep in mind, we don't, we have a very, as we kind of talked about prepared market, a very diverse customer base, if you will, between being international, between being very large, mid, small, and MSSPs, et cetera. So I don't want put a policy in place that covers every geography and it covers every customer size. And I think what you're really talking about here is something that for us represents 15% of our business, maybe just a little bit less. And because it's at that size, it's something that we can really more, I think, target our responses to as we get deeper into the selling function as opposed to some broad announcement that we're going to give away services for two years or something like that. Angie, can you repeat that? You cut out in the beginning of that question. Yes, I think the one thing, Angie, and I think answer about this before as well, keep in mind, two-thirds of the business roughly is service revenue. And that's producing a gross margin that's in the mid-80s. So, and that's, those are longer-term contracts. So I think the business model is such that we'd have time to react if there was something really dramatic that happened in the industry. But part of that's, for that to happen, I think you'd probably have to see some sort of shift in the behavior of the bad actors, the nation states, the organized crime groups, et cetera. And we don't see that's on the landscape. Yes. So as a reminder, Tal good to hear from you again, if you think of the business being, extremely diversified, whether that's geographically or by customer segments, one-third small, one-third mid, one-third large. We specifically called out in the script that we added over 6,000 new logos in the quarter. So obviously and that's probably a growth rate that's, easily into double digits. New logos take a while to really produce revenue for us, it tends to be, less than 10% of total revenue from the new logos. So it creates the opportunity to continue to sell into them. Kind of to Ken's comment a moment ago into your question here, do we see large enterprises in the U.S. still moving forward robustly with all their various digital transformation projects? I think that the, the word on the street is, that slowed down a little bit. And in that environment, I do think that incumbents sometimes have an advantage, but also a cost of performance argument and debate is something that you see customers perhaps more receptive to in the current macro environment It was flat year-over-year down one month, quarter-over-quarter. Which somebody reminds me of the room very politely. Every first quarter is down one month. Well, Ken and I are smiling at each other. We've had this conversation that they're I think I've been here for nine years as of this week. One thing I've come to appreciate is that Ken behaves like a long-term investor, and with that in mind owning critical real estate assets tends to have a better payback than leasing them over an extended period of time. Whether that's in R&D facilities, whether that's in manufacturing or warehouse facilities, or that as you, as we move into that, into the SaaS market as well as other cloud offerings it's not just investments in SASE, if you will, but it's also investments in larger data centers in order to deliver various, cloud-based services and solutions. And I think you've heard us talk about that the last several earnings calls and the guys of, data centers having an impact on margins for services and CapEx spending. So I don't think there should be a surprise there, but I think it is a, an indication of our looking to expand into, more fully into some of these other markets. Yes, I would say it's all the above. It's happening geographically. I think it's happening with customers that we took down earlier that are expanding with us, with additional firewalls and additional security or additional services as well. I think the market, if you will, financial services, if you step back and look at what's happening there, specifically the firewalls over the last several years, there's probably two legacy vendors there that when they're contracts are up for renewal and we've talked about this for a long period of time, now they're exposed. And it creates an opportunity to come in for a competitive displacement. And I think that some of the other comments or questions today is, is it more difficult in this environment for competitive placements? I mean, sure, you got to work a lot harder to make it happen. You got to make your value proposition more well known. But I think, again I think it's expansion. I think it's opportunity to displace incumbents and I don't think it's specific to any one particular geography."

We are pleased to report another quarter of strong execution and continued growth momentum, including record gross margin and operating margin with operation margin increased by 830 basis points to over 36%. Total revenue growth of 13% as we returned to positive building and product revenue growth. Unified SASE building growth of 14%, secure operation building growth of 32% and secure networking returned to positive growth all driven by a continued share gain in our total addressable market of $284 billion. As highlighted on Slide 11 of the investor presentation, Fortinet continued to be the only vendor to leverage a single operating system for the U.S., delivering solution with 5 secure network in dynamic quality report, secure service edge, SD-WAN, single vendor network firewall and Enterprise wireless line infrastructure. For the U.S., combined with proprietary for ASIC technology significantly boost secure computing power delivered 5x to expect performance than our competitors while lower customers' total cost ownership and energy consumption. In the third quarter, Unified SASE building was 23% of our business, up 1.5 points, driven by secured building growth of 220 with pipeline up 130%. Fortinet is the only vendor offering all SASE functions in a single operation SIM and providing a unified networking security stack on-premise and in the -- this allows FortiSASE to be deployed within minutes from our SD-WAN customers. Our SBS-based FortiSASE also enable sovereign SASE for service providers and large enterprise to deploy FortiSASE with their own data center for data privacy. In addition, we were recently recognized as a clear leader in the 2024 government magic quadrant for SD-WAN for the fifth consecutive year and notably position highest of all vendors in ability to execute for the fourth year in a row, leveraging leading position in firewall and SD-WAN and our integrated FortiSASE within the same FortiOS, provide easiest and most secure path for migrating from traditional firewall to secure SD-WAN and Unified SASE. [Indiscernible] invest in our global infrastructure over 3 million square feet of across office space, briefing center, operation facility and data centers. Our own hosting capability gives us a long-term cost advantage were allowing us to use our own Fortistack for better security and management. Security operation was our fast-growing pillar outpacing the overall market with a 32% building growth, accounting for 10.5% [ph] of our total business, up 2 points. We have expanded our secured operation portfolio with the launch of [indiscernible] which together represent a new $20 billion market opportunity. And we expect to cross-sell both solutions to a large installed base of customers. Our commitment to innovation and investment in R&D has enabled us to rapidly expanding FortiAI, our GenAI system into 7 key solutions. FortiAnalyzer, FortiManager, FortiSIM, FortiDLP and recently announced FortiNDR and FortiCNAPP. GenAI for FortiAI will be announced in early 2025, as Fortinet AI-based secure operation business are accelerating. Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners and suppliers worldwide for their continued support and hard work.\nKeith Jensen: Thank you, Ken. Thank you, Aaron and good afternoon, everyone. Let's start with the key highlights from the third quarter. We are very pleased with our strong execution and financial performance in the third quarter, repeating our second quarter performance by again achieving record gross margins and record operating margins while delivering top line results at the top of our guidance range. Total revenue grew 13%, driven by strong growth in services revenue and product revenues returned to growth. We again added over 6,000 new logos driven by the resilience of small enterprise customers and the strength of our robust channel partner, as you'll hear in a moment, we are pleased to again raise our revenue and operating margin guidance for the full year. And we believe we are on track to achieve our seventh consecutive year of exceeding the rule of 40. Looking at billings in more detail, RPO grew 15% to $6.1 billion and total billings grew 6% to $1.58 billion, driven by robust growth in security operations at 32% and Unified SASE at 14%. SSE and related cloud technologies, were again the fastest growers in Unified SASE, benefiting from our large SD-WAN customer base. Our Unified SASE and security operation pillars are gaining considerable traction with over 50% of their billings coming from our secure networking installed base and combining to drive our SaaS solution, organic ARR growth rate of 74%. The customer buying journey from FortiGate to SD-WAN to SASE supports our customers drive towards consolidation and is gaining traction. This consolidation journey first begins with a firewall in 40 OS and typically expands to SD-WAN and next to SASE. I should share that 2/3 of our large and mid-enterprise customers have deployed our SD-WAN technology, providing them with a gateway to FortiSASE. These are our customers, our first year of SASE delivered high mid-single-digit penetration rates, highlighting both the dramatic expansion opportunity as well as customer demand for vendor consolidation. Including all elements unified SASE, pipeline growth was over 30%. And while the SSE technologies are seeing pipeline and ARR growth of 130% and over 500%, respectively. Larger enterprises continue to drive our expansion into Unified SASE and the security operation markets with large and mid-enterprises representing 91% and 76% of SASE and Secop's billings, respectively. As we work through the wind-down of last year's backlog and the related year-over-year headwind to growth this year, secured networking has returned to growth as we expected. Rounding out the buildings commentary, SMB and large enterprise were our top 2 performing customer segments, while EMEA was our best-performing geography with double-digit growth. Among our top 5 verticals, manufacturing billings grew by over 20%, driven by OT billings of 119%. Retail returned to growth for the first time in 6 quarters, up 9%, while the service provider vertical reached its highest growth rate over that same 6 quarter period. Turning to revenue and margins. Total revenue grew 13% to $1.508 billion, driven by 19% service revenue growth and product revenues returned to growth. Service revenue of $1.034 billion grew 19% accounting for 69% of total revenue. Service revenue growth was driven by growth in our SaaS solutions, including 50% services growth in SecOps and 27% services growth in Unified SASE. Product revenue returned to growth for the first time in 5 quarters, increasing 2% to $474 million. Excluding the impact of backlog, product revenue grew sequentially at double-digit rates, outpacing historical norms for Q2 to Q3. And following a similar storyline on what we saw in Q2, with sequential growth also outpaced historical norms. A moment ago, we talked about solution consolidation and describe the customer's journey around firewalls to SD-WAN and on SASE. The second customer buying journey is supporting customers' convergence of security and networking. Their journey begins with Fortinet firewalls and expand to leverage our FortiLink technology to manage Fortinet switches and access points. It's worth noting that over 95% of our larger enterprise customers previously or simultaneously purchased FortiGate firewalls. At the same time, our switch penetration rate for these larger customers is around 50%, highlighting both our success and the future opportunity. Software license revenue continued its double-digit growth, driven by SecOp Solutions and represented a mid- to high-teens percentage of total product revenue. Combined revenue from software licenses and software services such as cloud and SaaS security solutions, increased 33%, accelerating from 32% in the second quarter and providing an annual revenue run rate of over $900 million. Total gross margin increased 630 basis points to a quarterly record of 83.2%, exceeded the high end of our guidance range by 320 basis points. Gross margin benefited from higher product and service growth margins as well as a 4-point mix shift to higher-margin service revenue. Product margin of 71.6% was also a quarterly record and increased 1,370 basis points which includes a 320 basis point benefit related to the renegotiation of supplier contractual commitments. Excluding this onetime benefit, the product gross margin would have been 6.4% [ph]. Service gross margin of 88.4% [ph] increased 130 basis points as service revenue growth outpaced labor cost increases and benefited from a mix shift towards higher-margin FortiGuard security subscription services. Operating margin increased 130 basis points to a quarterly record of 36.1% and was 360 basis points above the high end of our guidance range. Excluding the onetime benefit to product gross margins, operating margins would have been 35.1%. Taken together with our reported Q2 margins, the Q3 margins, excluding the onetime benefit, provide directional insights to our financial performance. Before moving on to the statement of cash flows, I'd like to provide a few details related to the impact of Lacework and next VLP acquisitions. These acquisitions increased Q3 billings and revenue by approximately 60 and 90 basis points, respectively and increased gross and operating margins by about 30 and 220 basis points, respectively. And as most decreased gross margin and operating margins. Looking at the statement of cash flow summarized on Slides 16 and 17. Free cash flow was $572 million, representing a margin of 38%. And adjusted for real estate investments, the margins came in at 40%. In the first 9 months of the year, free cash flow was $1.5 billion or $1.75 billion after adjusting for real estate investments. Cash taxes were $140 million, up $114 million, reflecting the prior year's regulatory extensions of estimated tax payments. Infrastructure investments totaled $36 million. The average contract term in the third quarter was 28 months, flat year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. DSO decreased 6 days year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter to 62 days, reflecting stronger than usual linearity. The $106 million gain on bargain purchase from the Lacework acquisition relates to NOL carryforwards and the related recognition of the deferred tax assets. The gain is excluded from our non-GAAP financials but it is included in the GAAP financials, adding $0.14 per share to our GAAP EPS. Share buybacks in the quarter totaled $600. And last month, the Board increased the share repurchase authorization by an additional $1 billion, bringing our remaining share repurchase authorization to approximately $2 billion. Now, I'd like to share a few significant wins from the third quarter. First, in a 7-figure upsell deal, an existing SD-WAN customer in the retail industry, continued their consolidation journey, adding FortiSASE for 16,000 users. This customer selected our FortiSASE solution for simplicity, ease of management and consistent security enforcement across our infrastructure. We outperformed the competition by leveraging our FortiOS operating system. Streamlining operations and reducing cost of ownership while showcasing our ability to consolidate multiple security functions onto a single platform. In another 7-figure win, a medical device company purchased FortiSASE to replace their existing solution. This customer chose Fortinet we simplified and consistent security management, significant cost savings and FortiSASE's enhanced functionality, particularly the bidirectional connectivity between their data center and remote users, enabling to push policies more effectively. In an 8-figure competitive displacement win, a multinational bank commenced their partnership with us by selecting our FortiGate firewalls and multiple set top solutions to secure their hybrid architecture. This customer was particularly impressed with our integrated security end-to-end visibility and automated response capabilities of our FortiOS operating system. Before discussing our guidance, I'd like to offer a couple of comments on the firewall recovery and refresh opportunity. During last quarter's remarks, we mentioned that the continued improvement in the days of registered FortiGuard contracts indicated the inventory digestion at end users was returning or had returned to normal. In the third quarter, this metric was stable, further validating our view that the firewall market is recovering. Today, we'd like to add to this commentary by noting that in 2026, a record number of FortiGates will reach the end of their support life cycle and we expect these customers to start to refresh cycle for these products sometime in 2025. Moving on to guidance. As a reminder, our fourth quarter and full year outlook which are summarized on Slides 19 and 20, are subject to the disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Aaron provided at the beginning of the call. Before reviewing our outlook, I should note, we expect Lacework and ex DLP for those acquisitions, Q4 billings and revenue by 75 and 135 basis points, respectively and decreased audit margins by 230 basis points. All right. For the fourth quarter, we expect billings between $1.9 billion and [indiscernible] which at the midpoint represents growth of 5%. Revenue in the range of $1.56 billion to $1.62 billion which at the midpoint represents growth of 12%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 79.5% to 80.5%; non-GAAP operating margins of 33% to 34%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.58 to $0.62 which assumes a share count of between $768 million and $778 million; capital expenditures of $100 million to $120 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of 17% and cash taxes of $127 million to $177 million. For the full year, we expect billings in the range of $6.43 billion, to $6.53 billion; revenue in the range of $5.856 billion to $5.916 billion which at the midpoint represents growth of 11%. Service driven in the range of $4.15 billion to $4.45 billion which at the midpoint represents growth of 19%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 80.3% to 81.3%, non-GAAP operating margin of 32.9% to 33.9%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.20 to $2.28 which assumes a share count of between $766 million and $776 million. Capital expenditures of $380 million to $400 million, non-GAAP tax rate of 17% and cash taxes of between $550 million and $600 million. I look forward to seeing you at the Analyst Day later this month and updating you on our progress in the coming quarters. I'll now hand it back the call over to Aaron to begin the Q&A session.\nAaron Ovadia: Thank you, Keith. As a reminder, during the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one on follow-up questions to allow others to participate. Operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Hamza Fodderwala with Morgan Stanley.\nHamza Fodderwala: Ken, I couldn't help another thing in your investor presentation, you talked about a market that you see over $200 billion, growing 12% over the next 4 years. Obviously, a big chunk of that growth is driven by the SASE market and your share in there. I'm curious if you could talk a little bit more about Fortinet's approach in terms of Sovereign SASE. How is that differentiated versus some of the competitors out there? And what is it that you're doing differently, particularly for those highly regulated verticals out there?\nKen Xie: Thank you, Hamza. It's a great question. We invest in the SASE for 5 to 10 years in the market, including our SD-WAN and also all the SASE function in the same FortiOS, both on-premise also in the cloud. So with huge differentiation without a competitor which they cannot run the SASE whether in the same OS or even different box. And that's for the sovereign SASE. We us call private SASE, actually -- if you look at probably 1 year ago, we were more focused on there with a lot of service provider which is quite important for them to play the SASE within own data center to process data and also to keep the data in their own kind of data center and also process also within our own data center. So that's the 2 important factor there. So they have to be local and to secure the data and same kind of pro data locally, so that's a huge advantage in the same OS and also a lot of function can use in FortiASIC salary. The other differentiation comes from the business side. So we are the number 1 on the network security firewall. We're also the number 1 on the SD-WAN. So leverage our installation base and also both the firewall function and also IT function the same OS with the SASE. So that for the customer, they have the most easy migration part from the traditional firewall vendor, I mean some traditional firewall customer to the SD-WAN customer go to SASE. It's only in a few minutes reconfiguration that can enable SASE based on their previous SD or the firewall contribution there. So it's a very easy migration path. As you can see, the pipeline growth and also the business is growing there from SSE like over 200% the pipeline grew over 100%. So we do believe we'll be the number 1 leader in the assays in the next few years.\nOperator: Our next question comes the line of Brian Essex from JPMorgan.\nBrian Essex: Stick to one topic. I guess either Ken or Keith, could you dig into the commentary around the firewall refresh cycle that you provided. So with respect to conversations you're having with customers and maybe with a little bit of color what you've seen historically, how far before the renewal point do customers tend to refresh? And do you have any insight into the mix of F&B, large enterprise service provider, retail and what the timing and the magnitude might be, whether this might be a first half event, second half event? Any kind of insight you could provide would really be helpful.\nKeith Jensen: Yes, I'll kind of jump in a little bit on this. I think that we see these end-of-life of these products starting in the second half of 2026. We don't expect the customers to wait until the 11th hour to make the change. For larger enterprises, they would go through another certification POC project perhaps as part of that before they place them in service. So we saw a similar -- not similar, we saw a lift, if you will, similarly in 2023, although the magnitude in 2026 is much, much larger. And why it's relevant to 2023 is that if you go back and look at product revenue growth in 2022, very different world, supply chain, switches, et cetera but I think in 2022, the product revenue growth was a little bit over 40%. So we do think there's a relationship there. We do think it starts earlier. To the second part of your comment, as I mentioned, the absolute number that we see in 2026 is by far the largest we've seen probably ever but certainly in the last 5 or 6 years. It is -- each year is dominated by the entry-level firewalls. However, in 2026, we do see a significant portion of that actually being in the mid-range firewalls as well. And that is a very unusual and positive situation. I don't have right -- I would break down by SMB or something else. So maybe, Christian, do you want to offer something more on that.\nBrian Essex: Or by vertical, I think you've mentioned before that you need large enterprise retail and service provider in order to recover. So if you have any insight there, how that -- how their cycles and spending patterns may impact, that would be helpful.\nKeith Jensen: Well, again, I think 2022 was a robust year for those industries that you just talked about retail in particular and partly manufacturing across the board. And I would expect that they would be active players, if you will, in the refresh cycle that we see in 2026. But Christian?\nChristian Agard: Yes. You were asking whether -- or how early customers would refresh. And many of the enterprise customers have enterprise agreements where they have account levels support and subscriptions. So they don't really wait until something expires. They will probably -- I would expect what we typically see refresh about ever before U.S. And for smaller customers, they will be try to wait until the contracts expire. But because we don't allow them to renew for less than a year, you also see the refresh cycles happening about -- yes, 15 to 18 [ph].\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani from Citi.\nFatima Boolani: Ken, a question for you. There was a discount about the routes to market in terms of gaining your market share within the SASE universe. And one of those important routes is leverage our installed base by converting and migrating a lot of the SD-WAN customers. So my question for you is how should we think about potential for the cannibalization of some of your refresh potential as that migration journey transpires from SD-WAN to SASE? And then I just have a follow-up for Keith, if I may.\nKen Xie: Very great question. I think if you look at the customer, a lot of SASE is really supporting the DTA and also remote growth environment. So they are not kind of like any network security firewall deployment which tend to be more in the office in the headquarter there. On the other side, it's most of -- if you look at our current SASE growing strong is most come from the current SD-WAN customer base or even the firewall customer base here. So that's where they do need a hardware firewall SD-WAN layer to support SASE with additional SASE user license with addition all these other functions service add-on there. So that's where we see like a 3 pillars, whether the secure networking side and also the SASE side which will help add additional service and plus the other we call the secure operations side, all kind of starting growing. So we do believe we can keep in grow in all these 3 areas faster than the market, keeping gaining market share, especially SASE, the technology we can put out in the same OS with AC to accelerate and also supporting both the cloud SASE -- private SASE or Sovereign SASE is a huge advantage. And also comment, we also believe eventually, the service provider carrier will play some important role in SASE and offer a lot of their own kind of SASE to their customer. And so that's where we have very strong support in all the service providers build their own SASE infrastructure. And we do -- it's a huge growth potential on top of traditional network firewall market.\nFatima Boolani: And just Keith, for you to double back on the end of support analysts around the refresh that you're talking to and telegraphing for 2026. Any way you can give us a lens on either the proportion of the shipment footprint or the installed base footprint or the customer footprint that this applies to in the aggregate?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. At the risk of taking all the fun out of the Analyst Day in 10 days, I would say the second -- 2023 was -- 2022 was the second best second highest I looked at. '26 is a little bit more than 2x '23. So you're not coming to the Analyst Day.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line from Saket Kalia from Barclays.\nSaket Kalia: Maybe for Keith or Christian, I think we mentioned as Solutions ARR growth number in the prepared remarks. Could you just remind us, is that an organic or inorganic number? And maybe just touch on what are the solutions that are driving that growth?\nKeith Jensen: Christian, do you want to...\nChristian Agard: Yes. So the growth number that Keith referenced was an organic growth number. We did not include the ARR that we acquired from Next DLP and Lacework. So the growth would be even higher year-over-year will be 150%. What are the solutions, the organic solutions that are driving this out, ARR growth is really FortiEDR, FortiClients, FortiNDR clouds, FortiWeb, so a variety of our cloud solutions and solutions that we've started to offer. Some of them are acquired, some of them are internally developed.\nSaket Kalia: Got it. Keith, maybe for my follow-up for you. Just to shift gears a little bit, it was great to see the profitability again. Could you just remind us what -- you mentioned something about being onetime in nature in the quarter. It sounded small but could you just remind us what that was? And more importantly, do you think about this as a more sustainable level of profitability?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think if I were to use the headline first, I would say the pro forma margins, if you back out that onetime benefit, product gross margin would have been about 68.4%, 68.5% and operating margin, if you backed out that benefit would be 35.1%. As you may recall, we have 2 different things that are impacting our margins in that regard. One is the traditional excess and obsolete inventory calculation related inventory you have on hand, that's pretty straightforward in comparison. The second one is Q2 deliverables. And the operations team has worked really hard with last year negotiating and renegotiating those. And we saw a benefit there that kind of pencils out to those margins I gave you in round numbers, we got a benefit there of about $15 million. That's very unusual. We've not seen that in the past.\nSaket Kalia: And anything on sort of the sustainability of that margin? And if that risk pulling anything from the I totally understand. But I wanted to make sure the question was asked.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think we feel really good about the profitability of the business. And I think it comes back to where those investment vectors that Ken and John Will and others are going to really focus on as we go forward and how we want to invest there. But I think we certainly have ample room to invest in the growth of the company.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani from Bank of America.\nUnidentified Analyst: You have Tomer Zilberman [ph] on for Tal Liani. Just wanted to ask about the billings guidance for next quarter. The organic billings ex Lacework and Next DLP came in well below Street expectations. Just wanted to ask where you see the weakness and how you measure that against the comments of seeing stable firewall demand this quarter and the expected refresh cycle in 2025?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. Great question. And I think what we're seeing when we look at the fourth quarter right now, we're really pleased with what we got out of the very first month of the first quarter. And I think that the second month is -- it's early yet, it's tracking. We're giving us pause or some chunky deals that are teeing up for the final month of the quarter. And they just need to mature a little bit before we start thinking about them as part of our guidance numbers. So I think it's really that population of large 7-figure and a few 8-figure deals that are kind of coming into play there a little bit.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. And maybe to follow up, asking more generally about the competitive landscape. We've seen over the last couple of quarters some of the larger vendors are now focusing even more on discounting, bundling and vendor financing. So how do you see the competitive landscape? Do you see pricing pressure because of that? And how are you participating with that as well?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think the -- maybe Christian will add a couple of comments here as well. But I think the discounting was very similar to what it's been in prior periods. As I mentioned, we certainly have ample margin to invest in a wide range of ways and we're encouraging our sales team and our channel partners to take part of that. But I think there's also been some other changes in terms of incentives that we offer as well. But maybe Christian have some thoughts as well.\nChristian Agard: Yes. I think that overall, the discounting will expect to be pretty stable. But of course, it depends on the product set a little bit. And then yes, we have incentives in the market for channel partners, specifically but also for our customers to -- yes, to buy more Fortinet solutions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges from Goldman Sachs.\nGabriela Borges: Keith and Ken, I wanted to ask you about the go-to-market. And more specifically, I think it's been about a year since you upleveled your sales force around SSD. What are some of your learnings? What do you think is working well? And what do you think is incrementally a focus as we go into 2025 where you think you can maybe up level some more?\nKen Xie: Yes. You can see the last 12 months, we made a huge progress in the SASE SSD go-to-market directly. But also, you can see Q3 some service provider also starting -- finally setting turn worth now and realize the importance of the SASE into their customer base. But it's probably still takes some time. But on the other side, we see our own customer base really like the SASE and very easy micro from the firewall in into -- so that's kind of probably 90% of our SASE business come from existing or security and also customer. And that actually helped us sell additional service, additional margin there. On the other side, the technology we have, whether the single OS, the ASIC sell all this function, it was advantage and to expand beyond traditional SASE market which is only focused on a cloud-based society. So that's where we see the -- whether the sovereigns probably says even beyond go to the edge computing area with our kind of technology with appliance also CE especially for the OT/IoT area, both the hardware agents, software agent who's supporting all these OT device, we see also a huge growth potential there. So that's why we're pretty confident. So we're leading the SASE market and just like we did in the firewall SD-WAN space.\nKeith Jensen: Yes, I think, Ken spot on with that. I think that if you vary contrast where we are today versus a year ago, what I would say is that given the response that we get from customers when they meet with us, they're very excited about the architectural design of SASE that we've taken. And what we really want now is just more at that. When customers sit down with us and hear that story, it resonates with them and you see that in some of the pipeline numbers and some of the ARR numbers that we're talking about which are still very early days. And I think part of it is getting more reference customers involved. And I think also the channel needs to -- we need to partner more closely with the channel to make sure that we're getting more advanced on those SASE opportunities.\nKen Xie: Yes. SASE also the infrastructure were also different than other competitor. I think -- like I said, we own the 3 million square feet of our own kind of facility which is our own data center can deliver the SASE function probably less than half compared to all the colon and then also kind of only 10% to 20% compared to some core provider but we're definitely working with them because they have also good coverage. So that's where, for us, we do have a cost advantage on the infrastructure side, plus on the OS technology on Acceleration can lower the energy cost within the data center within all the SASE processing, I think we do have a huge advantage, both on technology, from infrastructure and also leverage the business customer base we have on the firewall SD-WAN. So that's the advantage we have over our other SASE competitors.\nGabriela Borges: I think it's also interesting to note, like you said, we started really focusing on SASE a year ago, like Ken said, we've been building the solution for some time, of course. A year ago, at the November '23 earnings call right around that we broke out those 2 other pillars, Sassy and SecOps, externally and also internally to focus on those pillars. And you've seen really nice growth when we focus on solutions like that over the past year. It's only been a year -- and I think it's a little analogous when you think about kind of Fortinet's ability to execute. If you look at SD-WAN which we started to really focus on in 2018 and then we've risen to be the leader in the Garden Magic Quadrant, it steadily grew over time. And so I think that those past results delivered around SD-WAN are illustrative of what can do when they focus on things. And we've really been focused on SASE and SecOps for that year. And so I think -- we had really good results over that -- over the course of that year in a very short period a lot more focus to come going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal from TD Cowen.\nShaul Eyal: Ken or Keith, in your press release, you're talking about Fortinet being well positioned to lead in its 3 core growth barriers and drive sustained growth. Keith, again, I don't want to spoil the Analyst Day front run it in advance but sustained growth, what are we talking here? Low teens, mid-teens? Any color will be highly appreciated.\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I appreciate the opportunity to talk to it but -- and maybe Ken walks to a little bit, although I would probably be careful what he says. I think we'll, obviously, we'll talk about 2025 as we get to the February earnings call and we understand that the November Analyst Day is probably going to bake in some of the 2025 conversations. So I think that's -- it's a well-structured question but I think we'll pause on answering it for now.\nKen Xie: Yes, I agree. And so probably waiting for 10 days. And also you can in the investor slides, probably number 6, there's some information there. We'll probably provide more detailed information about total addressable market; how we want to grow faster than the market in each sector.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Owens from Piper Sandlin.\nRob Owens: Keith, I wanted to I guess, double back on your comments around Q4 and some of the chunky yielding up for the final month of the quarter, giving you a bit of caution. Was that not in your purview, I guess, when you were looking at the setup for the second half before? Have these things somewhat slipped relative to maturation, your ability to get them across the line. Just curious why the additional conservatism around them now?\nKeith Jensen: Yes, great question. And I do think that compared to what we've seen in other quarters, maybe a little bit less or a little bit slower progress on the maturation of those larger deals in the third quarter as they got teed up for the fourth quarter. Certainly not shutting them out. I just -- I think it's more prudent right now to take a more cautious approach and let them mature a little bit.\nKen Xie: It's another fact. It's really probably the first time we also started gave the RPO number and compared 1 year ago, some of the deal, probably Christiana can give more detail instead of finance from the channel, get a building right away for multiple deal, some of them may just using IPO just bill annually. Maybe Christian know this better.\nChristian Agard: Yes. As you can imagine, the customers won't pay years upfront. And so we have internal discussions around either getting the channel finance or do it ourselves and this is also not mature enough be comfortable guiding in that direction but gives us some pause because some customers just don't want to sign up for long periods without financing.\nKen Xie: This maybe has a little bit short-term impact but also benefit the company long term with better margin, better customer relation. So that's what we all looking for long-term success.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Catharine Trebnick from Rosenblatt.\nCatharine Trebnick: Can you discuss how your virtual firewall is performing this quarter or the trends for and competitively, we've been picking up that [indiscernible] have been doing a really good job with their virtual firewall. So how is that standing competitively with you?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think that the virtual firewalls have done very, very well. It is a component of Unified SASE as well as our network security portfolio. So -- and I think -- the other thing we look at is the crossover that we see which is a very strong relationship between [indiscernible]. Are you still there, Catharine? Well, I'll just finish the topic. I think another thing we will talk about later this month is just the strong overlap that exists between our enterprise customers that are buying both physical appliances and virtual appliances.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Borg from Stifel.\nAdam Borg: Great. Maybe for Ken, just on the Lacework FortiCNAPP offering now. I'd love to hear a little bit about initial customer feedback, partner feedback and kind of near-term R&D and sales and marketing priorities.\nJohn Whittle: Yes. I mean I think the feedback we're getting is similar to what we felt, this is John Whittle, by the way. What we found when we did our diligence, great product, great engineering team. It's an incremental TAM of $10 billion for us. So it really opens up that incremental TAM. Now we have out security, endpoint, network -- and we have great threat intelligence from all 3. So I think it's very, very positive feedback in terms of the quality of the product. We're continuing on the road map to improve the user interface in other areas and really make it a really, really, really strongly competitive product. I think it's very accreditive against some who have kind of pieced their solutions together based on multiple acquisitions forming their CNAPP solution. And so what we find is, in that context, oftentimes, we hear this feedback from customers a lot, they're not well together. It's reportedly integrated but it's not Lacework CNAPP Solution was largely developed organically by them to all seamlessly work to us. We're hearing really positives on that front. And then also versus other competitors, we do have this broad suite of products that we can offer together versus other kind of single point, single product vendors who just offer snap. So we have real differentiators against the others in this space that we see working to our advantage.\nKen Xie: Both company has a market-leading technology and the team there are also pretty strong. On the same time, also kind of bet as a company, so keeping hand-on solution -- integrated solution there and that's probably better than other competitors actually let our customer base, leverage our also strong R&D resource, both combined solution and also send a lot solution to supporting customer units, a new $200 billion total addressable market, I think it's definitely a huge growth potential, both in the in secure app but also in the SASE space.\nAdam Borg: That's great. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. Just on the government vertical. Obviously, 3Q is important for the U.S. Fed. I know the Fed is a little bit smaller of a vertical for Fortinet. But maybe talk about the government vertical more broadly in the quarter and how you think about it in coming periods?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. To your point, we're not really aligned with the U.S. part of the market for us, the government part is more state and local as well as international government. So you don't really get the same sort of 9/30 benefit that maybe some other companies see.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Patrick Colville from Scotia.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Joe Andrew [ph] on for Patrick Colville. Can you just talk more about how you're enabling or incentivizing partners to kind of lead with Fortinet SASE when they may already have existing relationships with more established vendors in this space?\nKen Xie: Yes, you can see the Follet channel partner, you can see a lot of the actuality is our partner for network security and also SD-WAN to the very easy upgrade class to SASE. And a lot of also compared to whether the cost, the security, the performance, the flexibility at the broad range, we're also not better than any other competitor. So it's quite easy to migrate from some of our competitors to Fortinet but we do see some kind of acceleration there. The other part is also we have a pretty big SMB customer base. SMB went up probably only single digit has any kind of network security deployment. We also see that's also one of the fast-growing areas because they do suffer a lot of runway out these contents. So we do see there's additional segment we can grow and at the same time for service provider for big enterprise to do this private solvency strategy, that's also one other competitor can offer whether in the same OS or the local data center deployment within the customer premise there. So that we feel we have quite some differentiation can give us huge advantage over other competitors.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Gallo from Jefferies.\nJoseph Gallo: It was great to see the OT grew 19% billings growth. How should we think about sustainability of that business? And then are there any changes in that competitive landscape?\nKeith Jensen: Well, I think that very bullish on the OT market but the leadership opportunity for us.\nKen Xie: Yes. OT is the other year, we already did the space in some report, we're the only leader in OT security. We do believe also investing this year for a long time. And also, we believe in the next 5 to 10 years, probably most connection will come from is a device level and which most of them probably have a difficult way to deploy the agent software on the have to use network security. So we see a huge opportunity this OT combined resulted edge computing with view, it's will be the strongest growing area in the next 5 to 10 years. And so leverage, whether the OS or ASIC technology and also the infrastructure we have, we feel there is a huge opportunity there. We'll be driving or definitely to have the long-term amount of growth.\nJoseph Gallo: And then maybe just to double-click on retail and some of the verticals. It was great to see that, that grew for the first time, I think, 6 quarters. Now that we're post-election? Like are there any verticals that you expect to rebound? Or are there any changes going forward over the next couple of quarters that we should expect?\nKen Xie: We see the manufacturer already pretty strong in Q3. We feel the postelection properties as we also begin accelerating there. Also, the other one like a carrier service provider is out of the market. We still finally see some growth after probably 6 quarters. And probably some other like retail, like it's pretty strong growth in 2001, 2002 -- 2021, 2022, almost by the 100% growth in some [indiscernible]. So I think like that's probably will be most statin the refreshing cycle studying whether next year or '26, because we see the number of units in that space registered in a go through most like 4 years, we probably more reach to the time to refresh now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman from BMO.\nKeith Bachman: I wanted to ask two questions; sort of a micro and a macro and I'll just ask them concurrently in the interest of time. Keith, just on the SaaS penetration. You indicated on Slide 9, about 45% is with large enterprise. If you took out the SD -- and it's a very impressive figure. If you took out the SD-WAN. What would that penetration rate or share look like in terms of customer type? I'm just -- I'm trying to understand the SD-WAN versus the other bucket. And then the second question is a broader question but how are you thinking about Europe as you look out over the next quarter or 2? I know it's T plus 1 in terms of the election and what economic growth may be as a consequence. But just how are you looking at Europe over the next couple of quarters, not just in Q4? And that's it for me.\nKeith Jensen: Yes, maybe we've confused you or I confuse myself on Slide 9. I don't think that's showing penetration, the mix of customers.\nKeith Bachman: Yes. That's what -- sorry, that's what I meant but what would the -- just a mix of customers, if you took out SD-WAN of the SASE piece alone?\nKeith Jensen: You're going to find a mix of customers that more tilted to the larger enterprises, if you look at SASE alone than when you look at the entire universe would be my expectation. I think we said. It has -- when you look at dollar values, right, not customer accounts. Yes, Europe -- I mean, Europe was -- I think we mentioned on the call, international EMEA was number one. I think U.S. was number 2 in Europe is right behind them on number 3. It's a little bit like the SMB headlines that we talk about every quarter that the economy is well every worries about SMB and it continues to do well. I'm not saying there aren't pressures in Europe. And as we look forward to the fourth quarter, I don't know that we're expecting anything like an outsized performance from Europe but we'll see how the quarter comes out.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Janice Quek from CFRA [ph].\nUnidentified Analyst: I just want to drill down in your hardware appliances. And if you can maybe just give us a little bit more color how the high-end family performed versus the midrange and the lower end?\nKeith Jensen: Good question. Looking for some numbers real quick here. So overall, I would say, mid-range and high-end has continued to be stable but not outgrow. We had a little bit more unit shipment in the end. I guess what we're saying is it's not going to jump off the page when we look at our numbers.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Gray Powell with BTIG.\nGray Powell: So yes, it was really helpful to see the product level is growth rate disclosures on the slide deck. Within Universal Sassy, -- could you maybe give us a ballpark sense as to how fast the SD-WAN piece is growing? My understanding is that that's probably been under pressure over the last 18 months. So I guess my question is really like, do you see potential for that product to reaccelerate, particularly as VMware customers start looking for alternative solutions?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think we're -- if you look at our SD-WAN space and we -- I think we made reference to the penetration in the larger enterprises that something on the order of 65% or 70%. That is of our customer base. Greg, as you're pointing out, the opportunity for us to see greater growth here is by -- in white space accounts and bringing them on board with the FortiGate and SD-WAN solution and starting them on that customer journey that goes FortiGate SD-WAN SASE. I think you're going to get some renewals from the early adopters of SD-WAN here as we start looking into 2025 and into 2026, that would be natural. I think that those same -- just as we're going through a renewal cycle for SD-WAN, our competitors will be also and we've historically shown where we have a superior product like SD-WAN, that's an opportunity for us to just lodge the incumbents.\nKen Xie: Yes, agree. If you look at the top 5 SD-WAN provider, we are the other one internally developed in with security and also the strategy of these things on the other comp acquisition, a lot of content also being sold after a core some of SD-WAN. So they're kind of a function of technology already stop developing in a few years now. And come up the refresh, we do see a huge opportunity. It's still very fragmented space but we do see a lot of replacement opportunity deal right now. And we also feel we are not only leading technology but also performance cost, energy consumption. So that's why we feel the SD-WAN, we're keeping accelerating and grow faster than the market, gaining market share there.\nOperator: This does conclude the question-and-answer portion. I will now turn it back over to Aaron for closing remarks.\nAaron Ovadia: Thank you. I'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call. As a reminder, we will be holding an Analyst Day on November 18, marking our 15-year IPO anniversary, where we will share the company's vision for the future of cybersecurity and provide an update on our strategy and midterm financial model. We will also be attending investor conferences hosted by Barclays, Needham, Scotiabank and Wells Fargo during the fourth quarter. The webcast link will be posted on the Events and Presentations section of Fortinet's Investor Relations website. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to contact me. Have a great rest of your day.\nOperator: This concludes the conference call. Thank you for being here. You are now flying to disconnect.",

            "name": "Ken Xie",
            "content": "Thank you, Aaron and thank you to everyone for joining our call. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong execution and continued growth momentum, including record gross margin and operating margin with operation margin increased by 830 basis points to over 36%. Total revenue growth of 13% as we returned to positive building and product revenue growth. Unified SASE building growth of 14%, secure operation building growth of 32% and secure networking returned to positive growth all driven by a continued share gain in our total addressable market of $284 billion. As highlighted on Slide 11 of the investor presentation, Fortinet continued to be the only vendor to leverage a single operating system for the U.S., delivering solution with 5 secure network in dynamic quality report, secure service edge, SD-WAN, single vendor network firewall and Enterprise wireless line infrastructure. For the U.S., combined with proprietary for ASIC technology significantly boost secure computing power delivered 5x to expect performance than our competitors while lower customers' total cost ownership and energy consumption. In the third quarter, Unified SASE building was 23% of our business, up 1.5 points, driven by secured building growth of 220 with pipeline up 130%. Fortinet is the only vendor offering all SASE functions in a single operation SIM and providing a unified networking security stack on-premise and in the -- this allows FortiSASE to be deployed within minutes from our SD-WAN customers. Our SBS-based FortiSASE also enable sovereign SASE for service providers and large enterprise to deploy FortiSASE with their own data center for data privacy. In addition, we were recently recognized as a clear leader in the 2024 government magic quadrant for SD-WAN for the fifth consecutive year and notably position highest of all vendors in ability to execute for the fourth year in a row, leveraging leading position in firewall and SD-WAN and our integrated FortiSASE within the same FortiOS, provide easiest and most secure path for migrating from traditional firewall to secure SD-WAN and Unified SASE. [Indiscernible] invest in our global infrastructure over 3 million square feet of across office space, briefing center, operation facility and data centers. Our own hosting capability gives us a long-term cost advantage were allowing us to use our own Fortistack for better security and management. Security operation was our fast-growing pillar outpacing the overall market with a 32% building growth, accounting for 10.5% [ph] of our total business, up 2 points. We have expanded our secured operation portfolio with the launch of [indiscernible] which together represent a new $20 billion market opportunity. And we expect to cross-sell both solutions to a large installed base of customers. Our commitment to innovation and investment in R&D has enabled us to rapidly expanding FortiAI, our GenAI system into 7 key solutions. FortiAnalyzer, FortiManager, FortiSIM, FortiDLP and recently announced FortiNDR and FortiCNAPP. GenAI for FortiAI will be announced in early 2025, as Fortinet AI-based secure operation business are accelerating. Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners and suppliers worldwide for their continued support and hard work. Thank you, Hamza. It's a great question. We invest in the SASE for 5 to 10 years in the market, including our SD-WAN and also all the SASE function in the same FortiOS, both on-premise also in the cloud. So with huge differentiation without a competitor which they cannot run the SASE whether in the same OS or even different box. And that's for the sovereign SASE. We us call private SASE, actually -- if you look at probably 1 year ago, we were more focused on there with a lot of service provider which is quite important for them to play the SASE within own data center to process data and also to keep the data in their own kind of data center and also process also within our own data center. So that's the 2 important factor there. So they have to be local and to secure the data and same kind of pro data locally, so that's a huge advantage in the same OS and also a lot of function can use in FortiASIC salary. The other differentiation comes from the business side. So we are the number 1 on the network security firewall. We're also the number 1 on the SD-WAN. So leverage our installation base and also both the firewall function and also IT function the same OS with the SASE. So that for the customer, they have the most easy migration part from the traditional firewall vendor, I mean some traditional firewall customer to the SD-WAN customer go to SASE. It's only in a few minutes reconfiguration that can enable SASE based on their previous SD or the firewall contribution there. So it's a very easy migration path. As you can see, the pipeline growth and also the business is growing there from SSE like over 200% the pipeline grew over 100%. So we do believe we'll be the number 1 leader in the assays in the next few years. Very great question. I think if you look at the customer, a lot of SASE is really supporting the DTA and also remote growth environment. So they are not kind of like any network security firewall deployment which tend to be more in the office in the headquarter there. On the other side, it's most of -- if you look at our current SASE growing strong is most come from the current SD-WAN customer base or even the firewall customer base here. So that's where they do need a hardware firewall SD-WAN layer to support SASE with additional SASE user license with addition all these other functions service add-on there. So that's where we see like a 3 pillars, whether the secure networking side and also the SASE side which will help add additional service and plus the other we call the secure operations side, all kind of starting growing. So we do believe we can keep in grow in all these 3 areas faster than the market, keeping gaining market share, especially SASE, the technology we can put out in the same OS with AC to accelerate and also supporting both the cloud SASE -- private SASE or Sovereign SASE is a huge advantage. And also comment, we also believe eventually, the service provider carrier will play some important role in SASE and offer a lot of their own kind of SASE to their customer. And so that's where we have very strong support in all the service providers build their own SASE infrastructure. And we do -- it's a huge growth potential on top of traditional network firewall market. Yes. You can see the last 12 months, we made a huge progress in the SASE SSD go-to-market directly. But also, you can see Q3 some service provider also starting -- finally setting turn worth now and realize the importance of the SASE into their customer base. But it's probably still takes some time. But on the other side, we see our own customer base really like the SASE and very easy micro from the firewall in into -- so that's kind of probably 90% of our SASE business come from existing or security and also customer. And that actually helped us sell additional service, additional margin there. On the other side, the technology we have, whether the single OS, the ASIC sell all this function, it was advantage and to expand beyond traditional SASE market which is only focused on a cloud-based society. So that's where we see the -- whether the sovereigns probably says even beyond go to the edge computing area with our kind of technology with appliance also CE especially for the OT/IoT area, both the hardware agents, software agent who's supporting all these OT device, we see also a huge growth potential there. So that's why we're pretty confident. So we're leading the SASE market and just like we did in the firewall SD-WAN space. Yes. SASE also the infrastructure were also different than other competitor. I think -- like I said, we own the 3 million square feet of our own kind of facility which is our own data center can deliver the SASE function probably less than half compared to all the colon and then also kind of only 10% to 20% compared to some core provider but we're definitely working with them because they have also good coverage. So that's where, for us, we do have a cost advantage on the infrastructure side, plus on the OS technology on Acceleration can lower the energy cost within the data center within all the SASE processing, I think we do have a huge advantage, both on technology, from infrastructure and also leverage the business customer base we have on the firewall SD-WAN. So that's the advantage we have over our other SASE competitors. Yes, I agree. And so probably waiting for 10 days. And also you can in the investor slides, probably number 6, there's some information there. We'll probably provide more detailed information about total addressable market; how we want to grow faster than the market in each sector. It's another fact. It's really probably the first time we also started gave the RPO number and compared 1 year ago, some of the deal, probably Christiana can give more detail instead of finance from the channel, get a building right away for multiple deal, some of them may just using IPO just bill annually. Maybe Christian know this better. This maybe has a little bit short-term impact but also benefit the company long term with better margin, better customer relation. So that's what we all looking for long-term success. Both company has a market-leading technology and the team there are also pretty strong. On the same time, also kind of bet as a company, so keeping hand-on solution -- integrated solution there and that's probably better than other competitors actually let our customer base, leverage our also strong R&D resource, both combined solution and also send a lot solution to supporting customer units, a new $200 billion total addressable market, I think it's definitely a huge growth potential, both in the in secure app but also in the SASE space. Yes, you can see the Follet channel partner, you can see a lot of the actuality is our partner for network security and also SD-WAN to the very easy upgrade class to SASE. And a lot of also compared to whether the cost, the security, the performance, the flexibility at the broad range, we're also not better than any other competitor. So it's quite easy to migrate from some of our competitors to Fortinet but we do see some kind of acceleration there. The other part is also we have a pretty big SMB customer base. SMB went up probably only single digit has any kind of network security deployment. We also see that's also one of the fast-growing areas because they do suffer a lot of runway out these contents. So we do see there's additional segment we can grow and at the same time for service provider for big enterprise to do this private solvency strategy, that's also one other competitor can offer whether in the same OS or the local data center deployment within the customer premise there. So that we feel we have quite some differentiation can give us huge advantage over other competitors. Yes. OT is the other year, we already did the space in some report, we're the only leader in OT security. We do believe also investing this year for a long time. And also, we believe in the next 5 to 10 years, probably most connection will come from is a device level and which most of them probably have a difficult way to deploy the agent software on the have to use network security. So we see a huge opportunity this OT combined resulted edge computing with view, it's will be the strongest growing area in the next 5 to 10 years. And so leverage, whether the OS or ASIC technology and also the infrastructure we have, we feel there is a huge opportunity there. We'll be driving or definitely to have the long-term amount of growth. We see the manufacturer already pretty strong in Q3. We feel the postelection properties as we also begin accelerating there. Also, the other one like a carrier service provider is out of the market. We still finally see some growth after probably 6 quarters. And probably some other like retail, like it's pretty strong growth in 2001, 2002 -- 2021, 2022, almost by the 100% growth in some [indiscernible]. So I think like that's probably will be most statin the refreshing cycle studying whether next year or '26, because we see the number of units in that space registered in a go through most like 4 years, we probably more reach to the time to refresh now. Yes, agree. If you look at the top 5 SD-WAN provider, we are the other one internally developed in with security and also the strategy of these things on the other comp acquisition, a lot of content also being sold after a core some of SD-WAN. So they're kind of a function of technology already stop developing in a few years now. And come up the refresh, we do see a huge opportunity. It's still very fragmented space but we do see a lot of replacement opportunity deal right now. And we also feel we are not only leading technology but also performance cost, energy consumption. So that's why we feel the SD-WAN, we're keeping accelerating and grow faster than the market, gaining market share there."

            "name": "Keith Jensen",
            "content": "Thank you, Ken. Thank you, Aaron and good afternoon, everyone. Let's start with the key highlights from the third quarter. We are very pleased with our strong execution and financial performance in the third quarter, repeating our second quarter performance by again achieving record gross margins and record operating margins while delivering top line results at the top of our guidance range. Total revenue grew 13%, driven by strong growth in services revenue and product revenues returned to growth. We again added over 6,000 new logos driven by the resilience of small enterprise customers and the strength of our robust channel partner, as you'll hear in a moment, we are pleased to again raise our revenue and operating margin guidance for the full year. And we believe we are on track to achieve our seventh consecutive year of exceeding the rule of 40. Looking at billings in more detail, RPO grew 15% to $6.1 billion and total billings grew 6% to $1.58 billion, driven by robust growth in security operations at 32% and Unified SASE at 14%. SSE and related cloud technologies, were again the fastest growers in Unified SASE, benefiting from our large SD-WAN customer base. Our Unified SASE and security operation pillars are gaining considerable traction with over 50% of their billings coming from our secure networking installed base and combining to drive our SaaS solution, organic ARR growth rate of 74%. The customer buying journey from FortiGate to SD-WAN to SASE supports our customers drive towards consolidation and is gaining traction. This consolidation journey first begins with a firewall in 40 OS and typically expands to SD-WAN and next to SASE. I should share that 2/3 of our large and mid-enterprise customers have deployed our SD-WAN technology, providing them with a gateway to FortiSASE. These are our customers, our first year of SASE delivered high mid-single-digit penetration rates, highlighting both the dramatic expansion opportunity as well as customer demand for vendor consolidation. Including all elements unified SASE, pipeline growth was over 30%. And while the SSE technologies are seeing pipeline and ARR growth of 130% and over 500%, respectively. Larger enterprises continue to drive our expansion into Unified SASE and the security operation markets with large and mid-enterprises representing 91% and 76% of SASE and Secop's billings, respectively. As we work through the wind-down of last year's backlog and the related year-over-year headwind to growth this year, secured networking has returned to growth as we expected. Rounding out the buildings commentary, SMB and large enterprise were our top 2 performing customer segments, while EMEA was our best-performing geography with double-digit growth. Among our top 5 verticals, manufacturing billings grew by over 20%, driven by OT billings of 119%. Retail returned to growth for the first time in 6 quarters, up 9%, while the service provider vertical reached its highest growth rate over that same 6 quarter period. Turning to revenue and margins. Total revenue grew 13% to $1.508 billion, driven by 19% service revenue growth and product revenues returned to growth. Service revenue of $1.034 billion grew 19% accounting for 69% of total revenue. Service revenue growth was driven by growth in our SaaS solutions, including 50% services growth in SecOps and 27% services growth in Unified SASE. Product revenue returned to growth for the first time in 5 quarters, increasing 2% to $474 million. Excluding the impact of backlog, product revenue grew sequentially at double-digit rates, outpacing historical norms for Q2 to Q3. And following a similar storyline on what we saw in Q2, with sequential growth also outpaced historical norms. A moment ago, we talked about solution consolidation and describe the customer's journey around firewalls to SD-WAN and on SASE. The second customer buying journey is supporting customers' convergence of security and networking. Their journey begins with Fortinet firewalls and expand to leverage our FortiLink technology to manage Fortinet switches and access points. It's worth noting that over 95% of our larger enterprise customers previously or simultaneously purchased FortiGate firewalls. At the same time, our switch penetration rate for these larger customers is around 50%, highlighting both our success and the future opportunity. Software license revenue continued its double-digit growth, driven by SecOp Solutions and represented a mid- to high-teens percentage of total product revenue. Combined revenue from software licenses and software services such as cloud and SaaS security solutions, increased 33%, accelerating from 32% in the second quarter and providing an annual revenue run rate of over $900 million. Total gross margin increased 630 basis points to a quarterly record of 83.2%, exceeded the high end of our guidance range by 320 basis points. Gross margin benefited from higher product and service growth margins as well as a 4-point mix shift to higher-margin service revenue. Product margin of 71.6% was also a quarterly record and increased 1,370 basis points which includes a 320 basis point benefit related to the renegotiation of supplier contractual commitments. Excluding this onetime benefit, the product gross margin would have been 6.4% [ph]. Service gross margin of 88.4% [ph] increased 130 basis points as service revenue growth outpaced labor cost increases and benefited from a mix shift towards higher-margin FortiGuard security subscription services. Operating margin increased 130 basis points to a quarterly record of 36.1% and was 360 basis points above the high end of our guidance range. Excluding the onetime benefit to product gross margins, operating margins would have been 35.1%. Taken together with our reported Q2 margins, the Q3 margins, excluding the onetime benefit, provide directional insights to our financial performance. Before moving on to the statement of cash flows, I'd like to provide a few details related to the impact of Lacework and next VLP acquisitions. These acquisitions increased Q3 billings and revenue by approximately 60 and 90 basis points, respectively and increased gross and operating margins by about 30 and 220 basis points, respectively. And as most decreased gross margin and operating margins. Looking at the statement of cash flow summarized on Slides 16 and 17. Free cash flow was $572 million, representing a margin of 38%. And adjusted for real estate investments, the margins came in at 40%. In the first 9 months of the year, free cash flow was $1.5 billion or $1.75 billion after adjusting for real estate investments. Cash taxes were $140 million, up $114 million, reflecting the prior year's regulatory extensions of estimated tax payments. Infrastructure investments totaled $36 million. The average contract term in the third quarter was 28 months, flat year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. DSO decreased 6 days year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter to 62 days, reflecting stronger than usual linearity. The $106 million gain on bargain purchase from the Lacework acquisition relates to NOL carryforwards and the related recognition of the deferred tax assets. The gain is excluded from our non-GAAP financials but it is included in the GAAP financials, adding $0.14 per share to our GAAP EPS. Share buybacks in the quarter totaled $600. And last month, the Board increased the share repurchase authorization by an additional $1 billion, bringing our remaining share repurchase authorization to approximately $2 billion. Now, I'd like to share a few significant wins from the third quarter. First, in a 7-figure upsell deal, an existing SD-WAN customer in the retail industry, continued their consolidation journey, adding FortiSASE for 16,000 users. This customer selected our FortiSASE solution for simplicity, ease of management and consistent security enforcement across our infrastructure. We outperformed the competition by leveraging our FortiOS operating system. Streamlining operations and reducing cost of ownership while showcasing our ability to consolidate multiple security functions onto a single platform. In another 7-figure win, a medical device company purchased FortiSASE to replace their existing solution. This customer chose Fortinet we simplified and consistent security management, significant cost savings and FortiSASE's enhanced functionality, particularly the bidirectional connectivity between their data center and remote users, enabling to push policies more effectively. In an 8-figure competitive displacement win, a multinational bank commenced their partnership with us by selecting our FortiGate firewalls and multiple set top solutions to secure their hybrid architecture. This customer was particularly impressed with our integrated security end-to-end visibility and automated response capabilities of our FortiOS operating system. Before discussing our guidance, I'd like to offer a couple of comments on the firewall recovery and refresh opportunity. During last quarter's remarks, we mentioned that the continued improvement in the days of registered FortiGuard contracts indicated the inventory digestion at end users was returning or had returned to normal. In the third quarter, this metric was stable, further validating our view that the firewall market is recovering. Today, we'd like to add to this commentary by noting that in 2026, a record number of FortiGates will reach the end of their support life cycle and we expect these customers to start to refresh cycle for these products sometime in 2025. Moving on to guidance. As a reminder, our fourth quarter and full year outlook which are summarized on Slides 19 and 20, are subject to the disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Aaron provided at the beginning of the call. Before reviewing our outlook, I should note, we expect Lacework and ex DLP for those acquisitions, Q4 billings and revenue by 75 and 135 basis points, respectively and decreased audit margins by 230 basis points. All right. For the fourth quarter, we expect billings between $1.9 billion and [indiscernible] which at the midpoint represents growth of 5%. Revenue in the range of $1.56 billion to $1.62 billion which at the midpoint represents growth of 12%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 79.5% to 80.5%; non-GAAP operating margins of 33% to 34%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.58 to $0.62 which assumes a share count of between $768 million and $778 million; capital expenditures of $100 million to $120 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of 17% and cash taxes of $127 million to $177 million. For the full year, we expect billings in the range of $6.43 billion, to $6.53 billion; revenue in the range of $5.856 billion to $5.916 billion which at the midpoint represents growth of 11%. Service driven in the range of $4.15 billion to $4.45 billion which at the midpoint represents growth of 19%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 80.3% to 81.3%, non-GAAP operating margin of 32.9% to 33.9%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.20 to $2.28 which assumes a share count of between $766 million and $776 million. Capital expenditures of $380 million to $400 million, non-GAAP tax rate of 17% and cash taxes of between $550 million and $600 million. I look forward to seeing you at the Analyst Day later this month and updating you on our progress in the coming quarters. I'll now hand it back the call over to Aaron to begin the Q&A session. Yes, I'll kind of jump in a little bit on this. I think that we see these end-of-life of these products starting in the second half of 2026. We don't expect the customers to wait until the 11th hour to make the change. For larger enterprises, they would go through another certification POC project perhaps as part of that before they place them in service. So we saw a similar -- not similar, we saw a lift, if you will, similarly in 2023, although the magnitude in 2026 is much, much larger. And why it's relevant to 2023 is that if you go back and look at product revenue growth in 2022, very different world, supply chain, switches, et cetera but I think in 2022, the product revenue growth was a little bit over 40%. So we do think there's a relationship there. We do think it starts earlier. To the second part of your comment, as I mentioned, the absolute number that we see in 2026 is by far the largest we've seen probably ever but certainly in the last 5 or 6 years. It is -- each year is dominated by the entry-level firewalls. However, in 2026, we do see a significant portion of that actually being in the mid-range firewalls as well. And that is a very unusual and positive situation. I don't have right -- I would break down by SMB or something else. So maybe, Christian, do you want to offer something more on that. Well, again, I think 2022 was a robust year for those industries that you just talked about retail in particular and partly manufacturing across the board. And I would expect that they would be active players, if you will, in the refresh cycle that we see in 2026. But Christian? Yes. At the risk of taking all the fun out of the Analyst Day in 10 days, I would say the second -- 2023 was -- 2022 was the second best second highest I looked at. '26 is a little bit more than 2x '23. So you're not coming to the Analyst Day. Christian, do you want to... Yes. I think if I were to use the headline first, I would say the pro forma margins, if you back out that onetime benefit, product gross margin would have been about 68.4%, 68.5% and operating margin, if you backed out that benefit would be 35.1%. As you may recall, we have 2 different things that are impacting our margins in that regard. One is the traditional excess and obsolete inventory calculation related inventory you have on hand, that's pretty straightforward in comparison. The second one is Q2 deliverables. And the operations team has worked really hard with last year negotiating and renegotiating those. And we saw a benefit there that kind of pencils out to those margins I gave you in round numbers, we got a benefit there of about $15 million. That's very unusual. We've not seen that in the past. Yes. I think we feel really good about the profitability of the business. And I think it comes back to where those investment vectors that Ken and John Will and others are going to really focus on as we go forward and how we want to invest there. But I think we certainly have ample room to invest in the growth of the company. Yes. Great question. And I think what we're seeing when we look at the fourth quarter right now, we're really pleased with what we got out of the very first month of the first quarter. And I think that the second month is -- it's early yet, it's tracking. We're giving us pause or some chunky deals that are teeing up for the final month of the quarter. And they just need to mature a little bit before we start thinking about them as part of our guidance numbers. So I think it's really that population of large 7-figure and a few 8-figure deals that are kind of coming into play there a little bit. Yes. I think the -- maybe Christian will add a couple of comments here as well. But I think the discounting was very similar to what it's been in prior periods. As I mentioned, we certainly have ample margin to invest in a wide range of ways and we're encouraging our sales team and our channel partners to take part of that. But I think there's also been some other changes in terms of incentives that we offer as well. But maybe Christian have some thoughts as well. Yes, I think, Ken spot on with that. I think that if you vary contrast where we are today versus a year ago, what I would say is that given the response that we get from customers when they meet with us, they're very excited about the architectural design of SASE that we've taken. And what we really want now is just more at that. When customers sit down with us and hear that story, it resonates with them and you see that in some of the pipeline numbers and some of the ARR numbers that we're talking about which are still very early days. And I think part of it is getting more reference customers involved. And I think also the channel needs to -- we need to partner more closely with the channel to make sure that we're getting more advanced on those SASE opportunities. Yes. I appreciate the opportunity to talk to it but -- and maybe Ken walks to a little bit, although I would probably be careful what he says. I think we'll, obviously, we'll talk about 2025 as we get to the February earnings call and we understand that the November Analyst Day is probably going to bake in some of the 2025 conversations. So I think that's -- it's a well-structured question but I think we'll pause on answering it for now. Yes, great question. And I do think that compared to what we've seen in other quarters, maybe a little bit less or a little bit slower progress on the maturation of those larger deals in the third quarter as they got teed up for the fourth quarter. Certainly not shutting them out. I just -- I think it's more prudent right now to take a more cautious approach and let them mature a little bit. Yes. I think that the virtual firewalls have done very, very well. It is a component of Unified SASE as well as our network security portfolio. So -- and I think -- the other thing we look at is the crossover that we see which is a very strong relationship between [indiscernible]. Are you still there, Catharine? Well, I'll just finish the topic. I think another thing we will talk about later this month is just the strong overlap that exists between our enterprise customers that are buying both physical appliances and virtual appliances. Yes. To your point, we're not really aligned with the U.S. part of the market for us, the government part is more state and local as well as international government. So you don't really get the same sort of 9/30 benefit that maybe some other companies see. Well, I think that very bullish on the OT market but the leadership opportunity for us. Yes, maybe we've confused you or I confuse myself on Slide 9. I don't think that's showing penetration, the mix of customers. You're going to find a mix of customers that more tilted to the larger enterprises, if you look at SASE alone than when you look at the entire universe would be my expectation. I think we said. It has -- when you look at dollar values, right, not customer accounts. Yes, Europe -- I mean, Europe was -- I think we mentioned on the call, international EMEA was number one. I think U.S. was number 2 in Europe is right behind them on number 3. It's a little bit like the SMB headlines that we talk about every quarter that the economy is well every worries about SMB and it continues to do well. I'm not saying there aren't pressures in Europe. And as we look forward to the fourth quarter, I don't know that we're expecting anything like an outsized performance from Europe but we'll see how the quarter comes out. Good question. Looking for some numbers real quick here. So overall, I would say, mid-range and high-end has continued to be stable but not outgrow. We had a little bit more unit shipment in the end. I guess what we're saying is it's not going to jump off the page when we look at our numbers. Yes. I think we're -- if you look at our SD-WAN space and we -- I think we made reference to the penetration in the larger enterprises that something on the order of 65% or 70%. That is of our customer base. Greg, as you're pointing out, the opportunity for us to see greater growth here is by -- in white space accounts and bringing them on board with the FortiGate and SD-WAN solution and starting them on that customer journey that goes FortiGate SD-WAN SASE. I think you're going to get some renewals from the early adopters of SD-WAN here as we start looking into 2025 and into 2026, that would be natural. I think that those same -- just as we're going through a renewal cycle for SD-WAN, our competitors will be also and we've historically shown where we have a superior product like SD-WAN, that's an opportunity for us to just lodge the incumbents."

            "name": "Christian Agard",
            "content": "Yes. You were asking whether -- or how early customers would refresh. And many of the enterprise customers have enterprise agreements where they have account levels support and subscriptions. So they don't really wait until something expires. They will probably -- I would expect what we typically see refresh about ever before U.S. And for smaller customers, they will be try to wait until the contracts expire. But because we don't allow them to renew for less than a year, you also see the refresh cycles happening about -- yes, 15 to 18 [ph]. Yes. So the growth number that Keith referenced was an organic growth number. We did not include the ARR that we acquired from Next DLP and Lacework. So the growth would be even higher year-over-year will be 150%. What are the solutions, the organic solutions that are driving this out, ARR growth is really FortiEDR, FortiClients, FortiNDR clouds, FortiWeb, so a variety of our cloud solutions and solutions that we've started to offer. Some of them are acquired, some of them are internally developed. Yes. I think that overall, the discounting will expect to be pretty stable. But of course, it depends on the product set a little bit. And then yes, we have incentives in the market for channel partners, specifically but also for our customers to -- yes, to buy more Fortinet solutions. Yes. As you can imagine, the customers won't pay years upfront. And so we have internal discussions around either getting the channel finance or do it ourselves and this is also not mature enough be comfortable guiding in that direction but gives us some pause because some customers just don't want to sign up for long periods without financing."

            "name": "John Whittle",
            "content": "Yes. I mean I think the feedback we're getting is similar to what we felt, this is John Whittle, by the way. What we found when we did our diligence, great product, great engineering team. It's an incremental TAM of $10 billion for us. So it really opens up that incremental TAM. Now we have out security, endpoint, network -- and we have great threat intelligence from all 3. So I think it's very, very positive feedback in terms of the quality of the product. We're continuing on the road map to improve the user interface in other areas and really make it a really, really, really strongly competitive product. I think it's very accreditive against some who have kind of pieced their solutions together based on multiple acquisitions forming their CNAPP solution. And so what we find is, in that context, oftentimes, we hear this feedback from customers a lot, they're not well together. It's reportedly integrated but it's not Lacework CNAPP Solution was largely developed organically by them to all seamlessly work to us. We're hearing really positives on that front. And then also versus other competitors, we do have this broad suite of products that we can offer together versus other kind of single point, single product vendors who just offer snap. So we have real differentiators against the others in this space that we see working to our advantage."

Lastly, all references to growth are on a year-over-year basis, unless noted otherwise. I will now turn the call over to Ken.\nKen Xie: Okay. Thank you Aaron and thank you to everyone for joining our call. We are pleased with our strong execution in the second quarter as we successfully balanced growth and profitability. We achieved record operation margin which increased 820 basis points to 35% and managed to building revenue in the high end of the guidance range, reached our full year 2024 revenue and operation margin guidance and we continue to invest for growth. Gaining market share and secure networking and investing in fast-growing Unified SASE and Secure Operation market. Secure networking customers are increasingly recognized our FortiOS and FortiASIC technology offering 5 to 10x better performance than our competitors while improving security effectiveness and providing a low total cost of ownership. For over 20 years, we have been leading the shift to networking and security convergence and the industry projection now indicate secure networking will surpass to traditional network by 2026, 4 years earlier than previously anticipated. In the second quarter, Unified SASE accounted for 23% of total building, up 1 point. We expect our differentiated Unified SASE offering to become a leader in the SASE market. We believe we are the only company that has built all the SASE functions organically in a single operation system. We have a converged networking and security stack, including our market-leading SD-WAN, ZTNA, Secure Web Gateway, CASB, Firewall and many other innovations. Our SASE offering provides flexible enforcement delivering a better user experience while securing access to application on-premise and in the cloud. Furthermore, we continue to build our own SASE delivery infrastructure, including leverage of FortiGate technologies, providing us with a competitive long-term cost advantage. As announced earlier today, we acquired Next DLP, a next-generation cloud-native SaaS data protection platform, extending from endpoint to cloud. This will allow us to enter the stand-alone enterprise DLP market as well as immigrate market for the SASE solution. We also recently improved our position in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for single-vendor SASE and are the only vendor included in all 5 of major network security Magic Quadrant single-vendor SASE, network firewall, SD-WAN, secure service edge and enterprise wide and wireless in infrastructure. Each of the solutions run on our single unified operating system for the OS with AI-powered FortiGuard secure service and unified management. AI-driven Secure Ops accounted for 10% of total building in the second quarter, up 1 point. Our comprehensive Secure Ops portfolio backed by over a decade of AI experience offers the broadest range of sensors and advanced analytics to continuous access activity to identify sign of cyber strides. For AI harness generative AI to table chart our platform and help secure the operation team make better informed decision and respond to threats faster by simplifying the most complex task. Fortinet is available in FortiAnalyzer for the SIM and for store and will soon be available in other Fortinet product. In addition, we are pleased to further expand our secured portfolio with acquisition of Lacework and we believe that together, our solution form one of the most comprehensive full-stack cloud security solution available from a single vendor. Lacework organically developed AI-driven cloud native application protection platform will be combined with the power of Fortinet security platform, ensuring broad protection across network, cloud and endpoint. This acquisition increases our total addressable market by $10 billion and add a team of talented engineers dedicated to cloud-native security while also expanding our sales force that can sell the entire Fortinet portfolio of solutions. Yesterday, we announced several enhancements to Fortinet security platform which are already stand as the most comprehensive OT security platform on the market, enhancements include new recited plans [ph], advanced secure networking and secure operation capability and expanded partnership with leading OT vendors, reflecting Fortinet's commitment to security for the growing cyber physical system market. As further evidence of our innovation and commitment to excellence in OT, we recently earned a prestigious Red Dot product design work for a FortiGate Rugged 70G with Dual 5G model. Fortinet was the only secured company who will see this recognition in the industry next-generation firewall. Before turning the call over to Keith, I wish to present our employees, customers partners and suppliers worldwide for their continued support and hard work. Keith?\nKeith Jensen: Thank you, Ken and thank you, Aaron and good afternoon, everyone. Let's start with the key highlights from the second quarter. Overall, we are very pleased with our execution in the quarter. We achieved record growth in operating margins at 81.5% and 35.1%, respectively, while delivering top line numbers at the high end of our guidance range. Revenue grew 11% as product revenue exceeded our expectations, driven by robust software revenue growth and sequential hardware growth that more closely aligned with historical norms. We also added 6,300 new logos as we continue to invest in our channel partners. As you'll hear in a moment, we believe we are on a pace for another rule of 40 year. At the same time, we accelerated our investments in the fast-growing Unified SASE and security operation markets with the acquisitions of Lacework and Next DLP. Lacework strengthens our position in the high-growth CGNAT market and expands our total addressable market by $10 billion, while Next DLP improves our position in the stand-alone enterprise data loss prevention market. Combined, Fortinet will gain over 900 customers and talented sales and engineering teams. And I'll just pause here to offer a very warm welcome to team members from both companies. Continuing with our Q2 highlights, we've taken the lead in partnering with the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA through a secure by design pledge and are leading with our responsible transparency practices. We want to emphasize, we understand customer trust is paramount to our business. Our continued success across all customer segments in each of our 3 pillars, represents hundreds of thousands of end customers testing and buying for net security solutions. Simply stated, this is a significant scale advantage and a responsibility a few others have and also offers customers validation at a very robust level. We are committed to responsible updates and deployment processes supply chain controls, product security measures and transparency. To understand more about the proactive measures we take to safeguard our customers and our reputation, please visit our trust website at fortinet.com/trust. Looking at billings in more detail. Total billings were consistent year-over-year at $1.54 billion, overcoming the headwind from the drawdown in backlog in the comparable quarter. At the same time, total bookings increased year-over-year and more importantly, the sequential growth rate approached pre-COVID, pre-supply chain norms. Unified SASE and SecOps delivered strong growth along with software while product sales recovered more than expected. We continue to see significant progress from our investments in both pillars and saw strong pipeline growth of 45% for Unified SASE and 18% for SecOps. Both pillars are gaining significant momentum within our installed base is over 90% of Unified SASE and SecOps billings are coming from existing customers. Larger enterprises continue to be our largest customer segment. with large and mid-enterprises combining to represent 86% and 82% of Unified SASE and SecOp solutions, respectively. Within Unified SASE, 40 SASE buildings continue to grow at triple-digit rates as existing customers can seamlessly integrate our solution within minutes to secure their hybrid workforce. While 40 client customers are able to use a single agent to secure Internet, private and SaaS applications. We've also integrated 40 AP with 40 SASE for securing thin edges and unmanaged devices. Our Unified SASE solution continues to gain market recognition. For the second consecutive year, we've been recognized as a challenger in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for single vendor SASE with the third highest placement in the ability to execute access. And as mentioned earlier, we are further improving our FortiSASE solution by adding powerful data loss prevention capabilities from Next DLP. Rounding out the billings commentary, the SMB was again the top performing customer segment, while international emerging was again our best-performing geography. On an industry vertical basis, technology and transportation grew at double-digit rates, while service provider and manufacturing were more challenged. Turning to revenue and margins. Total revenue grew 11% and to $1.434 billion, driven by service revenue growth and software licenses. Service revenue of $982 million grew 20%, accounting for 68.5% of total revenue. Service revenue growth was led by 36% growth in SecOps and 27% growth in Unified SASE. As noted on Slide 5, Unified SASE includes SASE and related technologies together with SD-WAN. Product revenue decreased 4% but better than expected to $452 million. Excluding the impact of backlog, product sales growth improved 14 points quarter-over-quarter and a similar amount year-over-year. Software license revenue growth continued to accelerate at 26% and represented a high teens percentage of product revenue, a nearly 5-point increase in the software mix year-over-year. Combined revenue from software licenses and software services such as cloud and SaaS security solutions, increased 32%, accelerating from 23% a year ago and providing an annual revenue run rate of over $800 million. Total gross margin increased 360 basis points to a quarterly record of 81.5% and exceeded the high end of our guidance range by 400 basis points, benefiting from higher product and services gross margin as well as a 5-point mix shift to higher-margin service revenues. Product gross margin of 66% increased 250 basis points year-over-year, mainly due to increased software mix and lower indirect costs. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, product gross margin increased from 56% to 66% as hardware demand increased and inventory levels and related inventory charges moved closer to historical norms. Service gross margin of 88.6%, increased 240 basis points as service revenue growth outpaced labor cost increases and benefited from the mix shift towards higher-margin FortiGuard Security subscription services. Operating margin increased 820 basis points to a quarterly record of 35.1% and was 840 basis points above the high end of our guidance range, reflecting the record gross margin as well as cost efficiencies within the business. Looking at the statement of cash flows summarized on Slides 16 and 17. Free cash flow was $319 million for the quarter and $927 million for the first half of 2024, or $1.1 billion after adjusting for real estate and infrastructure investments. Cash taxes in the quarter were $252 million. As a reminder, last year's second quarter benefited from the deferral of approximately $190 million in cash tax payments which were ultimately paid in the fourth quarter of 2023. Infrastructure investments totaled $23 million. Average contract term in the second quarter was 28 months, flat year-over-year and up 1 month quarter-over-quarter. DSO decreased 7 days year-over-year and increased 2 days quarter-over-quarter to 68 days. While we did not repurchase shares in Q2, share buybacks have totaled $5.3 billion over the last 4 plus years and the remaining buyback authorization is $1 billion. Now, I'd like to share a few significant wins from the second quarter. In a 7-figure deal, an international government agency purchased 12 solutions across all 3 pillars, including 8 SecOp solutions. This new customer selected Fortinet because of our operating system's ability to consolidate over 30 networking and security functions into a single unified platform, covering SecOps, SASE and Secure Networking. The customer was impressed with the integrated security, end-to-end visibility and automated response features of our FortiOS operating system. Next, in a 7-figure win, a large utility company, expanded our partnership by signing their first enterprise agreement with us to safeguard their OT environment. This deal displaces 5 legacy vendors and includes ruggedized equipment deployed to the customers' power plants, control centers and substations. Keys to this expansion win were our proven expertise in securing critical infrastructure and our price for performance advantage. And lastly, in a competitive displacement win, our retail store chain purchased our FortiSASE solution in a 7-figure deal. This customer chose Fortinet because of our integrated FortiOS platform, as they were able to seamlessly integrate FortiSASE with their existing Fortinet security solutions. Now I'd like to offer some comments on customer inventory digestion and the firewall refresh cycle. Last quarter, we pointed to a 25% improvement in the number of days of registered FortiGuard contracts from its peak and view this as an early but soft indicator of that \"inventory digestion\" at end users appear to be normalizing and the firewall market could start to show signs of recovery. To provide an update on this indicator and other signs of possible improvement in the firewall market, we can share that as shown on Slide 19, in the second quarter. The days of registered security service contracts improved another 12 days and has now returned to 2020 pre-supply chain, pre-COVID crisis levels. Inventory commitments and levels are normalizing at our contract manufacturers and in the channel. And as noted earlier, the sequential increase in hardware sales in the second quarter aligned more closely with historical norms. While these indicators are positive, we believe customers are currently managing a tough macro environment and a key election year in the U.S. and we believe this is having an impact on our customers' purchasing decisions. As a result, we believe a full refresh cycle is unlikely to occur in 2024 but more likely in 2025. Moving on to guidance. As a reminder, our third quarter and full year outlook which are summarized on Slides 21 and 22, it's subject to the disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Aaron provided at the beginning of the call. Before reviewing the outlook, I'd like to offer a few modeling notes in light of our Lacework and Next DLP acquisitions, covering estimates included in our Q3 and full year guidance. For billings, the acquisitions increased Q3 by approximately 0.5 point and the full year by approximately 1/3 point. Total revenue increased Q3 and full year growth by 1 point and 1.5 points, respectively. For gross margin, they decreased Q3 and full year margins by less than 0.5 point for each period. For operating margin, they decreased Q3 and full year margins by 3 points and 1.5 points, respectively. Inclusive of these acquisition-related estimates, for the third quarter, we expect billings in the range of $1.530 billion to $1.600 billion which at the midpoint represents growth of 5%, revenue in the range of $1.445 billion to $1.505 billion which at the midpoint represents growth of 10.5%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 79% to 80%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 30.5% to 31.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.56 to $0.58 which assumes a share count of between $767 million and $777 million. Capital expenditures of $40 million to $60 million. A non-GAAP tax rate of 17%. And cash taxes of $125 million to $145 million. And again, for the full year, inclusive of the numbers we gave a moment ago, we expect billings in the range of $6.400 billion to $6.600 billion; revenue in the range of $5.800 billion to $5.900 billion which at the midpoint represents growth of 10%. Service revenue remained of $3.975 billion to $4.025 billion which at the midpoint represents growth of 18%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 79% to 80%, Non-GAAP operating margin of 30% to 31.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.13 to $2.19 which assumes a share count of between 767 million and 777 million. Capital expenditures of $320 million to $360 million. Non-GAAP tax rate of 17% and cash taxes of between $525 million and $575 million. I look forward to updating you on our progress in coming quarters. Before we begin the Q&A session, it is with deep sadness that we recognize the passing of our friend, Peter Salkowski, our SVP of Finance and Investor Relations. Peter was an integral part of the Fortinet team for over 6 years and was renowned for is passion for mentoring and developing the next generation of leaders. We'll miss Peter and fondly remember his commitment to fostering talent and nurturing potential within our company. I know that Peter worked closely with many of you on this call and the outlining of condolences and heartfelt memories you've shared since his passing clearly shows the positive impact he had on so many people's lives. Peter took great pride in his contribution to Fortinet and rightly so. having contributed to increasing shareholder value from $8 billion to $46 billion during his tenure Fortinet. We'll miss Peter. Aaron, back to you.\nAaron Ovadia: Thank you, Keith. As a reminder, during the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question to allow others to participate. Operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Essex of JPMorgan.\nBrian Essex: Sorry for your loss. Keith, if I could maybe touch on the margins. I think it's incredible margin results for the quarter. Could you help me understand or maybe unpack outside of the obviously, the gross margin benefit that you saw in the quarter. Maybe help me understand where you saw better cost efficiencies, how sustainable are they particularly in light of the effort to incentivize the channel and the sales force to focus more on selling SecOps and SASE with maybe some incremental effort?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think the gross margin is the largest driver of what you saw in the operating margin, particularly when you look at it on a quarter-over-quarter basis and in that, we talked about or made reference to a more normalized environment for us in terms of inventory levels, turns and what we're seeing with channel inventory but also commitments to our contract manufacturers. So I think that we've been working through that for probably the last 3 quarters, maybe 4 quarters. And with that, I would say, I think we've returned to a more normal state and so I would expect that to continue on. I think we're getting a little more contribution from sales and marketing than maybe I'd like at the moment and I would expect us to make a little bit more investments there as we go through the second half of the year. Keep in mind, we're getting a very large group of salespeople as Ken made reference to from both the Lacework and the Next DLP acquisitions. But I think we feel certainly comfortable with the guidance that we've given for both Q3 and for the full year on the margin line.\nBrian Essex: Great. Maybe just a quick follow-up. How should we anticipate the impact of the operating margin to reflect on free cash flow as we look through the rest of the year? Should we look at historical spread between margin and cash flow margin and maybe estimate kind of ballpark the same kind of spread? Or are there going to be more puts and takes like timing of tax payments that are going to mess with that free cash flow margin as we fine-tune our models?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I don't -- I mean, I think it's a good starting point is to look at the improvement in operating margin flowing through to free cash flow. Some of the changes that we monitor would be things like contract duration but you've seen now that industries and companies have been talking about contract duration for several quarters and you really haven't seen that come through to us yet. I should say, yes, habits going to come through to us. And so I'm not I think we have opportunity to leverage our balance sheet more with our customers and prospects that we have. But I don't see over the next 90 days or 180 days, a dramatic shift in that area.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Hamza Fodderwala of Morgan Stanley.\nHamza Fodderwala: I'll echo my condolences for Peter and his family, we'll definitely miss them. Keith, I wanted to follow up on the margin question because obviously, it was a very strong beat, I think a lot more than any of us were expecting historically, Fortinet has kind of managed the business towards the 25%-plus type operating margin run rate. I'm curious, is this the new base that we should sort of think Fortinet goes off of longer term? Or is it sort of a onetime margin outperformance given what you saw on the gross margin side coming out of the inventory digestion headwinds?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. Again, I think the inventory part of that is I think we've worked our way back to a more normalized state. So I think that is our business model going forward for it that way. There can always be something that changes but I don't see us anticipating something in the gross margin line and that is by far and away the biggest opportunity there. I think it also says that we clearly have the opportunity to more -- invest more in go-to-market than we did in the first half of this year. And I think we've factored in some of that investment ideas or those ideas in our forecast and our guidance. In terms of whether or not I make Ken Cry, when I increase the margin the way I did, that's a different topic and I'll let him respond to that.\nKen Xie: Also, we'll benefit from the service revenue which has a much higher margin compared to the product revenue. So once the product starts growing, because product has a lower gross margin, that probably will impact the margin but the product is also the leading indicator of future service. So that's where we kind of also were happy to see the product also starting growing now which I think going forward with the product has a higher percentage, that probably also will impact the margin.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani of Citi.\nFatima Boolani: I wanted to share my condolences for Peter, he was just a fantastic person and he will absolutely be missed. Keith, I wanted to zero-in on your comments regarding software license growth. You talked about that accelerating 26% year-on-year, I believe and now it constitutes a high-teens percentage of your product revenue, I wanted to understand what are the drivers behind that massive mix shift and how we should think about the trajectory of this mix shift in the context of your guidance for the remainder of the year and bringing into consideration some of the hardware digestion, potential prolonging comments that you shared as well, if you can help us square that away?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think the software license, if you kind of step back and look at what the business model is not to make it only simplistic, we want to -- it's so compelling to start with the firewall and it's very compelling to start with the ASIC. So a physical part of it, we don't always do that but we almost always start with a firewall, whether it's physical or virtual. Really, what you want to do is get the operating system in the hands of the customer. And what form factor that takes is we're fairly agnostic about that. So once that happens, then you start to see the knock-on effect of either selling more firewall use cases and other form factors into organizations or you're seeing that full portfolio, the SecOps product line take hold as continuous to expand throughout organization. So I would expect that we're going to continue to see tailwinds and growth, no doubt about it from the software part of the business. Will there be a mix shift that slows a little bit when firewall and FortiGate starts to return? Sure, absolutely. But this has been a trend that we talked about a little bit, I think, last quarter and probably some earlier quarters about the software mix and the mix shift that we've been seeing. So I would expect that, that's going to continue on given the success we're seeing in the other 2 pillars.\nKen Xie: In the FortiSASE and FortiOS, we see customers setting turn around more and more function which also enable more service for us. At the same time, the FortiSASE Secure Ops has also fully pretty much our service base and plus a lot of secure a high percentage in software compared to the hardware on the secure networking part. So that's both helping drive the additional software and licensing growth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges of Goldman Sachs.\nGabriela Borges: Either for Ken or for Keith. On the firewall refresh cycle, I can appreciate your comments on not expecting to see a recovery in 2024. Share us a little bit more detail on why you think we'll see it in 2025. And -- to what extent are customers giving you an indication that they will be refreshing in 2025, perhaps as we get through the election and some of the macro or perhaps because of their updated depreciation plans? Any color on why you think the timing will be 2025 would be helpful.\nKen Xie: I think it's probably more Keith. I think the rest of the year probably still pretty tough to make an environment where the election or some interest rate is still pretty high. The money cost is pretty high that's where some companies may not really want to spend some long-term investment which is drive the product revenue and building infrastructure, so that's what we view. Also, if you look at it historically, every 4 years -- 4 to 5 years, the network here or another network in our security they need to be refreshed for faster, more function layer. So that's where we feel when we're starting this supply chain issue, they artificially put up the since lag started in 2001 [ph], maybe next year will be pretty much full year cycle now. So some company may start looking to refresh the product they purchased 4, 5 years ago, especially in certain vertical like retail, some other we see pretty strong growth in early days of a supply chain issue and we feel probably in the next 1 to 2 years, they may starting to return to see some investment on the infrastructure. On the other side, we see the big trend we always believe, always a hybrid mode, even there's -- like we have a very advanced SASE infrastructure side but also to secure OT/IoT area, to secure a lot of infrastructure, work for home and we do need an appliance in the field. And also even for SASE, we do offer both cloud-based SASE and also on premise-based private SASE. So that also needs some hardware to support in local for the customer.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani of Bank of America.\nTal Liani: The fact that -- can you go back to the fact that billings, you made 2 acquisitions this quarter, you didn't change the billing guidance for the year but you did beat the numbers for this quarter by $20 million, so in effect, you reduced the billing for the next 2 quarters. What are the drivers in billings? I know we spoke about it in the past but what are the drivers for billings and what's the outlook for billings going forward? Second question is your -- you grew revenues by 11%. But when you look at OpEx, they're flat. And you don't do buybacks now what's the outlook for buybacks? And what's the outlook for OpEx? Will it start growing now that you started executing on revenue growth.\nKeith Jensen: Tal, I think I kind of missed -- very, very faint on your questions there. Maybe if you can give us maybe a little later recap of the 2 questions you had.\nKen Xie: I think that get some part about the 2 acquisitions impact on billing. I believe the post-acquisition, I think, Lacework maybe this year will contribute or maybe...\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think that -- I mean if you kind of look at the recap of the year, there's not a lot of variability in it, if you will. We are a little bit light in the first quarter, we came back and recovered the first quarter shortage in the second quarter. Now you see us looking at the third quarter and maybe taking that just a little bit off of some of the Street numbers and looking to see a little bit of that back in the fourth quarter. But we're kind of taking the third quarter correction to the Street numbers and putting it into the full year number. But yes, offsetting a very, very similar amount in terms of what we expect to get from the acquisitions and that leaves the full year range very much intact. And I understand that tick up is quick, I understand part of that is I'm taking -- I'm getting inorganic benefit in that number of the 0.5 point that we talked about at the -- and really taking down the organic part of the business. But again, I think we're talking about small numbers here.\nTal Liani: Got it. My second question can hear me okay now. But my second question was about OpEx that was flat and no buybacks. What's the outlook on those items?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think the OpEx is probably a little lighter on the sales and marketing line than maybe we would like to see, particularly as we start looking at more opportunities as we get into the second half of the year and into 2025. So hopefully, we'll find some opportunities there to make investments. Obviously, you're going to get a fairly significant movement there from the 2 acquisitions that we just did and we gave the number about what the OpEx impact is going to be, that will largely be in sales and marketing. Buyback, I think that we still remain being opportunistic and that opportunistic number changes every 90 days as we reset our plans.\nKen Xie: Yes. And also, in the market, whether the private company, public company, we see the multiple probably more friendly for [indiscernible] compared to the last 2, 3 years. So we should go back to more reasonable so that we see some opportunity there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Owens of Piper Sandler.\nRob Owens: Curious relative to the macro and obviously a lot of cross currents out there, maybe what you're seeing via your different customer sizes and different theaters?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think because we are so diversified, as you kind of alluded to, 70% of the business is international and a little bit less than 30% in the U.S. And yes, there's been a lot of elections around the world this year but it's certainly the U.S. election, maybe weighing on people and every kind of taking a position of waiting to see. As you move -- pull back from that, the international emerging part of the business has been strong, very strong for several quarters and continues on to be. A lot of those are oil-producing countries and similar. So I think they've done well in this economic cycle. There are a little more risk there perhaps with geopolitical events in some of those countries. But to this point, it really hasn't had an impact there. We are much more likely to be the number 1 market share when you move outside the U.S. and parts of Europe and the Middle East and Latin America and parts of APAC. And I think having an incumbency advantage, if you will, helps you in those more challenging times because you're there, you're on site and you have that opportunity to cross-sell and upsell your installed base.\nKen Xie: In the U.S., last next growing area which also needs more direct marketing, direct sales. That's also need more investment. So that's where we do plan to invest more into sales and marketing to keep gaining market share in the U.S.\nRob Owens: And Keith, if you contemplate these acquisitions and a little bit of mix shift to software and I realize hardware is weak right now with the potential recovery next year. But how are you thinking about billings duration? You shave some off the back half and I think some of that's probably the mix shift towards software as we kind of look overall at the model and the increase in revenue but as we contemplate 2025, how should we think about billings duration and potential compression with more cloud-based or software deals that are likely shorter in nature?\nKeith Jensen: Well, I look forward to seeing you in November at the Analyst Day and we'll talk more about 2025 and midterm numbers. But in the interim, I would probably say that if it's a white space account in some of these places like Lacework would be, for example, I think it's going to be much more prone to having a shorter duration contract. If it's part of that 90% of be selling SecOps or SASE solutions to my installed base. What I'm seeing to this point is my installed base continues to purchase in terms of contract duration, the way they have historically. So they haven't -- if I sell something from the SecOp portfolio into one of my firewall customers, they tend to sign up for a longer duration contract than you may see from a point solution vendor.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal of TD Cowen.\nShaul Eyal: Keith or Ken, so listening to Keith's commentary about the potential refresh cycle not taking place in the second half of this year but most likely during 2025. And again, not trying to front run the November Analyst Day but should we be thinking about 2025 accelerating over 2024? And again, I know you don't have the current visibility to guide to '25 but just conceptually, is it fair to assume another year of double-digit growth?\nKen Xie: We do believe next year, there's -- I think first, overall, we see the long-term convergence -- networking convergence to network security, we're still keeping going. That's why we do give the CAGR in secure networking area is about 15% year-over-year growth. If you look in the investor presentation slide for about which page. But on the other side, we also see a lot of new opportunity, whether in the OT area in the Unified SASE and also upsell, cross-sell which are all helping driving, I would say, probably like a 90% customer initially moved by a FortiGate getting the firewall and network security market first which we have a huge advantage over competitors. But after that one, they're keeping expanding beyond the network security, go to the other area. So that's what's happening for the Unified SASE for the Secure Op. And now the product, especially on the FortiGate firewall side we're starting to see kind of go back to normal or starting growing with the market now. So, we do feel probably next year will be whether the refresh cycle which after -- that's where the existing customer, if they have the product for 4, 5 years, that's probably the average turn starting to refresh. And so we do see probably next year, we're starting that process.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick of Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick: Keith, I think you called out the service provider segment is more challenged this quarter after being a strong performer last quarter. And I know it's lumpy and remains a top vertical as it always has been for Fortinet. But can you share an update on what's happening in that segment? And in particular, how your value prop and unified -- and focus on Unified SASE and SecOps applies in this important vertical?\nKen Xie: Yes. I don't feel the service provider telecom slowdown, it's really kind of lumpy and on the other side, we're also starting to see the telecom service provider more interest in offer their own SASE using our product solution or kind of helping customers do the private SASE, localized SASE which also will helping drive our long-term growth. But I do believe long-term wise, the service provider will be if not the biggest, probably one of the biggest part of the whole cybersecurity business because they have the infrastructure, they have the customer relation, so we still want to keep a focus on the service provider area. But for them, it's really the sales cycle resting is long and the deal pretty big, like 8-figure deal. That's where the lumpiness probably impacted the quarterly. But if you look at more long-term multi-quarter annually, I don't believe it's still keeping growing.\nKeith Jensen: Yes, Ken is spot on, right? It's a lumpy industry. Financial services can be to at times as well. But I think more importantly, I think the conversations around their own independent SASE solution that they can bring to market is something that's getting a lot more conversation from the service providers. I think we saw it first internationally and we're starting to see a little bit more of it here domestically. But that's going to -- that's a pretty exciting opportunity if it continues to move forward.\nBrad Zelnick: Just a quick follow-up on the very impressive operating leverage that you've shown us particularly on the sales and marketing line, where I know, Keith, you said that it's more than you'd like to see at this point. But just structurally, like to see it down, albeit very slightly sequentially on a dollar basis, especially as you outperformed on the top line and billings this quarter. I'm just trying to understand like where it comes from? And is there anything structurally that change that we should be thinking about, whether it's commission deferral rates, channel rebates or anything else other than headcount?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think there's a few things going on there. I think probably 9 months ago, we looked at the cost structure pretty closely. And across a number of areas. And the first place that people kind of look at and when you're in that vote is marketing programs and they get hit pretty hard early on. And I think you're trying to see that roll through you do make changes to your compensation programs, whether it's for direct salespeople or for channel people or what have you. And I think maybe as we're coming out of that environment now, it's important for us to kind of revisit some of those decisions and making sure I kind of talk about the investment opportunities that we have in the sales and marketing line. And I think I would include the channel net as well. It is why I would say that to your point or you're repeating me, probably a little bit lower than we would have liked it to have been in the second quarter. And I think we'll continue to make go-to-market investments here in the second half of the year.\nKen Xie: Yes, I agree with Keith. We're starting tracking more carefully for the ROI for each investment in marketing sales and also try to improve the efficiency with the marketing sales. On the other side, we are a little bit behind on hiring in the sales and marketing side which we intend to accelerate. So that's actually what will drive the future growth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Tindle of Raymond James.\nAdam Tindle: I just wanted to continue the margin discussion. Obviously, you had great product gross margin performance this quarter on top of those tight cost controls. And the question really is around pricing dynamics in the core firewall business from here. The supply chain sounds like it's clearly normalized. You've had multiple years of price increases during this period of time. What are your expectations of the pricing dynamic in core firewall from here? What would it take to maybe even consider reducing price back to historical at some point? And any comments that you want to make on the competitive environment in light of this?\nKen Xie: I think we have not increased the price in the last few quarters. I think that because we still believe we have a huge advantage with FortiASIC, FortiOS technology has a more function better performance, lower total cost of ownership and also energy cost. So we feel we're keeping that advantage over our competitors. On the other side, we don't see any pressure to also decrease price all kind of discount more. So that's where we feel we're keeping pretty stable for the price. And at the same time, that the customers see the benefit of our product solution and with better performance, more function which also will drive the future service. I think the bigger environment also, we don't feel changed much. Definitely, we see that the inventory all go back to normal weather on kind of inventory and also the channel inventory. That's also more helping driving the healthy behavior in the business also in the supply chain area. Maybe Keith has something to add.\nKeith Jensen: Just to repeat what Ken said, maybe a little more granularity. I think the price increases that you referred to, we're really probably a late '21, 2022 impact. And I don't think we're really raising prices at '23. We did take some prices down at the end of '23 and in the very beginning of 2024. But that's really been the only pricing actions we've taken in the last 6 months. And then to Ken's point, I think we're at a moment where we think it's probably -- the value for the solution is very, very strong. I think the energy costs that Ken mentioned is starting to get -- it's gotten a lot of traction internationally in Europe but you're starting to see more conversation around that in the U.S. and that could be people concerned about energy consumption and issues with AI and EV and government actions on manufacturing. So I do think the energy cost advantage is coming into play more. And then last one on that discounting was, I think, very much in line. I think we actually improved discounting meaning higher prices by about 1 point quarter-over-quarter and kind of a similar number one way or the other for the full year. So we obviously have room given the margins to use discounting and pricing as a lever. But I think there's other things that we'd like to push on first.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Borg of Stifel.\nAdam Borg: Also condolences on Peter's passing. He's certainly missed by all of us. We'd love to talk about the Next DLP acquisition. Maybe talk a little bit more about what's attracting you to the stand-alone enterprise data protection market overall and Next DLP in particular?\nJohn Whittle: This is John Whittle. There's a lot of positivity around that. We obviously just announced it today, we closed it yesterday. We did a lot of diligence on the company, The tech is great. And not only will we plan to offer it stand-alone but also integrated with our FortiSASE solution. And so I think it's another step in steadily bolstering our FortiSASE solution, We feel very, very confident in our strategy there. For the most part, as you know, I mean, we've done some tech and talent tuck-ins. Most of our technology is organic I think to some of the earlier questions, you think about the firewall market coming back next year. And we really just started kind of organizing our solutions into these 3 pillars less than a year ago and the amount of progress we've made and the execution we've made in kind of developing very, very competitive solutions in SASE and SecOps in addition to secure networking is pretty impressive. And I think this is an important step along the way to continue to develop the best SASE solution out there to protect our customers.\nAdam Borg: That's great. And maybe just as a quick follow-up there, John. Maybe just could you comment on current level of sales force productivity for SASE and SecOps and the opportunities for improvement from here?\nJohn Whittle: Sorry, the sales execution with SASE and SecOps.\nAdam Borg: Just general sales force productivity as you've gone through many months at this point of training and just ramping of the ability to sell that across your company globally.\nJohn Whittle: Yes. No, it's a really good question. I think what we're seeing is it does take time. We are very focused on that broad sales enablement I always say, I mean, the opportunity just abounds from our solution set and we're always with a customer-first focus. So in terms of protecting and serving our customers the opportunity to bounce I think our sales force -- the good news is they have a ton of opportunity. I always say they're going to suffer more from indigestion than starvation. But we've got really a big focus in the company to really train up that sales force, enable that sales force, make sure we have the incentives in the right place and make sure we have the support. So when they do qualify different opportunities in different solution sets, the support to support them in that sale. So I think, like Keith had alluded to, we often land with the firewall and then expand and get that support to our sales force with SASE and SecOps solutions and we're seeing a lot of success there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia of Barclays.\nSaket Kalia: Tip my cap to Peter as well. We're going to miss him. Ken, maybe just to start with you. I wanted to get into just the firewall refresh for next year a little bit. I mean you've seen so many refresh cycles over the years. How would you sort of compare this upcoming cycle versus others in the past? And maybe touch on how SASE and sort of -- maybe what sounds like a higher mix of virtual might sort of play into that?\nKen Xie: Yes, agree. There's the infrastructure probably different than the last refresh cycle. You see more hybrid working environment, whether working remotely and also more supporting broad connection, including connect all this OT/IoT device level. For the SASE, we always believe also should be a hybrid SASE environment, not just cloud only. You do need to have a private SASE, some other local SASE offer by service provider. And also some time, the SASE also need secure some device which cannot install a software agent like using a FortiAP, FortiSwitch to secure this agent is device. So that's where we feel this also will always kind of the unified SASE will be the long-term future. We believe we also combine both the hardware and the software and infrastructure and appliance together. So that's where the refresh. On the other side, network security is always probably the biggest market -- I mean it has been the biggest market in cybersecurity for probably 30 years now, 20, 30 years and keep expanding because more people devices get connect and more application to access or even as cloud, you do need to secure on the network side. So that's what we see when you try to access the network side and also the long-term convergence of network in network security, that's also what drives the refresh. That's also you can see the Gartner research we pointed out, the convergence of network in the network security also starting or accelerating. So originally, I think last year, they say by 2030, the secure networking will be larger than traditional networking. Now they say, 2026, 4 years ahead, the secure networking will be larger than the traditional networking. So that's where we really invest long term on this trend. And with all this FortiOS, FortiASIC and making the best both appliance and infrastructure, the ASIC technology and at the same time, also try to investment more in the sales and marketing area to really catch the trend and also keep gaining market share. So that's the strategy to be ahead.\nSaket Kalia: That makes a lot of sense. Keith, if I could fit in one quick follow-up. Just on the software mix in product, I think you said, call it, roughly $800 million run rate. Can we just touch on, even anecdotally, roughly how much of that is sort of virtual firewall versus SecOps? And I realize they're coming in at software gross margins. But can you put a finer point on that and sort of what that aggregate business might be coming in at from a gross margin perspective as we think about that gross margin shift long term?\nKeith Jensen: Well, I think whether it's a virtual firewall or any other software product or the software licenses are all coming in at very, very attractive margins. I think that when you look at some of the SaaS solutions that are sitting in the services line for SecOps and so forth, you get a very wide range of margins there but it's only because of the relative size or maturity of the solution. Obviously, something that's very new and absorbing a lot of the hosting cost is a little harder. But those aren't as big numbers. As you see those SecOps solutions get greater and greater traction and more critical mass, the margins start to normalize. I think kind of what's really been exciting is the ability to absorb those data center POP, colo, everybody's got their hand in the products and on these things, cloud provider fees and developing the SaaS solutions and still bring up the services gross margin. And by the same token, being able to absorb the charge for Lacework on the operating margin line because we've managed the business in terms of cost of goods sold for the product side, I think we're really, really pleased with how those 2 things will work hand in hand.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Gallo from Jefferies.\nJoseph Gallo: I also want to echo my condolence to the team and Peter. Sadly, big shoes to fill. I just wanted to double click on what drove the better performance in product in 2Q? Was there some large deals or region, segment or vertical that stood out, especially since you don't expect the refresh benefit until calendar '25?\nKeith Jensen: No, great question. I mean we've talked about 8-figure deals and our size 8-figure deals can kind of still will around, as you saw in the fourth quarter last year, we did 6 of them. We had one 8-figure deal, Q1. We had 2 in Q2. So I would wouldn't attribute to that. I think what we saw the last month of the quarter and particularly as we got into the last week of the quarter, what you see in a strong market is a lot of deals started to fall in place and we're getting across the finish line. I think we saw a lot more positiveness if you will, at the end of Q2 than maybe we saw say at the end of Q3 or something like that last year.\nJoseph Gallo: Okay. And then just on a follow-up to that. And I think it was a follow-up to Fatima's question. Given that mix shift, you now expect in the second half, given the delayed refresh, what is your confidence or visibility into the billings re-acceleration in the second half? Do you, in theory, have more visibility now, given that it's less hardware based? Or how are you thinking about that?\nKeith Jensen: Yes. I don't think that the form factor really impacts the visibility in terms of what's in the pipeline or how we work with the sales teams in terms of forecasting. I've not noticed a difference, if you will, in close rates between a virtual machine and a physical machine.\nKen Xie: Yes, we probably would do some more deep study to maybe on Analyst Day, we'll give some color next year and also some midterm model on November 18 which also the 15 anniversary of IPO.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it back to Aaron Ovadia, Director of Investor Relations.\nAaron Ovadia: Thank you. I'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call. Fortinet will be attending investor conferences hosted by Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Oppenheimer during the third quarter. We will also be holding an Analyst Day on November 18 where we expect to update our medium-term financial model. The webcast link will be posted on the events in the Presentations section of Fortinet's Investor Relations website. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to contact me. Have a great rest of your day.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ken Xie",
            "content": "Okay. Thank you Aaron and thank you to everyone for joining our call. We are pleased with our strong execution in the second quarter as we successfully balanced growth and profitability. We achieved record operation margin which increased 820 basis points to 35% and managed to building revenue in the high end of the guidance range, reached our full year 2024 revenue and operation margin guidance and we continue to invest for growth. Gaining market share and secure networking and investing in fast-growing Unified SASE and Secure Operation market. Secure networking customers are increasingly recognized our FortiOS and FortiASIC technology offering 5 to 10x better performance than our competitors while improving security effectiveness and providing a low total cost of ownership. For over 20 years, we have been leading the shift to networking and security convergence and the industry projection now indicate secure networking will surpass to traditional network by 2026, 4 years earlier than previously anticipated. In the second quarter, Unified SASE accounted for 23% of total building, up 1 point. We expect our differentiated Unified SASE offering to become a leader in the SASE market. We believe we are the only company that has built all the SASE functions organically in a single operation system. We have a converged networking and security stack, including our market-leading SD-WAN, ZTNA, Secure Web Gateway, CASB, Firewall and many other innovations. Our SASE offering provides flexible enforcement delivering a better user experience while securing access to application on-premise and in the cloud. Furthermore, we continue to build our own SASE delivery infrastructure, including leverage of FortiGate technologies, providing us with a competitive long-term cost advantage. As announced earlier today, we acquired Next DLP, a next-generation cloud-native SaaS data protection platform, extending from endpoint to cloud. This will allow us to enter the stand-alone enterprise DLP market as well as immigrate market for the SASE solution. We also recently improved our position in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for single-vendor SASE and are the only vendor included in all 5 of major network security Magic Quadrant single-vendor SASE, network firewall, SD-WAN, secure service edge and enterprise wide and wireless in infrastructure. Each of the solutions run on our single unified operating system for the OS with AI-powered FortiGuard secure service and unified management. AI-driven Secure Ops accounted for 10% of total building in the second quarter, up 1 point. Our comprehensive Secure Ops portfolio backed by over a decade of AI experience offers the broadest range of sensors and advanced analytics to continuous access activity to identify sign of cyber strides. For AI harness generative AI to table chart our platform and help secure the operation team make better informed decision and respond to threats faster by simplifying the most complex task. Fortinet is available in FortiAnalyzer for the SIM and for store and will soon be available in other Fortinet product. In addition, we are pleased to further expand our secured portfolio with acquisition of Lacework and we believe that together, our solution form one of the most comprehensive full-stack cloud security solution available from a single vendor. Lacework organically developed AI-driven cloud native application protection platform will be combined with the power of Fortinet security platform, ensuring broad protection across network, cloud and endpoint. This acquisition increases our total addressable market by $10 billion and add a team of talented engineers dedicated to cloud-native security while also expanding our sales force that can sell the entire Fortinet portfolio of solutions. Yesterday, we announced several enhancements to Fortinet security platform which are already stand as the most comprehensive OT security platform on the market, enhancements include new recited plans [ph], advanced secure networking and secure operation capability and expanded partnership with leading OT vendors, reflecting Fortinet's commitment to security for the growing cyber physical system market. As further evidence of our innovation and commitment to excellence in OT, we recently earned a prestigious Red Dot product design work for a FortiGate Rugged 70G with Dual 5G model. Fortinet was the only secured company who will see this recognition in the industry next-generation firewall. Before turning the call over to Keith, I wish to present our employees, customers partners and suppliers worldwide for their continued support and hard work. Keith? Also, we'll benefit from the service revenue which has a much higher margin compared to the product revenue. So once the product starts growing, because product has a lower gross margin, that probably will impact the margin but the product is also the leading indicator of future service. So that's where we kind of also were happy to see the product also starting growing now which I think going forward with the product has a higher percentage, that probably also will impact the margin. In the FortiSASE and FortiOS, we see customers setting turn around more and more function which also enable more service for us. At the same time, the FortiSASE Secure Ops has also fully pretty much our service base and plus a lot of secure a high percentage in software compared to the hardware on the secure networking part. So that's both helping drive the additional software and licensing growth. I think it's probably more Keith. I think the rest of the year probably still pretty tough to make an environment where the election or some interest rate is still pretty high. The money cost is pretty high that's where some companies may not really want to spend some long-term investment which is drive the product revenue and building infrastructure, so that's what we view. Also, if you look at it historically, every 4 years -- 4 to 5 years, the network here or another network in our security they need to be refreshed for faster, more function layer. So that's where we feel when we're starting this supply chain issue, they artificially put up the since lag started in 2001 [ph], maybe next year will be pretty much full year cycle now. So some company may start looking to refresh the product they purchased 4, 5 years ago, especially in certain vertical like retail, some other we see pretty strong growth in early days of a supply chain issue and we feel probably in the next 1 to 2 years, they may starting to return to see some investment on the infrastructure. On the other side, we see the big trend we always believe, always a hybrid mode, even there's -- like we have a very advanced SASE infrastructure side but also to secure OT/IoT area, to secure a lot of infrastructure, work for home and we do need an appliance in the field. And also even for SASE, we do offer both cloud-based SASE and also on premise-based private SASE. So that also needs some hardware to support in local for the customer. I think that get some part about the 2 acquisitions impact on billing. I believe the post-acquisition, I think, Lacework maybe this year will contribute or maybe... Yes. And also, in the market, whether the private company, public company, we see the multiple probably more friendly for [indiscernible] compared to the last 2, 3 years. So we should go back to more reasonable so that we see some opportunity there. In the U.S., last next growing area which also needs more direct marketing, direct sales. That's also need more investment. So that's where we do plan to invest more into sales and marketing to keep gaining market share in the U.S. We do believe next year, there's -- I think first, overall, we see the long-term convergence -- networking convergence to network security, we're still keeping going. That's why we do give the CAGR in secure networking area is about 15% year-over-year growth. If you look in the investor presentation slide for about which page. But on the other side, we also see a lot of new opportunity, whether in the OT area in the Unified SASE and also upsell, cross-sell which are all helping driving, I would say, probably like a 90% customer initially moved by a FortiGate getting the firewall and network security market first which we have a huge advantage over competitors. But after that one, they're keeping expanding beyond the network security, go to the other area. So that's what's happening for the Unified SASE for the Secure Op. And now the product, especially on the FortiGate firewall side we're starting to see kind of go back to normal or starting growing with the market now. So, we do feel probably next year will be whether the refresh cycle which after -- that's where the existing customer, if they have the product for 4, 5 years, that's probably the average turn starting to refresh. And so we do see probably next year, we're starting that process. Yes. I don't feel the service provider telecom slowdown, it's really kind of lumpy and on the other side, we're also starting to see the telecom service provider more interest in offer their own SASE using our product solution or kind of helping customers do the private SASE, localized SASE which also will helping drive our long-term growth. But I do believe long-term wise, the service provider will be if not the biggest, probably one of the biggest part of the whole cybersecurity business because they have the infrastructure, they have the customer relation, so we still want to keep a focus on the service provider area. But for them, it's really the sales cycle resting is long and the deal pretty big, like 8-figure deal. That's where the lumpiness probably impacted the quarterly. But if you look at more long-term multi-quarter annually, I don't believe it's still keeping growing. Yes, I agree with Keith. We're starting tracking more carefully for the ROI for each investment in marketing sales and also try to improve the efficiency with the marketing sales. On the other side, we are a little bit behind on hiring in the sales and marketing side which we intend to accelerate. So that's actually what will drive the future growth. I think we have not increased the price in the last few quarters. I think that because we still believe we have a huge advantage with FortiASIC, FortiOS technology has a more function better performance, lower total cost of ownership and also energy cost. So we feel we're keeping that advantage over our competitors. On the other side, we don't see any pressure to also decrease price all kind of discount more. So that's where we feel we're keeping pretty stable for the price. And at the same time, that the customers see the benefit of our product solution and with better performance, more function which also will drive the future service. I think the bigger environment also, we don't feel changed much. Definitely, we see that the inventory all go back to normal weather on kind of inventory and also the channel inventory. That's also more helping driving the healthy behavior in the business also in the supply chain area. Maybe Keith has something to add. Yes, agree. There's the infrastructure probably different than the last refresh cycle. You see more hybrid working environment, whether working remotely and also more supporting broad connection, including connect all this OT/IoT device level. For the SASE, we always believe also should be a hybrid SASE environment, not just cloud only. You do need to have a private SASE, some other local SASE offer by service provider. And also some time, the SASE also need secure some device which cannot install a software agent like using a FortiAP, FortiSwitch to secure this agent is device. So that's where we feel this also will always kind of the unified SASE will be the long-term future. We believe we also combine both the hardware and the software and infrastructure and appliance together. So that's where the refresh. On the other side, network security is always probably the biggest market -- I mean it has been the biggest market in cybersecurity for probably 30 years now, 20, 30 years and keep expanding because more people devices get connect and more application to access or even as cloud, you do need to secure on the network side. So that's what we see when you try to access the network side and also the long-term convergence of network in network security, that's also what drives the refresh. That's also you can see the Gartner research we pointed out, the convergence of network in the network security also starting or accelerating. So originally, I think last year, they say by 2030, the secure networking will be larger than traditional networking. Now they say, 2026, 4 years ahead, the secure networking will be larger than the traditional networking. So that's where we really invest long term on this trend. And with all this FortiOS, FortiASIC and making the best both appliance and infrastructure, the ASIC technology and at the same time, also try to investment more in the sales and marketing area to really catch the trend and also keep gaining market share. So that's the strategy to be ahead. Yes, we probably would do some more deep study to maybe on Analyst Day, we'll give some color next year and also some midterm model on November 18 which also the 15 anniversary of IPO."

            "name": "Keith Jensen",
            "content": "Thank you, Ken and thank you, Aaron and good afternoon, everyone. Let's start with the key highlights from the second quarter. Overall, we are very pleased with our execution in the quarter. We achieved record growth in operating margins at 81.5% and 35.1%, respectively, while delivering top line numbers at the high end of our guidance range. Revenue grew 11% as product revenue exceeded our expectations, driven by robust software revenue growth and sequential hardware growth that more closely aligned with historical norms. We also added 6,300 new logos as we continue to invest in our channel partners. As you'll hear in a moment, we believe we are on a pace for another rule of 40 year. At the same time, we accelerated our investments in the fast-growing Unified SASE and security operation markets with the acquisitions of Lacework and Next DLP. Lacework strengthens our position in the high-growth CGNAT market and expands our total addressable market by $10 billion, while Next DLP improves our position in the stand-alone enterprise data loss prevention market. Combined, Fortinet will gain over 900 customers and talented sales and engineering teams. And I'll just pause here to offer a very warm welcome to team members from both companies. Continuing with our Q2 highlights, we've taken the lead in partnering with the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA through a secure by design pledge and are leading with our responsible transparency practices. We want to emphasize, we understand customer trust is paramount to our business. Our continued success across all customer segments in each of our 3 pillars, represents hundreds of thousands of end customers testing and buying for net security solutions. Simply stated, this is a significant scale advantage and a responsibility a few others have and also offers customers validation at a very robust level. We are committed to responsible updates and deployment processes supply chain controls, product security measures and transparency. To understand more about the proactive measures we take to safeguard our customers and our reputation, please visit our trust website at fortinet.com/trust. Looking at billings in more detail. Total billings were consistent year-over-year at $1.54 billion, overcoming the headwind from the drawdown in backlog in the comparable quarter. At the same time, total bookings increased year-over-year and more importantly, the sequential growth rate approached pre-COVID, pre-supply chain norms. Unified SASE and SecOps delivered strong growth along with software while product sales recovered more than expected. We continue to see significant progress from our investments in both pillars and saw strong pipeline growth of 45% for Unified SASE and 18% for SecOps. Both pillars are gaining significant momentum within our installed base is over 90% of Unified SASE and SecOps billings are coming from existing customers. Larger enterprises continue to be our largest customer segment. with large and mid-enterprises combining to represent 86% and 82% of Unified SASE and SecOp solutions, respectively. Within Unified SASE, 40 SASE buildings continue to grow at triple-digit rates as existing customers can seamlessly integrate our solution within minutes to secure their hybrid workforce. While 40 client customers are able to use a single agent to secure Internet, private and SaaS applications. We've also integrated 40 AP with 40 SASE for securing thin edges and unmanaged devices. Our Unified SASE solution continues to gain market recognition. For the second consecutive year, we've been recognized as a challenger in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for single vendor SASE with the third highest placement in the ability to execute access. And as mentioned earlier, we are further improving our FortiSASE solution by adding powerful data loss prevention capabilities from Next DLP. Rounding out the billings commentary, the SMB was again the top performing customer segment, while international emerging was again our best-performing geography. On an industry vertical basis, technology and transportation grew at double-digit rates, while service provider and manufacturing were more challenged. Turning to revenue and margins. Total revenue grew 11% and to $1.434 billion, driven by service revenue growth and software licenses. Service revenue of $982 million grew 20%, accounting for 68.5% of total revenue. Service revenue growth was led by 36% growth in SecOps and 27% growth in Unified SASE. As noted on Slide 5, Unified SASE includes SASE and related technologies together with SD-WAN. Product revenue decreased 4% but better than expected to $452 million. Excluding the impact of backlog, product sales growth improved 14 points quarter-over-quarter and a similar amount year-over-year. Software license revenue growth continued to accelerate at 26% and represented a high teens percentage of product revenue, a nearly 5-point increase in the software mix year-over-year. Combined revenue from software licenses and software services such as cloud and SaaS security solutions, increased 32%, accelerating from 23% a year ago and providing an annual revenue run rate of over $800 million. Total gross margin increased 360 basis points to a quarterly record of 81.5% and exceeded the high end of our guidance range by 400 basis points, benefiting from higher product and services gross margin as well as a 5-point mix shift to higher-margin service revenues. Product gross margin of 66% increased 250 basis points year-over-year, mainly due to increased software mix and lower indirect costs. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, product gross margin increased from 56% to 66% as hardware demand increased and inventory levels and related inventory charges moved closer to historical norms. Service gross margin of 88.6%, increased 240 basis points as service revenue growth outpaced labor cost increases and benefited from the mix shift towards higher-margin FortiGuard Security subscription services. Operating margin increased 820 basis points to a quarterly record of 35.1% and was 840 basis points above the high end of our guidance range, reflecting the record gross margin as well as cost efficiencies within the business. Looking at the statement of cash flows summarized on Slides 16 and 17. Free cash flow was $319 million for the quarter and $927 million for the first half of 2024, or $1.1 billion after adjusting for real estate and infrastructure investments. Cash taxes in the quarter were $252 million. As a reminder, last year's second quarter benefited from the deferral of approximately $190 million in cash tax payments which were ultimately paid in the fourth quarter of 2023. Infrastructure investments totaled $23 million. Average contract term in the second quarter was 28 months, flat year-over-year and up 1 month quarter-over-quarter. DSO decreased 7 days year-over-year and increased 2 days quarter-over-quarter to 68 days. While we did not repurchase shares in Q2, share buybacks have totaled $5.3 billion over the last 4 plus years and the remaining buyback authorization is $1 billion. Now, I'd like to share a few significant wins from the second quarter. In a 7-figure deal, an international government agency purchased 12 solutions across all 3 pillars, including 8 SecOp solutions. This new customer selected Fortinet because of our operating system's ability to consolidate over 30 networking and security functions into a single unified platform, covering SecOps, SASE and Secure Networking. The customer was impressed with the integrated security, end-to-end visibility and automated response features of our FortiOS operating system. Next, in a 7-figure win, a large utility company, expanded our partnership by signing their first enterprise agreement with us to safeguard their OT environment. This deal displaces 5 legacy vendors and includes ruggedized equipment deployed to the customers' power plants, control centers and substations. Keys to this expansion win were our proven expertise in securing critical infrastructure and our price for performance advantage. And lastly, in a competitive displacement win, our retail store chain purchased our FortiSASE solution in a 7-figure deal. This customer chose Fortinet because of our integrated FortiOS platform, as they were able to seamlessly integrate FortiSASE with their existing Fortinet security solutions. Now I'd like to offer some comments on customer inventory digestion and the firewall refresh cycle. Last quarter, we pointed to a 25% improvement in the number of days of registered FortiGuard contracts from its peak and view this as an early but soft indicator of that \"inventory digestion\" at end users appear to be normalizing and the firewall market could start to show signs of recovery. To provide an update on this indicator and other signs of possible improvement in the firewall market, we can share that as shown on Slide 19, in the second quarter. The days of registered security service contracts improved another 12 days and has now returned to 2020 pre-supply chain, pre-COVID crisis levels. Inventory commitments and levels are normalizing at our contract manufacturers and in the channel. And as noted earlier, the sequential increase in hardware sales in the second quarter aligned more closely with historical norms. While these indicators are positive, we believe customers are currently managing a tough macro environment and a key election year in the U.S. and we believe this is having an impact on our customers' purchasing decisions. As a result, we believe a full refresh cycle is unlikely to occur in 2024 but more likely in 2025. Moving on to guidance. As a reminder, our third quarter and full year outlook which are summarized on Slides 21 and 22, it's subject to the disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Aaron provided at the beginning of the call. Before reviewing the outlook, I'd like to offer a few modeling notes in light of our Lacework and Next DLP acquisitions, covering estimates included in our Q3 and full year guidance. For billings, the acquisitions increased Q3 by approximately 0.5 point and the full year by approximately 1/3 point. Total revenue increased Q3 and full year growth by 1 point and 1.5 points, respectively. For gross margin, they decreased Q3 and full year margins by less than 0.5 point for each period. For operating margin, they decreased Q3 and full year margins by 3 points and 1.5 points, respectively. Inclusive of these acquisition-related estimates, for the third quarter, we expect billings in the range of $1.530 billion to $1.600 billion which at the midpoint represents growth of 5%, revenue in the range of $1.445 billion to $1.505 billion which at the midpoint represents growth of 10.5%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 79% to 80%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 30.5% to 31.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.56 to $0.58 which assumes a share count of between $767 million and $777 million. Capital expenditures of $40 million to $60 million. A non-GAAP tax rate of 17%. And cash taxes of $125 million to $145 million. And again, for the full year, inclusive of the numbers we gave a moment ago, we expect billings in the range of $6.400 billion to $6.600 billion; revenue in the range of $5.800 billion to $5.900 billion which at the midpoint represents growth of 10%. Service revenue remained of $3.975 billion to $4.025 billion which at the midpoint represents growth of 18%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 79% to 80%, Non-GAAP operating margin of 30% to 31.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.13 to $2.19 which assumes a share count of between 767 million and 777 million. Capital expenditures of $320 million to $360 million. Non-GAAP tax rate of 17% and cash taxes of between $525 million and $575 million. I look forward to updating you on our progress in coming quarters. Before we begin the Q&A session, it is with deep sadness that we recognize the passing of our friend, Peter Salkowski, our SVP of Finance and Investor Relations. Peter was an integral part of the Fortinet team for over 6 years and was renowned for is passion for mentoring and developing the next generation of leaders. We'll miss Peter and fondly remember his commitment to fostering talent and nurturing potential within our company. I know that Peter worked closely with many of you on this call and the outlining of condolences and heartfelt memories you've shared since his passing clearly shows the positive impact he had on so many people's lives. Peter took great pride in his contribution to Fortinet and rightly so. having contributed to increasing shareholder value from $8 billion to $46 billion during his tenure Fortinet. We'll miss Peter. Aaron, back to you. Yes. I think the gross margin is the largest driver of what you saw in the operating margin, particularly when you look at it on a quarter-over-quarter basis and in that, we talked about or made reference to a more normalized environment for us in terms of inventory levels, turns and what we're seeing with channel inventory but also commitments to our contract manufacturers. So I think that we've been working through that for probably the last 3 quarters, maybe 4 quarters. And with that, I would say, I think we've returned to a more normal state and so I would expect that to continue on. I think we're getting a little more contribution from sales and marketing than maybe I'd like at the moment and I would expect us to make a little bit more investments there as we go through the second half of the year. Keep in mind, we're getting a very large group of salespeople as Ken made reference to from both the Lacework and the Next DLP acquisitions. But I think we feel certainly comfortable with the guidance that we've given for both Q3 and for the full year on the margin line. Yes. I don't -- I mean, I think it's a good starting point is to look at the improvement in operating margin flowing through to free cash flow. Some of the changes that we monitor would be things like contract duration but you've seen now that industries and companies have been talking about contract duration for several quarters and you really haven't seen that come through to us yet. I should say, yes, habits going to come through to us. And so I'm not I think we have opportunity to leverage our balance sheet more with our customers and prospects that we have. But I don't see over the next 90 days or 180 days, a dramatic shift in that area. Yes. Again, I think the inventory part of that is I think we've worked our way back to a more normalized state. So I think that is our business model going forward for it that way. There can always be something that changes but I don't see us anticipating something in the gross margin line and that is by far and away the biggest opportunity there. I think it also says that we clearly have the opportunity to more -- invest more in go-to-market than we did in the first half of this year. And I think we've factored in some of that investment ideas or those ideas in our forecast and our guidance. In terms of whether or not I make Ken Cry, when I increase the margin the way I did, that's a different topic and I'll let him respond to that. Yes. I think the software license, if you kind of step back and look at what the business model is not to make it only simplistic, we want to -- it's so compelling to start with the firewall and it's very compelling to start with the ASIC. So a physical part of it, we don't always do that but we almost always start with a firewall, whether it's physical or virtual. Really, what you want to do is get the operating system in the hands of the customer. And what form factor that takes is we're fairly agnostic about that. So once that happens, then you start to see the knock-on effect of either selling more firewall use cases and other form factors into organizations or you're seeing that full portfolio, the SecOps product line take hold as continuous to expand throughout organization. So I would expect that we're going to continue to see tailwinds and growth, no doubt about it from the software part of the business. Will there be a mix shift that slows a little bit when firewall and FortiGate starts to return? Sure, absolutely. But this has been a trend that we talked about a little bit, I think, last quarter and probably some earlier quarters about the software mix and the mix shift that we've been seeing. So I would expect that, that's going to continue on given the success we're seeing in the other 2 pillars. Tal, I think I kind of missed -- very, very faint on your questions there. Maybe if you can give us maybe a little later recap of the 2 questions you had. Yes. I think that -- I mean if you kind of look at the recap of the year, there's not a lot of variability in it, if you will. We are a little bit light in the first quarter, we came back and recovered the first quarter shortage in the second quarter. Now you see us looking at the third quarter and maybe taking that just a little bit off of some of the Street numbers and looking to see a little bit of that back in the fourth quarter. But we're kind of taking the third quarter correction to the Street numbers and putting it into the full year number. But yes, offsetting a very, very similar amount in terms of what we expect to get from the acquisitions and that leaves the full year range very much intact. And I understand that tick up is quick, I understand part of that is I'm taking -- I'm getting inorganic benefit in that number of the 0.5 point that we talked about at the -- and really taking down the organic part of the business. But again, I think we're talking about small numbers here. Yes. I think the OpEx is probably a little lighter on the sales and marketing line than maybe we would like to see, particularly as we start looking at more opportunities as we get into the second half of the year and into 2025. So hopefully, we'll find some opportunities there to make investments. Obviously, you're going to get a fairly significant movement there from the 2 acquisitions that we just did and we gave the number about what the OpEx impact is going to be, that will largely be in sales and marketing. Buyback, I think that we still remain being opportunistic and that opportunistic number changes every 90 days as we reset our plans. Yes. I think because we are so diversified, as you kind of alluded to, 70% of the business is international and a little bit less than 30% in the U.S. And yes, there's been a lot of elections around the world this year but it's certainly the U.S. election, maybe weighing on people and every kind of taking a position of waiting to see. As you move -- pull back from that, the international emerging part of the business has been strong, very strong for several quarters and continues on to be. A lot of those are oil-producing countries and similar. So I think they've done well in this economic cycle. There are a little more risk there perhaps with geopolitical events in some of those countries. But to this point, it really hasn't had an impact there. We are much more likely to be the number 1 market share when you move outside the U.S. and parts of Europe and the Middle East and Latin America and parts of APAC. And I think having an incumbency advantage, if you will, helps you in those more challenging times because you're there, you're on site and you have that opportunity to cross-sell and upsell your installed base. Well, I look forward to seeing you in November at the Analyst Day and we'll talk more about 2025 and midterm numbers. But in the interim, I would probably say that if it's a white space account in some of these places like Lacework would be, for example, I think it's going to be much more prone to having a shorter duration contract. If it's part of that 90% of be selling SecOps or SASE solutions to my installed base. What I'm seeing to this point is my installed base continues to purchase in terms of contract duration, the way they have historically. So they haven't -- if I sell something from the SecOp portfolio into one of my firewall customers, they tend to sign up for a longer duration contract than you may see from a point solution vendor. Yes, Ken is spot on, right? It's a lumpy industry. Financial services can be to at times as well. But I think more importantly, I think the conversations around their own independent SASE solution that they can bring to market is something that's getting a lot more conversation from the service providers. I think we saw it first internationally and we're starting to see a little bit more of it here domestically. But that's going to -- that's a pretty exciting opportunity if it continues to move forward. Yes. I think there's a few things going on there. I think probably 9 months ago, we looked at the cost structure pretty closely. And across a number of areas. And the first place that people kind of look at and when you're in that vote is marketing programs and they get hit pretty hard early on. And I think you're trying to see that roll through you do make changes to your compensation programs, whether it's for direct salespeople or for channel people or what have you. And I think maybe as we're coming out of that environment now, it's important for us to kind of revisit some of those decisions and making sure I kind of talk about the investment opportunities that we have in the sales and marketing line. And I think I would include the channel net as well. It is why I would say that to your point or you're repeating me, probably a little bit lower than we would have liked it to have been in the second quarter. And I think we'll continue to make go-to-market investments here in the second half of the year. Just to repeat what Ken said, maybe a little more granularity. I think the price increases that you referred to, we're really probably a late '21, 2022 impact. And I don't think we're really raising prices at '23. We did take some prices down at the end of '23 and in the very beginning of 2024. But that's really been the only pricing actions we've taken in the last 6 months. And then to Ken's point, I think we're at a moment where we think it's probably -- the value for the solution is very, very strong. I think the energy costs that Ken mentioned is starting to get -- it's gotten a lot of traction internationally in Europe but you're starting to see more conversation around that in the U.S. and that could be people concerned about energy consumption and issues with AI and EV and government actions on manufacturing. So I do think the energy cost advantage is coming into play more. And then last one on that discounting was, I think, very much in line. I think we actually improved discounting meaning higher prices by about 1 point quarter-over-quarter and kind of a similar number one way or the other for the full year. So we obviously have room given the margins to use discounting and pricing as a lever. But I think there's other things that we'd like to push on first. Well, I think whether it's a virtual firewall or any other software product or the software licenses are all coming in at very, very attractive margins. I think that when you look at some of the SaaS solutions that are sitting in the services line for SecOps and so forth, you get a very wide range of margins there but it's only because of the relative size or maturity of the solution. Obviously, something that's very new and absorbing a lot of the hosting cost is a little harder. But those aren't as big numbers. As you see those SecOps solutions get greater and greater traction and more critical mass, the margins start to normalize. I think kind of what's really been exciting is the ability to absorb those data center POP, colo, everybody's got their hand in the products and on these things, cloud provider fees and developing the SaaS solutions and still bring up the services gross margin. And by the same token, being able to absorb the charge for Lacework on the operating margin line because we've managed the business in terms of cost of goods sold for the product side, I think we're really, really pleased with how those 2 things will work hand in hand. No, great question. I mean we've talked about 8-figure deals and our size 8-figure deals can kind of still will around, as you saw in the fourth quarter last year, we did 6 of them. We had one 8-figure deal, Q1. We had 2 in Q2. So I would wouldn't attribute to that. I think what we saw the last month of the quarter and particularly as we got into the last week of the quarter, what you see in a strong market is a lot of deals started to fall in place and we're getting across the finish line. I think we saw a lot more positiveness if you will, at the end of Q2 than maybe we saw say at the end of Q3 or something like that last year. Yes. I don't think that the form factor really impacts the visibility in terms of what's in the pipeline or how we work with the sales teams in terms of forecasting. I've not noticed a difference, if you will, in close rates between a virtual machine and a physical machine."

            "content": "This is John Whittle. There's a lot of positivity around that. We obviously just announced it today, we closed it yesterday. We did a lot of diligence on the company, The tech is great. And not only will we plan to offer it stand-alone but also integrated with our FortiSASE solution. And so I think it's another step in steadily bolstering our FortiSASE solution, We feel very, very confident in our strategy there. For the most part, as you know, I mean, we've done some tech and talent tuck-ins. Most of our technology is organic I think to some of the earlier questions, you think about the firewall market coming back next year. And we really just started kind of organizing our solutions into these 3 pillars less than a year ago and the amount of progress we've made and the execution we've made in kind of developing very, very competitive solutions in SASE and SecOps in addition to secure networking is pretty impressive. And I think this is an important step along the way to continue to develop the best SASE solution out there to protect our customers. Sorry, the sales execution with SASE and SecOps. Yes. No, it's a really good question. I think what we're seeing is it does take time. We are very focused on that broad sales enablement I always say, I mean, the opportunity just abounds from our solution set and we're always with a customer-first focus. So in terms of protecting and serving our customers the opportunity to bounce I think our sales force -- the good news is they have a ton of opportunity. I always say they're going to suffer more from indigestion than starvation. But we've got really a big focus in the company to really train up that sales force, enable that sales force, make sure we have the incentives in the right place and make sure we have the support. So when they do qualify different opportunities in different solution sets, the support to support them in that sale. So I think, like Keith had alluded to, we often land with the firewall and then expand and get that support to our sales force with SASE and SecOps solutions and we're seeing a lot of success there."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.  \n I would now like to hand the conference over to our first speaker today, Peter Salkowski, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nPeter Salkowski: Thank you, Brianna. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Peter Salkowski, Senior Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations at Fortinet. I am pleased to welcome everyone to our call to discuss Fortinet's financial results for the first quarter of 2024. Joining me on today's call are Ken Xie, Fortinet's Founder, Chairman and CEO; Keith Jensen, our CFO; and John Whittle, our Chief Operating Officer.  \n This is a live call that will be available for replay via webcast on our Investor Relations website. Ken will bring our call today by providing a high-level perspective on our business. Keith will then review our financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2024 before providing guidance for the second quarter of 2024 and updating the full year. We'll then open the call for questions. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question to allow others to participate.  \n Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, and these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Please refer to our SEC filings, in particular, the risk factors in our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for more information. All forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation and specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements.  \n Also, all references to financial metrics, which we make on today's call, are non-GAAP, unless stated otherwise. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are located in our earnings press release and in the presentation that accompany today's remarks, both of which are posted on our Investor Relations website. The prepared remarks for today's call will be posted on the quarterly earnings section of the Investor Relations website immediately following the call. Lastly, all references to growth are on a year-over-year basis, unless noted otherwise.  \n I'll now turn the call over to Ken. \nKen Xie: Thank you, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining our call. Q1, we've managed business with strong spending discipline and increased our operation margin 200 basis points to a first quarter record of 28.5%. We also generated record cash flow from operations of $830 million, and our adjusted free cash flow margin was 61%. \n We remain focused on investing in a fast-growing Unified SASE and secure operation market, which, combined, accounted for 1/3 of first quarter billings. We continue to gain security networking market share, leveraging our advanced and differentiated FortiOS and FortiASIC technologies with an increasing number of large customer adopting our industry-leading Secure Networking solutions. \n Last month, attendance in our annual Accelerate conference increased 25% year-over-year to nearly 5,000 participants. Our Unified SASE and new AI offering dominated the discussion with our partner and customers. \n For the first quarter, Unified SASE accounted for 24% of total billings. To introduce customer and prospect to our new Unified SASE solution, we plan to run attractive promotions this year in 2024. For several reasons, we believe no service secure company come close toward differentiated Unified SASE solutions. \n First, we have developed all Unified SASE functionality into one single operation system, the FortiOS. This includes a full networking and security set comprised of a ZTNA, Secure Web Gateway, CASB and our market-leading SD-WAN and firewall technologies, providing content, application, user, device and location awareness to reduce attacks. \n Second, our Unified SASE solution can be deployed on-premise, in the cloud, or both. Peer solutions send a traffic to copy the PoP, increasing security risk and latency and is less efficient. Last, Fortinet Unified SASE offer both traditional software endpoint agent and how are agents such as FortiWiFi access point and FortiSwitch for customers, with easier deployment and more broad use case such as Unified SASE for OT and IoT devices. We expect our differentiated Unified SASE offering to emerge as the SASE leader. \n Fortinet advanced platform approach has been earning third-party awards for many years. Last month, we entered Gartner Magic Quadrant for Secure Service Edge. As shown on the Slide 12 in the investor presentation. Fortinet is the only vendor recognized in the Gartner Magic Quadrant Report for Security Service Edge, SD-WAN, Single-Vendor SASE, Network Firewall and Enterprise Wired and Wireless LAN infrastructure. \n All 5 security and network offering from Fortinet are uniquely built on one operating system, the FortiOS, and a leverage of FortiASIC to increase secure computing power for more functions and better performance while lowering the cost and energy consumption. \n Fortinet's Secure Ops solution, which are better integrated and automate than competitors, accounted for 9% of total billings. Initially launched as part of our FortiSIEM and FortiSOAR, our Gen AI technology, FortiAI, is being deployed across both networking and security products. \n And today, we announced the industry-first IoT security Generative AI assistant. Customers can ask FortiAI to help in 30-plus languages. Fortinet is also the market leader in OT security solutions, the fastest-growing space in network security, with billings of device connected online, and the most OT device has a limited compiling power, making new secure the most effective experience of security.  \n Today, we announced the FortiGate 200G, a mid-range fire were powered by a new SD FortiASIC with secure computing rating of 3 expected performance real-time petites and industry average. We're enforcing our leading networking and Unified SASE advantage that provides customers with industry-leading security functions, performance and power efficiency.  \n Before turning the call over to Keith, I wish to thank our employees, customers, partners and suppliers worldwide for their continuous support and hard work. \nKeith Jensen: Thank you, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's start with the key highlights from the first quarter. As Ken mentioned, we continue to manage the business through the macro uncertainty and successfully drove operating margin to a first quarter record of 28.5%, exceeding the high end of the guidance range by 200 basis points.  \n Free cash flow of $609 million represents a 45% free cash flow margin, benefiting from strong Q4 '23 billings and their subsequent collection in Q1 of '24. Billings of $1.41 billion and revenue of $1.35 billion were within their respective guidance ranges. \n Looking at billings in more detail. While Unified SASE and SecOps delivered strong billings growth, total billings declined 6% as expected. The billings performance was driven by the difficult year-earlier comparison, created by the backlog contribution to billings that occurred in last year's first quarter. \n Total bookings were down just slightly. Unified SASE and SecOps had outstanding growth across a variety of benchmarks in the first quarter. In addition, we saw significant progress from our investments in Unified SASE and SecOps. These include cross-selling into our large installed base. Existing customers delivered over 90% of SecOps and Unified SASE billings. \n On an even more targeted basis, existing SD-WAN customers delivered 81% of Unified SASE billings. Larger enterprises are proving to be our largest customer segment. with large and enterprise -- large and mid-enterprises representing 78% and 84% of SecOps and Unified SASE billings, respectively. Even with increasing scale, both pillars have strong pipeline growth, 30% for SecOps and over 45% for Unified SASE. \n More importantly, within SASE, the SSE pipeline growth is over 150%. Our investment in SASE is being recognized by third-party agencies. We recently recorded the Trifecta with Gartner's SASE Magic Quadrants, SSE, SD-WAN and single vendor SASE. \n And as Ken noted, with last month's addition to SSE, Fortinet now appears in 5 Network Security Gartner Magic Quadrants, again, all running on a single operating system. With the SASE Magic Quadrant Trifecta, customers have shown increased interest in learning more about our unique SASE platform that runs on the one operating system with one Unified agent, one management system and one data lake. \n To offer an example of customer interest at our Accelerate conference early last month, the SASE demo booth was our most active as customers surveyed SASE's new features and functions including end-to-end digital experience monitoring, remote browser isolation, advanced data loss prevention and third-party SD-WAN connectivity. \n As a second example, Nearly 25% of the accelerated attendees who joined our CMO for the SASE breakout session. The attendee number for this breakout session would have been even higher if it wasn't for the fire marshals regulations that forced us to turn away customers and partners who are eager to hear more about the SASE offering.  \n And to offer one final example, the customer partner SASE Fast Track training program at Fortinet, which launched in January, is already this #2 most attended technical training session, trending only a single vendor SASE partner, SD-WAN. We're committed to driving more effective security solutions worldwide and welcome greater partnership with our industry peers. The new third-party SD-WAN connectivity technology is designed to support consolidation not only on Fortinet, but with Fortinet.  \n In terms of scale, we continue to open new Google and Fortinet PoPs in sync with our customers' expanding footprint and driving the deployment scale demanded by large enterprises. And a quick update on that 7-figure 300,000 seat education deal that we mentioned last quarter, the full production environment was activated in March, and we are on track to have their 300,000-plus seats on board to start the new school year. \n To expand on Ken's earlier comment on today's AR-related announcement, Fortinet's Gen AI assistant follows our FortiAI launch last year, by supporting and guiding SOC and NOC teams as they configure and manage changes to their network and investigate and remediate threats. Its intuitive interface allows individuals to engage using 30 different natural languages, bridging the industry's skill shortage. I encourage everyone to visit fortinet.com to learn more about the Gen AI system. \n Rounding out our billings commentary, SMB was a top-performing customer segment. International Emerging was our best-performing geography. And our 3 largest industry verticals continue to be worldwide government, service providers and financial services. Service provider and worldwide government experienced the highest growth while retail and financial services were a bit more challenged.  \n As noted in our prior call, the 6 8-figure deals in Q4 '23 pushed our average contract term in DSO to elevated levels. The average contract term in the first quarter was 27 months, down just under 1 month year-over-year and 3.5 months quarter-over-quarter. DSO decreased 12 days year-over-year and 23 days quarter-over-quarter to 66 days.  \n Turning to revenue and margins. Total revenue grew 7% to $1.35 billion, driven by service revenue growth. Service revenue of $944 million grew 24%, accounting for 70% of total revenue and a revenue mix shift to services of 10 points. Service revenue growth was led by over 30% growth from Unified SASE and SecOps. Product revenue decreased 18% as expected, to $409 million coming off a challenging 35% year earlier compare impacted by backlog fulfillment in the prior year.  \n Software license revenue increased 20% and represented a mid- to high teens mix of product revenue. Total net product bookings were down just slightly. Combined revenue from software licenses and software services such as cloud and SASE security options, increased 29% and represented an annual revenue run rate approaching $750 million. \n Total gross margin of 78.1% was up 180 basis points and exceeded the high end of our guidance range, benefiting from the mix shift to higher-margin service revenues. Service gross margins of 87.9% were up 200 basis points as service revenue outpaced labor cost increases and benefited from the mix shift towards higher-margin FortiGuard security subscriptions.  \n Product gross margin of 55.7% as we -- were pressured as we saw challenges related to inventory levels and the transition to a more normalized demand environment. Operating margin of 28.5% was 200 basis points above the high end of our guidance range, reflecting the strong gross margins and prudent cost management. \n Looking at the statement of cash flows summarized on Slide 16 and 17. Free cash flow was $609 million. Adjusted free cash flow, which excludes real estate investments, was $821 million, representing a 61% adjusted free cash flow margin. Infrastructure investments totaled $222 million, including $212 million of real estate investments. \n Cash taxes in the quarter were $31 million. And while we did not repurchase shares in Q1, share buybacks have totaled $5.3 billion over the past 4-plus years and the remaining buyback authorization is $1 billion.  \n Now I'd like to share a few significant wins in the first quarter. I'll start with the 1 8-figure deal in the quarter, a competitive displacement and new logo win. This large U.S. financial institution selected Fortinet as part of their data center update and consolidation projects. \n Key to this win included our experience in this highly regulated customer data-sensitive industry and our ability to lower the total cost of ownership and exceed their low latency performance requirements. Similar to other large financial institutions separating from their incumbent, this customer is expanding their Fortinet footprint by adding our SD branch solution and planning to consolidate additional technologies. \n Next, in the competitive 7-figure win, a hospitality company that serves over 5 million guests annually updated their various Fortinet solutions, including their FortiGate firewall footprint and FortiNAC solutions. Keys to expanding our relationship included our price-to-performance advantage on the firewalls and the next solutions proven ability to discover and lock down devices that attempt to join their network, together with the operational simplicity, and integration of a dozen different Fortinet solutions the customer uses. \n In another 7-figure deal, a hotel and restaurant chain purchased our SD branch solution for 800 locations as well as our data center FortiGates for centralized management and enhanced security. The solution from our network security pillar included firewalls, switches and access points as well as a variety of software products.  \n The SE branch solutions bring improved efficiency and security over their branches and IoT devices. Key to this win and in other retail opportunities is enabling retailers to deploy, expand and deliver a growing array of in-store digital solutions to support their customers' experience and increase their top line performance. \n As these customer wins illustrate, our Security Fabric platform includes each of our security pillars, Unified South, AI-driven SecOps and secured networking, making it the most integrated, most open portfolio of products in the industry backed by 1 operating system, FortiOS; 1 Unified agent, FortiClient; 1 management console, FortiManager; 1 data lake, FortiAnalyzer; and open APIs and integration with over 500 competitor and other third-party products. This integration allows customers to consolidate security solutions, thereby reducing operational costs, while increasing security effectiveness. \n Moving to guidance. As a reminder, our first quarter and full year outlook, which are summarized on Slides 21 and 22, are subject to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the second quarter, we expect billings in the range of $1.490 billion to $1.550 billion, which, at the midpoint, represents a decline of 1%. \n Revenue in the range of $1.375 billion to $1.435 billion, which, at the midpoint, represents growth of 9%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 76.5% to 77.5%, non-GAAP operating margin of 25.75% to 26.75%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.39 to $0.41, which assumes a share count of between 775 million and 785 million. Capital expenditures of $30 million to $40 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of 17% and cash taxes of $240 million to $270 million.  \n Before updating the full year guidance, I'd like to elaborate on the backlog headwinds easing in the second half of 2024 and share what we believe we are starting to see as early signs that the firewall digestion cycle is nearing completion. First, the billings headwind from last year's backlog drawdown is over $150 million in 2024 and gradually diminishes throughout the year with no headwind in the fourth quarter. And second, we're looking for early signs of a more normalized firewall market, one metric we watch is the average days to register security service contracts, as shown on Slide 19. \n In 2022, we noted that the user registered has increased about 50%, which was consistent with customers' buying and stocking behaviors at the time. More recently, this metric decreased by about 25% from SP and is now consistent with late 2021 levels. It is on a pace to return to normal levels in the second half of 2024. A reasonable read-through of the data is that customers are completing the inventory digestion process and are on the path to a more normalized firewall-buying behavior. \n And with that, for the year, we expect billings in the range of $6.400 billion to $6.600 billion; revenue in the range of $5.745 billion to $5.845 billion, which, at the midpoint represents growth of 9%; service revenue in the range of $3.940 billion to $3.990 billion, which, at the midpoint represents growth of 17%; non-GAAP gross margin of 76.5% to 78%; non-GAAP operating margin of 26.5% to 28%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.73 to $1.79, which assumes a share count of between 780 million and 790 million; capital expenditures of $350 million to $400 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of 17%; and cash taxes of between $500 million and $550 million. \n I look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters. And I'll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A session. \nPeter Salkowski: Thank you, Keith. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please open up the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Hamza Fodderwala from Morgan Stanley. \nHamza Fodderwala: Perhaps both for Ken and Keith, you spoke to a lot of green shoots in your prepared remarks. SMB service provider growth looks a little healthier. You're getting a recognition on SASE, and you spoke to competitive replacements. \n That said, the billings in Q1 was a bit closer to the lower end of your guidance versus the high end. So just curious what drove that? And what gives you confidence based on what you're seeing in the pipeline to maintain your guidance and continue to assume a reacceleration on the top line in the back half of the year? \nKeith Jensen: Yes, I'll talk about the full year. I think that if you look at where we ended up in the first quarter, inside the guidance range, maybe just a little bit of weakness that we saw in Europe, just enough to move us off the midpoint, but not really a big movement in terms of where we are in our final results compared to the midpoint. \n And if we look at where we end up with the total for the year, I don't think we're at all far off from the plan that we thought. Maybe there's some more [indiscernible]  there that you're kind of pointing out. But as we look at the pipeline, to your point, I think the mix that we see in our pipeline today, together with some of the hygiene improvements that we worked on for the last 6 to 9 months, I think we feel better about where we end up with the full year numbers, if you will. \n I think, at the same time, when you look at the full year numbers and some of the outperformance in the quarter or better performance, if you will, with service revenue and product revenue, you see us bringing that number up a little bit. But importantly, at the same time, you see us also bringing up the margin number on the bottom line by about 0.75 of a point. \nKen Xie: Yes. I think the high interest rate, making the money kind of more expensive, have a lot of enterprise kind of probably more favored OpEx instead of a CapEx for some of the networking security project. So that's where -- that's also the reason we're starting shifting the focus more on the kind of the SASE or kind of SecureOps, which is really more helping company saving the cost at the same time, kind of -- some kind of OpEx model.\n  So that's probably -- at the same time, we do make some adjustment in certain product price back to like pre-pandemic level, before the [indiscernible]. That's happening in Q1, probably has a little bit of impact, but it's -- overall, I think the product competitive is still more and more strong. \n And we still see a lot of replacement of our competitive product, which tend to be more expensive. And especially the new FortiOS introduced last month with more function, including the function in Unified SASE, all these things drive a lot of our change from the customer, and they're all interested to these new OS and the new product we have launched. \nOperator: Our next question is from Gabriela Borges of Goldman Sachs. \nGabriela Borges: For either Ken or Keith, I'd love to get an update on your pricing strategy more broadly. More specifically, how do you think about the trade-off between discounting when you're cross-selling a broader bundle of portfolios such as SecOps or SSE services versus being able to capture some of the value from the cross-sell? How do you think about that trade-off? \nKen Xie: I think our price strategy is pretty consistent in the last 20-plus years. We want to maintain a healthy gross margin and also a healthy margin for the partners. And when we see certain cost increase like doing the supply chain shortage, whether the component costs or some shipping costs increase, we kind of increase the price. But now some of the costs coming down, we also kind of returned some margin to the partner and also low on product price to match the pre-pandemic level. \n But I think all this supply chain change in missing is over and also we're probably more focused on the new product and which follow kind of a healthy margin guideline. And I don't think we have adjust any pricing for the existing product anymore. It's really more focused on when we introduce a new product, we just want to make sure it's a healthy margin for all the parties. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Essex from JPMorgan. \nBrian Essex: Appreciate it. Maybe for Ken, in terms of the SASE traction that you saw in the quarter, how much was SD-WAN conversion? And maybe a little bit -- if you could give us a little more color on the split of the customers that you saw in that business, the spot of maybe large and mid, small enterprise, so we can get a sense of competitively how you might be lining up against some of the peers in that SASE market? \nKen Xie: I think that's a great question. I think we have a slide for that. \nKeith Jensen: Try to ask that question. Yes. I think we also included in the prepared, and I'll tap the answer while somebody follows the actual slide number for you, Brian. But I think that existing customers were over 90% for both SASE and for SecOps, so they were expansion sales. \n And Ken's kindly pointing out to me my Slide #8 is in the deck that actually give you a little more context for it. One change you may notice there is that, for the first few quarters, when we talk about customer mix and expansion opportunity, we did it by customer counts, believing that we were going to have a lot of penetration with the SMB space. \n And that was where you get a larger number to start seeing some patterns. What we've now seen is that the large enterprises and the mid-enterprises are actually dominating both of those pillars of growth. And with that, we've just converted those pie charts to dollar values, which is more traditional where we expect it to get eventually. \nBrian Essex: Okay. Great. Maybe just as a quick follow-up on that topic. I think you mentioned, if I'm not mistaken, Unified SASE 81% of -- I'm sorry, SD-WAN, 81% of Unified SASE billings. And I think you might have given that metric to back into SD-WAN last quarter, if you could maybe iterate what that was? \nKeith Jensen: Yes, Brian. What we're trying to say there is that I think we're -- there's a common belief internally and probably externally that we're going to have a lot of success with the SASE solution by cross-selling our existing SD-WAN customers. And so the SASE billings that we saw this quarter, I believe the number was 81% of those were existing SD-WAN customers. \nKen Xie: Yes. And also, we build SD-WAN function into the FortiOS, which, whenever you have a FortiCare, we believe like close to 60%, 70% customer all have by the FortiCare, they have automatic SD-WAN function. And so that's where we do see other SD-WAN, current SD-WAN customer, which we were not fully tracking because the part of our [ list function free ] of charge. So we do believe a lot of them are [ interest ] come into SASE for SASE function there. \nOperator: Our next question is from Fatima Boolani from Citi. \nFatima Boolani: Keith, I wanted to -- have you spent a little bit of more time talking about some of the geographic theater-level performances. So we've seen a pretty material deceleration in your Americas business. EMEA has been relatively resilient and APAC's actually shrunk this quarter. So I was hoping you could put a lens on each one of those geographies to talk about any nuances or idiosyncrasies from a demand and/or buying perspective from an end market standpoint or a customer attribution standpoint. And then just a follow-up with regards to if you can talk about the pipeline and pipeline growth you're seeing with secure SD-WAN proper, considering that is such an important conduit for future SASE upsells. \nKeith Jensen: Okay. where to begin? Kind of cherry picking through some data points. I think one -- first and foremost, the SMB continues to perform stronger than expectations, whether that's external to the company or from other sources, if you will, it's very resilient. And I think it's simply the breadth of the SMB space together with, as I've said in the past, the success of the channel program. \n I think Europe was just a tad that light in the quarter and a little bit on the enterprise side of their business and probably just enough, as I said before, to move us off of the midpoint of our guidance. \n I think what we spent a fair amount of time with more recently is looking at where the 8-figure deal is coming from. And if you're looking at the deceleration, and let's take the U.S. enterprise as an example of that, last quarter, we talked about 6, 8-figure deals in the business. The vast majority of those are in the U.S. enterprise. \n This quarter, we generally noted that we had one 8-figure deal. And so you can see that those 8-figure deals can whipsaw that growth rate for the U.S. enterprise around quite a bit really because if there are opportunities in these 8-figure deals that maybe some of the other geos don't have. We really don't have those opportunities in APAC and some of the other geographies that we see in the U.S. \n I think the other part of growth, I mean, I think we I think we have to understand where the firewall growth is right now in terms of the industry. And with that, it puts a lot of the pressure or opportunity for us to sell the SASE solutions and the SecOps solutions. And you're probably seeing a little more maturity in the ability to sell or the openness to buy SecOps and SASE solutions in the U.S. and in Europe, the larger economies, than you are in APAC. \nKen Xie: Yes. Also, Japan probably kind of about is the biggest country for us in APAC and probably 1/3 of more APAC, which the currency like the U.S. currency pretty strong again. Japan currency is that may also have some impact of some slowdown there. On the other side, we do see most SD-WAN customers definitely more interest in the SASE and also in the current environment, more and more customer set in terms SD-WAN because SD-WAN definitely have been a cost saving. So on average, it's about 50% in cost savings compared to the traditional NPI or other networking function there. So we do see more and more customer first converting to SD-WAN customer and then using the same FortiGate adding additional SASE function there. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Tal Liani of Bank of America. \nTal Liani: You gave some comments at the end of your prepared remarks about signs of recovery of the firewall market? And would you mind to repeat that? You went over quickly in -- the question is also with it, do you expect the non-FortiGate to recover? Is there a correlation between the two? Do you expect the non-FortiGate to recover? And -- or does it have its own cycle. \n On the first question, which is about the firewall recovery, do you see that the market share situation is changing, meaning the share gains you experienced in the 3 years of the boom cycle, do you have any reason to believe that it's going to slow down or you're going to maintain market share gain? How does it change when the market recovers, what drives the share dynamics to change or to stay stable? \nKeith Jensen: Do you want to take the market share and the mix, and then I'll go through the algebra on Slide 19. \nKen Xie: Yes. I think we believe we continue gaining market share even right now the quarter -- last quarter in the cyclical secure networking, which both the firewall and also some other like  FortiWiFi FortiSASE space there. And I think because whether the strong performance advantage, we have all kind of more function can give a customer, like a better ROI return and better security and also more deployed case compared with the traditional firewall. So we feel we're keeping gaining market share. \n But overall, I have to say that whether the network secure firewall market or the networking market definitely has gone down like 10% to 20% year-over-year. But even in that market condition, we keep on gaining more share -- market share in this environment. Keith probably will answer the digestion question. \nKeith Jensen: But yes, for people that have access to it, Slide 19 in the deck. And for those -- a lot of you have followed the company for quite a while and you remember that we have some pressure on software revenue early in the pandemic, and we talked about things like the impact from Russia, but also that we were seeing a delay in customers registering the service contracts that attached to the hardware contracts. \n And if you look at that chart, you can see that, that delaying activity really started at the end of 2021, peaked at the end of the beginning of '23, kind of plateaued and now has moved down. And what we believe as you're seeing there is that when the supply chain hit, customers bought the equipment, put it on the shelves and did not need to register the contract as quickly and that's why you saw the increase in the days of register. \n Now as we move through the digestion cycle, you've seen that inventories come off their shelves and those days to register are starting to return to normal. We're not quite there, but we're actually quite close to it. And I would just offer that, I think, as I said, by the second half and the second half of this year on the current pace, we would return to where we were at pre-COVID on that metric. And again, we think that's a very good indicator of where customers are in the digestion cycle. \nTal Liani: Got it. And what about the question on non-FortiGate. What are the cycles within non-FortiGate on the FortiGate side? \nKeith Jensen: Well, first of all, you're going to get me in trouble for using the term non-FortiGate. We talked about SASE and SecOps, but we're all showing our age here a little bit. \nKen Xie: The notice probably around 10% of our product, that's probably -- all the networking side, definitely down a little bit, but there's some other like whether the FortiWeb, FortiMail some other we see for we see pretty strong growth. So it's a mix. But overall, I think pretty much similar like the FortiGate mix. But definitely, we see it. \n And on the other side, we do see some early signs of interest a customer using our FortiWiFi AP FortiSwitch as a hardware agent for the SASE. So that's also one of the promotions we're going to really offer some customer. If they got a FortiWiFi, they probably can run some free FortiSASE function for some time. So that we see could be driving additional non-FortiGate growth. But we -- actually, all the non-FortiGate product, we also have a technology called FortiLink. It's all like FortiGate, like FortiGate, whether that's kind of the aging firewall host or a host working together with FortiWiFi or FortiSwitch. \nOperator: Our next question is from Rob Owens of Piper Sandler. \nRobbie Owens: Keith, I want to build a little bit on your answer to Fatima's question earlier. And I believe you used the technical term of whipsawing when it comes to growth when you saw 6 large transactions, very large transactions in Q4 and 1 in Q1. \n And just I wanted to ask it relative to health and enterprise and what you're seeing here in the pipeline. Should we expect similar types of results in terms of those very large deals as we move throughout the year? And how do you think the pipeline is setting up in relative health of the enterprise? \nKeith Jensen: Yes, I feel good about it. And I think we're -- the parallel that I've drawn in the conversations before is that if you went back to 2015, '16, you saw the company moving away from -- or expanding beyond the SMB space and doing $1 billion deals. But it wasn't that there was enough $1 million deals that we couldn't get whipside by them then. \n Now we've got plenty -- well, I can always take more, plenty of million dollar deals, but the $10 million deals are whipsawing us around a little bit. You saw that with a very strong performance in the fourth quarter. And I think we were pretty open about that in the fourth quarter and setting expectations for the first. One thing we have spent some time doing is going back and looking at the number of 8-figure deals we have by quarter, for, say, the last 3 or 4 years. \n And you're looking at a model that maybe had one of the other quarter or 5 years ago to now where you're probably average something on the order of 2, perhaps 3 of opportunities over a full year per quarter. They're going to get condensed sometimes in certain quarters. With our business model in the history, you see that Q4 obviously outperforms as does Q2 typically perform strongly. And I suspect as we look forward, we'll see a little more concentration on those 8-figure deals certainly in Q4 and maybe some in Q2. \nOperator: Our next question is from Saket Kalia of Barclays. \nSaket Kalia: Okay. Great. Ken, maybe the first one is for you. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about how your conversations are going with customers around their plans to refresh their firewall appliances. And maybe specifically, when would we sort of expect that firewall refresh to sort of begin? Does that make sense? \nKen Xie: Yes. The 3 parts of the business. One, like Keith mentioned, is really the digestion whatever supply chain issue. I think that's pretty much over, maybe just a few more months, it will be all normal. And the second part is really the refresh, which is the current customer over the new product, which has a better performance, all the things there. I have to say, seeing the economy slowdown or high interest rate environment, some customer may stretch the current product a little bit longer. \n And -- but we do see more cases, we call it replacement, and also the new area like OT/IoT security. So we do see the requirement pick up quite well, which, when they face in like where they need a new function, like the new SD-WAN function or the SASE function, a lot of our big enterprise starting using our product to replace a more competitive product because they have to offer like multiple product to match one of our FortiGate or FortiOS solution there. \n And we also have a much better performance and power efficiency. We use [indiscernible] measure for every product. So that's replacement case, definitely picking up quite well. The refresh probably would still need some time to come. And on the other side, the new area like OTT security, we see other strong growth. \n So that's a new market because really all this OT devices not connected online or kind of canola has now protection and pretty much impossible to run endpoint software because of different operating system living computing power. So we see this new OTL space pick up quite well. That's the new market. So long-term wise, I still believe the network security market continued to grow. \n And -- but probably will be more mix in the current environment, probably a little bit more towards the OpEx model, which is kind of a -- and -- but for us, the differentiation is really, we have all the staff in the same FortiGate operating system FortiOS, which customers can run whether on-premise or in the cloud and the PoP. So we do see a lot of customers that then turn on the SASE function, maybe starting the SASE function first, then the additional strategy function, additional SASE service. So that's the way they are starting doing now. \nSaket Kalia: Got it. Got it. And maybe the follow-up is on that point, kind of if I can stay with you. Just on that topic of refresh and replacement, is there any sort of change in thinking for those customers about firewall versus SASE? And I mean, as part of the discussion, you mentioned pricing earlier, are you getting any sort of pushback on just appliance pricing since sort of the prior round of adjustments that you did sort of during the supply chain? \nKen Xie: We have not seen any pricing pressure discount because we tend to be much better performance and more function because of ASIC technology and none of our competitor has. On the other side, [ billion ] customer considered a new function they needed for security or higher network speed environment, I think compare us to some competitor because competitors sometimes they just cannot keep in function like all the SD-WAN function in their existing firewall for us is very, very different. \n So we have all the SD-WAN function, all the new SASE function built in into the same FortiOS running on different kind of FortiGate device there. So that's also kind of helping customers to really keep adding additional functions sometimes without really replacing the existing hardware, so that's really helping the customer keeping kind of adding surveys and had secured with new function there. \n And also, that's also driving a lot of replacement of our competitor solution, especially in the big enterprise environment. So that's we see the strong -- the strongest growing area for us actually is enterprise customers, which they not enter some finance stretch because the high cost are the money. But we do see that the growing in our enterprise space or strong and a lot of replacement of competitive solution using the FortiGate which has a more function, better performance, low cost and also more efficient on the energy consumption there. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick of analysts. \nBrad Zelnick: And because we just had 2 for Ken, I think I'm going to now go for 2 with Keith, if we could. Keith, first one, I think, pretty straightforward with $1 billion left in your buyback authorization and the strong cash generation of the business, I was surprised to see and not buy back any stock in the quarter. Can you just remind us of your approach to buybacks and if any change in thinking around use of cash and specifically M&A? \nKeith Jensen: Peter's point, get our COO for M&A answers. So we're all -- listen, leaning forward here wants to say. I don't think there's been any real change in our buyback philosophy. We -- the term we use is we're very opportunistic. We do put a program in place with one of the Wall Street firms each quarter and we renew it. \n I think the important part there is looking at the $5 billion that we bought back over the last 4 years, and it's not that we're doing some other companies would do x percent of free cash flow or something like that. It is really looking for market opportunities and when we see them. can typically steps in and have something set up in that regard. And now John Whittle has been -- going to get a chance to join. \nJohn Whittle: Thank you for the question. on M&A, we've always been very, very disciplined. We've done some very strategic tech and talent tuck-ins. And I think you'll see -- we're open-minded. We consider M&A as it makes sense, but that's definitely been our approach so far. And I think you'll see that approach continue, although we will be [indiscernible] about M&A as it makes sense. \nBrad Zelnick: And maybe just my follow-up. I'm sorry, please. \nKen Xie: Probably is the most busy time in the last 10, 20 years now to look at all different companies. \nJohn Whittle: Yes. We see a lot of opportunities in the securities base for sure. And so yes, we build a pipeline just like sales build the pipeline, and we consider them as they come along and reach out on product as well. \nBrad Zelnick: Got it. That makes all the sense in the world, and you guys have done a great job of it over the years. Maybe just on the margin discipline that -- and the leverage that we're seeing in the quarter, Keith, can you maybe just give us an update on head count plans and where you are year-to-date? And as maybe relative to 3 months ago, how enthusiastic you are and where you are in sort of pushing or pulling back on the throttle to continue hiring and how we should think about OpEx? \nJohn Whittle: If I can, we're going to say something on hire. \nKen Xie: It's okay. I think we continue to invest balance the gross margin. So the area like a lot of on the long-term product, we continue to invest, and we do the selective hiring. And also, we also take this opportunity to mixing the management ratio or structure will be better. So it's more invest in the field sales engineering and also the R&D area and the kind of more flat on certain management level and making the whole company more efficient. \nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think the -- setting aside the fact that need more resources in finance, but I was hoping Ken was just going to announce that, but that's probably not. The -- I think the business model, Brad, you've seen it through the cycles where -- if you look back at 2017, for example, and if you look at the gross margin number, when you start to see the slowdown of the pause, the cycle and the hardware, you start to see the mix shift to the really rich services. .\n And then as the market recovers, you see that relationship change a little bit. Clearly, we're in a situation right now with the firewall market that the mix shifted 10 points of services, and I think that was 87% gross margin. It's making margin targets very achievable, let's put it that way. And I would imagine, I think we raised it by 0.75 of a point at the midpoint for the full year. That's a pretty big move at this point, and I think we feel very comfortable with that as we look at the rest of 2024. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Bollin of Cleveland Research Company. \nBenjamin Bollin: Keith, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the receivables drawdown and the DSO performance. I believe you made a comment on your prepared remarks about large deal impact in collections, but it does look like DSOs are below what we've seen for the last few years. So I'm curious if there's a change in working capital management. Anything notable there? \nKeith Jensen: No, I don't think there's really a change. I think there's always a few puts and takes, if you will. I think the real driver was that last quarter, we had those 6 8-figure deals, and I believe all those closed in the last week or 2 of the quarter. So that put a lot of pressure on DSOs and only having one 8-figure deal this quarter, which I believe closed fairly early in the quarter, in mid-quarter, but not in the last week. So I think that's really all I would point to there. \nBenjamin Bollin: Okay. And the last one for me. You talked a little bit about duration. If you step back, a lot of your business is done through the partner community. Do you have any thoughts on how much of that business is being financed by the partners themselves to manage this kind of CapEx to OpEx appetite? Any thoughts there would be helpful. \nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think when you say partners, I would say that all the large distributors that we're working with are offering financing programs, either in some cases, it might be through their own captive. But I think more often not, it's white labeling somebody else's product, if you will. I think that also some of the larger resellers are also offering financing. \n I think that where it makes a little more sense for ourselves as an OEM is on larger deals, whether we move to the extended payment program or working with the channel and provide them capital, if you will, for the financing. I think there's a lot of different ways to go there. But I don't think good credits, so to speak, are suffering because they can't find credit. I don't think that's the issue. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Borg of Stifel. \nAdam Borg: Awesome. Maybe for Ken, last quarter, you talked about a great job with increasing traction with enterprise agreements. And I was hoping you could talk. Obviously, I know 1Q is typically a smaller EA quarter. Maybe talk a little bit more about the EA strategy overall and the go-to-market efforts to more systematically drive these enterprise agreements, especially in the back half of this year? \nKen Xie: Yes, I think we do see when we have a more enterprise customer and they also want to be long-term customers and also with many different products like the consolidation strategy they have right now, we see more EA. And at the same time, with that one, we definitely see kind of a bigger deal and also kind of a more long-term customer can be with us right now. \nKeith Jensen: Yes. I think that -- and John took this over, so he gets to make that -- his habitual rap on EAs. But as Ken kind of alluded to it, it tends to make a lot of sense when -- you're -- most usually going to see it as part of your expansion inside of a larger enterprise. You're probably not going to see it frequently with the very first sale into a new logo, you could. And I think some things that are really we're starting to see resonate there are the new FortiPoints program that we make available and things with that nature, where customers have reached that point where they're very comfortable for in that for the technology and our customer support, et cetera, and they start thinking about long-term relationships. They know they're going to buy more. They may not know what. But the combination of EAs and FortiPoints, I think, has been well received by the customer group. \nAdam Borg: That's great. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. In the slide deck, I didn't recall seeing the breakout of the FortiGate by small, medium and large. I know that indicator has been less meaningful more recently. I was just curious, is anything interesting there as you think about the FortiGate sales by size? \nKeith Jensen: No. I think the two that take it really -- you see us at this point in the firewall cycle, it's really for us, we want to increase the focus on SASE. I think we feel very good about it. you see us adding some more information there. And to your point that it wasn't anything that was really new or earth shattering on the FortiGates. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Bachman of BMO. \nKeith Bachman: And Peter and Keith, I appreciate the slides. I did find 7 and 8 to be quite interesting. And I want to focus my first question on that. And if you look at the amount of billings from SASE, 24%. Is there -- just any clarification on -- of that 24%, how much is SD-WAN? And then if I look at the SecOps really interesting that enterprise is 40% of the SecOps. And is there just any patterns or anything that's kind of bubbling up as a frequent purchase within the SecOps portfolio you have that is serving to be pretty interesting to the enterprise? \n I just -- I thought that 40% number was quite interesting. And believe it or not, I'm going to count that as one question. And then, Keith, just anything you could think about or guide us on the FortiCare support line item as we think about the correlation to the product sales, and then I will cede the floor before Peter gets a chance to cut me off. \nKeith Jensen: I need to reverse what I covered FortiCare, FortiGuard. I think it's a great question is FortiCare, which is the traditional support offering, we talk about services being a lagging indicator. It's really what did you sell before and what rep you're recognizing now. And what's important is that FortiCare is going to be more closely linked to more recent product sales, right, because you have fewer products to attach it. So you'll probably see a little more pressure on FortiCare there. \n FortiGuard, which is the security subscriptions, which can be bundled, but they can also now be a variety of SecOps solutions and SASE solutions is getting a fair amount of tailwind from those other two pillars. So you will start to see, I think, and have seen a little more divergence in the growth rates as it goes through the cycle, if you will, between FortiCare and FortiGuard. \n In the FortiGuard actually has higher margins. And I think that we tried to call out in the prepared remarks that if you look at the SASE SecOps business, which I'll just broadly call SASE, not currently FortiCare and FortiGuard, and our software licenses, you start to see a company now that has a run rate of about $750 million in, say, non-hardware and nonattached service contracts, which is pretty impressive, I think. \nKen Xie: And I think since we only launched our own FortiSASE six months ago, we see pretty strong growth but also SD-WAN has been there for a few years. So I have to say, probably most -- a majority if not the most, SASE still more comes from SD-WAN, which is in the chart there. Maybe the better way to say is really look at the pipeline, so that's on key script. He said -- it's a Unified SASE probably pipeline grow like 45%. And then the SSE pipeline growth over 150%. That's maybe a better indicator as a pretty strong for the SASE interest and also leverage our both SD-WAN and the firewall market-leading position there.\n  So we do see a lot of customer adding the SASE, adding the SD-WAN and convert some of them to the additional service, which will probably come about over 90% of our -- like the SASE business  right now. And is also very strong interest from the customer right now. \n And at the same time, some of the trial program like using the FortiWiFi AP as a hardware agent offers certain free SASE service. That's also what drives additional like differentiated -- Unified SASE approach compared to the other competitor in the market, which we also drive quite a lot of SASE business going forward. So that's also the reason we believe probably within a few quarters or a few years, we'll be the #1 leader in the SASE market. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Joseph Gallo of Jefferies. \nJoseph Gallo: A lot of cool stuff around AI at your conference. FortiAI, any early feedback? And how are we thinking about monetizing that? And any impact to gross margins? And when can that benefit top line? \nKen Xie: Yes. Could agree, there's a lot of interest in AI -- we started our time more fully to different products, which are helping customers more efficiently manage their operation there. And that's also what drive the additional service, additional product out there. I'd say it's still more in the early ramp-up stage, and -- but the interest is we very high end, we do see some benefit already -- but how soon will be materializing. \nKeith Jensen: Yes, I think it's some more tactical responses to you. In general, we're charging for it separately. It's on the price list. It's additive to it, and you're going to really push my technical knowledge, maybe somebody here can eat me out. But I think there's an LLM the customer has to go out and buy on their own, in some cases, to enable it. And then I would offer a really shameless plug. I really tell you, you should go look at our website and see the demo that was done at Accelerate with FortiAI, it was fantastic. \nJoseph Gallo: Yes. We saw it live. Just a quick follow-up on really, really appreciate the time to register or days to register metrics, it's really interesting. Was there any seasonality in that metric historically before or after firewall cycle? Just trying to better understand if we should expect to find a floor at 2019 levels or if there's a potential another leg down? \nKen Xie: I think probably if I look back to 20, 30 years when there's a big attack in the space, then they drive some kind of a new function, then there's some rush by something maybe impact some of them. Otherwise, it's pretty normal, I don't know, 7, 8 [ week ] whatever a customer to register. And then the last 2, 3 years, the supply chain really changing sometimes certain channel partners on the distributor may try to have a little bit more inventory. \n And some kind of customer because it takes some time to deploy, they also try to order some actual inventory. But that's pretty much all normal now. If you place the order, you pretty much can get it delivered right away. No longer has the lead time anymore. So that's where we see is the digestion pretty much go over, and it's pretty back to normal in the current environment now. \nKeith Jensen: Yes. And I think the charts actually goes all the way back to 2019. And you can see it by quarter there. Nothing jumps out of me in terms of seasonality by quarter that we really have that I would call out to it. So... \nOperator: This now concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it back to Peter Salkowski for closing remarks. \nPeter Salkowski: Thank you, Brianna. I'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call. Fortinet will be attending investor conferences hosted by JPMorgan and Bank of America during the second quarter. Fireside chat -- website link -- webcast link will be posted on the Events and Presentations section of our Fortinet's Investor Relations website. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to contact me. Have a great rest of your day. Thank you very much. \nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ken Xie",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining our call. Q1, we've managed business with strong spending discipline and increased our operation margin 200 basis points to a first quarter record of 28.5%. We also generated record cash flow from operations of $830 million, and our adjusted free cash flow margin was 61%. \n We remain focused on investing in a fast-growing Unified SASE and secure operation market, which, combined, accounted for 1/3 of first quarter billings. We continue to gain security networking market share, leveraging our advanced and differentiated FortiOS and FortiASIC technologies with an increasing number of large customer adopting our industry-leading Secure Networking solutions. \n Last month, attendance in our annual Accelerate conference increased 25% year-over-year to nearly 5,000 participants. Our Unified SASE and new AI offering dominated the discussion with our partner and customers. \n For the first quarter, Unified SASE accounted for 24% of total billings. To introduce customer and prospect to our new Unified SASE solution, we plan to run attractive promotions this year in 2024. For several reasons, we believe no service secure company come close toward differentiated Unified SASE solutions. \n First, we have developed all Unified SASE functionality into one single operation system, the FortiOS. This includes a full networking and security set comprised of a ZTNA, Secure Web Gateway, CASB and our market-leading SD-WAN and firewall technologies, providing content, application, user, device and location awareness to reduce attacks. \n Second, our Unified SASE solution can be deployed on-premise, in the cloud, or both. Peer solutions send a traffic to copy the PoP, increasing security risk and latency and is less efficient. Last, Fortinet Unified SASE offer both traditional software endpoint agent and how are agents such as FortiWiFi access point and FortiSwitch for customers, with easier deployment and more broad use case such as Unified SASE for OT and IoT devices. We expect our differentiated Unified SASE offering to emerge as the SASE leader. \n Fortinet advanced platform approach has been earning third-party awards for many years. Last month, we entered Gartner Magic Quadrant for Secure Service Edge. As shown on the Slide 12 in the investor presentation. Fortinet is the only vendor recognized in the Gartner Magic Quadrant Report for Security Service Edge, SD-WAN, Single-Vendor SASE, Network Firewall and Enterprise Wired and Wireless LAN infrastructure. \n All 5 security and network offering from Fortinet are uniquely built on one operating system, the FortiOS, and a leverage of FortiASIC to increase secure computing power for more functions and better performance while lowering the cost and energy consumption. \n Fortinet's Secure Ops solution, which are better integrated and automate than competitors, accounted for 9% of total billings. Initially launched as part of our FortiSIEM and FortiSOAR, our Gen AI technology, FortiAI, is being deployed across both networking and security products. \n And today, we announced the industry-first IoT security Generative AI assistant. Customers can ask FortiAI to help in 30-plus languages. Fortinet is also the market leader in OT security solutions, the fastest-growing space in network security, with billings of device connected online, and the most OT device has a limited compiling power, making new secure the most effective experience of security.  \n Today, we announced the FortiGate 200G, a mid-range fire were powered by a new SD FortiASIC with secure computing rating of 3 expected performance real-time petites and industry average. We're enforcing our leading networking and Unified SASE advantage that provides customers with industry-leading security functions, performance and power efficiency.  \n Before turning the call over to Keith, I wish to thank our employees, customers, partners and suppliers worldwide for their continuous support and hard work. Yes. I think the high interest rate, making the money kind of more expensive, have a lot of enterprise kind of probably more favored OpEx instead of a CapEx for some of the networking security project. So that's where -- that's also the reason we're starting shifting the focus more on the kind of the SASE or kind of SecureOps, which is really more helping company saving the cost at the same time, kind of -- some kind of OpEx model.\n  So that's probably -- at the same time, we do make some adjustment in certain product price back to like pre-pandemic level, before the [indiscernible]. That's happening in Q1, probably has a little bit of impact, but it's -- overall, I think the product competitive is still more and more strong. \n And we still see a lot of replacement of our competitive product, which tend to be more expensive. And especially the new FortiOS introduced last month with more function, including the function in Unified SASE, all these things drive a lot of our change from the customer, and they're all interested to these new OS and the new product we have launched. I think our price strategy is pretty consistent in the last 20-plus years. We want to maintain a healthy gross margin and also a healthy margin for the partners. And when we see certain cost increase like doing the supply chain shortage, whether the component costs or some shipping costs increase, we kind of increase the price. But now some of the costs coming down, we also kind of returned some margin to the partner and also low on product price to match the pre-pandemic level. \n But I think all this supply chain change in missing is over and also we're probably more focused on the new product and which follow kind of a healthy margin guideline. And I don't think we have adjust any pricing for the existing product anymore. It's really more focused on when we introduce a new product, we just want to make sure it's a healthy margin for all the parties. I think that's a great question. I think we have a slide for that. Yes. And also, we build SD-WAN function into the FortiOS, which, whenever you have a FortiCare, we believe like close to 60%, 70% customer all have by the FortiCare, they have automatic SD-WAN function. And so that's where we do see other SD-WAN, current SD-WAN customer, which we were not fully tracking because the part of our [ list function free ] of charge. So we do believe a lot of them are [ interest ] come into SASE for SASE function there. Yes. Also, Japan probably kind of about is the biggest country for us in APAC and probably 1/3 of more APAC, which the currency like the U.S. currency pretty strong again. Japan currency is that may also have some impact of some slowdown there. On the other side, we do see most SD-WAN customers definitely more interest in the SASE and also in the current environment, more and more customer set in terms SD-WAN because SD-WAN definitely have been a cost saving. So on average, it's about 50% in cost savings compared to the traditional NPI or other networking function there. So we do see more and more customer first converting to SD-WAN customer and then using the same FortiGate adding additional SASE function there. Yes. I think we believe we continue gaining market share even right now the quarter -- last quarter in the cyclical secure networking, which both the firewall and also some other like  FortiWiFi FortiSASE space there. And I think because whether the strong performance advantage, we have all kind of more function can give a customer, like a better ROI return and better security and also more deployed case compared with the traditional firewall. So we feel we're keeping gaining market share. \n But overall, I have to say that whether the network secure firewall market or the networking market definitely has gone down like 10% to 20% year-over-year. But even in that market condition, we keep on gaining more share -- market share in this environment. Keith probably will answer the digestion question. The notice probably around 10% of our product, that's probably -- all the networking side, definitely down a little bit, but there's some other like whether the FortiWeb, FortiMail some other we see for we see pretty strong growth. So it's a mix. But overall, I think pretty much similar like the FortiGate mix. But definitely, we see it. \n And on the other side, we do see some early signs of interest a customer using our FortiWiFi AP FortiSwitch as a hardware agent for the SASE. So that's also one of the promotions we're going to really offer some customer. If they got a FortiWiFi, they probably can run some free FortiSASE function for some time. So that we see could be driving additional non-FortiGate growth. But we -- actually, all the non-FortiGate product, we also have a technology called FortiLink. It's all like FortiGate, like FortiGate, whether that's kind of the aging firewall host or a host working together with FortiWiFi or FortiSwitch. Yes. The 3 parts of the business. One, like Keith mentioned, is really the digestion whatever supply chain issue. I think that's pretty much over, maybe just a few more months, it will be all normal. And the second part is really the refresh, which is the current customer over the new product, which has a better performance, all the things there. I have to say, seeing the economy slowdown or high interest rate environment, some customer may stretch the current product a little bit longer. \n And -- but we do see more cases, we call it replacement, and also the new area like OT/IoT security. So we do see the requirement pick up quite well, which, when they face in like where they need a new function, like the new SD-WAN function or the SASE function, a lot of our big enterprise starting using our product to replace a more competitive product because they have to offer like multiple product to match one of our FortiGate or FortiOS solution there. \n And we also have a much better performance and power efficiency. We use [indiscernible] measure for every product. So that's replacement case, definitely picking up quite well. The refresh probably would still need some time to come. And on the other side, the new area like OTT security, we see other strong growth. \n So that's a new market because really all this OT devices not connected online or kind of canola has now protection and pretty much impossible to run endpoint software because of different operating system living computing power. So we see this new OTL space pick up quite well. That's the new market. So long-term wise, I still believe the network security market continued to grow. \n And -- but probably will be more mix in the current environment, probably a little bit more towards the OpEx model, which is kind of a -- and -- but for us, the differentiation is really, we have all the staff in the same FortiGate operating system FortiOS, which customers can run whether on-premise or in the cloud and the PoP. So we do see a lot of customers that then turn on the SASE function, maybe starting the SASE function first, then the additional strategy function, additional SASE service. So that's the way they are starting doing now. We have not seen any pricing pressure discount because we tend to be much better performance and more function because of ASIC technology and none of our competitor has. On the other side, [ billion ] customer considered a new function they needed for security or higher network speed environment, I think compare us to some competitor because competitors sometimes they just cannot keep in function like all the SD-WAN function in their existing firewall for us is very, very different. \n So we have all the SD-WAN function, all the new SASE function built in into the same FortiOS running on different kind of FortiGate device there. So that's also kind of helping customers to really keep adding additional functions sometimes without really replacing the existing hardware, so that's really helping the customer keeping kind of adding surveys and had secured with new function there. \n And also, that's also driving a lot of replacement of our competitor solution, especially in the big enterprise environment. So that's we see the strong -- the strongest growing area for us actually is enterprise customers, which they not enter some finance stretch because the high cost are the money. But we do see that the growing in our enterprise space or strong and a lot of replacement of competitive solution using the FortiGate which has a more function, better performance, low cost and also more efficient on the energy consumption there. Probably is the most busy time in the last 10, 20 years now to look at all different companies. It's okay. I think we continue to invest balance the gross margin. So the area like a lot of on the long-term product, we continue to invest, and we do the selective hiring. And also, we also take this opportunity to mixing the management ratio or structure will be better. So it's more invest in the field sales engineering and also the R&D area and the kind of more flat on certain management level and making the whole company more efficient. Yes, I think we do see when we have a more enterprise customer and they also want to be long-term customers and also with many different products like the consolidation strategy they have right now, we see more EA. And at the same time, with that one, we definitely see kind of a bigger deal and also kind of a more long-term customer can be with us right now. And I think since we only launched our own FortiSASE six months ago, we see pretty strong growth but also SD-WAN has been there for a few years. So I have to say, probably most -- a majority if not the most, SASE still more comes from SD-WAN, which is in the chart there. Maybe the better way to say is really look at the pipeline, so that's on key script. He said -- it's a Unified SASE probably pipeline grow like 45%. And then the SSE pipeline growth over 150%. That's maybe a better indicator as a pretty strong for the SASE interest and also leverage our both SD-WAN and the firewall market-leading position there.\n  So we do see a lot of customer adding the SASE, adding the SD-WAN and convert some of them to the additional service, which will probably come about over 90% of our -- like the SASE business  right now. And is also very strong interest from the customer right now. \n And at the same time, some of the trial program like using the FortiWiFi AP as a hardware agent offers certain free SASE service. That's also what drives additional like differentiated -- Unified SASE approach compared to the other competitor in the market, which we also drive quite a lot of SASE business going forward. So that's also the reason we believe probably within a few quarters or a few years, we'll be the #1 leader in the SASE market. Yes. Could agree, there's a lot of interest in AI -- we started our time more fully to different products, which are helping customers more efficiently manage their operation there. And that's also what drive the additional service, additional product out there. I'd say it's still more in the early ramp-up stage, and -- but the interest is we very high end, we do see some benefit already -- but how soon will be materializing. I think probably if I look back to 20, 30 years when there's a big attack in the space, then they drive some kind of a new function, then there's some rush by something maybe impact some of them. Otherwise, it's pretty normal, I don't know, 7, 8 [ week ] whatever a customer to register. And then the last 2, 3 years, the supply chain really changing sometimes certain channel partners on the distributor may try to have a little bit more inventory. \n And some kind of customer because it takes some time to deploy, they also try to order some actual inventory. But that's pretty much all normal now. If you place the order, you pretty much can get it delivered right away. No longer has the lead time anymore. So that's where we see is the digestion pretty much go over, and it's pretty back to normal in the current environment now."

            "name": "Keith Jensen",
            "content": "Thank you, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's start with the key highlights from the first quarter. As Ken mentioned, we continue to manage the business through the macro uncertainty and successfully drove operating margin to a first quarter record of 28.5%, exceeding the high end of the guidance range by 200 basis points.  \n Free cash flow of $609 million represents a 45% free cash flow margin, benefiting from strong Q4 '23 billings and their subsequent collection in Q1 of '24. Billings of $1.41 billion and revenue of $1.35 billion were within their respective guidance ranges. \n Looking at billings in more detail. While Unified SASE and SecOps delivered strong billings growth, total billings declined 6% as expected. The billings performance was driven by the difficult year-earlier comparison, created by the backlog contribution to billings that occurred in last year's first quarter. \n Total bookings were down just slightly. Unified SASE and SecOps had outstanding growth across a variety of benchmarks in the first quarter. In addition, we saw significant progress from our investments in Unified SASE and SecOps. These include cross-selling into our large installed base. Existing customers delivered over 90% of SecOps and Unified SASE billings. \n On an even more targeted basis, existing SD-WAN customers delivered 81% of Unified SASE billings. Larger enterprises are proving to be our largest customer segment. with large and enterprise -- large and mid-enterprises representing 78% and 84% of SecOps and Unified SASE billings, respectively. Even with increasing scale, both pillars have strong pipeline growth, 30% for SecOps and over 45% for Unified SASE. \n More importantly, within SASE, the SSE pipeline growth is over 150%. Our investment in SASE is being recognized by third-party agencies. We recently recorded the Trifecta with Gartner's SASE Magic Quadrants, SSE, SD-WAN and single vendor SASE. \n And as Ken noted, with last month's addition to SSE, Fortinet now appears in 5 Network Security Gartner Magic Quadrants, again, all running on a single operating system. With the SASE Magic Quadrant Trifecta, customers have shown increased interest in learning more about our unique SASE platform that runs on the one operating system with one Unified agent, one management system and one data lake. \n To offer an example of customer interest at our Accelerate conference early last month, the SASE demo booth was our most active as customers surveyed SASE's new features and functions including end-to-end digital experience monitoring, remote browser isolation, advanced data loss prevention and third-party SD-WAN connectivity. \n As a second example, Nearly 25% of the accelerated attendees who joined our CMO for the SASE breakout session. The attendee number for this breakout session would have been even higher if it wasn't for the fire marshals regulations that forced us to turn away customers and partners who are eager to hear more about the SASE offering.  \n And to offer one final example, the customer partner SASE Fast Track training program at Fortinet, which launched in January, is already this #2 most attended technical training session, trending only a single vendor SASE partner, SD-WAN. We're committed to driving more effective security solutions worldwide and welcome greater partnership with our industry peers. The new third-party SD-WAN connectivity technology is designed to support consolidation not only on Fortinet, but with Fortinet.  \n In terms of scale, we continue to open new Google and Fortinet PoPs in sync with our customers' expanding footprint and driving the deployment scale demanded by large enterprises. And a quick update on that 7-figure 300,000 seat education deal that we mentioned last quarter, the full production environment was activated in March, and we are on track to have their 300,000-plus seats on board to start the new school year. \n To expand on Ken's earlier comment on today's AR-related announcement, Fortinet's Gen AI assistant follows our FortiAI launch last year, by supporting and guiding SOC and NOC teams as they configure and manage changes to their network and investigate and remediate threats. Its intuitive interface allows individuals to engage using 30 different natural languages, bridging the industry's skill shortage. I encourage everyone to visit fortinet.com to learn more about the Gen AI system. \n Rounding out our billings commentary, SMB was a top-performing customer segment. International Emerging was our best-performing geography. And our 3 largest industry verticals continue to be worldwide government, service providers and financial services. Service provider and worldwide government experienced the highest growth while retail and financial services were a bit more challenged.  \n As noted in our prior call, the 6 8-figure deals in Q4 '23 pushed our average contract term in DSO to elevated levels. The average contract term in the first quarter was 27 months, down just under 1 month year-over-year and 3.5 months quarter-over-quarter. DSO decreased 12 days year-over-year and 23 days quarter-over-quarter to 66 days.  \n Turning to revenue and margins. Total revenue grew 7% to $1.35 billion, driven by service revenue growth. Service revenue of $944 million grew 24%, accounting for 70% of total revenue and a revenue mix shift to services of 10 points. Service revenue growth was led by over 30% growth from Unified SASE and SecOps. Product revenue decreased 18% as expected, to $409 million coming off a challenging 35% year earlier compare impacted by backlog fulfillment in the prior year.  \n Software license revenue increased 20% and represented a mid- to high teens mix of product revenue. Total net product bookings were down just slightly. Combined revenue from software licenses and software services such as cloud and SASE security options, increased 29% and represented an annual revenue run rate approaching $750 million. \n Total gross margin of 78.1% was up 180 basis points and exceeded the high end of our guidance range, benefiting from the mix shift to higher-margin service revenues. Service gross margins of 87.9% were up 200 basis points as service revenue outpaced labor cost increases and benefited from the mix shift towards higher-margin FortiGuard security subscriptions.  \n Product gross margin of 55.7% as we -- were pressured as we saw challenges related to inventory levels and the transition to a more normalized demand environment. Operating margin of 28.5% was 200 basis points above the high end of our guidance range, reflecting the strong gross margins and prudent cost management. \n Looking at the statement of cash flows summarized on Slide 16 and 17. Free cash flow was $609 million. Adjusted free cash flow, which excludes real estate investments, was $821 million, representing a 61% adjusted free cash flow margin. Infrastructure investments totaled $222 million, including $212 million of real estate investments. \n Cash taxes in the quarter were $31 million. And while we did not repurchase shares in Q1, share buybacks have totaled $5.3 billion over the past 4-plus years and the remaining buyback authorization is $1 billion.  \n Now I'd like to share a few significant wins in the first quarter. I'll start with the 1 8-figure deal in the quarter, a competitive displacement and new logo win. This large U.S. financial institution selected Fortinet as part of their data center update and consolidation projects. \n Key to this win included our experience in this highly regulated customer data-sensitive industry and our ability to lower the total cost of ownership and exceed their low latency performance requirements. Similar to other large financial institutions separating from their incumbent, this customer is expanding their Fortinet footprint by adding our SD branch solution and planning to consolidate additional technologies. \n Next, in the competitive 7-figure win, a hospitality company that serves over 5 million guests annually updated their various Fortinet solutions, including their FortiGate firewall footprint and FortiNAC solutions. Keys to expanding our relationship included our price-to-performance advantage on the firewalls and the next solutions proven ability to discover and lock down devices that attempt to join their network, together with the operational simplicity, and integration of a dozen different Fortinet solutions the customer uses. \n In another 7-figure deal, a hotel and restaurant chain purchased our SD branch solution for 800 locations as well as our data center FortiGates for centralized management and enhanced security. The solution from our network security pillar included firewalls, switches and access points as well as a variety of software products.  \n The SE branch solutions bring improved efficiency and security over their branches and IoT devices. Key to this win and in other retail opportunities is enabling retailers to deploy, expand and deliver a growing array of in-store digital solutions to support their customers' experience and increase their top line performance. \n As these customer wins illustrate, our Security Fabric platform includes each of our security pillars, Unified South, AI-driven SecOps and secured networking, making it the most integrated, most open portfolio of products in the industry backed by 1 operating system, FortiOS; 1 Unified agent, FortiClient; 1 management console, FortiManager; 1 data lake, FortiAnalyzer; and open APIs and integration with over 500 competitor and other third-party products. This integration allows customers to consolidate security solutions, thereby reducing operational costs, while increasing security effectiveness. \n Moving to guidance. As a reminder, our first quarter and full year outlook, which are summarized on Slides 21 and 22, are subject to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the second quarter, we expect billings in the range of $1.490 billion to $1.550 billion, which, at the midpoint, represents a decline of 1%. \n Revenue in the range of $1.375 billion to $1.435 billion, which, at the midpoint, represents growth of 9%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 76.5% to 77.5%, non-GAAP operating margin of 25.75% to 26.75%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.39 to $0.41, which assumes a share count of between 775 million and 785 million. Capital expenditures of $30 million to $40 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of 17% and cash taxes of $240 million to $270 million.  \n Before updating the full year guidance, I'd like to elaborate on the backlog headwinds easing in the second half of 2024 and share what we believe we are starting to see as early signs that the firewall digestion cycle is nearing completion. First, the billings headwind from last year's backlog drawdown is over $150 million in 2024 and gradually diminishes throughout the year with no headwind in the fourth quarter. And second, we're looking for early signs of a more normalized firewall market, one metric we watch is the average days to register security service contracts, as shown on Slide 19. \n In 2022, we noted that the user registered has increased about 50%, which was consistent with customers' buying and stocking behaviors at the time. More recently, this metric decreased by about 25% from SP and is now consistent with late 2021 levels. It is on a pace to return to normal levels in the second half of 2024. A reasonable read-through of the data is that customers are completing the inventory digestion process and are on the path to a more normalized firewall-buying behavior. \n And with that, for the year, we expect billings in the range of $6.400 billion to $6.600 billion; revenue in the range of $5.745 billion to $5.845 billion, which, at the midpoint represents growth of 9%; service revenue in the range of $3.940 billion to $3.990 billion, which, at the midpoint represents growth of 17%; non-GAAP gross margin of 76.5% to 78%; non-GAAP operating margin of 26.5% to 28%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.73 to $1.79, which assumes a share count of between 780 million and 790 million; capital expenditures of $350 million to $400 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of 17%; and cash taxes of between $500 million and $550 million. \n I look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters. And I'll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A session. Yes, I'll talk about the full year. I think that if you look at where we ended up in the first quarter, inside the guidance range, maybe just a little bit of weakness that we saw in Europe, just enough to move us off the midpoint, but not really a big movement in terms of where we are in our final results compared to the midpoint. \n And if we look at where we end up with the total for the year, I don't think we're at all far off from the plan that we thought. Maybe there's some more [indiscernible]  there that you're kind of pointing out. But as we look at the pipeline, to your point, I think the mix that we see in our pipeline today, together with some of the hygiene improvements that we worked on for the last 6 to 9 months, I think we feel better about where we end up with the full year numbers, if you will. \n I think, at the same time, when you look at the full year numbers and some of the outperformance in the quarter or better performance, if you will, with service revenue and product revenue, you see us bringing that number up a little bit. But importantly, at the same time, you see us also bringing up the margin number on the bottom line by about 0.75 of a point. Try to ask that question. Yes. I think we also included in the prepared, and I'll tap the answer while somebody follows the actual slide number for you, Brian. But I think that existing customers were over 90% for both SASE and for SecOps, so they were expansion sales. \n And Ken's kindly pointing out to me my Slide #8 is in the deck that actually give you a little more context for it. One change you may notice there is that, for the first few quarters, when we talk about customer mix and expansion opportunity, we did it by customer counts, believing that we were going to have a lot of penetration with the SMB space. \n And that was where you get a larger number to start seeing some patterns. What we've now seen is that the large enterprises and the mid-enterprises are actually dominating both of those pillars of growth. And with that, we've just converted those pie charts to dollar values, which is more traditional where we expect it to get eventually. Yes, Brian. What we're trying to say there is that I think we're -- there's a common belief internally and probably externally that we're going to have a lot of success with the SASE solution by cross-selling our existing SD-WAN customers. And so the SASE billings that we saw this quarter, I believe the number was 81% of those were existing SD-WAN customers. Okay. where to begin? Kind of cherry picking through some data points. I think one -- first and foremost, the SMB continues to perform stronger than expectations, whether that's external to the company or from other sources, if you will, it's very resilient. And I think it's simply the breadth of the SMB space together with, as I've said in the past, the success of the channel program. \n I think Europe was just a tad that light in the quarter and a little bit on the enterprise side of their business and probably just enough, as I said before, to move us off of the midpoint of our guidance. \n I think what we spent a fair amount of time with more recently is looking at where the 8-figure deal is coming from. And if you're looking at the deceleration, and let's take the U.S. enterprise as an example of that, last quarter, we talked about 6, 8-figure deals in the business. The vast majority of those are in the U.S. enterprise. \n This quarter, we generally noted that we had one 8-figure deal. And so you can see that those 8-figure deals can whipsaw that growth rate for the U.S. enterprise around quite a bit really because if there are opportunities in these 8-figure deals that maybe some of the other geos don't have. We really don't have those opportunities in APAC and some of the other geographies that we see in the U.S. \n I think the other part of growth, I mean, I think we I think we have to understand where the firewall growth is right now in terms of the industry. And with that, it puts a lot of the pressure or opportunity for us to sell the SASE solutions and the SecOps solutions. And you're probably seeing a little more maturity in the ability to sell or the openness to buy SecOps and SASE solutions in the U.S. and in Europe, the larger economies, than you are in APAC. Do you want to take the market share and the mix, and then I'll go through the algebra on Slide 19. But yes, for people that have access to it, Slide 19 in the deck. And for those -- a lot of you have followed the company for quite a while and you remember that we have some pressure on software revenue early in the pandemic, and we talked about things like the impact from Russia, but also that we were seeing a delay in customers registering the service contracts that attached to the hardware contracts. \n And if you look at that chart, you can see that, that delaying activity really started at the end of 2021, peaked at the end of the beginning of '23, kind of plateaued and now has moved down. And what we believe as you're seeing there is that when the supply chain hit, customers bought the equipment, put it on the shelves and did not need to register the contract as quickly and that's why you saw the increase in the days of register. \n Now as we move through the digestion cycle, you've seen that inventories come off their shelves and those days to register are starting to return to normal. We're not quite there, but we're actually quite close to it. And I would just offer that, I think, as I said, by the second half and the second half of this year on the current pace, we would return to where we were at pre-COVID on that metric. And again, we think that's a very good indicator of where customers are in the digestion cycle. Well, first of all, you're going to get me in trouble for using the term non-FortiGate. We talked about SASE and SecOps, but we're all showing our age here a little bit. Yes, I feel good about it. And I think we're -- the parallel that I've drawn in the conversations before is that if you went back to 2015, '16, you saw the company moving away from -- or expanding beyond the SMB space and doing $1 billion deals. But it wasn't that there was enough $1 million deals that we couldn't get whipside by them then. \n Now we've got plenty -- well, I can always take more, plenty of million dollar deals, but the $10 million deals are whipsawing us around a little bit. You saw that with a very strong performance in the fourth quarter. And I think we were pretty open about that in the fourth quarter and setting expectations for the first. One thing we have spent some time doing is going back and looking at the number of 8-figure deals we have by quarter, for, say, the last 3 or 4 years. \n And you're looking at a model that maybe had one of the other quarter or 5 years ago to now where you're probably average something on the order of 2, perhaps 3 of opportunities over a full year per quarter. They're going to get condensed sometimes in certain quarters. With our business model in the history, you see that Q4 obviously outperforms as does Q2 typically perform strongly. And I suspect as we look forward, we'll see a little more concentration on those 8-figure deals certainly in Q4 and maybe some in Q2. Peter's point, get our COO for M&A answers. So we're all -- listen, leaning forward here wants to say. I don't think there's been any real change in our buyback philosophy. We -- the term we use is we're very opportunistic. We do put a program in place with one of the Wall Street firms each quarter and we renew it. \n I think the important part there is looking at the $5 billion that we bought back over the last 4 years, and it's not that we're doing some other companies would do x percent of free cash flow or something like that. It is really looking for market opportunities and when we see them. can typically steps in and have something set up in that regard. And now John Whittle has been -- going to get a chance to join. Yes. I think the -- setting aside the fact that need more resources in finance, but I was hoping Ken was just going to announce that, but that's probably not. The -- I think the business model, Brad, you've seen it through the cycles where -- if you look back at 2017, for example, and if you look at the gross margin number, when you start to see the slowdown of the pause, the cycle and the hardware, you start to see the mix shift to the really rich services. .\n And then as the market recovers, you see that relationship change a little bit. Clearly, we're in a situation right now with the firewall market that the mix shifted 10 points of services, and I think that was 87% gross margin. It's making margin targets very achievable, let's put it that way. And I would imagine, I think we raised it by 0.75 of a point at the midpoint for the full year. That's a pretty big move at this point, and I think we feel very comfortable with that as we look at the rest of 2024. No, I don't think there's really a change. I think there's always a few puts and takes, if you will. I think the real driver was that last quarter, we had those 6 8-figure deals, and I believe all those closed in the last week or 2 of the quarter. So that put a lot of pressure on DSOs and only having one 8-figure deal this quarter, which I believe closed fairly early in the quarter, in mid-quarter, but not in the last week. So I think that's really all I would point to there. Yes. I think when you say partners, I would say that all the large distributors that we're working with are offering financing programs, either in some cases, it might be through their own captive. But I think more often not, it's white labeling somebody else's product, if you will. I think that also some of the larger resellers are also offering financing. \n I think that where it makes a little more sense for ourselves as an OEM is on larger deals, whether we move to the extended payment program or working with the channel and provide them capital, if you will, for the financing. I think there's a lot of different ways to go there. But I don't think good credits, so to speak, are suffering because they can't find credit. I don't think that's the issue. Yes. I think that -- and John took this over, so he gets to make that -- his habitual rap on EAs. But as Ken kind of alluded to it, it tends to make a lot of sense when -- you're -- most usually going to see it as part of your expansion inside of a larger enterprise. You're probably not going to see it frequently with the very first sale into a new logo, you could. And I think some things that are really we're starting to see resonate there are the new FortiPoints program that we make available and things with that nature, where customers have reached that point where they're very comfortable for in that for the technology and our customer support, et cetera, and they start thinking about long-term relationships. They know they're going to buy more. They may not know what. But the combination of EAs and FortiPoints, I think, has been well received by the customer group. No. I think the two that take it really -- you see us at this point in the firewall cycle, it's really for us, we want to increase the focus on SASE. I think we feel very good about it. you see us adding some more information there. And to your point that it wasn't anything that was really new or earth shattering on the FortiGates. I need to reverse what I covered FortiCare, FortiGuard. I think it's a great question is FortiCare, which is the traditional support offering, we talk about services being a lagging indicator. It's really what did you sell before and what rep you're recognizing now. And what's important is that FortiCare is going to be more closely linked to more recent product sales, right, because you have fewer products to attach it. So you'll probably see a little more pressure on FortiCare there. \n FortiGuard, which is the security subscriptions, which can be bundled, but they can also now be a variety of SecOps solutions and SASE solutions is getting a fair amount of tailwind from those other two pillars. So you will start to see, I think, and have seen a little more divergence in the growth rates as it goes through the cycle, if you will, between FortiCare and FortiGuard. \n In the FortiGuard actually has higher margins. And I think that we tried to call out in the prepared remarks that if you look at the SASE SecOps business, which I'll just broadly call SASE, not currently FortiCare and FortiGuard, and our software licenses, you start to see a company now that has a run rate of about $750 million in, say, non-hardware and nonattached service contracts, which is pretty impressive, I think. Yes, I think it's some more tactical responses to you. In general, we're charging for it separately. It's on the price list. It's additive to it, and you're going to really push my technical knowledge, maybe somebody here can eat me out. But I think there's an LLM the customer has to go out and buy on their own, in some cases, to enable it. And then I would offer a really shameless plug. I really tell you, you should go look at our website and see the demo that was done at Accelerate with FortiAI, it was fantastic. Yes. And I think the charts actually goes all the way back to 2019. And you can see it by quarter there. Nothing jumps out of me in terms of seasonality by quarter that we really have that I would call out to it. So..."
