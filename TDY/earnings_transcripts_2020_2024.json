I'd now like to turn our conference over to the host, Jason VanWees. Please go ahead.\nJason VanWees: Thank you, William, and good morning, everyone. This is Jason VanWees, Executive Vice President at Teledyne, and I want to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter and full year earnings release conference call. We released our earnings earlier this morning. Joining me today are Teledyne's Executive Chairman, Robert Mehrabian; President and CEO, Al Pichelli; Senior Vice President and CFO, Sue Main; and Senior Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, Melanie Cibik. After remarks by Robert, Al and Sue, we will ask for your questions.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Jason. Good morning, and thank you for joining our earnings call. I'll begin by discussing our 2020 results, briefly comment on the outlook for 2021, and of course, comment on the pending acquisition of FLIR. We concluded 2020 with the best earnings, operating margin and cash flow in the company's history. Compared to last year, fourth quarter earnings increased 13.7%. Operating margin increased 173 basis points and free cash flow increased 50.7%. For the full year 2020, GAAP operating margin increased slightly and free cash flow increased significantly 39.1% to $547.5 million. It is worth emphasizing, the full year margin and cash flow performance occurred, despite over $33 million in non-recurring charges, record negative GDP in the second quarter and the constant challenges faced by manufacturers during the COVID-19 pandemic. For all of their efforts, I want to congratulate our employees as well as offer my most sincere thank you to them for transforming a difficult year into one of the most rewarding for our stockholders. We entered 2021 with a clear improvement in demand across the majority of our businesses. In fact, we received record orders in the fourth quarter and ended 2020 with record backlog. Q2 orders were $920 million or 1.14x sales with year-end backlog of $1.7 billion. While it's still early in 2021, we're expecting continuing recovery in our commercial businesses as well as growth in our government businesses. In both cases, strongest within our Digital Imaging segment. Given some caution and conservatism, related to the ongoing tug of war between shutdowns and vaccines, we think a reasonable outlook for the total company's organic growth is between 5% and 6% for 2021. Of course, the largely pre-COVID comparison in the first quarter will be the most difficult with revenue relatively flat. Finally, I want to comment on the FLIR acquisition. We've been watching FLIR since we first entered the space bay infrared imaging market in 2006 when we acquired Teledyne Scientific and Imaging. We believe then and we believe now that our infrared imaging technologies and market segments are uniquely complementary. As both companies evolved, we've grown to be even more complementary. For example, Teledyne entered the subsea drone business in 2008 and FLIR entered the airborne unmanned business in 2016, and more recently, the land-based robotics business. Perhaps more importantly, each company exited unattractive businesses, Teledyne in 2011 and FLIR in 2018.\nAl Pichelli: Thank you, Robert. In our Instrumentation segment, overall fourth quarter sales decreased 6.2% when compared with last year. Sales of environmental instruments decreased 6.7% from last year. However, sales increased 6.9% sequentially from the third quarter. Compared with last year, sales of certain products, such as wastewater samplers increased. However, this was more than offset by year-over-year declines and sales of selected industrial products, such as ambient air monitoring instrumentation.  Sales of electronic test and measurement systems increased 3.7% year-over-year to a quarterly record of $70 million. Sales of marine instrumentation decreased 11.4% in the quarter, due in part to a difficult comparison with the fourth quarter of 2019. In spite of lower sales, overall Instrumentation segment operating margin increased 262 basis points to a record, 22.3%. Now turning to the Digital Imaging segment. Fourth quarter sales decreased 2.3%, and primarily reflect the core sales of X-ray detectors for dental and medical imaging, partially offset by greater sales of infrared and visible detectors for space applications. GAAP segment operating margin was 21.6%, an increase of 407 basis points year-over-year and also, a record. Now in the Aerospace and Defense segment, fourth quarter sales declined 14.8% as greater U.S. defense sales were more than offset by a 45% decline in sales of commercial aerospace products as well as lower commercial space sales related to OneWeb. The GAAP segment operating margin decreased due to lower sales as well as $5.8 million in severance facility consolidation and other contract charges. In the Engineered Systems segment, fourth quarter revenue increased 26.8%, primarily due to greater sales from defense, nuclear and other manufacturing programs as well as electronic manufacturing services. Segment operating margin increased 175 basis points compared with last year.\nSue Main: Thank you, Al, and good morning, everyone. I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and Al, and then I will discuss our first quarter and full year 2021 outlook. In the fourth quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $236.4 million compared to cash flow of $167.9 million for the same period of 2019. Record free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $217 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with $144 million in 2019. Capital expenditures were $19.4 million in the fourth quarter compared to $23.9 million for the same period of 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense was $28.7 million in the fourth quarter compared to $29.3 million for the same period of 2019. We ended the quarter with $105.4 million of net debt, that is $778.5 million of debt less cash of $673.1 million for a net debt-to-capital ratio of only 3.2%. Stock option compensation expense was $5.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $5.7 million for the same period of 2019. Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that earnings per share in the first quarter of 2021 will be in the range of $2.55 to $2.60 per share. And for the full year 2021, our earnings per share outlook is $11.25 to $11.45. In each case, these do not reflect the pending acquisition of FLIR and related acquisition and financing costs. The 2021 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items is expected to be 22.3%. In addition, we currently expect significantly net discrete tax items in 2021 compared with 2020. I will now pass the call back to Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you. We would now like to take your questions. William, if you're ready to proceed with the questions and answers, please go ahead.\nOperator:  Our first question will come from the line of Greg Konrad. Please go ahead.\nGreg Konrad : Good Morning. I'm Greg Konrad.\nRobert Mehrabian : Thank you, Greg.\nGreg Konrad : You mentioned 5% to 6% organic growth in 2021, but how are you thinking about that on a segment basis, just thinking about the different recovery cycles across the business?\nRobert Mehrabian: Good question. Let's start with the instruments. In the instruments, we think our sales would increase about 5%, maybe just a head over 5% with our environmental and test and measurement businesses leading those. In Digital Imaging, the theme for Digital Imaging for us is recovery. And even though our revenue only went down 1% this year, we expect next year to recover and go up about 9% in Digital Imaging. Aerospace and Defense, we had a tough year, especially in Aerospace. And we expect some improvement, especially in our Defense businesses, I would say, about 4%. Engineered Systems had a great year, the best year among all of our businesses in terms of improving sales. So there, we expect their sales to improve very modestly less than 1%. And the way I've laid it out, Greg, so far, it adds up to something like 5.5% to 5.6%. I hope that's helpful.\nGreg Konrad : That's very helpful. And I mean, the other thing that just stood out on the quarter and the year, I mean, just looking at free cash flow conversion, I think it was like 136% in 2020. I mean, how are you thinking about conversion going forward? And maybe this is too early, but just kind of post-FLIR close, is there any reason to think that, that level of conversion changes?\nRobert Mehrabian: Well, let me -- Greg, let me start with -- without FLIR first. We think year-over-year, our free cash flow is going to be relatively flat, maybe a little down because, as you said, the conversion was phenomenal. There is, of course, we had the benefit of a payroll tax, about $24 million last year. Even though you put that in, it doesn't affect our already outstanding cash flow, so we've got to pay some of that back next year. But having said that, I think absent the onetime charges and expenses that come with the FLIR acquisition, our cash flow would be relatively flat, maybe a little down next year. But it will still be very close to the record that we accomplished this year. Now with FLIR. What -- the way I can describe that is on an adjusted basis, if I may, because it is -- it's difficult for us to right now determine what that cash flow would be. But based on historical trends, we think together, we would have an adjusted EBITDA after the acquisition of about $1.2 billion. Ours and theirs. And that's about the best I can do at this time knowing what I know.\nGreg Konrad : That's helpful. And then just one quick cleanup question. In terms of the debt financing for FLIR, I mean, any thoughts around kind of timing and rate on that? Thank you.\nRobert Mehrabian: Sure. Let me start by noting where we are today and what progress we've made to date. We have interacted with our banking institutions and we have secured financing for our term loans. First, we have $1.25 billion of term loans, which we have a commitment for. And the remainder of the $4 billion that we need will come in corporate bonds and that we will do after we have -- after we've obtained a rating for ourselves from the rating agencies, Moody's and S&P. And I think we will get an investment-grade rating, after which we will do that financing. The other thing that's important is that, we have increased our net debt-to-EBITDA multiple to 4.8, and we think this would conveniently put us in a position where we'll have cash on hand after the acquisition. And our covenants are about 4.75% to about 4.8% in net debt. And the last thing I would say is that, we managed to also get a commitment to increase our line of credit from about what it is now $750 million to over $1.1 billion. So that's about the best I can do.\nGreg Konrad : Thank you.\nRobert Mehrabian : Sure, Greg.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Jim Ricchiuti. Please go ahead.\nJim Ricchiuti : Hi. Thank you. So I wanted to pursue, Robert, if I may, just the improvement that you're expecting in the Digital Imaging business in 2021. Is -- are you seeing signs yet of the recovery in the X-ray detector business? Or are you just assuming as we get the pandemic behind us, lead that business starts to recover?\nRobert Mehrabian : Well, there are two parts to that. There's the x-rays for dental imaging, which already are recovering. Then there's the X-ray for cancer treatment, both -- in that case, we make components that go into machines. And that's recovering a little slower, but we're seeing some recovery in our X-ray imaging where we have these CMOS image sensors, we're seeing some recovery there. So overall, I'm going to say that we will see recovery in our healthcare, I would say, of the order of 6%. At least that's our guess right now, maybe a little more than that.\nJim Ricchiuti : Got it. And what kind of recovery are you assuming in the industrial machine vision portion of the business?\nRobert Mehrabian : I think if you look at this year in the total machine vision, which would include scientific cameras, we expect about a 10% recovery in that domain.\nJim Ricchiuti : Got it. And so the bookings, that strength that you saw in Q4, was that -- were any of the major segments unusually strong that led to a...\nRobert Mehrabian : Yes, I'm sorry, I should let you finish your question.\nJim Ricchiuti : No. Please, please go ahead.\nRobert Mehrabian : I think the strongest, again, was in Digital Imaging, it was about 1.2. And that bodes well for us because it cuts across all of the businesses there, including our Aerospace and Defense businesses and our micro electro mechanical systems foundries.\nJim Ricchiuti : Got it. Okay, thanks very much. \nRobert Mehrabian : Sure, Jim.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Joe Giordano. Please go ahead.\nJoe Giordano : Thanks for taking the questions. I'll start just on Aerospace and Defense Electronics. Like, so given what's happened in that space, and I know you're being conservative about the ramp back on the commercial side. Like what -- how do we think about margin recovery in that business, given the cost that you took out. Like what kind of run-rate of revenue do you need to achieve to get back to where we were in margins before?\nRobert Mehrabian : Well, the revenue, of course, is one story. We don't expect at this time much recovery in our Aerospace businesses. On the other hand, we do expect some improvement in our Defense businesses. But coming back to the question of margin, last year, we took a -- in 2020, we took a real hit in our margin in Aerospace and Defense. In 2019, we had margins of 20.8%. In 2020, we have 13.7%. So the margin went down almost 700 basis points. We expect, based on all the costs that we've taken out of that business, we expect the margins to improve to a little better than 18% from 13.7% or about 450 basis points approximately, even though we don't expect much recovery in the Aerospace side of the business. It's just primarily cost takeout and improvement in everything else that we're doing.\nJoe Giordano : Perfect. That's really helpful. I saw that there was an expansion awarded on a Swiss contract. So just curious like, I think you mentioned Engineered offered a good year as kind of a flat outlook. What's the path over the next few years in Engineered Systems just based on kind of the pacing of contracts that you've won and the deployment schedules there?\nRobert Mehrabian : Yes. First, let me back up and say what business there is going to shrink. And that's -- we are doing -- we make turbine engines for missiles, specifically harpoon missiles. And that will be going away at the end of the first quarter. So I think that in terms of sales of turbine engines, which also are profitable businesses, it should impact our revenue about $20 million next year. So that's on the contraction side. On the expansion side, which will keep us hopefully flat year-over-year since we have such a great year in 2020. On the expansion side, we won a number of contracts, multiyear contracts, some of which we put out news releases. And we think that we had about $0.5 billion in total of new contracts or renewal of contracts that last year. For example, coming back to the Swiss, what we have is -- we have our existing programs, which are about, rough numbers, let's say, they'll add up to about $250 million. Then we received a foreign military sales contract for new boats, which is about $35-or-so-million, and put the advance, it's $40 million. And that's a plus in that business. And we're very excited about that business because, as you know, that underwater vehicle also uses a lot of our sensors that we develop in our marine businesses. So that's -- I don't know if that answered your question as well as you want it.\nJoe Giordano : Yes. Yes. Yes. Is the margin profile for that business kind of similar on a similar run rate revenue you expect next year?\nRobert Mehrabian : No, I think margins will go down somewhat. We had just a blowout margin year this year in that business, primarily because of turbine engines and some of our manufacturing programs. We ended the year at about 12%. That's on the very high side of that business. I think we're going to go down to closer to 10.5% next year.\nJoe Giordano : That makes sense. And then just last for me. Like any update on how you're thinking of presenting FLIR once you close it? Because, I think the $1.2 billion EBITDA run rate that you were talking, I assume that's kind of like a full year equivalency. So as that comes in at some point during '21. How do you think you're going to present like the incremental operating performance plus the onetime costs associated with it?\nRobert Mehrabian : Yes. What we'll do, Joe, is we'll take the onetime cost and put it aside, as you know. But that's going to be significant. It's going to be -- I'm going to guess. My guess right now is about $175 million. It could be a little higher than that. So put that aside because there's nothing we can do about that. Then you go to, let's assume, the merger happens, the acquisition happens on July 1. Then what we're looking at is -- you can look at that two ways. You can look at it with as an adjusted basis.  And when I talk adjust that I'm only speaking about adjustment for intangible amortization, nothing else. If you look at it that way, then the acquisition is going to be accretive almost immediately. And the first full year is going to be accretive significantly. It could be as accretive as $2.50. With the $40 million, the tax takeout, the cost takeout that we're estimating for the first full year, we think on a GAAP basis, it should be accretive after the first full year, marginally accretive. So the way we presented is what is the combined revenue going to be? At this point, I would say of the -- if you look at the 2020 pro-forma, you're looking at $5 billion. If you look at '21 plus FLIR for the first full year, you're looking at $5.2 billion in revenue. And then we will work on the free cash flow same as we do now. We'll probably present it on a non-GAAP basis. Only I say that because in our agreement with our lenders, in terms of what they have agreed to in terms of our debt -- net debt-to-EBITDA, they're excluding the onetime costs that we're going to incur in that business. So we'll have a table of free cash flow to lay all of that out. \nJoe Giordano : Thanks, guys. \nRobert Mehrabian : Thanks, Joe.\nOperator:  Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Buscaglia : Morning, guys. \nRobert Mehrabian : Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Buscaglia : I wanted to ask on, I believe last quarter, you provided sort of a soft target for this year's margins to be expand about 130 basis points and you kind of walked through a couple of segments, but do you still stand by that initial take?\nRobert Mehrabian : Well, you said it was a soft target, 100 basis points improvement? Okay. I think we'll deliver better than that. I -- for us, as a stand-alone company, again, excluding any onetime charges, which were going to happen. I think our margin should improve about 120 to 140 basis points in 2021 versus 2020.\nAndrew Buscaglia : Okay. Okay. And then -- and Robert, you sounded last time or last quarter a little bit -- I guess, your expectations around the Biden administration would not be great for your defense business. Have you given that much more thought now that's coming to fruition. Broadly, it sounds like defense still has some legs into 2021. But I guess, what's your outlook beyond that?\nRobert Mehrabian : Well, it's very interesting. One of our directors made an observation yesterday, which I agree with, that I don't think, by and large, democratic administrations have been against defense spending because they -- obviously, they don't want to be -- appear as being soft on defense. And with the world situation as it is today, we think defense is going to be stable. And we have long-term programs in very critical areas, including space infrared programs that are going to be healthy. That's about all I can say on the defense side. There are other things, of course, that will affect us, which would be interest rates if they went up. And of course, taxes will hit all corporations if they were to go up.\nAndrew Buscaglia : Okay. And last one, this might be a little out there, but you guys sounded really excited about potential M&A into this year, pre-FLIR. And I know you got your hands full with FLIR, but is M&A off the table completely this year outside of FLIR until you digest that one?\nRobert Mehrabian : Yes and no. M&A is never off the table. If something really attractive came along, and we thought we could do it while being as busy as we are at this time in going to be integrating. We would have the capacity, as I mentioned, we would have another almost $1 billion that we can spend. But I don't -- I would say it's not likely at this time because the amount of work we have. Now on the other hand, if it's a small bolt-on that we can talk to -- tuck away into one of our businesses, yes, we do it. \nAndrew Buscaglia : Okay, thank you.\nOperator: At this time, we have no further questions in queue.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, William. I'll now ask Jason to conclude our conference call, please.\nJason VanWees: Thank you, Robert. And again, thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. All the news releases are available on our website. And of course, should you have follow-up questions, my numbers there, please do feel free to call me or send me a note to set up a time to speak. Thanks, everyone. William, if you could give the replay information, please, that would be great.

It's just primarily cost takeout and improvement in everything else that we're doing. Yes. First, let me back up and say what business there is going to shrink. And that's -- we are doing -- we make turbine engines for missiles, specifically harpoon missiles. And that will be going away at the end of the first quarter. So I think that in terms of sales of turbine engines, which also are profitable businesses, it should impact our revenue about $20 million next year. So that's on the contraction side. On the expansion side, which will keep us hopefully flat year-over-year since we have such a great year in 2020. On the expansion side, we won a number of contracts, multiyear contracts, some of which we put out news releases. And we think that we had about $0.5 billion in total of new contracts or renewal of contracts that last year. For example, coming back to the Swiss, what we have is -- we have our existing programs, which are about, rough numbers, let's say, they'll add up to about $250 million. Then we received a foreign military sales contract for new boats, which is about $35-or-so-million, and put the advance, it's $40 million. And that's a plus in that business. And we're very excited about that business because, as you know, that underwater vehicle also uses a lot of our sensors that we develop in our marine businesses. So that's -- I don't know if that answered your question as well as you want it. No, I think margins will go down somewhat. We had just a blowout margin year this year in that business, primarily because of turbine engines and some of our manufacturing programs. We ended the year at about 12%. That's on the very high side of that business. I think we're going to go down to closer to 10.5% next year. Yes. What we'll do, Joe, is we'll take the onetime cost and put it aside, as you know. But that's going to be significant. It's going to be -- I'm going to guess. My guess right now is about $175 million. It could be a little higher than that. So put that aside because there's nothing we can do about that. Then you go to, let's assume, the merger happens, the acquisition happens on July 1. Then what we're looking at is -- you can look at that two ways. You can look at it with as an adjusted basis.  And when I talk adjust that I'm only speaking about adjustment for intangible amortization, nothing else. If you look at it that way, then the acquisition is going to be accretive almost immediately. And the first full year is going to be accretive significantly. It could be as accretive as $2.50. With the $40 million, the tax takeout, the cost takeout that we're estimating for the first full year, we think on a GAAP basis, it should be accretive after the first full year, marginally accretive. So the way we presented is what is the combined revenue going to be? At this point, I would say of the -- if you look at the 2020 pro-forma, you're looking at $5 billion. If you look at '21 plus FLIR for the first full year, you're looking at $5.2 billion in revenue. And then we will work on the free cash flow same as we do now. We'll probably present it on a non-GAAP basis. Only I say that because in our agreement with our lenders, in terms of what they have agreed to in terms of our debt -- net debt-to-EBITDA, they're excluding the onetime costs that we're going to incur in that business. So we'll have a table of free cash flow to lay all of that out. Thanks, Joe. Good morning, Andrew. Well, you said it was a soft target, 100 basis points improvement? Okay. I think we'll deliver better than that. I -- for us, as a stand-alone company, again, excluding any onetime charges, which were going to happen. I think our margin should improve about 120 to 140 basis points in 2021 versus 2020. Well, it's very interesting. One of our directors made an observation yesterday, which I agree with, that I don't think, by and large, democratic administrations have been against defense spending because they -- obviously, they don't want to be -- appear as being soft on defense. And with the world situation as it is today, we think defense is going to be stable. And we have long-term programs in very critical areas, including space infrared programs that are going to be healthy. That's about all I can say on the defense side. There are other things, of course, that will affect us, which would be interest rates if they went up. And of course, taxes will hit all corporations if they were to go up. Yes and no. M&A is never off the table. If something really attractive came along, and we thought we could do it while being as busy as we are at this time in going to be integrating. We would have the capacity, as I mentioned, we would have another almost $1 billion that we can spend. But I don't -- I would say it's not likely at this time because the amount of work we have. Now on the other hand, if it's a small bolt-on that we can talk to -- tuck away into one of our businesses, yes, we do it. Thank you, William. I'll now ask Jason to conclude our conference call, please."

            "content": "Thank you, Al, and good morning, everyone. I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and Al, and then I will discuss our first quarter and full year 2021 outlook. In the fourth quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $236.4 million compared to cash flow of $167.9 million for the same period of 2019. Record free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $217 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with $144 million in 2019. Capital expenditures were $19.4 million in the fourth quarter compared to $23.9 million for the same period of 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense was $28.7 million in the fourth quarter compared to $29.3 million for the same period of 2019. We ended the quarter with $105.4 million of net debt, that is $778.5 million of debt less cash of $673.1 million for a net debt-to-capital ratio of only 3.2%. Stock option compensation expense was $5.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $5.7 million for the same period of 2019. Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that earnings per share in the first quarter of 2021 will be in the range of $2.55 to $2.60 per share. And for the full year 2021, our earnings per share outlook is $11.25 to $11.45. In each case, these do not reflect the pending acquisition of FLIR and related acquisition and financing costs. The 2021 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items is expected to be 22.3%. In addition, we currently expect significantly net discrete tax items in 2021 compared with 2020. I will now pass the call back to Robert."

Later on, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to our host, Jason VanWees. Please go ahead.\nJason VanWees: Good morning and thanks everyone. This is Jason VanWees, Executive Vice President and I would like to welcome everyone to Teledyne's third quarter earnings release conference call. We released our earnings earlier this morning before the market opened. Joining me today are Teledyne's Executive Chairman, Robert Mehrabian; President and CEO, Al Pichelli; Senior Vice President and CFO, Sue Main; and Senior Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, Melanie Cibik. After remarks by Robert, Al and Sue, we will ask for your questions. But of course, before we get started, our attorneys have reminded me to tell you that all forward-looking statements made this morning are subject to various assumptions, risks and caveats as noted in the earnings release and our periodic SEC filings. And of course, actual results may differ materially. In order to avoid potential selective disclosures, this call is simultaneously being webcast and a replay, both via webcast and dial-in will be available for approximately one month. Here is Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Jason. Good morning and thank you for joining our earnings call. I want to open with the following comments. First, all of our 70 worldwide manufacturing sites as well as our corporate office and research laboratory remain operational and only 16% of total employees are working from home. Second, our short cycle environmental and test and measurement instrumentation businesses rebounded from the trough in the second quarter growing approximately 6 % and 5% respectively quarter-over-quarter. Third, we believe our longer cycle commercial markets such as marine instrumentation and medical imaging bottomed in the third quarter. Fourth, our government businesses continue to grow and generally remain in attractive niches such as space-based imaging, manned and autonomous subsidy systems and electronic warfare. Despite the market turmoil and lower sales in 2020 we have successfully demonstrated GAAP margin improvement. For example, the second quarter GAAP operating margin increased sequentially over 150 basis points specifically operating margin of 16.4% was the second highest in the company's history. In addition, we achieved greater margins compared to last year in nearly every major business category except commercial aerospace where sales have declined nearly 50%. We also achieved record third quarter free cash flow and all-time record free cash flow for any first nine months period. Finally, our balance sheet has never been stronger and our acquisition pipeline is healthy. As the overall demand environment continues to improve our substantially lower cost structure, for example we're operating with 9.2% fewer employees, our lower cost structure should provide significant operating leverage in future quarters. Coupled with acquisitions, we expect earnings and cash flow to continue compounding for years to come. Before turning to Al to report on the third quarter performance by segment, I want to comment briefly on two important items. First, the OneWeb satellite program and second, the potential acquisition of Plotinus. Over the last few weeks the OneWeb situation has improved considerably. First OneWeb parent of our customer Airbus OneWeb satellite secures $235 million of interim financing in late September. Second we received a substantial advance payment in the month of October and third we recently signed a new more favorable contract for which we have resumed limited production. While some risk remains including a successful exit by OneWeb from bankruptcy. We currently expect a modest charge of approximately $3 million in the fourth quarter versus the potential $40 million noted earlier during the work stoppage. Now regarding Photonis, on September 28 we paused our efforts to acquire the business and voluntarily withdrew our application for authorization by the government of France. In summary, we determined at that time that an acquisition under the proposed conditions of the French government was not visible at the seller's valuation expectation communicated to Teledyne. However, in recent days the seller's valuation expectations have significantly moderated and we have renewed our acquisition efforts. At this time we are hopeful to conclude the negotiations and announce the acquisition before the end of the year. Al will now comment on the performance of our core segments.\nAl Pichelli: Thank you Robert. In our instrumentation segment overall third quarter sales decreased 6.9% versus last year. Sales of environmental instruments decreased 2.1% from last year. However, sales increased 6.5% sequentially from the trough in the second quarter. Compared with last year sales of certain products such as laboratory instrumentation for life science applications increased. However, this was more than offset by year-over-year declines in sales of selected industrial products such as ambient air monitoring instrumentation. Sales of electronic test and measurement system decreased 6.5% year-over-year again however, sales increased 4.6% sequentially. Sales of protocol test instrumentation in particular for PCI Express and USB test solutions increased from last year but sales of general purpose oscilloscopes declined. Sales of marine instrumentation decreased 11.3% in the quarter. However, operating margin was stable due to head count management and business simplification initiatives. Overall instrumentation segment operating margin increased 86 basis points despite the lower year-over-year sales. Turning to digital imaging segment. Third quarter sales decreased 1.8% and primarily reflected lower sales of X-ray detectors for dental and medical applications partially offset by greater sales of infrared detectors for the defense market and 3D geospatial imaging systems. Sales of industrial and scientific cameras and sensors were largely flat with last year. With continued strength in semi-conductor inspection and markets in Asia largely offsetting some weaknesses in Europe and North America. GAAP segment operating margin was 19%, an increase of 210 basis points year-over-year. In the aerospace and defense electronics market third quarter sales declined 18.2% as greater defense sales were more than offset by a 49% decline in sales of commercial aerospace products as well as lower commercial space sales related to OneWeb. GAAP segment operating margin decreased due to lower sales but increased 621 basis points sequentially given a significant lower cost structure. In the engineered system segment third quarter revenue increased to 2.9% primarily due to greater sales from space, nuclear and other manufacturing programs as well as electronic manufacturing services. Segment operating profits increased 17.9% with margin 158 basis points higher than last year. I will now turn to call to Sue who will offer some additional commentary regarding the third quarter and our 2020 outlook.\nSue Main: Thank you Al. Good morning everyone. I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and Al and then I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2020 outlook. In the third quarter cash flow from operating activities was $150.3 million compared with cash flow of $150.9 million for the same period of 2019. Record third quarter free cash flow that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures was $135.1 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared with $125.8 million in 2019. Capital expenditures were $15.2 million in the third quarter compared to $25.1 million for the same period of 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense was $29.2 million in the third quarter compared to $27.9 million for the same period of 2019. We ended the quarter with $332.2 million of net debt that is $786.7 million of debt less cash of $454.5 million for a net debt to capital ratio of 9.9%. Stock option compensation expense was $5.7 million for both the third quarter of 2020 and 2019. Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2020 will be in the range of $2.56 to $2.86 per share and for the full year 2020 our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $9.70 to $10 compared with the prior outlook of $9.45 to $10. The 2020 full year estimated tax rate excluding discrete items is expected to be 22.7%; a 210 basis point increase compared to full year 2019 due in part to less R&D tax credits. In addition, we currently expect less discrete tax items in 2020 compared with 2019. I will now pass a call back to Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you Sue. We would now like to take your question. Alicia if you're ready to proceed with the questions and answers please go ahead.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Joe Giordano. Please go ahead.\nJoe Giordano: Hi, everyone. Good morning.\nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe Giordano: So some interesting stuff you said there Robert on OneWeb and Photonis that I wanted to touch on. On OneWeb, I was going to ask kind of before you knew about that development what's kind of your broader outlook for commercial space? There is obviously been a lot of kind of buzz around the sector recently with some other big companies like Microsoft the other day talking about it like what are your future ambitions there in terms of growth and is there new applications that you might like want to be involved in that sector going forward?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes Joe. Thank you for the question. Let me note that for us we have space programs both in the commercial and the defense sector. In the commercial sector, a lot of our instruments are used both for studying the universe as well as looking down at Earth for environmental measurements. On the defense side, on the other hand we do have a large number of programs that address the needs for looking at weapons through satellites. While there are of course as you said there is a lot of interest in communications in space like the programs that you mentioned, our involvement right now is OneWeb. The more interesting part to us is the defense imaging sector where we've been winning contracts recently and where our programs are very healthy. For example we're involved with the wide field of view program in the defense sector and the Opier program which is a persistent overhead infrared classified program. I think going forward let's see what the outcome is on the OneWeb program. They have ambitions of course to increase the number of satellites in the future but right now we're more focused on making sure that we make the products, we promise to make and we get paid for them promptly. I don't know if that answered your question Joe.\nJoe Giordano: It did. Thank you. On Photonis do these new, do the discussions with the French government like what kind of scope changes does that entail like how is the size of the business that you would potentially be acquiring kind of different now than what we initially thought given those discussions?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. initially obviously we were to acquire 100% of the business. The French government is asking that we let a French government state-sponsored investment bank invest 10% in the company. In and of itself we find that okay we're going to work with the French government and especially the investment bank to make sure that we have all of our procedures in place. The more important thing that has happened recently Joe is that there was a significant change in price that we asked for and receive about 15% on U.S. dollars basis and frankly you can appreciate that owning a 100% of an entity is very different than owning 90% of an entity and that's why the price reduction. I think we have an agreement in principle right now and we need to now finalize our detailed paperwork with the government and then see if we can proceed from there.\nJoe Giordano: Well, that's definitely good to hear. Just two more quick ones for me. Can you guys give maybe your current views if I know it's been shifting in the market, so your current views on the defense sector under a Biden administration and what are your thinking early stage of like your biggest margin opportunities into next year across the portfolio. Thanks.\nRobert Mehrabian: I think in the short term we're looking at which I mean the really short term and let's say midterm next year, we're looking at growth in the defense sector for our programs in the mid single digit range. If there is a change in administration as you indicated then I think in the future years in the out years we think things will remain relatively flat. Our job is really very simple; regardless of which administration is in and which programs are supported, our job is to be able to get our share of the market and gain market against the competition. So I feel very good about our defense programs because of the breadth of offerings we have from space imaging to electronic warfare to communication, etc. Having said all of that defense today is about 20% of our sales, our portfolio and I would say a little less than that 20% of our operating income. Consequently really my attention going forward, our attention going forward is to expand our commercial businesses where we enjoy much higher margins.\nRobert Mehrabian: That's it Joe.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Blake Gendron with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nBlake Gendron: Yes. Thanks. Good morning. So I want to dig into the margin improvement in the next year. You've quantified some of the cost out in the past things that you're doing internally with the target goal of 20% GAAP EBIT margins or better. I'm wondering if you could update us on both the cost capture to date and then additional opportunities moving forward and what the timeline of that would be? Thanks.\nRobert Mehrabian: Sure Blake. I'll try to answer that the best I can at this time. First, there are two primary changes in our cost structure. The first and the most important one is the lower number of employees. In general, we're down about 9.3% that is after adding about 30-40 people in our OneWeb program in the UK. So we are down about 9.3% which is about 1,100 a little less than 1,100 employees that the effect of that maintaining that cost structure is that it will help our margins approximately 130 basis points or so. The other thing is that we also have a procurement initiatives which are helping us reduce our cost across the board as we procure. We buy about $1.2 billion worth of goods and services and our procurement initiatives are aimed at reducing that. So we expect to get a little bit help from that domain as well but by and large I'd say the 130 basis points for next year is a good number that I gave you. I'm hoping that will be higher than that.\nBlake Gendron: Understood. That's really helpful. Circling back on digital imaging, I'm hoping to better understand kind of roughly the end market waiting across things like machine vision semis, life sciences [indiscernible] etc. it seems like life science demand could carry the segment into 4Q what specific and market considerations are baked into the segment outlook through year end and what are some of the longer arc trends that you're focused on? We see a lot of product announcements and expansions but it's tough to contextualize exactly where those fit across your end markets. So I guess just high level how do you expect this market level to evolve?\nRobert Mehrabian: Okay I'll try and answer that. Let us start with our digital imaging sales for this year. They're about $985 million, $983 million -- $985 million. Last year they were about 990. So it's flat year-over-year. Now the big chunk of that is our cameras and vision systems and sensors. They're used both for flat panel displaces about any phone or any television that you look at has to be inspected and a lot of those are done by our cameras and also our cameras are used in semiconductor industry for inspection. Overall, with both sensors and cameras now of course three-dimensional views of things and all that sales in that business is about 340 million and it's a fairly stable business with all the problems, with the pandemic that business has remained healthy. It's flat year-over-year but having said that the margins have improved. The area that has hit us a little bit harder is in the healthcare area. That sales that are about the $220 million. We make X-ray detectors both for dental as well as or looking at human anatomy and we also make some X-ray sources but let's stay with the detectors. As you know the detectors that we make for the dentist for the dental industry they're both inter-oral and extra-oral that's outside the mouth and inside the mouth. That has been very slow because dentists have not been very active up until very recently. Our inter-oral detectors are picking up. Our extra-oral detectors will probably be a little while before they pick up. We think that business would start picking up at the end of the fourth quarter. The one area that surprised us frankly in healthcare is that we make sources, we make magnetrons that go into radiotherapy instruments that are instruments that are used for cancer treatment. A lot of those instruments are also used for looking for cancer and because of the pandemic that area has significantly slowed down and so until that area comes back we don't think our healthcare businesses would be as robust as they used to be and we think that's going to happen by the way next year. The aerospace and defense that includes both our imaging for classified programs here as well as studying space both here and in Europe. That's been an increase for us this year. Year-over-year I think we've got an 8% increase. We're about $270 million. That's pretty healthy. The last two items are the MEMs business. MEMs micro electronic systems, micro mechanical systems, the revenue there is about 95 million. It's up about 12% from last year primarily because we bought a small MEMs business. We are probably the largest independent MEMs foundry in the world today and we're very positive about that business. The issue there is it's a fab, very capital intensive. So we're always balancing our capital investments against what kind of market share we want to have. The last area of course is our geospatial where we make LIDARS and other devices and that's a healthy business but it's relatively small. It's of the order of $58 million. So I don't know if that answered your question directionally. I think we expect digital imaging business to grow next year.\nBlake Gendron: That's extremely helpful. I appreciate the detailed response. I'll get back in queue.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Greg Konrad with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nGreg Konrad: Good morning.\nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning Greg.\nGreg Konrad: How you doing? I just wanted to follow up on two of the previous questions. I mean first on healthcare and you kind of talked about it and in the release you talked about kind of a recovery in late Q4. I mean pre-COVID that business seems to have just been straight up. You've picked up share and a lot of the new technologies. I mean when we think about into next year does that business kind of get back to the normalized level and continue its growth trajectory? I mean what type of opportunities do you see going forward?\nRobert Mehrabian: Well, I think there is no question that business has a very healthy future and the reason is very simple. We make detectors, X-ray detectors that have higher resolution than normal detectors and therefore you use much less X-ray to be able to project an image. Having said that that's a no-brainer that is going to take off. The issue is at what time are hospitals going to be allowing patients in for other than serious surgery or cancer treatments or other things. We think that's going to happen next year. We even think overall in digital imaging we should have a little increase from this quarter to next quarter. I would say as much as maybe $10 million and we think for next year we probably should see of the range of about 8% to 9% increase in revenue overall in digital imaging which would be pretty good for us since it's one of our higher margin businesses.\nGreg Konrad: And then just to follow up on the defense question I mean you mentioned space and unmanned and I think shallow water submersible but we're also seeing a lot of new opportunities the Navy is talking about growing it's unmanned portion. I mean what is your content or opportunity with that whether it's larger systems or smaller ones and kind of just the outlook for opportunities within unmanned.\nAl Pichelli: First you mentioned the shallow water submersible of course that's for our Navy Seals and we're the sole provider of that. That program is going really well. As you move to the unmanned vehicles from a defense perspective we really have two sets of vehicles that are being used today. One of them is really a vehicle that is a glider that glides in the ocean and in front of a battleship formation they can use as many as a hundred gliders in order to sample the salinity, density of the water which of course affects sonar transmission and reception. In that area we've had the probably the largest programs from the Navy. Another area of course is that we make medium-sized autonomous vehicles and we have an opportunity, we have sold some of those both to our military as well as overseas and we're looking at more opportunities in that area especially as a prime. Going back to the large displacement AUVs we are going to bid on that program probably as a subcontractor to someone else but frankly if you were to come and look at the, if you were to look at the submarine and say okay what kind of vehicles are available today in the world to be able to exit be housed in a submarine and exit a submarine. The only new vehicle is ours and that's the shallow water submersible vehicle and of course coupled with our unmanned vehicles that I just mentioned and the technologies that go with it are we fairly bullish for that area.\nGreg Konrad: And then just one more quick one. I think last quarter you talked about well in excess of a billion dollars in capacity to do M&A. I mean on the Photonis deal that seems to be well less than half. I mean what are you seeing in the broader M&A market whether just valuations, volume of potential opportunities, just given that you tend to be fairly conservative and prudent around M&A?\nAl Pichelli: Yes. We've demonstrated both the characteristics both being very prudent but also when opportunities are afforded to us to be able to be more aggressive. I'll just mention to you that when we went through the downturn in 2008 to 2010 the financial crisis right after we came out of that we acquired two very strong companies one was [indiscernible] and the second one was DALSA. Fast forward to the crisis in 2014 to 2016 which was oil crisis for us we lost about $200 million in revenue. We improved our cash flow just like we're doing now as soon. As we came out of there we acquired e2v which was our last largest acquisition to date. It's about $780 million and that's done really well, we started with margins that of 7%-8% they're almost reaching 20% today. Now going back now to your observation and question I said before our ability we had a billion dollars or a little more than that because of our cash flow that has significantly increased today. So I think it's closer to one and a half. I think it could go as far as 2 billion depending on whether how much of an EBITDA we acquire or debt to EBITDA ratio limit is about 3.5. Today we're sitting around 1.4 and with more cash generation in the fourth quarter we should be a little better than that. So I would say 1.5 to 2 billion, 1.9 billion is the range that we're capable of doing. Now if you take Photonis which is going to cost this at least for our best estimates closing costs, etc. is going to be about $450 million - $460 million. You subtract that out that leaves us with 1 billion to 1.4 billion - 1.5 billion additional capability. So we're looking very hard as we come out of this year. I think people are having a difficult time and some of the boards obviously boardroom management as I said before they're always looking in the rear view mirror saying how well their stock used to be whereas shareholders are always looking at least my view of it is they're always looking forward through the front window saying where things are and what kind of an offer would be attractive. So having said all of that I think we think this is a good environment for us to make acquisitions.\nGreg Konrad: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg Bank, please go ahead.\nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning Andrew. Operator I don't think Andrew is on.\nOperator: Okay. We will move on to the next one. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Ricchiuti with Needham and Company. Please go ahead.\nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning Jim. For some reason operator we're not getting the people. There is something wrong at your end because I can hear you but the questions are not coming through.\nJim Ricchiuti: Robert I think that one was on me. Robert I had my phone on mute. That's my apology. If I may Roberts you sound a lot more confident about closing on the Photonis acquisition and I wonder if maybe you could talk a little bit about what you find so attractive about this business. I think in some respects it looks a little bit reminiscent of the acquisition that you did of e2v but I wonder if you could talk a little bit about it to the extent you can.\nRobert Mehrabian: Sure. First I'm a little more positive about it because we've had some discussions with the French investment bank and we find them to be much more business oriented than government oriented. Of course they're going to have a say in making sure that the technology doesn't move out of France but we think I feel better about it because I think we can live with that enterprise as a minority shareholder for a number of years. The second part is that that business seems to we have to get your final due diligence check that business seems to have held up pretty well during this difficult period just like our defense businesses because primarily it provides the non- [indiscernible] image intensifiers for night vision systems. Now what we bring to it is all of our digital imaging capabilities which are all complementary and not duplicative of that. That field is moving more towards digitization which we are experts in. So we think we bring substantial synergistic value to the enterprise which has been missing in the recent past because it's been owned by a private equity firm. Therefore it didn't have sister companies to interact with. There is a small part of the business also that is has to do with commercial laboratory instrumentation and for very low light using photon multiplier; same technology used for the night vision. That's attractive to us also because we bought this scientific camera businesses which serve laboratories instruments and academic instrument across the world and we think that is really attractive to us because they bring the best mass spectrometry detectors to the field and it'd be a very nice overlap with our existing businesses that we acquired last year in that area. So those are some of the specifics about that acquisition Jim.\nJim Ricchiuti: That's helpful Robert. I wonder if you might also may have missed it but did you give any information on orders, the book to build and maybe a little color and book to build per segments. You also I think gave a little bit of color about what you're anticipating for the digital imaging business in Q4. I wonder if there is any color you could provide on some of the other business units.\nRobert Mehrabian: Let me start with the book to build. The book to build in Q3 is about 0.95 maybe a little more than that because our engineer systems is a very lumpy business that we get a big book to build but excluding that it's a little over 0.95. We expect next quarter to exceed one in book to build based on everything that we see so far in the quarter and we expect to end the year just below one maybe 0.98- 0.97. Now Q4 revenue which I talked about digital imaging being up somewhat, Q4 revenue should increase over to Q3 by about 4% or so or $40 million, let's say that's a little higher than 4%. That would be very attractive for us because in Q2 where we had I think about 743 in revenue I said I expected Q3 to be equal and very similar to that. It end up the revenue was about 7 million, 6 million higher and the income was about the same, the EPS even though we didn't have many one-time benefits in the third quarter. Just to digress for a second if you take the third quarter of this year versus the third quarter of last year there is $0.29 income difference from taxes, one-time tax items and against one-time charges to benefit last year's third quarter. So if you kind of do an apples to apples which we never really do non-GAAP measures but if you do that we're only down about $0.07 -- $0.08 from last year's third quarter. So going into the fourth quarter I think if we can increase the revenue in various groups and achieve about $40 million of increasing overall revenue coupled to what is now our better margin that we're achieving our margin this quarter was 16.4% and so we think what will happen is that we will have a better earnings as well which is what Sue alluded to as we raise the midpoint of our earnings early as today.\nJim Ricchiuti: Got it. Thank you. That's very helpful.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNoah Poponak: Hi, good morning everybody.\nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning Noah.\nNoah Poponak: Robert, sort of following up there and in your prepared remarks you mentioned that you think you've seen a bottom in your cyclical businesses. Can you just elaborate on that comment? I mean, is that an exit rate versus entry rate into the quarter or order action or any more detail to help us get comfortable that's happened would be helpful.\nRobert Mehrabian: As Al Pichelli mentioned earlier, we've seen five and six and I said it also we've seen 5% to 6% improvement in revenue in the environmental and test and measurement businesses. Our book to build in those two areas are over one about [1.02 to 1.04]. So 2% to 4% above what we sold and we think as a consequence, we think that those businesses are going to do okay going forward. We expect some marginal [sale] improvements in our total instrumentation business maybe as much as $15 million or so but more importantly I think we're seeing some act. Of course China is coming out of their downturn and doing well but we also see some new products that we're offering in the pharmaceutical area as well as water sampling area that are encouraging for us. So in the instrumentation would be the one. In digital imaging, I think I've already spoken about it could be as high as $10 million to $15 million to maybe even $20 million in Q4 versus Q3. I think in aerospace and defense I think we're going to be fairly flat primarily because I don't think there's going to be any much movement in the aerospace domain and our defense is already pretty healthy. In the engineered system we may have some uptick in revenue but we'll have some pressure on our margins but generally we think if you add all of that up we could have about $40 million increase quarter-over-quarter because of the things that I mentioned.\nNoah Poponak: Okay. That's helpful. Trying to piece together the margin commentary you've made today it kind of looks like the segment operating margin at the total company level full year 2020 is going to come in around 17% depending on exactly where the fourth quarter is and then, are the comments that you made earlier is sort of officially targeting 130 basis points of improvement in that next year and then I can't quite tell if you've provided a long-term 20% target or not but it certainly sounds like you expect more improvement beyond that. I mean are we kind of looking at something in the zone approximately of 100 basis points of segment operating margin improvement for a few years?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. I hope so. Let me -- I'm going to get some looks around the table from my various segment operatives and others but let me go back for a second. If we do what we have just said we would in the fourth quarter, we should end the year with segment operating margins of about 17% which is what you noted because early in the year of course Q1 it was 15.2 and we've continuously improved. If we do that than the total company operating margin which was about 15% in the end of Q2 which is what I thought it would be should improve to about 15.2% to 15.3%. Now going forward into next year because of the actions that we spoke about both people and procurement and a whole bunch of other 80/20 programs that we have, we expect to bump that up 130 basis points next year. Our operating margins and frankly if you put it on 17 and you put it on 15, it's the same thing because the percentage of corporate costs are fairly fixed. Having said that and going forward I think that would moderate somewhat because we took a lot of cost out this year and we're going to enjoy the fruits of that next year but I would be disappointed if we can't continuously improve our margins somewhere between 80 to 100 basis points in the next few years.\nNoah Poponak: Okay. That's helpful and then finally just wanted to ask about the cash flow statement. Is it possible to quantify or bracket the October advance payment related to OneWeb that you mentioned and then it certainly looks like you'll come in ahead of the full year $400 million of free cash flow that you had discussed previously if you're willing to provide an update to that and then the conversion to net income is pretty high for the year. CapEx is down, I guess maybe if you would just speak to -- I guess we're just assuming the conversion is 100% into perpetuity any reason not to expect that?\nRobert Mehrabian: Let me start from the rear end of that question because that's the easier one to answer for me. Over 100% conversion yes and we anticipate that will continue because of all the programs that we have introducing managed working capital and reducing costs in general. Now going to the cash flow for the year, in Q2 I said it'd be a little over $400 million. In Q3 where we enjoyed the $135 million of free cash flow that also included $15.8 million dollars that we had to repay the government for the CARES Act. So the 135 is a really very healthy cash flow for a company like ours. If we can continue that momentum I expect that by the end of the year we will be over 400. 425 I think that's within reach maybe a little higher than that and I expect if we can do all of that then our net debt should drop around $200 million a little north or south of $200 million which puts us in a really good position for the future in terms of acquisitions.\nNoah Poponak: Very helpful. Thanks so much.\nRobert Mehrabian: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Blake Gendron with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nBlake Gendron: Yes. Thanks for getting me back on here. Feel free to pump me from the call if there is not enough time here. I have just two quick follow-ups first on instrumentation it looks like the shorter cycle industrial recovery is starting to plane out a little bit. If environmental outperforms testing next year what would that do from a margin mix perspective and how do the three stack up really marine versus environmental versus testing?\nRobert Mehrabian: Let me start. The marine businesses are fairly flat year-over-year and they're going to remain so for a long time primarily because we've moved more away from some of our oil and gas markets to defense markets and until the oil and gas markets even though they're okay now until they come back, we don't expect revenue increases. Having said that the marine businesses if you look at the total instrumentation business, the marine businesses however have lower margins in general even though the margins are improving significantly but they're still about 200 basis points lower than the others. Environmental is about 100 basis points above the average source a test and measurement those are very healthy businesses. So combined together it kind of flattens out but I think we'd encourage that our higher margin businesses are the ones that we're looking forward to growing.\nBlake Gendron: Understood. And then one just quick one on M&A, you wouldn't rush a deal announcement obviously and Photonis is not withstanding because that's TBD but as you think about the election and maybe the tax regime in Biden administration does that maybe accelerate your M&A pipeline processes at all or do you expect valuations to kind of normalize with any change in tax? Thanks.\nRobert Mehrabian: Boy that's a difficult one. I can only answer the following. We're not going to hurry up to do anything. Never have, never will regardless of which administration is occupying the White House. I think taxes will change up or down but I think we will buy the businesses that we're looking at the ones that we're looking at. We will buy them because they're good businesses in the long term and we can improve their margins and I wouldn't rush about it not because of the election or subsequent to the election. On the other hand I wouldn't be very slow about it either because things are going to improve next year and everybody's prices are going to go up. So this might be a good opportunity.\nBlake Gendron: Understood. Thanks so much for the time.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you Blake.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg Bank. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Hey guys. Can you hear me now? Had some technical difficulty.\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. For sure.\nAndrew Buscaglia: All right. Everything's pretty picked over but I'm curious high level within digital imaging you guys can see some pretty powerful growth in that segment. If you look back to 2017 or so you're able to grow over 20% organically there. I would think that kind of given the set up into 2021 you have, you've had a couple years of more muted growth and specifically machine vision seems to be there could be some optimism of some upside brewing there given the semis and tech cycle. I guess how are you thinking about that business? I guess in a [bull] case in order of magnitude where do you see that business going? Where the differences between this entering 2021 and 2017?\nRobert Mehrabian: Well, I think in 2017 obviously that's the year that we also acquired e2v, so things got really bumped up that year because of the acquisition but let's say absence any acquisition. I think right now I expect us to grow our top line in the higher single digits in the overall digital imaging domain. I will only put the caveat on it that this healthcare situation has hit us pretty hard and we are expecting that we'll improve. If that were to happen I think high single digits growth in revenue for digital imaging overall should be expected and of course as you said if we make the Photonis acquisition without throwing another $150 or plus million worth of revenue and we so a business is going to grow that's for sure. The question is can we get over the healthcare hump that we're experiencing right now.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. Okay and I know this piece is small but you're offshore oil and gas exposure. So it went from being very optimistic for that outlet there to pretty pessimistic I think based on what's going on in energy. Any change in your view on strategically that segment and if where you want to play in that business if it's still viable in your mind as a long-term growth opportunity for you guys?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. I would say obviously there is two parts to our marine businesses. There is the offshore energy which is both production as well as exploration and then the second part is construction, science hydraulically but more importantly defense where we are a major player in making penetrators for our submarine fleet. And then we have of course a lot of sensors program that are used whether in our autonomous vehicles or others. So I think the defense sector of that business is healthy and will remain so and probably grow in future years and if you're throwing science and construction, etc. that's really going to be almost 60% of our business going forward. Now, the overall segment, the sub segment, the marine sub segment has revenues of about $420 million to $425 million so the rest of it is offshore oil production and exploration. Let's say about 150 million total. That is fairly stable for us primarily because there is still a 40 dollars a barrel of oil. There is still developments going on and we are winning because we have the best products plus we have standardized products which people can buy and we think that's going to be very stable. The area that has not come back is the offshore exploration where we provide streamer cables and sensors. That used to be a pretty healthy business for us even after the downturn in the oil industry. That is kind of not been that high recently and if that comes back if they put more vessels in the water for exploration, I think that will help generally our marine business but looking forward I'd say growth in the marine business is going to be relatively benign where what we're going to do there and we've done this continuously is improve the margins. It's enjoying really good margins above the average margins of our segments right now. I hope that answers.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Yes. No, that's great detail. Thanks.\nRobert Mehrabian: Sure.\nOperator: And there are no further questions.\nRobert Mehrabian: Alicia, I would now ask Jason and Wees to conclude our conference call. Thank you very much.\nJason VanWees: Thank you Robert and again thanks everyone for joining us this morning.

            "content": "Thank you Robert. In our instrumentation segment overall third quarter sales decreased 6.9% versus last year. Sales of environmental instruments decreased 2.1% from last year. However, sales increased 6.5% sequentially from the trough in the second quarter. Compared with last year sales of certain products such as laboratory instrumentation for life science applications increased. However, this was more than offset by year-over-year declines in sales of selected industrial products such as ambient air monitoring instrumentation. Sales of electronic test and measurement system decreased 6.5% year-over-year again however, sales increased 4.6% sequentially. Sales of protocol test instrumentation in particular for PCI Express and USB test solutions increased from last year but sales of general purpose oscilloscopes declined. Sales of marine instrumentation decreased 11.3% in the quarter. However, operating margin was stable due to head count management and business simplification initiatives. Overall instrumentation segment operating margin increased 86 basis points despite the lower year-over-year sales. Turning to digital imaging segment. Third quarter sales decreased 1.8% and primarily reflected lower sales of X-ray detectors for dental and medical applications partially offset by greater sales of infrared detectors for the defense market and 3D geospatial imaging systems. Sales of industrial and scientific cameras and sensors were largely flat with last year. With continued strength in semi-conductor inspection and markets in Asia largely offsetting some weaknesses in Europe and North America. GAAP segment operating margin was 19%, an increase of 210 basis points year-over-year. In the aerospace and defense electronics market third quarter sales declined 18.2% as greater defense sales were more than offset by a 49% decline in sales of commercial aerospace products as well as lower commercial space sales related to OneWeb. GAAP segment operating margin decreased due to lower sales but increased 621 basis points sequentially given a significant lower cost structure. In the engineered system segment third quarter revenue increased to 2.9% primarily due to greater sales from space, nuclear and other manufacturing programs as well as electronic manufacturing services. Segment operating profits increased 17.9% with margin 158 basis points higher than last year. I will now turn to call to Sue who will offer some additional commentary regarding the third quarter and our 2020 outlook. First you mentioned the shallow water submersible of course that's for our Navy Seals and we're the sole provider of that. That program is going really well. As you move to the unmanned vehicles from a defense perspective we really have two sets of vehicles that are being used today. One of them is really a vehicle that is a glider that glides in the ocean and in front of a battleship formation they can use as many as a hundred gliders in order to sample the salinity, density of the water which of course affects sonar transmission and reception. In that area we've had the probably the largest programs from the Navy. Another area of course is that we make medium-sized autonomous vehicles and we have an opportunity, we have sold some of those both to our military as well as overseas and we're looking at more opportunities in that area especially as a prime. Going back to the large displacement AUVs we are going to bid on that program probably as a subcontractor to someone else but frankly if you were to come and look at the, if you were to look at the submarine and say okay what kind of vehicles are available today in the world to be able to exit be housed in a submarine and exit a submarine. The only new vehicle is ours and that's the shallow water submersible vehicle and of course coupled with our unmanned vehicles that I just mentioned and the technologies that go with it are we fairly bullish for that area. Yes. We've demonstrated both the characteristics both being very prudent but also when opportunities are afforded to us to be able to be more aggressive. I'll just mention to you that when we went through the downturn in 2008 to 2010 the financial crisis right after we came out of that we acquired two very strong companies one was [indiscernible] and the second one was DALSA. Fast forward to the crisis in 2014 to 2016 which was oil crisis for us we lost about $200 million in revenue. We improved our cash flow just like we're doing now as soon. As we came out of there we acquired e2v which was our last largest acquisition to date. It's about $780 million and that's done really well, we started with margins that of 7%-8% they're almost reaching 20% today. Now going back now to your observation and question I said before our ability we had a billion dollars or a little more than that because of our cash flow that has significantly increased today. So I think it's closer to one and a half. I think it could go as far as 2 billion depending on whether how much of an EBITDA we acquire or debt to EBITDA ratio limit is about 3.5. Today we're sitting around 1.4 and with more cash generation in the fourth quarter we should be a little better than that. So I would say 1.5 to 2 billion, 1.9 billion is the range that we're capable of doing. Now if you take Photonis which is going to cost this at least for our best estimates closing costs, etc. is going to be about $450 million - $460 million. You subtract that out that leaves us with 1 billion to 1.4 billion - 1.5 billion additional capability. So we're looking very hard as we come out of this year. I think people are having a difficult time and some of the boards obviously boardroom management as I said before they're always looking in the rear view mirror saying how well their stock used to be whereas shareholders are always looking at least my view of it is they're always looking forward through the front window saying where things are and what kind of an offer would be attractive. So having said all of that I think we think this is a good environment for us to make acquisitions."

            "name": "Robert Mehrabian",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason. Good morning and thank you for joining our earnings call. I want to open with the following comments. First, all of our 70 worldwide manufacturing sites as well as our corporate office and research laboratory remain operational and only 16% of total employees are working from home. Second, our short cycle environmental and test and measurement instrumentation businesses rebounded from the trough in the second quarter growing approximately 6 % and 5% respectively quarter-over-quarter. Third, we believe our longer cycle commercial markets such as marine instrumentation and medical imaging bottomed in the third quarter. Fourth, our government businesses continue to grow and generally remain in attractive niches such as space-based imaging, manned and autonomous subsidy systems and electronic warfare. Despite the market turmoil and lower sales in 2020 we have successfully demonstrated GAAP margin improvement. For example, the second quarter GAAP operating margin increased sequentially over 150 basis points specifically operating margin of 16.4% was the second highest in the company's history. In addition, we achieved greater margins compared to last year in nearly every major business category except commercial aerospace where sales have declined nearly 50%. We also achieved record third quarter free cash flow and all-time record free cash flow for any first nine months period. Finally, our balance sheet has never been stronger and our acquisition pipeline is healthy. As the overall demand environment continues to improve our substantially lower cost structure, for example we're operating with 9.2% fewer employees, our lower cost structure should provide significant operating leverage in future quarters. Coupled with acquisitions, we expect earnings and cash flow to continue compounding for years to come. Before turning to Al to report on the third quarter performance by segment, I want to comment briefly on two important items. First, the OneWeb satellite program and second, the potential acquisition of Plotinus. Over the last few weeks the OneWeb situation has improved considerably. First OneWeb parent of our customer Airbus OneWeb satellite secures $235 million of interim financing in late September. Second we received a substantial advance payment in the month of October and third we recently signed a new more favorable contract for which we have resumed limited production. While some risk remains including a successful exit by OneWeb from bankruptcy. We currently expect a modest charge of approximately $3 million in the fourth quarter versus the potential $40 million noted earlier during the work stoppage. Now regarding Photonis, on September 28 we paused our efforts to acquire the business and voluntarily withdrew our application for authorization by the government of France. In summary, we determined at that time that an acquisition under the proposed conditions of the French government was not visible at the seller's valuation expectation communicated to Teledyne. However, in recent days the seller's valuation expectations have significantly moderated and we have renewed our acquisition efforts. At this time we are hopeful to conclude the negotiations and announce the acquisition before the end of the year. Al will now comment on the performance of our core segments. Thank you Sue. We would now like to take your question. Alicia if you're ready to proceed with the questions and answers please go ahead. Good morning, Joe. Yes Joe. Thank you for the question. Let me note that for us we have space programs both in the commercial and the defense sector. In the commercial sector, a lot of our instruments are used both for studying the universe as well as looking down at Earth for environmental measurements. On the defense side, on the other hand we do have a large number of programs that address the needs for looking at weapons through satellites. While there are of course as you said there is a lot of interest in communications in space like the programs that you mentioned, our involvement right now is OneWeb. The more interesting part to us is the defense imaging sector where we've been winning contracts recently and where our programs are very healthy. For example we're involved with the wide field of view program in the defense sector and the Opier program which is a persistent overhead infrared classified program. I think going forward let's see what the outcome is on the OneWeb program. They have ambitions of course to increase the number of satellites in the future but right now we're more focused on making sure that we make the products, we promise to make and we get paid for them promptly. I don't know if that answered your question Joe. Yes. initially obviously we were to acquire 100% of the business. The French government is asking that we let a French government state-sponsored investment bank invest 10% in the company. In and of itself we find that okay we're going to work with the French government and especially the investment bank to make sure that we have all of our procedures in place. The more important thing that has happened recently Joe is that there was a significant change in price that we asked for and receive about 15% on U.S. dollars basis and frankly you can appreciate that owning a 100% of an entity is very different than owning 90% of an entity and that's why the price reduction. I think we have an agreement in principle right now and we need to now finalize our detailed paperwork with the government and then see if we can proceed from there. I think in the short term we're looking at which I mean the really short term and let's say midterm next year, we're looking at growth in the defense sector for our programs in the mid single digit range. If there is a change in administration as you indicated then I think in the future years in the out years we think things will remain relatively flat. Our job is really very simple; regardless of which administration is in and which programs are supported, our job is to be able to get our share of the market and gain market against the competition. So I feel very good about our defense programs because of the breadth of offerings we have from space imaging to electronic warfare to communication, etc. Having said all of that defense today is about 20% of our sales, our portfolio and I would say a little less than that 20% of our operating income. Consequently really my attention going forward, our attention going forward is to expand our commercial businesses where we enjoy much higher margins. That's it Joe. Sure Blake. I'll try to answer that the best I can at this time. First, there are two primary changes in our cost structure. The first and the most important one is the lower number of employees. In general, we're down about 9.3% that is after adding about 30-40 people in our OneWeb program in the UK. So we are down about 9.3% which is about 1,100 a little less than 1,100 employees that the effect of that maintaining that cost structure is that it will help our margins approximately 130 basis points or so. The other thing is that we also have a procurement initiatives which are helping us reduce our cost across the board as we procure. We buy about $1.2 billion worth of goods and services and our procurement initiatives are aimed at reducing that. So we expect to get a little bit help from that domain as well but by and large I'd say the 130 basis points for next year is a good number that I gave you. I'm hoping that will be higher than that. Okay I'll try and answer that. Let us start with our digital imaging sales for this year. They're about $985 million, $983 million -- $985 million. Last year they were about 990. So it's flat year-over-year. Now the big chunk of that is our cameras and vision systems and sensors. They're used both for flat panel displaces about any phone or any television that you look at has to be inspected and a lot of those are done by our cameras and also our cameras are used in semiconductor industry for inspection. Overall, with both sensors and cameras now of course three-dimensional views of things and all that sales in that business is about 340 million and it's a fairly stable business with all the problems, with the pandemic that business has remained healthy. It's flat year-over-year but having said that the margins have improved. The area that has hit us a little bit harder is in the healthcare area. That sales that are about the $220 million. We make X-ray detectors both for dental as well as or looking at human anatomy and we also make some X-ray sources but let's stay with the detectors. As you know the detectors that we make for the dentist for the dental industry they're both inter-oral and extra-oral that's outside the mouth and inside the mouth. That has been very slow because dentists have not been very active up until very recently. Our inter-oral detectors are picking up. Our extra-oral detectors will probably be a little while before they pick up. We think that business would start picking up at the end of the fourth quarter. The one area that surprised us frankly in healthcare is that we make sources, we make magnetrons that go into radiotherapy instruments that are instruments that are used for cancer treatment. A lot of those instruments are also used for looking for cancer and because of the pandemic that area has significantly slowed down and so until that area comes back we don't think our healthcare businesses would be as robust as they used to be and we think that's going to happen by the way next year. The aerospace and defense that includes both our imaging for classified programs here as well as studying space both here and in Europe. That's been an increase for us this year. Year-over-year I think we've got an 8% increase. We're about $270 million. That's pretty healthy. The last two items are the MEMs business. MEMs micro electronic systems, micro mechanical systems, the revenue there is about 95 million. It's up about 12% from last year primarily because we bought a small MEMs business. We are probably the largest independent MEMs foundry in the world today and we're very positive about that business. The issue there is it's a fab, very capital intensive. So we're always balancing our capital investments against what kind of market share we want to have. The last area of course is our geospatial where we make LIDARS and other devices and that's a healthy business but it's relatively small. It's of the order of $58 million. So I don't know if that answered your question directionally. I think we expect digital imaging business to grow next year. Thank you. Good morning Greg. Well, I think there is no question that business has a very healthy future and the reason is very simple. We make detectors, X-ray detectors that have higher resolution than normal detectors and therefore you use much less X-ray to be able to project an image. Having said that that's a no-brainer that is going to take off. The issue is at what time are hospitals going to be allowing patients in for other than serious surgery or cancer treatments or other things. We think that's going to happen next year. We even think overall in digital imaging we should have a little increase from this quarter to next quarter. I would say as much as maybe $10 million and we think for next year we probably should see of the range of about 8% to 9% increase in revenue overall in digital imaging which would be pretty good for us since it's one of our higher margin businesses. Good morning Andrew. Operator I don't think Andrew is on. Good morning Jim. For some reason operator we're not getting the people. There is something wrong at your end because I can hear you but the questions are not coming through. Sure. First I'm a little more positive about it because we've had some discussions with the French investment bank and we find them to be much more business oriented than government oriented. Of course they're going to have a say in making sure that the technology doesn't move out of France but we think I feel better about it because I think we can live with that enterprise as a minority shareholder for a number of years. The second part is that that business seems to we have to get your final due diligence check that business seems to have held up pretty well during this difficult period just like our defense businesses because primarily it provides the non- [indiscernible] image intensifiers for night vision systems. Now what we bring to it is all of our digital imaging capabilities which are all complementary and not duplicative of that. That field is moving more towards digitization which we are experts in. So we think we bring substantial synergistic value to the enterprise which has been missing in the recent past because it's been owned by a private equity firm. Therefore it didn't have sister companies to interact with. There is a small part of the business also that is has to do with commercial laboratory instrumentation and for very low light using photon multiplier; same technology used for the night vision. That's attractive to us also because we bought this scientific camera businesses which serve laboratories instruments and academic instrument across the world and we think that is really attractive to us because they bring the best mass spectrometry detectors to the field and it'd be a very nice overlap with our existing businesses that we acquired last year in that area. So those are some of the specifics about that acquisition Jim. Let me start with the book to build. The book to build in Q3 is about 0.95 maybe a little more than that because our engineer systems is a very lumpy business that we get a big book to build but excluding that it's a little over 0.95. We expect next quarter to exceed one in book to build based on everything that we see so far in the quarter and we expect to end the year just below one maybe 0.98- 0.97. Now Q4 revenue which I talked about digital imaging being up somewhat, Q4 revenue should increase over to Q3 by about 4% or so or $40 million, let's say that's a little higher than 4%. That would be very attractive for us because in Q2 where we had I think about 743 in revenue I said I expected Q3 to be equal and very similar to that. It end up the revenue was about 7 million, 6 million higher and the income was about the same, the EPS even though we didn't have many one-time benefits in the third quarter. Just to digress for a second if you take the third quarter of this year versus the third quarter of last year there is $0.29 income difference from taxes, one-time tax items and against one-time charges to benefit last year's third quarter. So if you kind of do an apples to apples which we never really do non-GAAP measures but if you do that we're only down about $0.07 -- $0.08 from last year's third quarter. So going into the fourth quarter I think if we can increase the revenue in various groups and achieve about $40 million of increasing overall revenue coupled to what is now our better margin that we're achieving our margin this quarter was 16.4% and so we think what will happen is that we will have a better earnings as well which is what Sue alluded to as we raise the midpoint of our earnings early as today. Good morning Noah. As Al Pichelli mentioned earlier, we've seen five and six and I said it also we've seen 5% to 6% improvement in revenue in the environmental and test and measurement businesses. Our book to build in those two areas are over one about [1.02 to 1.04]. So 2% to 4% above what we sold and we think as a consequence, we think that those businesses are going to do okay going forward. We expect some marginal [sale] improvements in our total instrumentation business maybe as much as $15 million or so but more importantly I think we're seeing some act. Of course China is coming out of their downturn and doing well but we also see some new products that we're offering in the pharmaceutical area as well as water sampling area that are encouraging for us. So in the instrumentation would be the one. In digital imaging, I think I've already spoken about it could be as high as $10 million to $15 million to maybe even $20 million in Q4 versus Q3. I think in aerospace and defense I think we're going to be fairly flat primarily because I don't think there's going to be any much movement in the aerospace domain and our defense is already pretty healthy. In the engineered system we may have some uptick in revenue but we'll have some pressure on our margins but generally we think if you add all of that up we could have about $40 million increase quarter-over-quarter because of the things that I mentioned. Yes. I hope so. Let me -- I'm going to get some looks around the table from my various segment operatives and others but let me go back for a second. If we do what we have just said we would in the fourth quarter, we should end the year with segment operating margins of about 17% which is what you noted because early in the year of course Q1 it was 15.2 and we've continuously improved. If we do that than the total company operating margin which was about 15% in the end of Q2 which is what I thought it would be should improve to about 15.2% to 15.3%. Now going forward into next year because of the actions that we spoke about both people and procurement and a whole bunch of other 80/20 programs that we have, we expect to bump that up 130 basis points next year. Our operating margins and frankly if you put it on 17 and you put it on 15, it's the same thing because the percentage of corporate costs are fairly fixed. Having said that and going forward I think that would moderate somewhat because we took a lot of cost out this year and we're going to enjoy the fruits of that next year but I would be disappointed if we can't continuously improve our margins somewhere between 80 to 100 basis points in the next few years. Let me start from the rear end of that question because that's the easier one to answer for me. Over 100% conversion yes and we anticipate that will continue because of all the programs that we have introducing managed working capital and reducing costs in general. Now going to the cash flow for the year, in Q2 I said it'd be a little over $400 million. In Q3 where we enjoyed the $135 million of free cash flow that also included $15.8 million dollars that we had to repay the government for the CARES Act. So the 135 is a really very healthy cash flow for a company like ours. If we can continue that momentum I expect that by the end of the year we will be over 400. 425 I think that's within reach maybe a little higher than that and I expect if we can do all of that then our net debt should drop around $200 million a little north or south of $200 million which puts us in a really good position for the future in terms of acquisitions. Sure. Let me start. The marine businesses are fairly flat year-over-year and they're going to remain so for a long time primarily because we've moved more away from some of our oil and gas markets to defense markets and until the oil and gas markets even though they're okay now until they come back, we don't expect revenue increases. Having said that the marine businesses if you look at the total instrumentation business, the marine businesses however have lower margins in general even though the margins are improving significantly but they're still about 200 basis points lower than the others. Environmental is about 100 basis points above the average source a test and measurement those are very healthy businesses. So combined together it kind of flattens out but I think we'd encourage that our higher margin businesses are the ones that we're looking forward to growing. Boy that's a difficult one. I can only answer the following. We're not going to hurry up to do anything. Never have, never will regardless of which administration is occupying the White House. I think taxes will change up or down but I think we will buy the businesses that we're looking at the ones that we're looking at. We will buy them because they're good businesses in the long term and we can improve their margins and I wouldn't rush about it not because of the election or subsequent to the election. On the other hand I wouldn't be very slow about it either because things are going to improve next year and everybody's prices are going to go up. So this might be a good opportunity. Thank you Blake. Yes. For sure. Well, I think in 2017 obviously that's the year that we also acquired e2v, so things got really bumped up that year because of the acquisition but let's say absence any acquisition. I think right now I expect us to grow our top line in the higher single digits in the overall digital imaging domain. I will only put the caveat on it that this healthcare situation has hit us pretty hard and we are expecting that we'll improve. If that were to happen I think high single digits growth in revenue for digital imaging overall should be expected and of course as you said if we make the Photonis acquisition without throwing another $150 or plus million worth of revenue and we so a business is going to grow that's for sure. The question is can we get over the healthcare hump that we're experiencing right now. Yes. I would say obviously there is two parts to our marine businesses. There is the offshore energy which is both production as well as exploration and then the second part is construction, science hydraulically but more importantly defense where we are a major player in making penetrators for our submarine fleet. And then we have of course a lot of sensors program that are used whether in our autonomous vehicles or others. So I think the defense sector of that business is healthy and will remain so and probably grow in future years and if you're throwing science and construction, etc. that's really going to be almost 60% of our business going forward. Now, the overall segment, the sub segment, the marine sub segment has revenues of about $420 million to $425 million so the rest of it is offshore oil production and exploration. Let's say about 150 million total. That is fairly stable for us primarily because there is still a 40 dollars a barrel of oil. There is still developments going on and we are winning because we have the best products plus we have standardized products which people can buy and we think that's going to be very stable. The area that has not come back is the offshore exploration where we provide streamer cables and sensors. That used to be a pretty healthy business for us even after the downturn in the oil industry. That is kind of not been that high recently and if that comes back if they put more vessels in the water for exploration, I think that will help generally our marine business but looking forward I'd say growth in the marine business is going to be relatively benign where what we're going to do there and we've done this continuously is improve the margins. It's enjoying really good margins above the average margins of our segments right now. I hope that answers. Sure. Alicia, I would now ask Jason and Wees to conclude our conference call. Thank you very much."

            "content": "Thank you Al. Good morning everyone. I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and Al and then I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2020 outlook. In the third quarter cash flow from operating activities was $150.3 million compared with cash flow of $150.9 million for the same period of 2019. Record third quarter free cash flow that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures was $135.1 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared with $125.8 million in 2019. Capital expenditures were $15.2 million in the third quarter compared to $25.1 million for the same period of 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense was $29.2 million in the third quarter compared to $27.9 million for the same period of 2019. We ended the quarter with $332.2 million of net debt that is $786.7 million of debt less cash of $454.5 million for a net debt to capital ratio of 9.9%. Stock option compensation expense was $5.7 million for both the third quarter of 2020 and 2019. Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2020 will be in the range of $2.56 to $2.86 per share and for the full year 2020 our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $9.70 to $10 compared with the prior outlook of $9.45 to $10. The 2020 full year estimated tax rate excluding discrete items is expected to be 22.7%; a 210 basis point increase compared to full year 2019 due in part to less R&D tax credits. In addition, we currently expect less discrete tax items in 2020 compared with 2019. I will now pass a call back to Robert."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later on, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Jason VanWees. Please go ahead.\nJason VanWees: Thank you, Laurie, and good morning everyone. This is Jason VanWees, Executive Vice President and I would like to welcome everyone to Teledyne's second quarter earnings release conference call. We released our earnings earlier this morning before the market opened. Joining me today are Teledyne's Executive Chairman, Robert Mehrabian; President and CEO, Al Pichelli; Senior Vice President and CFO, Sue Main; and SVP, General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, Melanie Cibik. After remarks by Robert, Al and Sue, we will ask for your questions. But of course, before we get started, our attorneys have reminded me to tell you that all forward-looking statements made this morning are subject to various assumptions, risks and caveats as noted in the earnings release and our periodic SEC filings. And of course, actual results may differ materially. In order to avoid potential selective disclosures, this call is simultaneously being webcast and a replay, both via webcast and dial-in will be available for approximately one month. Here is Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Jason. Good morning and thank you for joining our earnings call. Before discussing our results, I want to emphasize that all of our worldwide manufacturing sites, as well as our corporate office and research laboratory have been and remain operational. However because our priority remains the health and safety of our employees, we're continuing social distancing, enhanced cleaning protocols, the usage of facemasks, and Personal Protective Equipment. I shall now make a few comments about our performance in the current environment and our outlook for the remainder of 2020. Despite record economic contraction, and a challenging operating environment for manufacturers, Teledyne performed extremely well in the second quarter. Our results reflect aggressive cost control and disciplined execution. In fact, although sales decreased approximately 5% compared to both last year and the first quarter of 2020, overall GAAP operating margin increased sequentially 150 basis points. Teledyne's business portfolio remains exceptionally well balanced across end-markets and geographies. Also, our mix of line cycle and short cycle business provides a reasonable level of credit predictability, and helped us -- give us the confidence to provide our outlook in April. Looking back at the second quarter, the overall market and demand outlook played out as we had envisioned. In April, we predicted second quarter sales to decrease 5% year-over-year versus the actual results of negative 4.9%. That said demand for instrumentation was better than forecast, due to continued demand for test and measurement, protocol analyzers, and a record quarter for OakGate business, which was acquired in January. These product lines serve technology markets related to solid state storage and cloud networking, where capital spending remains relatively robust. On the other hand, digital imaging sales were slightly lower than forecast, not only in dental healthcare markets where weakness due to COVID-19 was expected, but we also saw temporary declines in surgery and cancer radiotherapy due to one, deferred patient treatments; two, our customers destocking; and three, fewer new OEM equipment installations in hospitals. Otherwise, everything else from a sales perspective essentially occurred as expected. More importantly, operating margin, earnings, and cash flow each exceeded our April expectations. Ongoing simplification of our processes and margin improvement actions, including progressive cost cutting in the first half of 2020 delivered superior results. Now, looking forward to the balance of 2020, we remain positive overall. Just as commercial sales to Asia improved late in the first quarter, we expect a recovery in sales in Europe and the Americas later this year. However, in light of the initiated shutdowns and travel restrictions, it is prudent to assume such recovery will begin in the fourth quarter. In other words, we expect the overall sales level in the third quarter to be very similar to Q2. As a result, we now expect 2020 full year's sales to be declined approximately 3% from 2019, with sales of instrumentation and imaging increasing sequentially in the fourth quarter, and Defense Electronics and Engineered Systems sales continuing to remain robust throughout the year. We're now forecasting a recovery in commercial -- we're not forecasting a recovery in commercial aerospace in 2020. However, this market will contribute less than 5% to our total revenue. Before returning to Al, to report on the second quarter performance by segment, I want to emphasize the following. First, as we have repeatedly demonstrated in the past, we know how to be disciplined and perform well in challenging environments. Second, in prior cycles, where revenue was challenged, we protected earnings, while at the same time increasing cash flow. For example, in 2009, when revenue declined 4%, GAAP earnings were flat and free cash flow increased over 50% from 2008 and was a record for Teledyne at the time. Likewise, in 2016, when total revenue declined 6%, GAAP earnings were flat and free cash flow again increased over 50% from 2015 and was again a record for Teledyne at the time. More importantly, in subsequent years, we kept our lower cost structure. Hence GAAP earnings nearly doubled over the subsequent three to four years. In addition, following some periods of general market weakness, due to Teledyne's strong balance sheet, we were able to complete our largest and best acquisitions. For example, we announced acquisition of Teledyne DALSA in 2010, and Teledyne e2v in 2016, both of which were our largest acquisitions on those days. Fast forward to 2020. We're aggressively managing variable costs as well as permanently reducing costs where appropriate. Our balance sheet is exceptionally strong with over $380 million of cash and cash equivalents and a borrowing capacity of over $1.2 billion. Al will now comment on the performance of our four business segments.\nAl Pichelli: Thank you, Robert. In our Instrumentation segment, overall second quarter sales were flat versus last year. Sales in marine instrumentation decreased 1.3% in the quarter. However, operating profit improved due to business simplification initiatives and improved pricing and procurement activities. As a reminder, while our marine includes products sold to the energy industry, we expect this market to directly account for just over a third of total marine sales in 2020 or approximately $150 million as annual revenue compared to almost $400 million in 2014. In the environmental domain, sales increased 7.9% as a result of our acquisition of the Gas and Flame Detection business. While sales of certain products such as medical grade oxygen sensors increased during the quarter, this could not offset declines in general and industrial markets, such as stack gas emissions monitoring and wastewater flow and sampling. Sales of the electronic test and measurement systems decreased 9.8%. While there was strength in our Protocol Solutions Group, sales of general purpose oscilloscopes declined year-over-year, especially in Europe and the U.S. Nevertheless, order trends and sales leads in Asia and Europe have improved in recent weeks. Overall, Instrumentation segment operating profit and margin were flat with last year despite $2.8 million in higher severance and facility consolidation costs. Turning to Digital Imaging segment, second quarter sales decreased 4.3% and primarily reflected lower sales for x-ray detectors for dental and medical applications, partially offset by greater sales of infrared detectors for the defense market. Sales of industrial vision systems were largely flat with last year. Our strength in semiconductor inspection end markets in Asia largely offset some weakness in Europe and North America. GAAP segment operating margin of 19.7% was the second highest quarterly margin ever achieved, but was 108 basis points below last year's all-time record of 20.8%. In the aerospace and defense electronics segment, second quarter sales declined 18.7% as greater defense sales were more than offset by a 49% decline in sales of commercial aerospace products as well as lower commercial space sales related to OneWeb. GAAP segment operating margin decreased due to lower sales but also over 340 basis points of charges for severance and facility consolidation. In the Engineered Systems segment, second quarter revenue increased 6.4% primarily due to greater sales from marine, nuclear and other manufacturing programs, as well as electronic manufacturing services. Segment operating profits increased 20% with margin of 123 basis points. I will now turn the call to Sue who will offer some additional commentary regarding the second quarter and our 2020 outlook.\nSue Main: Thank you, Al, and good morning everyone. I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and Al and then I will discuss our third quarter and full-year 2020 outlook. In the second quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $155.8 million compared with cash flow of $83.2 million for the same period of 2019. The cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter of 2020 reflected improved collection of accounts receivable and $33.4 million of deferred tax payments partially offset by lower operating income. Free cash flow that is cash from operating activities, less capital expenditures was $139.2 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared with $65.1 million in 2019. Capital expenditures were $16.6 million in the second quarter compared to $18.1 million for the same period of 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense was $29.0 million in the second quarter compared to $27.1 million for the same period of 2019. We ended the quarter with $468.6 million of net debt that is $851.4 million of debt less cash of $382.8 million for a net debt to capital ratio of 14.0%. Stock option compensation expense was $5.7 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared with $5.8 million in the second quarter of 2019. Turning to our outlook, management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the third quarter of 2020 will be in the range of $2.25 to $2.45 per share. And for the full-year 2020, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $9.45 to $10 compared with the prior outlook of $9.30 to $10. The 2020 full-year estimated tax rate excluding discrete items is expected to be 22.8%, a 220 basis point increase compared to full-year 2019 due in part to less R&D tax credits. In addition, we currently expect less discrete tax items in 2020 compared with 2019. Please note that the estimates for third quarter and full-year 2020 GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude any potential charge related to Airbus OneWeb Satellites. I will now pass the call back to Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Sue. We would like to take your questions now. Laurie, if you're ready to proceed with the questions and answers, please go ahead.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Greg Konrad from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nGreg Konrad: Just to start on margins, I mean it seems like you maybe took down the organic growth outlook a little bit in Q3, EPS are kind of flat. I mean should we think about similar margins in Q3 and then a ramp in Q4 and then what type of assumptions have you made in terms of one-timers in H2 whether it's restructuring or anything embedded in the margins?\nRobert Mehrabian: Sure, Greg. First, let's go back to Q2. The margin was 14.8%, the operating margin. We think in Q3, the margin is going to go up to -- up to about 15.4%. And we think in Q4 it'll go up further, so we should end the year at around 15% considering the first quarter was pretty low at 13.3%. So, we expect to have continuous improvement in margin. And forgive me, the second part of your question, had to do with?\nGreg Konrad: Just have you embedded any additional restructuring, you kind of called into?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes, I think Greg, sorry about that. We have about $19 million year-to-date. We are still reducing our workforce, we -- by the end of the second quarter we were down about 660 people. We expect by the end of the year to be down about a 1,000 out of 11,800 that's 8.5%, so it will be below 11,000 when the year ends. Consequently we think we'll have maybe another $4 million to $5 million of charges in Q3 and Q4 collectively; let's just say $5 million.\nGreg Konrad: And then you kind of called out digital imaging maybe being a little bit worse than expected, but Instrumentation a little bit better and kind of a ramp into Q4. I mean when we think about toward the end of the year is digital imaging maybe where there's the most opportunity to kind of see increases kind of as we exit the year?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. Let me -- the surprise in digital imaging was the following: the -- we expected that the dental market for our sensors to be down because people are not going to dentist in the current circumstances. What was a little surprising to us was that down slope in radiotherapy that cancer treatment and equipment services that we provide upgrades. What we found out was that in the cancer therapy, really most of the downside was because of people that would be tested for cancer or colon cancer or various types and that shrank quite a bit. Now, having said that we think that Q3 would be relatively flat with Q2 and we think that we'll have in others, maybe upwards of $20 million in Q4, primarily in digital imaging, as well as, I should say in Instrumentation. So collectively we expect those to do much better in Q4 than they did in Q2.\nGreg Konrad: And then just last one for me, I mean, free cash flows kind of running ahead of expectations, where you we kind of laid out last quarter. Any update there? And then kind of tied to that, you had mentioned M&A I mean, any change in terms of your near-term appetite and kind of what you're seeing in terms of opportunities?\nRobert Mehrabian: Let me start with the cash. I think in April, Greg, I mentioned that we expect that cash to be at the order of $375 million -- free cash flow to be at the order of $375 million for the year. I'm going to up that now to probably about $400 million, maybe a little more, but let's just say round numbers $400 million of free cash flow. In the current circumstances that would be a record for us. Last year, we had $394 million. So if we can exceed that that would be a record. Now, going back, as I mentioned in my comments, we have the capacity to buy things excluding acquired EBITDA of the order of $1.2 billion. Anything we buy is going to obviously have some EBITDA associated with it. So it could be higher depending on what we buy. I'm going to hazard a guess by the end of the year we may have as much as capacity as $1.5 billion. Having said that, there is the one acquisition that's been sitting out there for Photonis [ph] which the situation is still undecided. That would take up about $550 million, maybe a little more because of the change in the currency. And then we have appetite for other acquisitions. I hope significant ones in this environment just like we did with DALSA in 2010 and e2v in 2016. And in those economic conditions those businesses were not performing very well and we were able to acquire them at a reasonable price. So our appetite I think will improve with time as our cash position improves with time also.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jim Ricchiuti from Needham and Company. Please go ahead.\nJim Ricchiuti: Hi. Thank you. Maybe just to follow up on that comment, Robert, if you look at that M&A pipeline, are there areas in the business where you would like to focus more of the M&A activity, is in digital imaging or are there still opportunities for you to look at Instrumentation acquisitions as well?\nRobert Mehrabian: You're right on Jim, both areas. I think digital imaging, obviously Photonis would be a complementary acquisition, a really good complementary acquisition if were able to make it to Digital Imaging. On the other hand in the Instrumentation area, that's our second high margin business, and we would like to make acquisitions there too. So those are the two main areas as you noted.\nJim Ricchiuti: Okay. And maybe just in general terms how were these -- the booking trends in the quarter? Can you give us any color as to the book-to-bill and I assume there's been some variability in the book-to-bill in the different segments.\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. Let me start again -- let me go back to Q1, we had a really good book-to-bill in Q1. We were about 1.09% in Q1. In Q2, things went south. We dropped to about 0.85% so collectively we think we'll end the year just below 1%. Q3 should improve over Q2 and Q4 should be a little over 1%. We think we'll end the year by maybe 0.98% of that order. That includes pretty lumpy quarters especially in our Engineered Systems. So I think -- I think you have to take into consideration that our Aerospace business, the book-to-bill is pretty low because of the decline in that whole domain. In T&M and Instruments, I think Instruments in general in Q2, we're just a little north of 1% and we think Q3 would be 1% and Q4 would be 1%, so we should be okay there. Digital imaging, we should end up a little over 1%. With Aerospace and Defense, Defense will pick up, so we should be just under 1% when we end the year even with Aerospace being down and Engineered Systems is lumpy. So, I think it doesn't matter. It's going to be around 1% in the end.\nJim Ricchiuti: Okay. That's helpful. And Robert, maybe as a final question, just in light of the economic environment, you obviously have less visibility on the short cycle business, you do have line of sight in some of the other businesses. But as you look at the portfolio where is there potentially more uncertainty relative to that full year kind of revenue -- sales decline of 3% that we need to at least be mindful of?\nRobert Mehrabian: Well, I think you hit it on the head. We think that the declines would be most pronounced in Aerospace and Defense as has been. We think in Q3 for example that would be down about 20% and for the year it could be as much as 14.5%. I think where we have some risks is in the environmental instruments and some of our Test and Measurement so even though the protocol analyzers are doing really well. We're seeing some encouraging signs in early July as Al alluded to. It's early to tell, but I'm hopeful that some of the environmental and T&M as is beginning pick up in China will also pick up in Europe and subsequently in the U.S. But the danger really is has to do with environmental. Digital I think would be okay, because we've got a very diverse portfolio. We think throughout the year for the full-year we might be down a percent which is to me is acceptable especially since as we go along we're also improving margins in digital imaging. We think that by the end of the year the margin there will improve 130 basis points or so, so 1% decline is acceptable.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Joe Giordano from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.\nJoe Giordano: Hey, guys. How you are doing?\nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe Giordano: Can you talk about cost savings in the quarter and how you kind of characterize them? And how much was more structural in nature versus how much was more due to volume declines and temporary savings that may have to come back, back into the business as things start to pick up?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. The primary savings, Joe, come from people. We spent approximately $1.2 billion; $1.3 billion are people expense. What happened there is that we have turnover, so we haven't been replacing those folks except where we have really good strong orders and then we've cut folks. And so the big change for the year is in people and I think that savings rolling forward net of charges that we take could be as much as $40 million to $50 million. Now having said that, it is our sole intention to keep that low cost structure into next year as we've done previously. The other area of cost savings is we have very strong initiatives in procurement and we have a target of saving over $25 million in procurement this year and that is not savings because we're buying [indiscernible] savings because we're buying them at a lower cost here, because we're signing contracts with our favored suppliers. If we can get that done that will save us another $20 million. In terms of the 1,000 people that I mentioned, I'd say half of it was maybe because the market demand going down like at controls where market tanked to 50% of what it was. And the other half is really proactive on our part in reducing complexity in our operations and we intend to keep that and we've done that in prior years. We've kept our lower cost as we move forward. I hope that answers your question.\nJoe Giordano: It does. Thank you. I also wanted to ask on China. You said you're seeing some of the better signs there over the last couple of months. How would you characterize that as a -- how much of that is like a restock off of low levels versus actual pull through of real demand?\nRobert Mehrabian: I think its demand driven. It's not -- it's not as good as it was last year. But it's improved over the first two quarters. I think they -- the upside is that they have increased their back-to-work efforts. Having said that, China as a whole is only 8% of our total sales. So there's also improved demand beyond China, in Asia, overall, in Taiwan, in Korea, other places. So we see a continuing improvement in demand there and we're kind of projecting that will pick some that up in Europe first and then finally in the Americas.\nJoe Giordano: Great. And then maybe last for me. It sounds like you're looking pretty actively on M&A and you talked about what you are able to close on in prior downturns. I guess what color can you give us here? This is a weird downturn where economics of companies have gone down dramatically but prices of the businesses have not. So what are you seeing in terms of valuation and how people are thinking about selling their companies and what price they deserve?\nRobert Mehrabian: Well, that's an excellent question. Everybody looks in the rearview mirror, right, even though prices have not gone down as much as some of the piece have expanded over time. Those that have gone down, let's say by 30%, 40%, people keep looking back in the rearview mirror and say, that's the price that they deserve. Having said that, it's an opportune time; most of these companies have shareholders and shareholders have various degrees of patience and they're going to look in the rearview mirror as much as the management and the boards do. So I think there are going to be opportunities for us. There are opportunities for us. We may not be able to get something at the market price that it's trading at, but we're certainly not going to pay what they were a year ago. So we'll -- we're kind of searching our way through that opportunity list to see what's possible.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions].\nRobert Mehrabian: Lori, if there's nobody else asking a question, what I'd like to do is I'd like to end the call and ask Jason to conclude the conference call, please.\nJason VanWees: Thanks.

            "content": "Thank you, Robert. In our Instrumentation segment, overall second quarter sales were flat versus last year. Sales in marine instrumentation decreased 1.3% in the quarter. However, operating profit improved due to business simplification initiatives and improved pricing and procurement activities. As a reminder, while our marine includes products sold to the energy industry, we expect this market to directly account for just over a third of total marine sales in 2020 or approximately $150 million as annual revenue compared to almost $400 million in 2014. In the environmental domain, sales increased 7.9% as a result of our acquisition of the Gas and Flame Detection business. While sales of certain products such as medical grade oxygen sensors increased during the quarter, this could not offset declines in general and industrial markets, such as stack gas emissions monitoring and wastewater flow and sampling. Sales of the electronic test and measurement systems decreased 9.8%. While there was strength in our Protocol Solutions Group, sales of general purpose oscilloscopes declined year-over-year, especially in Europe and the U.S. Nevertheless, order trends and sales leads in Asia and Europe have improved in recent weeks. Overall, Instrumentation segment operating profit and margin were flat with last year despite $2.8 million in higher severance and facility consolidation costs. Turning to Digital Imaging segment, second quarter sales decreased 4.3% and primarily reflected lower sales for x-ray detectors for dental and medical applications, partially offset by greater sales of infrared detectors for the defense market. Sales of industrial vision systems were largely flat with last year. Our strength in semiconductor inspection end markets in Asia largely offset some weakness in Europe and North America. GAAP segment operating margin of 19.7% was the second highest quarterly margin ever achieved, but was 108 basis points below last year's all-time record of 20.8%. In the aerospace and defense electronics segment, second quarter sales declined 18.7% as greater defense sales were more than offset by a 49% decline in sales of commercial aerospace products as well as lower commercial space sales related to OneWeb. GAAP segment operating margin decreased due to lower sales but also over 340 basis points of charges for severance and facility consolidation. In the Engineered Systems segment, second quarter revenue increased 6.4% primarily due to greater sales from marine, nuclear and other manufacturing programs, as well as electronic manufacturing services. Segment operating profits increased 20% with margin of 123 basis points. I will now turn the call to Sue who will offer some additional commentary regarding the second quarter and our 2020 outlook."

            "name": "Robert Mehrabian",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason. Good morning and thank you for joining our earnings call. Before discussing our results, I want to emphasize that all of our worldwide manufacturing sites, as well as our corporate office and research laboratory have been and remain operational. However because our priority remains the health and safety of our employees, we're continuing social distancing, enhanced cleaning protocols, the usage of facemasks, and Personal Protective Equipment. I shall now make a few comments about our performance in the current environment and our outlook for the remainder of 2020. Despite record economic contraction, and a challenging operating environment for manufacturers, Teledyne performed extremely well in the second quarter. Our results reflect aggressive cost control and disciplined execution. In fact, although sales decreased approximately 5% compared to both last year and the first quarter of 2020, overall GAAP operating margin increased sequentially 150 basis points. Teledyne's business portfolio remains exceptionally well balanced across end-markets and geographies. Also, our mix of line cycle and short cycle business provides a reasonable level of credit predictability, and helped us -- give us the confidence to provide our outlook in April. Looking back at the second quarter, the overall market and demand outlook played out as we had envisioned. In April, we predicted second quarter sales to decrease 5% year-over-year versus the actual results of negative 4.9%. That said demand for instrumentation was better than forecast, due to continued demand for test and measurement, protocol analyzers, and a record quarter for OakGate business, which was acquired in January. These product lines serve technology markets related to solid state storage and cloud networking, where capital spending remains relatively robust. On the other hand, digital imaging sales were slightly lower than forecast, not only in dental healthcare markets where weakness due to COVID-19 was expected, but we also saw temporary declines in surgery and cancer radiotherapy due to one, deferred patient treatments; two, our customers destocking; and three, fewer new OEM equipment installations in hospitals. Otherwise, everything else from a sales perspective essentially occurred as expected. More importantly, operating margin, earnings, and cash flow each exceeded our April expectations. Ongoing simplification of our processes and margin improvement actions, including progressive cost cutting in the first half of 2020 delivered superior results. Now, looking forward to the balance of 2020, we remain positive overall. Just as commercial sales to Asia improved late in the first quarter, we expect a recovery in sales in Europe and the Americas later this year. However, in light of the initiated shutdowns and travel restrictions, it is prudent to assume such recovery will begin in the fourth quarter. In other words, we expect the overall sales level in the third quarter to be very similar to Q2. As a result, we now expect 2020 full year's sales to be declined approximately 3% from 2019, with sales of instrumentation and imaging increasing sequentially in the fourth quarter, and Defense Electronics and Engineered Systems sales continuing to remain robust throughout the year. We're now forecasting a recovery in commercial -- we're not forecasting a recovery in commercial aerospace in 2020. However, this market will contribute less than 5% to our total revenue. Before returning to Al, to report on the second quarter performance by segment, I want to emphasize the following. First, as we have repeatedly demonstrated in the past, we know how to be disciplined and perform well in challenging environments. Second, in prior cycles, where revenue was challenged, we protected earnings, while at the same time increasing cash flow. For example, in 2009, when revenue declined 4%, GAAP earnings were flat and free cash flow increased over 50% from 2008 and was a record for Teledyne at the time. Likewise, in 2016, when total revenue declined 6%, GAAP earnings were flat and free cash flow again increased over 50% from 2015 and was again a record for Teledyne at the time. More importantly, in subsequent years, we kept our lower cost structure. Hence GAAP earnings nearly doubled over the subsequent three to four years. In addition, following some periods of general market weakness, due to Teledyne's strong balance sheet, we were able to complete our largest and best acquisitions. For example, we announced acquisition of Teledyne DALSA in 2010, and Teledyne e2v in 2016, both of which were our largest acquisitions on those days. Fast forward to 2020. We're aggressively managing variable costs as well as permanently reducing costs where appropriate. Our balance sheet is exceptionally strong with over $380 million of cash and cash equivalents and a borrowing capacity of over $1.2 billion. Al will now comment on the performance of our four business segments. Thank you, Sue. We would like to take your questions now. Laurie, if you're ready to proceed with the questions and answers, please go ahead. Sure, Greg. First, let's go back to Q2. The margin was 14.8%, the operating margin. We think in Q3, the margin is going to go up to -- up to about 15.4%. And we think in Q4 it'll go up further, so we should end the year at around 15% considering the first quarter was pretty low at 13.3%. So, we expect to have continuous improvement in margin. And forgive me, the second part of your question, had to do with? Yes, I think Greg, sorry about that. We have about $19 million year-to-date. We are still reducing our workforce, we -- by the end of the second quarter we were down about 660 people. We expect by the end of the year to be down about a 1,000 out of 11,800 that's 8.5%, so it will be below 11,000 when the year ends. Consequently we think we'll have maybe another $4 million to $5 million of charges in Q3 and Q4 collectively; let's just say $5 million. Yes. Let me -- the surprise in digital imaging was the following: the -- we expected that the dental market for our sensors to be down because people are not going to dentist in the current circumstances. What was a little surprising to us was that down slope in radiotherapy that cancer treatment and equipment services that we provide upgrades. What we found out was that in the cancer therapy, really most of the downside was because of people that would be tested for cancer or colon cancer or various types and that shrank quite a bit. Now, having said that we think that Q3 would be relatively flat with Q2 and we think that we'll have in others, maybe upwards of $20 million in Q4, primarily in digital imaging, as well as, I should say in Instrumentation. So collectively we expect those to do much better in Q4 than they did in Q2. Let me start with the cash. I think in April, Greg, I mentioned that we expect that cash to be at the order of $375 million -- free cash flow to be at the order of $375 million for the year. I'm going to up that now to probably about $400 million, maybe a little more, but let's just say round numbers $400 million of free cash flow. In the current circumstances that would be a record for us. Last year, we had $394 million. So if we can exceed that that would be a record. Now, going back, as I mentioned in my comments, we have the capacity to buy things excluding acquired EBITDA of the order of $1.2 billion. Anything we buy is going to obviously have some EBITDA associated with it. So it could be higher depending on what we buy. I'm going to hazard a guess by the end of the year we may have as much as capacity as $1.5 billion. Having said that, there is the one acquisition that's been sitting out there for Photonis [ph] which the situation is still undecided. That would take up about $550 million, maybe a little more because of the change in the currency. And then we have appetite for other acquisitions. I hope significant ones in this environment just like we did with DALSA in 2010 and e2v in 2016. And in those economic conditions those businesses were not performing very well and we were able to acquire them at a reasonable price. So our appetite I think will improve with time as our cash position improves with time also. You're right on Jim, both areas. I think digital imaging, obviously Photonis would be a complementary acquisition, a really good complementary acquisition if were able to make it to Digital Imaging. On the other hand in the Instrumentation area, that's our second high margin business, and we would like to make acquisitions there too. So those are the two main areas as you noted. Yes. Let me start again -- let me go back to Q1, we had a really good book-to-bill in Q1. We were about 1.09% in Q1. In Q2, things went south. We dropped to about 0.85% so collectively we think we'll end the year just below 1%. Q3 should improve over Q2 and Q4 should be a little over 1%. We think we'll end the year by maybe 0.98% of that order. That includes pretty lumpy quarters especially in our Engineered Systems. So I think -- I think you have to take into consideration that our Aerospace business, the book-to-bill is pretty low because of the decline in that whole domain. In T&M and Instruments, I think Instruments in general in Q2, we're just a little north of 1% and we think Q3 would be 1% and Q4 would be 1%, so we should be okay there. Digital imaging, we should end up a little over 1%. With Aerospace and Defense, Defense will pick up, so we should be just under 1% when we end the year even with Aerospace being down and Engineered Systems is lumpy. So, I think it doesn't matter. It's going to be around 1% in the end. Well, I think you hit it on the head. We think that the declines would be most pronounced in Aerospace and Defense as has been. We think in Q3 for example that would be down about 20% and for the year it could be as much as 14.5%. I think where we have some risks is in the environmental instruments and some of our Test and Measurement so even though the protocol analyzers are doing really well. We're seeing some encouraging signs in early July as Al alluded to. It's early to tell, but I'm hopeful that some of the environmental and T&M as is beginning pick up in China will also pick up in Europe and subsequently in the U.S. But the danger really is has to do with environmental. Digital I think would be okay, because we've got a very diverse portfolio. We think throughout the year for the full-year we might be down a percent which is to me is acceptable especially since as we go along we're also improving margins in digital imaging. We think that by the end of the year the margin there will improve 130 basis points or so, so 1% decline is acceptable. Good morning, Joe. Yes. The primary savings, Joe, come from people. We spent approximately $1.2 billion; $1.3 billion are people expense. What happened there is that we have turnover, so we haven't been replacing those folks except where we have really good strong orders and then we've cut folks. And so the big change for the year is in people and I think that savings rolling forward net of charges that we take could be as much as $40 million to $50 million. Now having said that, it is our sole intention to keep that low cost structure into next year as we've done previously. The other area of cost savings is we have very strong initiatives in procurement and we have a target of saving over $25 million in procurement this year and that is not savings because we're buying [indiscernible] savings because we're buying them at a lower cost here, because we're signing contracts with our favored suppliers.

And the other half is really proactive on our part in reducing complexity in our operations and we intend to keep that and we've done that in prior years.

So there's also improved demand beyond China, in Asia, overall, in Taiwan, in Korea, other places. So we see a continuing improvement in demand there and we're kind of projecting that will pick some that up in Europe first and then finally in the Americas. Well, that's an excellent question.

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and Al and then I will discuss our third quarter and full-year 2020 outlook. In the second quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $155.8 million compared with cash flow of $83.2 million for the same period of 2019. The cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter of 2020 reflected improved collection of accounts receivable and $33.4 million of deferred tax payments partially offset by lower operating income. Free cash flow that is cash from operating activities, less capital expenditures was $139.2 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared with $65.1 million in 2019. Capital expenditures were $16.6 million in the second quarter compared to $18.1 million for the same period of 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense was $29.0 million in the second quarter compared to $27.1 million for the same period of 2019. We ended the quarter with $468.6 million of net debt that is $851.4 million of debt less cash of $382.8 million for a net debt to capital ratio of 14.0%. Stock option compensation expense was $5.7 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared with $5.8 million in the second quarter of 2019. Turning to our outlook, management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the third quarter of 2020 will be in the range of $2.25 to $2.45 per share. And for the full-year 2020, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $9.45 to $10 compared with the prior outlook of $9.30 to $10. The 2020 full-year estimated tax rate excluding discrete items is expected to be 22.8%, a 220 basis point increase compared to full-year 2019 due in part to less R&D tax credits. In addition, we currently expect less discrete tax items in 2020 compared with 2019. Please note that the estimates for third quarter and full-year 2020 GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude any potential charge related to Airbus OneWeb Satellites. I will now pass the call back to Robert."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Jason VanWees. Please go ahead.\nJason VanWees: Great. Thank you very Greg. Good morning everyone. This is Jason VanWees, Executive Vice President and I like to welcome everyone to Teledyne's first quarter 2020 earnings release conference call. We released our earnings earlier this morning before the market opened. Joining me today are Teledyne's Executive Chairman, Robert Mehrabian, President and CEO, Al Pichelli, Senior Vice President and CFO, Sue Main and Senior Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, Melanie Cibik. After remarks by Robert, Al and Sue, we will ask for your questions. However, before we get started, our attorneys have reminded me to tell you that all forward-looking statements made this morning are subject to various assumptions, risks and caveats as noted in the earnings release and our periodic SEC filings. And of course, actual results may differ materially. In order to avoid potential selective disclosures, this call is simultaneously being webcast and a replay, both via webcast and dial in, will be available for approximately one month. Here is Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Jason. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our earnings calls. Before discussing our results and outlook, I want to talk very briefly about our people, our response to COVID-19 and our business portfolio as a whole. Our first priority remains the health and safety of our employees and the family. Employees use tasks can be done outside have been instructed to work from home. And currently, up to 40% of our total personnel are working remotely. Our corporate office has been and remains open, and all of our 70 manufacturing sites worldwide are operational. But we're maintaining social distancing, enhanced cleaning protocols and usage of personal protective equipment where appropriate. Our businesses can remain open because they serve critical infrastructure sectors, such as the defense industrial base, water and wastewater, health care and public health. Teledyne's business portfolio also remains exceptionally well balanced across end markets and geographies. In addition, approximately one half of our businesses are longer cycle, more predictable and supported by record ending -- quarter ending backlog. Looking back to the first quarter, we did not suffer any widespread reduction in customer demand. In fact, orders actually the sales in each month including March and quarter end backlog was a record at approximately 1.8 billion. Likewise, we did not incur any significant negative impact to our supply chain. Nevertheless, there were some first quarter operational challenges in manufacturing and chirping product due to our policy of maintaining appropriate employee density at the workplace, balancing employee absenteeism and the availability of our customers to accept product. These are operational and HR matters along with some demand and supply chain issues likely reduced our first quarter revenue by approximately $15 million. Nevertheless, organic sales growth was positive and overall first quarter revenue increased 5.3% from last year. GAAP earnings increased 7.4%. And despite $10.4 million of pre tax charges, GAAP operating margin also increased. Finally, revenue, earnings and operating margin were all records for any first quarter period. Now looking forward, to the second quarter and the full year. Operational challenges in context in the first quarter remain. However, there is no uncertainty regarding customer demand in the 50% of Teledyne businesses that are shorter cycles and generally tied to corporate capital expenditures and the global economy as a whole. In addition, some end markets such as commercial aviation, although just 6% of sales in the first quarter will be impacted beyond the next few quarters and 2020. While many other industrial companies have withdrawn to 2020 earnings guidance, our total company has a relatively and I emphasize relatively high degree of predictability and stability. Nevertheless, in the current environment, we find it prudent to both lower and widen our prior expectations for revenue and earnings that we provided in our January 22, 2020. Our current outlook is based on the following assumptions. First, at the lower end of our earnings range in the second quarter, we've assumed overall revenue contraction of approximately 6% as well as year-over-year declines in each of quarter three and quarter four, although moderating by year end. This would result in an overall full year-over-year revenue decline of approximately 2%. Second, at the high end of our earnings range in the second quarter we have assumed overall revenue contraction of approximately 4%, more about this contraction in Q3, flat year-over-year sales in Q4. This would result in roughly flat year-over-year overall sales. And by segment for instrumentation, which is our shortest cycle business group, we expect an overall revenue change in the second quarter ranging from negative 5% to flat. At the midpoint of our outlook range, we expect full year's segment sales to be flat, including incremental sales contribution of about $60 million from Gas and Flame and OakGate acquisition. We expect digital imaging to be more resilient, as nearly half of the segment serves defense based healthcare and scientific market. This segment also has greater exposure to \"back at work\" customers in Asia, plus, given a weaker 2019 in those digital imaging businesses serving semiconductor inspection and factory automation, we have an easier comparison in 2020, hence, we expect to achieve positive or these low single-digit segments full year's sales growth. In the other two segments, that is aerospace and defense electronics and engineering systems, we continue to see our defense businesses in this segment growing at mid-single digit rates, perhaps even high single digit despite the ongoing operations related challenges mentioned previously. However, we are forecasting a collapse in commercial aviation in the aerospace portion of our aerospace and defense electronic segment. While less than 6% of our total sales in the first quarter we're expecting a 40% plus year-over-year decline in commercial aviation due to both significant air transport OEM and aftermarket declines. As a result, we expect total year-over-year segment sales to decrease approximately $90 million. Before turning to Al to report on the first quarter performance by segment, I want to emphasize the following. We do not know the depth and duration of the economic decline or the pace of the recovery. But as we have repeatedly shown in the past, we know how to be disciplined and perform well in challenging environments. We are aggressively managing variable costs, CapEx and cash flow and quickly and permanently reducing costs where a prolonged non-cycle is anticipated, such as in aviation. Finally, our balance sheet is exceptionally strong with over 230 million of cash and cash equivalents, more than 600 million available under our credit facility maturing in 2024. Given our ample liquidity and the resilience of our business portfolio, we continue to review and pursue acquisition opportunities. Al will now comment on the performance of our four business segments followed by Sue Main, who will give further financial details and present our outlook. Al?\nAl Pichelli: Thank you, Robert. In our instrumentation segment, overall first quarter sales increased 11.2% from last year. Sales in marine instrumentation increased 3.9% organically in the quarter. Backlog continues to grow and it was at the highest levels in early 2015. In addition, operating profits improved significantly. As a reminder, while marine includes products sold in the energy industry, we expect this market to directly account for just over one-third of total marine sales in 2020, or approximately 150 million of annual revenue compared to almost 400 million in 2014. In the environmental domain, sales increased 26.5% as a result of our acquisition of the Gas and Flame Detection business. In addition, we achieved organic sales growth of certain laboratory instrumentation products, but this was offset by lower sales of other industrial instruments. Sales of electronic test and measurement systems increased 2.5% due to the acquisition of OakGate. Nevertheless, organic sales were flat given continued strong demand for our protocol test instrumentation. Overall instrumentation segment operating profits increased 27.3% in the first quarter, and margin increased 226 basis points with margins increasing for test and measurement and marine instrumentation. Excluding the Gas and Flame Detection acquisition and related purchase accounting margin was flat for environmental instrumentation. Turning to the digital imaging segment, first quarter sales increased 6.2% and included higher sales of infrared detectors for defense applications, MEMS products and x ray detectors for life sciences. Sales of all machine vision products collectively decreased slightly, but nevertheless stabilized with improved orders and sales for advanced instruction camera systems. GAAP segment operating profit increased 19.7% and margin increased 201 basis points, generally as a result of the increase in sales volume. In the aerospace and defense electronics segment, first quarter sales decreased 6.2% as positive 9% growth in sales of defense electronics was more than offset by a 35% decline in sales of commercial aerospace products. GAAP segment operating margin decreased due to lower aerospace sales, but also 525 basis points of charges for severance facility consolidations and certain contract cost adjustments. In the engineering system segment, first quarter revenue increased 7.6% with greater sales related to marine, space and nuclear programs, as well as electronic manufacturing and turbine engines partially offset by lower sales from missile defense programs. Segment operating profits increased 460 basis points, largely due to higher sales and greater mix of higher margin manufacturing programs. I will now turn the call to Sue, who will offer some additional commentary regarding the first quarter and our 2020 outlook.\nSue Main: Thank you, Al, and good morning, everyone. I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and Al, and then I will discuss our second quarter and full year 2020 outlook. In the first quarter cash flow from operating activities was $76.4 million, compared with cash flow of $80.1 million for the same period of 2019. The cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of 2020 reflected the timing of accounts receivable collections, partially offset by the impact of higher operating income, lower income tax payments and incremental cash flow from recent acquisitions. Free cash flow that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures was $56.2 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared with $58.8 million in 2019. Capital expenditures were $20.2 million in the first quarter compared to $21.3 million for the same period of 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense was $29.3 million in the first quarter compared to $27.6 million for the same period of 2019. We ended the quarter with $618.3 million of net debt that is $849.7 million of debt less cash of $231.4 million for net debt to capital ratio of 18.3%. Stock option compensation expense was $7.4 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared with $8.9 million in the first quarter of 2019. Turning to our outlook, management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the second quarter of 2020 will be in the range of $1.90 to $2.05 per share. And for the full year 2020, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $9.30 to $10. The 2020 full year estimated tax rate excluding discrete items is expected to be 22.8% a 220 basis point increase compared to full year 2019 due in part to less R&D tax credits. In addition, we currently expect significantly less discrete tax items in 2020 compared with 2019. Please note that the estimates for second quarter and full year 2020 GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude any future potential charge related to Airbus OneWeb Satellites. I will now pass the call back to Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Sue. Greg, if you're ready to proceed taking question and answers, please go ahead.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Greg Konrad. Please go ahead.\nGreg Konrad: Good morning. I just wanted to start with something that's maybe a little more topical. I think there was a release out last week on thermal cameras for non-contact fever screening. How big of an opportunity is that and what type of interest are you getting just kind of what's going on in the world?\nRobert Mehrabian: Hi, Greg. Good morning to you also. The cameras are long wavelength infrared cameras. They're made with our own sensors produced on a wafer level packaging. They are 640 by 480 of 17 micron pixel size. And we're just beginning the manufacturing of those cameras, as we announced. We are getting interest from a large number of manufacturers. And while it's still speculative, we're positively motivated to increase production of those cameras. So how big an opportunity it is too early to tell.\nGreg Konrad: Thanks. And then, I mean you kind of talked about the size of the oil and gas market within marine, but given oil price fluctuations and CapEx rationalization on the part of customers. I mean, have you seen any change to expectations or push out of shipments in that market?\nRobert Mehrabian: Not yet. The short answer is not yet. But I have to put that in perspective. The Marine businesses today are really we expecting the midpoint to be over $425 million. Only 150 of that or 35% about is in offshore oil exploration, offshore oil production and very little on land oil. So, most of our marine businesses we already see 65% is in defense, construction and other areas. Going back to the oil and gas, we do have good orders so far for the year. It's over 1, it's 1.1 and we don't see any cancellations yet. Having said that, that's in the oil production. In the oil exploration, we're seeing a little bit of softening, but in our orders, and considering the price of crude and what's happened to Brent, we think that we expect to have some softening later in the year. So we're taking that into consideration in our guidance, but the good part is, there is a good part to this for us versus 2014, when oil collapsed in '15 and '16, is that at that time, the majority of our marine sales were in oil and gas, today it's only 35%.\nGreg Konrad: Thanks. And then, just last one for me. Can you update us on expectations for margins for the year and given your report on a GAAP basis and had some restructuring in Q1. Do you have any other restructuring contemplated in the guidance for the rest of the year?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. So let me start from the latter part of your question, which is do I expect more restructuring? In the first quarter we had about $0.21 of restructuring. We were doing a little cost stakeout right now in the second quarter. And we expect that if things don't change get worse, we'll have to take some more out. We think that overall for the year, including first quarter can range between $0.40 and $0.50; $0.40 on the on the lower side. The margin effect is very interesting. Our margins weigh on the midpoint, we will always work with the midpoint of our guidance, which would get would be about 965 in earnings in EPS and about [3140] [ph] in revenue. Stay with that. With those numbers, I think instruments margin in the instrument segment should increase slightly maybe as much as 15 basis points. Digital Imaging year-over-year, we believe margins can go as high as 90 basis points above last year. In the aerospace and defense, very different issue. Defense is going to do okay. But aerospace is going to be done significantly and that's one of our highest margin businesses, so we think margins year-over-year would go down as much as 700 basis points. Engineering systems will go up probably 75 to 80 basis points. So overall segments will go down because of aerospace primarily, a little over 100 basis points and maybe 110. But we have cost control in the corporate domain. So, overall in the midpoint we think margins can go down as much as 80 basis points. But that, of course, is preliminary data on everything we know right now.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Ricchiuti. Please go ahead.\nJim Ricchiuti: Thank you. Good morning, and thanks for the detailed outlook. I'm not sure there are many companies in a position to offer that in this environment. Question I had Robert was regarding the defense business. There have been at least we're seeing more reports of supply chain disruptions in the defense market. And I guess what I'm wondering is, is there any potential risk as you look at that business in the second half, where there could be an issue for you or even the broader government business, normally have a pretty good line of sight there.\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. There are -- we are seeing a little disruption right now, especially in our printed circuit board -- specialized printed circuit board supply chain. The flip side of it is why we have hiccups. We have a very strong procurement initiative underway that started two years ago, actually to reduce procurement costs and they're shifting their emphasis to working with our suppliers to ensure that we do have a reasonable supply chain. Hiccups yes, I expect that we'll have more, so far nothing very serious. What's been troubling on the defense side is that availability of some of our customers to approve product that we're delivering to them. For example, just a simple example, in our shadow water combat submersibles, which are the boats we make for the Special Ops. We'd have the boat ready to test but because of the restrictions -- COVID's restrictions, our divers and the government divers can't test them. So they can't take delivery completely without getting paid completely. So there's those kinds of things happening all over. But, going back to something I said, Jim earlier, we know how to deal with these issues. We've done it before. We did it in 2015, '16, when oil collapse, we did in 2008 and 2009, in the financial crisis. So we're taking this into consideration with our guidance.\nJim Ricchiuti: Got it and thanks. The question on the industrial machine vision business. You talk about stability, it sounds like you're seeing some pick up, maybe on the semi side. I'm just wondering, is this more of a case of easier comparisons? Or is there some improvement that you're seeing in some of these markets, including the factory automation, which seems a little surprising, but just curious about that?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. Let me start with the first part which is last year, we had, this is one of those cases that -- good case is usually we say things like, we have a tough comps, or we try. Last year, semiconductor and factory automation really in general relatively weak. So our comps this year as last year are better. Let me start there. We think machine vision, this mission vision systems part of our overall digital imaging should be flat this year. We think overall digital imaging will increase. But I think the vision system will be flat and there's some good gives and takes. Our flat panel display orders are pretty good right now. Our scientific cameras are doing well. Semis catching up, we do have some incremental sales from acquisitions that we made the site cam from Roper and micro line in Canada, which makes MEMS products. So we think some of the other stuff is going to do well. Our aerospace and defense businesses in machine vision are doing well and we expect them to continue. So overall, I'm going to say the semi factory automation, we are lucky because last year, we had such weak revenue so the comps are easier. The others we've done okay.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano. Please go ahead.\nJoe Giordano: So, Robert, for businesses like commercial aerospace and energy which are like more -- obviously much more challenged now. You're taking actions. There seems to be kind of debate or confusion around when these things actually bottom. So like, are these markets now given what's happening in the time it takes to kind of flow through, are these markets that are likely worse than '21 than they are in '20? Or is this something that -- how do you characterize the likelihood of recovery in these markets over the next 12 to 24 months.\nRobert Mehrabian: Let me start with energy first, if I may. As I mentioned before, on the oil and gas part of our business is about $150 million and it's less than 5% of our revenues today. In that market, the products that we make lag the overall market that is, our orders presently are good and will continue for the next two quarters. We think it will soften in Q4. So while the primes are suffering today, I think our suffering will come a little later. The same happens with the recovery if the recovery come, which would obviously depend on the overall economy. We will be lagging the recovery. Having said all of that, in the overall marine businesses, which we kind of look at it as our energy businesses, we have really strong programs in the defense area, both vehicles and other areas like mine confirmations, et cetera. So, we see some downside for us. Recovery as to -- we need to bottom, I don't know. But I think recovery for us will come later. And we've all suffered the consequences of the current downturn perhaps later in the year. Going to commercial aerospace, I can't guess it. Right now, it's -- again, we're lucky. It's 6% of our sales, we have $90 million decline that we're projecting from last year to this year from about 211 to 120 or so. And again, we also there also lag the market after the 911 in 2001. Aviation didn't really recover until 2003. So that was a two year hiatus and we suffered the consequences of that. So, if that's an indication of how long is probably before things start turning up, it'd be another two years before we see a recovery. And frankly, that's the way we're treating these businesses. We are taking cost out, Joe permanently. And barley we've taken almost 20% of our folks out in that business a plus the other people are on furlough and other things. So the long answer is, the recoveries in both segments, the aerospace should be longer timeframe than energy in my view. We won't suffer much from the energy, we are taking hit from the deviation.\nJoe Giordano: Now that's clear, and it's very helpful. On the free cash flow side, can you talk about your expectations for the year? I mean, let's not -- you could strip out the potential for OneWeb write downs and things like that? But just outside of that, how do you looking at your working capital performance outlook for the year and when you think about a conversion? Will you guys be able to kind of accelerate cash -- bringing cash in as you kind of liquidate backlog and things like that this year?\nRobert Mehrabian: Let me start by saying, because obviously, we're lowering our earnings right now. So our free cash should be a little lower than last year. Last year, we had about $400 million. We think this year it'd be about 375, maybe even a little less. Having said that, we are taking very strong action now to reduce our inventories across our businesses, how successful it'd be will depend on how well we execute. If we do all the things that we've laid off, out to do, we might keep last year's free cash flow. But, the other thing that happened is, if you look at 2009 versus 2008. In 2008, free cash flow was fairly low; it was like $111 million. In 2009, when we came out of it, our free cash flow grew almost double to $190 million. The same thing happened in the '15 ,'16 timeframe. Free cash flow went from 160 million in 2015 to 250 million in 2016. So, the answer is this. I think we do okay, this year if we execute, we'll be around 375 maybe a little better. But if history is a lesson, we'll come out at this much stronger next year because of our ability to discipline. Our CapEx is going to be lower this year than last year; Al is kind of controlling that almost project by project justification. So I think we should be alright. And we do have cash in the bank.\nJoe Giordano: And maybe last for me. Can you just touch a little bit more on what you're seeing out of China for the respective businesses like test and measurement and some of the environmental businesses there?\nRobert Mehrabian: Okay. Let me, if I may Joe, you didn't ask it, but I think in the machine vision business things because of this back to work \"framework\". We also in the machine -- but in machine vision, health care products, we're doing okay there. In the test and measurement, we're lagging a little bit. On the other hand, our protocol in our test and measurement businesses had two legs to it. One of is oscilloscope and affiliated systems for looking at electronics hardware. The other part, the protocols, which are the standards by which in digital imaging systems communicate that area we're doing really well, both here and in China. And so I think our T&M, test and measurement, while we expect it to be essentially flat this year, it's probably going to be a little down because of what we do of acquisition there. So it we might be done 3% or 4%. But China is not our problem. Our problem is really right now is Europe and North America. Moving to environmental, that's a different story. We're seeing some compression there in China, two reasons. One, we make a lot of product that go in air quality monitoring, and measurements of air quality, continuous monitoring as well as measurement. And we see weaknesses there. The second thing, which is a little even more troubling, is the Chinese government emphasis that Chinese companies buy Chinese made product. That's not as much discussed in the United States. We've had initiatives like Buy America initiatives previously, but there's a strong emphasis there to do that. And frankly, I don't mind assembling products there. I don't want to manufacture products there because of other issues. So we are seeing some compression there and that's a little worrisome, but we do have new products and we will compete with everybody and we get our share of the market in that business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Can you take it into the thermal sensor for the skin application, skin temperature monitoring? And that, again, I don't know if you guys have talked about this much before. So can you remind us kind of where you fall on the spectrum of your capabilities for that? That's, is it a handheld scanner? Is it something that could scan crowds or just maybe a little more details on that? And then secondly, how fast do you think you can ramp production given all the supply chain issues?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. Let me start with the latter part of the question, Andrew, if I may. As I mentioned, unlike other companies that are making such devices, we make the sensors ourselves in our MEMS foundry in Canada in Bromont. And we make it on a wafer level packaging scale. So, we are our own supply chain. So that's the good part. The cameras are called Caliber. And we've been making various versions of the Caliber camera for about a year or longer. The ones that we're talking about are handheld, they're our newest product. They've just been manufactured. I cannot tell you how fast we can grow that, but obviously, we're going to do our best to increase production as fast as we can. Our cameras are also -- lastly, the sensors that we use that we make are vanadium oxide based sensors, really nice sensors 17 micron pixels whereas a lot of the other products around the world are made from amorphous silicon. So we think we have a niche there. I know there are some other companies that have had really a ton of publicity because of this domain. I don't know whether this is kind of move the needle in $3.2 billion revenue company.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. Can you talk about the potential Photonis acquisition, the rationale behind it and where do you sit with the French Ministry in getting that approved?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. Let me start with the rationale. That's it, that's easy one. Photonis primarily makes night vision product for the war fighters. And they do it for almost the rest of the world that has to have an ITAR-free product whereas our two companies in this country don't have ITAR restrictions. The second part that there is business related, again, is in life sciences, but 80% of the business is in defense. Now, what they do have is a very nice product, nice processes, but what they have lacked because they've been supportive by private equity, what they've lacked is the ability to significantly invest or acquire digital imaging companies that would complement it. Almost everything we do in our digital imaging is complimentary to what they have, including the infrared sensors I just mentioned. So we think we will, and digitization is obviously the future of that domain as well. So we think we made some significant capabilities to that product. Now, where are we? Unfortunately, on March 31, we were verbally notified that the Foreign Investment Office of France that they were going to have a negative opinion by the Minister of Economy, essentially saying there is going to be total transaction. Everything has gone quite since then. There are some indications that the Minister of Economy may be reconsidering. We don't know. Ultimately, one or two scenarios can develop. They will reaffirm the verbal detail. We have a written response from them because our agreement with the people we're buying it from is such that everything is in escrow until a final decision has been made. So once we get a written agreement would be one of the following. Either they'll reject it, which is same as their verbal, or they'll come back and agree to a transaction but put certain conditions on it. Now, we are used to certain conditions because we bought two businesses in France, would have operations in France. First, e2v be which we bought several years ago, last year, we bought Gas and Flame Detection business from 3M. In both those cases, there were certain conditions in terms of because they were supplying product to the French government, et cetera, in terms of how long we kept the businesses, et cetera. And we agreed to those conditions because frankly, they were also in our best interest. So we have a really good relationship with the Ministry of Economy and his offices in that domain, and we have a good track record with them. So if the conditions are not honored, they could be onerous, then we could live with it. On the other hand, if the conditions are onerous that would damage our ability to run the company, then we won't be able to complete the transaction. So that's a long way of giving you the best answer I have. And we expect to hear from them. I don't know it could be shortly or it could be a couple of months.\nOperator: There are no further questions.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you. And if I may, I'll ask Jason now to conclude our conference call. Jason?\nJason VanWees: Great. Thank you, Robert. And again, thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning.

            "name": "Al Pichelli",
            "content": "Thank you, Robert. In our instrumentation segment, overall first quarter sales increased 11.2% from last year. Sales in marine instrumentation increased 3.9% organically in the quarter. Backlog continues to grow and it was at the highest levels in early 2015. In addition, operating profits improved significantly. As a reminder, while marine includes products sold in the energy industry, we expect this market to directly account for just over one-third of total marine sales in 2020, or approximately 150 million of annual revenue compared to almost 400 million in 2014. In the environmental domain, sales increased 26.5% as a result of our acquisition of the Gas and Flame Detection business. In addition, we achieved organic sales growth of certain laboratory instrumentation products, but this was offset by lower sales of other industrial instruments. Sales of electronic test and measurement systems increased 2.5% due to the acquisition of OakGate. Nevertheless, organic sales were flat given continued strong demand for our protocol test instrumentation. Overall instrumentation segment operating profits increased 27.3% in the first quarter, and margin increased 226 basis points with margins increasing for test and measurement and marine instrumentation. Excluding the Gas and Flame Detection acquisition and related purchase accounting margin was flat for environmental instrumentation. Turning to the digital imaging segment, first quarter sales increased 6.2% and included higher sales of infrared detectors for defense applications, MEMS products and x ray detectors for life sciences. Sales of all machine vision products collectively decreased slightly, but nevertheless stabilized with improved orders and sales for advanced instruction camera systems. GAAP segment operating profit increased 19.7% and margin increased 201 basis points, generally as a result of the increase in sales volume. In the aerospace and defense electronics segment, first quarter sales decreased 6.2% as positive 9% growth in sales of defense electronics was more than offset by a 35% decline in sales of commercial aerospace products. GAAP segment operating margin decreased due to lower aerospace sales, but also 525 basis points of charges for severance facility consolidations and certain contract cost adjustments. In the engineering system segment, first quarter revenue increased 7.6% with greater sales related to marine, space and nuclear programs, as well as electronic manufacturing and turbine engines partially offset by lower sales from missile defense programs. Segment operating profits increased 460 basis points, largely due to higher sales and greater mix of higher margin manufacturing programs. I will now turn the call to Sue, who will offer some additional commentary regarding the first quarter and our 2020 outlook."

            "name": "Robert Mehrabian",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our earnings calls. Before discussing our results and outlook, I want to talk very briefly about our people, our response to COVID-19 and our business portfolio as a whole. Our first priority remains the health and safety of our employees and the family. Employees use tasks can be done outside have been instructed to work from home. And currently, up to 40% of our total personnel are working remotely. Our corporate office has been and remains open, and all of our 70 manufacturing sites worldwide are operational. But we're maintaining social distancing, enhanced cleaning protocols and usage of personal protective equipment where appropriate. Our businesses can remain open because they serve critical infrastructure sectors, such as the defense industrial base, water and wastewater, health care and public health. Teledyne's business portfolio also remains exceptionally well balanced across end markets and geographies. In addition, approximately one half of our businesses are longer cycle, more predictable and supported by record ending -- quarter ending backlog. Looking back to the first quarter, we did not suffer any widespread reduction in customer demand. In fact, orders actually the sales in each month including March and quarter end backlog was a record at approximately 1.8 billion. Likewise, we did not incur any significant negative impact to our supply chain. Nevertheless, there were some first quarter operational challenges in manufacturing and chirping product due to our policy of maintaining appropriate employee density at the workplace, balancing employee absenteeism and the availability of our customers to accept product. These are operational and HR matters along with some demand and supply chain issues likely reduced our first quarter revenue by approximately $15 million. Nevertheless, organic sales growth was positive and overall first quarter revenue increased 5.3% from last year. GAAP earnings increased 7.4%. And despite $10.4 million of pre tax charges, GAAP operating margin also increased. Finally, revenue, earnings and operating margin were all records for any first quarter period. Now looking forward, to the second quarter and the full year. Operational challenges in context in the first quarter remain. However, there is no uncertainty regarding customer demand in the 50% of Teledyne businesses that are shorter cycles and generally tied to corporate capital expenditures and the global economy as a whole. In addition, some end markets such as commercial aviation, although just 6% of sales in the first quarter will be impacted beyond the next few quarters and 2020. While many other industrial companies have withdrawn to 2020 earnings guidance, our total company has a relatively and I emphasize relatively high degree of predictability and stability. Nevertheless, in the current environment, we find it prudent to both lower and widen our prior expectations for revenue and earnings that we provided in our January 22, 2020. Our current outlook is based on the following assumptions. First, at the lower end of our earnings range in the second quarter, we've assumed overall revenue contraction of approximately 6% as well as year-over-year declines in each of quarter three and quarter four, although moderating by year end. This would result in an overall full year-over-year revenue decline of approximately 2%. Second, at the high end of our earnings range in the second quarter we have assumed overall revenue contraction of approximately 4%, more about this contraction in Q3, flat year-over-year sales in Q4. This would result in roughly flat year-over-year overall sales. And by segment for instrumentation, which is our shortest cycle business group, we expect an overall revenue change in the second quarter ranging from negative 5% to flat. At the midpoint of our outlook range, we expect full year's segment sales to be flat, including incremental sales contribution of about $60 million from Gas and Flame and OakGate acquisition. We expect digital imaging to be more resilient, as nearly half of the segment serves defense based healthcare and scientific market. This segment also has greater exposure to \"back at work\" customers in Asia, plus, given a weaker 2019 in those digital imaging businesses serving semiconductor inspection and factory automation, we have an easier comparison in 2020, hence, we expect to achieve positive or these low single-digit segments full year's sales growth. In the other two segments, that is aerospace and defense electronics and engineering systems, we continue to see our defense businesses in this segment growing at mid-single digit rates, perhaps even high single digit despite the ongoing operations related challenges mentioned previously. However, we are forecasting a collapse in commercial aviation in the aerospace portion of our aerospace and defense electronic segment. While less than 6% of our total sales in the first quarter we're expecting a 40% plus year-over-year decline in commercial aviation due to both significant air transport OEM and aftermarket declines. As a result, we expect total year-over-year segment sales to decrease approximately $90 million. Before turning to Al to report on the first quarter performance by segment, I want to emphasize the following. We do not know the depth and duration of the economic decline or the pace of the recovery. But as we have repeatedly shown in the past, we know how to be disciplined and perform well in challenging environments. We are aggressively managing variable costs, CapEx and cash flow and quickly and permanently reducing costs where a prolonged non-cycle is anticipated, such as in aviation. Finally, our balance sheet is exceptionally strong with over 230 million of cash and cash equivalents, more than 600 million available under our credit facility maturing in 2024. Given our ample liquidity and the resilience of our business portfolio, we continue to review and pursue acquisition opportunities. Al will now comment on the performance of our four business segments followed by Sue Main, who will give further financial details and present our outlook. Al? Thank you, Sue. Greg, if you're ready to proceed taking question and answers, please go ahead. Hi, Greg. Good morning to you also. The cameras are long wavelength infrared cameras. They're made with our own sensors produced on a wafer level packaging. They are 640 by 480 of 17 micron pixel size. And we're just beginning the manufacturing of those cameras, as we announced. We are getting interest from a large number of manufacturers. And while it's still speculative, we're positively motivated to increase production of those cameras. So how big an opportunity it is too early to tell. Not yet. The short answer is not yet. But I have to put that in perspective. The Marine businesses today are really we expecting the midpoint to be over $425 million. Only 150 of that or 35% about is in offshore oil exploration, offshore oil production and very little on land oil. So, most of our marine businesses we already see 65% is in defense, construction and other areas. Going back to the oil and gas, we do have good orders so far for the year. It's over 1, it's 1.1 and we don't see any cancellations yet. Having said that, that's in the oil production. In the oil exploration, we're seeing a little bit of softening, but in our orders, and considering the price of crude and what's happened to Brent, we think that we expect to have some softening later in the year. So we're taking that into consideration in our guidance, but the good part is, there is a good part to this for us versus 2014, when oil collapsed in '15 and '16, is that at that time, the majority of our marine sales were in oil and gas, today it's only 35%. Yes. So let me start from the latter part of your question, which is do I expect more restructuring? In the first quarter we had about $0.21 of restructuring. We were doing a little cost stakeout right now in the second quarter. And we expect that if things don't change get worse, we'll have to take some more out. We think that overall for the year, including first quarter can range between $0.40 and $0.50; $0.40 on the on the lower side. The margin effect is very interesting. Our margins weigh on the midpoint, we will always work with the midpoint of our guidance, which would get would be about 965 in earnings in EPS and about [3140] [ph] in revenue. Stay with that. With those numbers, I think instruments margin in the instrument segment should increase slightly maybe as much as 15 basis points. Digital Imaging year-over-year, we believe margins can go as high as 90 basis points above last year. In the aerospace and defense, very different issue. Defense is going to do okay. But aerospace is going to be done significantly and that's one of our highest margin businesses, so we think margins year-over-year would go down as much as 700 basis points. Engineering systems will go up probably 75 to 80 basis points. So overall segments will go down because of aerospace primarily, a little over 100 basis points and maybe 110. But we have cost control in the corporate domain. So, overall in the midpoint we think margins can go down as much as 80 basis points. But that, of course, is preliminary data on everything we know right now. Yes. There are -- we are seeing a little disruption right now, especially in our printed circuit board -- specialized printed circuit board supply chain. The flip side of it is why we have hiccups. We have a very strong procurement initiative underway that started two years ago, actually to reduce procurement costs and they're shifting their emphasis to working with our suppliers to ensure that we do have a reasonable supply chain. Hiccups yes, I expect that we'll have more, so far nothing very serious. What's been troubling on the defense side is that availability of some of our customers to approve product that we're delivering to them. For example, just a simple example, in our shadow water combat submersibles, which are the boats we make for the Special Ops. We'd have the boat ready to test but because of the restrictions -- COVID's restrictions, our divers and the government divers can't test them. So they can't take delivery completely without getting paid completely. So there's those kinds of things happening all over. But, going back to something I said, Jim earlier, we know how to deal with these issues. We've done it before. We did it in 2015, '16, when oil collapse, we did in 2008 and 2009, in the financial crisis. So we're taking this into consideration with our guidance. Yes. Let me start with the first part which is last year, we had, this is one of those cases that -- good case is usually we say things like, we have a tough comps, or we try. Last year, semiconductor and factory automation really in general relatively weak. So our comps this year as last year are better. Let me start there. We think machine vision, this mission vision systems part of our overall digital imaging should be flat this year. We think overall digital imaging will increase. But I think the vision system will be flat and there's some good gives and takes. Our flat panel display orders are pretty good right now. Our scientific cameras are doing well. Semis catching up, we do have some incremental sales from acquisitions that we made the site cam from Roper and micro line in Canada, which makes MEMS products. So we think some of the other stuff is going to do well. Our aerospace and defense businesses in machine vision are doing well and we expect them to continue. So overall, I'm going to say the semi factory automation, we are lucky because last year, we had such weak revenue so the comps are easier. The others we've done okay. Let me start with energy first, if I may. As I mentioned before, on the oil and gas part of our business is about $150 million and it's less than 5% of our revenues today. In that market, the products that we make lag the overall market that is, our orders presently are good and will continue for the next two quarters. We think it will soften in Q4. So while the primes are suffering today, I think our suffering will come a little later. The same happens with the recovery if the recovery come, which would obviously depend on the overall economy. We will be lagging the recovery. Having said all of that, in the overall marine businesses, which we kind of look at it as our energy businesses, we have really strong programs in the defense area, both vehicles and other areas like mine confirmations, et cetera. So, we see some downside for us. Recovery as to -- we need to bottom, I don't know. But I think recovery for us will come later. And we've all suffered the consequences of the current downturn perhaps later in the year. Going to commercial aerospace, I can't guess it. Right now, it's -- again, we're lucky. It's 6% of our sales, we have $90 million decline that we're projecting from last year to this year from about 211 to 120 or so. And again, we also there also lag the market after the 911 in 2001. Aviation didn't really recover until 2003. So that was a two year hiatus and we suffered the consequences of that. So, if that's an indication of how long is probably before things start turning up, it'd be another two years before we see a recovery. And frankly, that's the way we're treating these businesses. We are taking cost out, Joe permanently. And barley we've taken almost 20% of our folks out in that business a plus the other people are on furlough and other things. So the long answer is, the recoveries in both segments, the aerospace should be longer timeframe than energy in my view. We won't suffer much from the energy, we are taking hit from the deviation. Let me start by saying, because obviously, we're lowering our earnings right now. So our free cash should be a little lower than last year. Last year, we had about $400 million. We think this year it'd be about 375, maybe even a little less. Having said that, we are taking very strong action now to reduce our inventories across our businesses, how successful it'd be will depend on how well we execute. If we do all the things that we've laid off, out to do, we might keep last year's free cash flow. But, the other thing that happened is, if you look at 2009 versus 2008. In 2008, free cash flow was fairly low; it was like $111 million. In 2009, when we came out of it, our free cash flow grew almost double to $190 million. The same thing happened in the '15 ,'16 timeframe. Free cash flow went from 160 million in 2015 to 250 million in 2016. So, the answer is this. I think we do okay, this year if we execute, we'll be around 375 maybe a little better. But if history is a lesson, we'll come out at this much stronger next year because of our ability to discipline. Our CapEx is going to be lower this year than last year; Al is kind of controlling that almost project by project justification. So I think we should be alright. And we do have cash in the bank. Okay. Let me, if I may Joe, you didn't ask it, but I think in the machine vision business things because of this back to work \"framework\". We also in the machine -- but in machine vision, health care products, we're doing okay there. In the test and measurement, we're lagging a little bit. On the other hand, our protocol in our test and measurement businesses had two legs to it. One of is oscilloscope and affiliated systems for looking at electronics hardware. The other part, the protocols, which are the standards by which in digital imaging systems communicate that area we're doing really well, both here and in China. And so I think our T&M, test and measurement, while we expect it to be essentially flat this year, it's probably going to be a little down because of what we do of acquisition there. So it we might be done 3% or 4%. But China is not our problem. Our problem is really right now is Europe and North America. Moving to environmental, that's a different story. We're seeing some compression there in China, two reasons. One, we make a lot of product that go in air quality monitoring, and measurements of air quality, continuous monitoring as well as measurement. And we see weaknesses there. The second thing, which is a little even more troubling, is the Chinese government emphasis that Chinese companies buy Chinese made product. That's not as much discussed in the United States. We've had initiatives like Buy America initiatives previously, but there's a strong emphasis there to do that. And frankly, I don't mind assembling products there. I don't want to manufacture products there because of other issues. So we are seeing some compression there and that's a little worrisome, but we do have new products and we will compete with everybody and we get our share of the market in that business. Yes. Let me start with the latter part of the question, Andrew, if I may. As I mentioned, unlike other companies that are making such devices, we make the sensors ourselves in our MEMS foundry in Canada in Bromont. And we make it on a wafer level packaging scale. So, we are our own supply chain. So that's the good part. The cameras are called Caliber. And we've been making various versions of the Caliber camera for about a year or longer. The ones that we're talking about are handheld, they're our newest product. They've just been manufactured. I cannot tell you how fast we can grow that, but obviously, we're going to do our best to increase production as fast as we can. Our cameras are also -- lastly, the sensors that we use that we make are vanadium oxide based sensors, really nice sensors 17 micron pixels whereas a lot of the other products around the world are made from amorphous silicon. So we think we have a niche there. I know there are some other companies that have had really a ton of publicity because of this domain. I don't know whether this is kind of move the needle in $3.2 billion revenue company. Yes. Let me start with the rationale. That's it, that's easy one. Photonis primarily makes night vision product for the war fighters. And they do it for almost the rest of the world that has to have an ITAR-free product whereas our two companies in this country don't have ITAR restrictions. The second part that there is business related, again, is in life sciences, but 80% of the business is in defense. Now, what they do have is a very nice product, nice processes, but what they have lacked because they've been supportive by private equity, what they've lacked is the ability to significantly invest or acquire digital imaging companies that would complement it. Almost everything we do in our digital imaging is complimentary to what they have, including the infrared sensors I just mentioned. So we think we will, and digitization is obviously the future of that domain as well. So we think we made some significant capabilities to that product. Now, where are we? Unfortunately, on March 31, we were verbally notified that the Foreign Investment Office of France that they were going to have a negative opinion by the Minister of Economy, essentially saying there is going to be total transaction. Everything has gone quite since then. There are some indications that the Minister of Economy may be reconsidering. We don't know. Ultimately, one or two scenarios can develop. They will reaffirm the verbal detail. We have a written response from them because our agreement with the people we're buying it from is such that everything is in escrow until a final decision has been made. So once we get a written agreement would be one of the following. Either they'll reject it, which is same as their verbal, or they'll come back and agree to a transaction but put certain conditions on it. Now, we are used to certain conditions because we bought two businesses in France, would have operations in France. First, e2v be which we bought several years ago, last year, we bought Gas and Flame Detection business from 3M. In both those cases, there were certain conditions in terms of because they were supplying product to the French government, et cetera, in terms of how long we kept the businesses, et cetera. And we agreed to those conditions because frankly, they were also in our best interest. So we have a really good relationship with the Ministry of Economy and his offices in that domain, and we have a good track record with them. So if the conditions are not honored, they could be onerous, then we could live with it. On the other hand, if the conditions are onerous that would damage our ability to run the company, then we won't be able to complete the transaction. So that's a long way of giving you the best answer I have. And we expect to hear from them. I don't know it could be shortly or it could be a couple of months. Thank you. And if I may, I'll ask Jason now to conclude our conference call. Jason?"

            "content": "Thank you, Al, and good morning, everyone. I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and Al, and then I will discuss our second quarter and full year 2020 outlook. In the first quarter cash flow from operating activities was $76.4 million, compared with cash flow of $80.1 million for the same period of 2019. The cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of 2020 reflected the timing of accounts receivable collections, partially offset by the impact of higher operating income, lower income tax payments and incremental cash flow from recent acquisitions. Free cash flow that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures was $56.2 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared with $58.8 million in 2019. Capital expenditures were $20.2 million in the first quarter compared to $21.3 million for the same period of 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense was $29.3 million in the first quarter compared to $27.6 million for the same period of 2019. We ended the quarter with $618.3 million of net debt that is $849.7 million of debt less cash of $231.4 million for net debt to capital ratio of 18.3%. Stock option compensation expense was $7.4 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared with $8.9 million in the first quarter of 2019. Turning to our outlook, management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the second quarter of 2020 will be in the range of $1.90 to $2.05 per share. And for the full year 2020, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $9.30 to $10. The 2020 full year estimated tax rate excluding discrete items is expected to be 22.8% a 220 basis point increase compared to full year 2019 due in part to less R&D tax credits. In addition, we currently expect significantly less discrete tax items in 2020 compared with 2019. Please note that the estimates for second quarter and full year 2020 GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude any future potential charge related to Airbus OneWeb Satellites. I will now pass the call back to Robert."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Teledyne's Fourth Quarter Earnings Call 2021.  And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the call over to your first speaker, Mr. Jason VanWees. Please, go ahead.\nJason VanWees: Good morning, everyone. This is Jason VanWees, Vice Chairman of Teledyne. And I would like to welcome everyone to Teledyne's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Release Conference Call. We released our earnings earlier this morning before the market open.  Joining me today are Teledyne's Chairman, President and CEO, Robert Mehrabian; Senior Vice President and CFO, Sue Main; Senior Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, Melanie Cibik. And also joining today is Edwin Roks, Executive VP of Teledyne and President of our combined Teledyne Digital Imaging businesses. After remarks by Robert and Sue, we will ask for your questions. But of course, before we get started, our attorneys have reminded me to tell you that all forward-looking statements made this morning are subject to various assumptions, risks and caveats as noted in the earnings release and our periodic SEC filings. And yes, actual results may differ materially.  In order to avoid potential selective disclosures, this call is simultaneously being webcast and a replay, both via webcast and dial in, will be available for approximately 1 month. Here is Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Jason, and good morning, and thank you for joining our earnings call. 2021 was a defining year for Teledyne with record sales and adjusted earnings, operating margin and cash flow. Furthermore, with the successful acquisition and integration of Teledyne FLIR, Teledyne has further evolved into a global sensing and decision support technology company. We provide specialty sensors, cameras, instrumentation, algorithms and software across the electromagnetic spectrum, and unmanned systems in the subsea, land and air domains. I've never been more pleased with our portfolio of businesses in its simple description. We are a high-technology commercial industrial business balanced across multiple end markets with a resilient, predictable portion of long-cycle government business. In the fourth quarter, our operational execution remained very strong. We achieved revenue -- record revenue, 70% greater than last year, driven by organic growth of 8.4% and the remaining 61.6% of sales increase contributed by Teledyne FLIR. Sales growth was especially strong in our commercial imaging and electronic test and measurement instrumentation businesses. In addition, our Aerospace Defense Electronics segment saw continued growth in government and space markets, along with ongoing recovery in commercial aerospace. Despite significant noncash purchase accounting charges, fourth quarter GAAP earnings per share of $3.39 decreased only 2.6% compared to last year. Excluding acquisition-related charges, earnings were $4.56 per share, an increase of 23.9% on a comparable basis from 2020. Compared to the midpoint of our fourth quarter earnings outlook in October, which was $4.12, stronger sales contributed about $0.12 per share, improved margins roughly $0.25 plus a small $0.07 per share increase related to discrete tax items, which, by the way, specifically excludes a larger tax benefit related to clear foreign tax matters appearing in the GAAP results. Cash flow was also all-time quarterly record, allowing repayment of $345 million of debt and our leverage ratio declined from 2.9% -- declined 2 to 2.9 from 3.8, which was the number we had immediately after the FLIR acquisition. Turning to 2022 outlook. The overall demand environment across our businesses remains favorable. Nevertheless, supply chain constraints continue to limit shipments. Given this, we think, a reasonable outlook for total company organic sales growth at this time is between 4% and 5%. Coupled with a full year sales contribution of approximately $2 billion from FLIR, this equates to total revenue of just under $5.5 billion. Of course, if supply chain challenges ease or as it's necessary, we were able to increase pricing to offset inflation more than at the present time. We will increase the revenue outlook throughout the year as we did in 2021, where we achieved full year organic revenue growth of 8.2% relative to our initial outlook in January of 2021 of 5% to 6%. I will now comment on the performance of our 4 business segments. In our Digital Imaging segment, fourth quarter sales increased 209%, largely due to the FLIR acquisition. But organic growth in our combined commercial and government imaging businesses was also very strong at 18.6%. Sales growth was strongest for industrial and scientific vision sensors and systems. In addition, we had record health care sales with revenue greater than any pre-pandemic period. GAAP segment operating margin was 11.6%, but adjusted for purchase accounting and transaction costs, segment margin was 23.3%. In our Instrumentation segment, fourth quarter sales increased 6.9% versus last year. Sales of electronic test and measurement systems, which include oscilloscopes and protocol analyzers, were very strong and increased 13% year-over-year to record levels. Sales of environmental instruments increased 3.2% from last year with sales related to human health and safety markets, such as drug discovery and gas and flame detection being the strongest in the quarter. Sales of marine instruments increased 6.5% in the quarter. In addition, quarterly orders were the strongest in the last 7 years with fourth quarter book-to-bill of 1.35. Overall, Instrumentation segment operating profit increased 5.5% in the fourth quarter and 19% in 2021, with full year segment operating margin increasing 226 basis points or 218 basis points, excluding intangible asset amortization. In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, fourth quarter sales increased 12.5%, driven by 6.4% growth in defense, space and industrial sales, combined with 38.5% increase in sales of commercial aerospace products. GAAP segment operating profit increased 75% and margin 888 basis points greater than last year. Finally, in the Engineered Systems segment, fourth quarter revenue decreased 15.6% on operating profit and margin decline due to lower sales. And also since we exited the higher-margin cruise missile turbine engine business earlier this past year. Before turning the call over to Sue, I want to make a few concluding remarks. First, as noted in yesterday's 8-K filing, an appeals court in Sweden, generally affirmed a lower court ruling made in March of 2020 regarding a clear tax method dating back to 2012. The court determined an estimated tax liability of $303 million. This outcome was anticipated by us and the associated liability was accrued as noted in our most recent 10-Q. We do not plan to appeal the decision and expect to pay the tax in the first quarter of 2022. Finally, regarding environmental, social and governance efforts for ESG, Teledyne's sustainability journey began more than 20 years ago with the belief that demand for environmental monitoring instruments would outgrow general industrial process implementation. Our first 3 acquisitions were Advanced Pollution Instrumentation, Monitor Labs and Tekmar, 3 companies dedicated to analyzing trace contaminants in air and water. Today, our imaging sensors enable greenhouse gas and pollution monitoring from space. Our environmental instruments provide data on the concentration of chemicals and particulates in ambient air and our autonomous underwater floats and vehicles enable the monitoring of ocean temperature and solidity from the surface to deep subsea. While we have highlighted our strategy and products in our last 3 annual reports, next month, we will publish an inaugural corporate social responsibility or CSR report. Here, we will further highlight our sustainability efforts as well as disclose matrices regarding greenhouse gas emission and reduction targets workplace safety and employee and management diversity.  I'll now turn the call over to Sue.\nSusan Main: Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert, and then I will discuss our first quarter and full year 2022 outlook. In the fourth quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $295.6 million compared with cash flow of $236.4 million for the same period of 2020. Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $261.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared with $217 million in 2020. For the full year 2021, free cash flow was $794.6 million excluding FLIR transaction-related cash payments net of tax. Capital expenditures were $34 million in the fourth quarter compared to $19.4 million for the same period of 2020. Depreciation and amortization expense was $86.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared with $28.7 million in 2020. In addition, noncash inventory step-up expense for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $47.8 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $3.62 billion of net debt. That is approximately $4.1 billion of debt less cash of $474.7 million. Stock option compensation expense was $6.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to $5.9 million for the same period of 2020. Resulting from the FLIR acquisition, restricted stock unit expense for FLIR employees was $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.  Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the first quarter of 2022 will be in the range of $3.12 to $3.22 per share with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $4.02 to $4.10. And for the full year 2022, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $14.10 to $14.55, and on a non-GAAP basis, $17.60 to $18. The 2022 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 22.8%.  I'll now pass the call back to Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Sue. We would now like to take your questions. John, if you're ready to proceed with the questions and answers, please go ahead.\nOperator:  Our first question comes from Mike Maugeri with Wolfe Research.\nMike Maugeri: Robert, can you talk a little bit more about how you're thinking about doing deals again? What's the level of leverage that you're comfortable with the start doing deals again? And how does the size of those deals sort of flex with where your level of leverage is at?\nRobert Mehrabian: Thanks, Mike. First, we are rapidly bringing our leverage down. 2.9 leverage ratio that we currently enjoy is the number that we were really thinking would happen by the end of '22. So having moved that forward, I think by the end of '22, we should be in, what I would say, in an investment-grade range.  We are -- at the present time, we are pursuing bolt-on acquisitions but in the long term, we would also look at larger acquisitions. What do I mean by large? Anything that goes beyond a couple of billion dollars takes a little time, so even at this time, we can look at those things we take because it takes 10 months to a year to close. Having said all of that, our longer-term leverage ratio is somewhere between 1.5 to 2.5. So if we get down to 2.5 or less by the end of 2022, we'll be in good shape to do all these things.\nMike Maugeri: And then as my follow-up. Can you update us on free cash for 2022? And is there any update to the billion-dollar number that you put out there for 2023? \nRobert Mehrabian: Yeah. Mike, its Robert. So, Mike, I guess -- I think our '22 number is something like a little over $900 million. '23 will still be over $1 billion. We might be able to improve on that as we go along. But right now with what I see or what we see in organic growth and also CapEx and other expenses, that's about the range.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Greg Konrad with Jefferies.\nGreg Konrad: Maybe just to start, I mean, embedded in your guidance, how are you thinking about margins just given maybe some of the one-timers and Digital Imaging in 2021? And if you could just give a little bit of granularity around segment margins? \nRobert Mehrabian: Yeah, Greg, the Digital Imaging we ended full-year at a little over 24%. If you exclude the not one-time charges, it's a tough comp for us in '22. And the reason I say that is in Q2, when we acquired FLIR, they have always had their hockey stick sales profile during a quarter. So, at the beginning half of the quarter, they had a lot of costs which they made out in the second quarter of the quarter, as they sold product. And what we enjoyed this year was significant increase in the second half of third quarter, after we close the transaction right in the middle of the quarter on May 14. So that helped us with the margin.  Having said that, when you strip away all the one-time charges except for intangibles, we still think we're going to be in 22% close to 24%, 23.9%, 24 %, which is a little less than 21%. But we're stripping everything out there except intangibles. And those are pretty good margins and it's probably the result of the fact that we're able to maintain our reduced cost structure that we enjoyed implemented after the FLIR acquisition.  Now, if we can increase, as I said earlier, if we can increase price to make up -- better make up for inflation, I think our -- and with where our sales as robust as they have been, I think our margins will definitely increase.\nGreg Konrad: And then maybe just a follow-up on that comment, I mean, you talked about both supply chain and price kind of if those improve as kind of upside drivers. Is there any way to quantify maybe the impact or what you're seeing there? And then, just in terms of pricing, where could that be most impactful and maybe where you can get some price?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. Let's start with price increase for us. In '21, on the average, we increase price about 2%, and we had volume increase of 6.2% and that resulted in the overall organic growth of 8.2%.  On the flip side, we had some price increases from our suppliers. We were fortunate in that one because we instituted a very strong procurement program starting in 2019 before the pandemic. And because of that, we also ended up with some good contracts longer-term contracts with some of our supplies. Having said all of that, I think about $2 billion that we buy from our various suppliers between the -- in the new Teledyne, I think we are going to have some price increases from them that are going to be in the 2% to 3%, maybe a little more. But we are offsetting that right now in 2022 with our own price increases of 1.5% to 2%, but maybe we can do a little better than that.  Right now, we're predicting -- projecting our volume to go up 2.5% to 3% on top of the price increase which goes with the current outlook that I gave you between 4% and 5%. Having said, that if an increase prices more and as we go down the year like we did in '21 and things turn out to be working for us our organic growth should be better, just like it was in 2021. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company. \nJim Ricchiuti: Robert, I'm wondering if we think about your annual revenue outlook, any sense as to how much of a revenue impact you're seeing, you're anticipating, as you think about some of the supply chain challenges that are out there?\nRobert Mehrabian: I can only do the short-term, Jim. In Q1, the way we're looking at it, it's probably going to affect us somewhere about $80 million right now, what we see. Of course, we are working very hard on that one. We have buyers across our company focused on that, but more importantly where you also using buyers across the globe, specifically more in the far east that identify parts for us. So, if we have, let's say, 500 parts shortages across the company, they can usually find something about -- something around 60% to 70% for us. And then, of course, we have to qualify and use them.  Now we also have our semiconductor board manufacturers. They are also looking for parts for us at the same time. So we have this cooperative activity going on that I think has helped us so far certainly in 2021. Right now we're looking at $80 million decrements. But as we did in Q4, we'll overcome some of that as we go forward and we've kind of bake that in to our projections. So I don't think supply chain is going to kill us as it does in some of the other companies.\nJim Ricchiuti: And you gave -- I may have missed it, but you give some color on the book-to-bill in marine instrumentation. Did you -- could you provide some booking book-to-bill information on some of the other business segments? And just related to your comment about operating margins and Digital Imaging, if we think about some of the business areas that you've restructured, it would seem like there would be some nice margin expansion opportunity in some of those areas.\nRobert Mehrabian: Right. Well, let me start with the first part of your question, which is book-to-bill. In the instrument area, book-to-bill is about 1.08. So pretty healthy. In Q4 it was higher, it was like 1.16, but the average is out over the fourth quarter there is 1.08. The strongest category there being enjoyed by marine. Nevertheless, all of our programs, all of our businesses in the instrument business have -- in the instrument segment have ratios over 1.  In Digital Imaging we have about 1.05, healthier in our historical Digital Imaging which includes of course, -- e2v and other things, that is really doing well. It's about 1.3. FLIR is less than 1. And the reason for that is primarily in their defense businesses, which are both lumpy and also they -- there are projecting at this time the kind of programs that we anticipate. That's why by the way, we restructured the management of that business under JihFen Lei, who was, as you know, the Deputy for Research and Engineering Acting Deputy for Research and Engineering in Department of Defense. And we think that's going to come along fine.  In AD&E, Aerospace and Defense segment, there was over 1, it was 1.04. And in Engineered System, which is big programs fairly lumpy was close to 1. So overall, I'd say if you look at the total company, at the end of 2021 averaged over 2021, we're talking about 1.05, which I think, at this time for us that's a pretty healthy number. And then, let me go to the second part of your question which had to do with margins. We have significant margin improvement in all of our businesses except fairly flat in Engineered Systems in '21. Let me start with that because the trick is to maintain those margins as we move into '22 and as we grow.  First, in Instruments, our margins increased from '20 to '21, 218 basis points and we expect to increase that another 30 basis points to 23.8%. As I mentioned, in Digital Imaging, overall we have some tough comps, our margins may decline just a little bit maybe 30, 40 basis points. But I think as we improve our revenue and pricing, that should take care of that. In Aerospace and Defense, our margins between 2021 and 2020 increased 745%, and we expect to improve that another 80 basis points in 2022. Engineered Systems is the toughest comp we had because we did exit the turbine engine business and we think we're going to have some margin shrinkage there. Maybe 40, 50 basis points, but it's of course 48% of the company.  So, overall, I think total company margins right now with the organic growth that I projected between 4% and 5%, I think, our total margins were the company will improve about 20 basis points to 21.5%. But as I said before, if we can enjoy a little more price increases and if our revenue goes up, just like it did '21, then our margins will go up accordingly. I think that helps.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley.\nKristine Liwag: Robert, on the parts shortage issue that you mentioned in the supply chain, are trends starting to improve and you're seeing more availability or are you seeing the issues more widespread and potentially seen more parts affected?\nRobert Mehrabian: I would say, Kristine, overall, things are improving. There are pockets where things have not improved. Basically, the lead times are increased a little bit. And the trick is, of course, to make sure that you build certain products that you're waiting for a single part or 2 parts, build those products and put them on the shelf and be ready to move as soon as you secure the part. That especially becomes important in something like our cameras. We have thousands of cameras that can go out as soon as the part arrives. And because of the efforts, Kristine, that I mentioned before, with buyers across the world, especially in the Far East, looking for specifically people dedicated for looking for parts for us, we're able to offset those. I think, overall, the -- across our portfolio, part shortages are not that important in certain areas like aerospace and defense and certain parts of Digital Imaging. For example, some of the people that supply us semiconductor products for our Digital Imaging, that is the people that make the various products that we designed, they're also our customers. So there is a little bit of a -- we enjoy a little bit of leverage there, in that what goes around comes around. So we enjoy that leverage. So I would say the serious matter, but it's not as serious as other companies are suffering from.\nKristine Liwag: And maybe as a follow-up question, on one of the pricing increases you mentioned, it sounds like you've got efforts in place to pass on the 2% to 3% pricing increases from your suppliers and potentially get a little bit more. Can you talk about the competitive environment what your competitors are doing? And also any feedback from your customers about their price inelasticity? And ultimately, I mean, 2% to 3% seems pretty low versus that we're seeing in the overall industry but more mid-single digits. I mean, is this a very easy thing for you to be able to accomplish, which is passing that off and getting a margin on top of that?\nRobert Mehrabian: Kristine, I've never got to admit it's easy because if it were easy, then we would -- we'd enter a different world. What is happening to us is that we can't get price increases where our products have superior performance. So if someone is going to buy a camera, that's got very specific requirements for their application, and we provided, then we can enjoy price increases. In our protocol analyzers and oscilloscopes, where we have very unique positions, we're way ahead of the curve on other people. we can enjoy significant price increases. On the other hand, if you're making a product in the ambient particulate or ambient air monitoring and you're in China, and they're emphasizing by Chinese, and they are not really that interested in paying a high price for a product that's really superior then you don't have as much price advantage and you have to compete with what the market dictates. Fortunately, for us, Kristine, as you travel across our portfolio of products, across the company because our end markets are so diverse, you get really -- because of our balanced portfolio, you get some places where can enjoy serious price increases and some places that you have to stay competitive. So what you do is you just focus on cutting costs, focused on improving manufacturing operations.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Elizabeth Grenfell with BofA. Please go ahead.\nElizabeth Grenfell : I was hoping you could speak to your operating margins over more of the medium term, so not just this year, but how we should think about them progressing through, call it, the next 5-plus years -- or 5 years?\nRobert Mehrabian: Well, I can tell you, we measure ourselves against the very best-in-class. We've closed our margin gap significantly over the last 5 years. We have improved margins about 400 basis points. Now going forward another 5 years, where I sit here now, I'll say if we can improve 40 to 50 basis points a year, it'd be great. We've closed the gap very fast. On the other hand, if things go our way, which seems to have gone our way in the past, we could do better than that. But sitting here right now, I'd say, 40 to 50 basis points looking forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg. \nAndrew Buscaglia: I was hoping you could dig a little bit more into Digital Imaging in the quarter. It definitely exceeded my expectations, And you made an interesting comment that health care sales had a record level of sales. Can you -- so I imagine that's the main driver. But can you just talk about what you saw within that segment?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. There are two parts to it, Andrew. Of course, there's our legacy digital imaging, and there's our new acquisition clear. So if you would bear with me, I'd like to separate the 2 for a minute. And then, of course, going forward, we're going to talk as if there were one. But let me start with our historical Digital Imaging. Without acquisitions, between '20 and '21, we enjoyed 15.5%, 15.6% increase in revenue from about $986 million to $1.140 billion. And then -- if you look at our machine vision within that, some cameras, scientific cameras, and sensors, that really did well. It was -- in the fourth quarter, it was 29%. And in the fourth quarter, it was about 36%, forgive me. Overall during the year was 29%.  Health care, which as you know, we make x-rays as well as x-ray source components for cancer treatment. We had our best quarter we've had in the last -- ever, this year. And it increased 19.5% in Q4 and 15.8% for the year.  And then we also had growth in our aerospace and defense in that segment. Fourth quarter, about 4.8%, over the year about 4.1%. And then MEMS, as you know, our Micro Electro Mechanical Systems, fabs and factories, we enjoyed about 17.9% for fourth quarter and 12.3%. So fourth quarter was a great quarter. We had a little decline in our J-S ratio, but that's a very small part of that portfolio. It's only $60 million. So $2 million or $3 million would look like a lot of money, but it essentially didn't grow year-over-year. Now -- looking -- again, I'm going to stay with this segment for a while. Looking forward to 2022, at this time, we're projecting about 5.35% growth for next year, something to go to about $1.2 billion. And that varies across the various products. A much more moderated increases that we had in 2021. But again, let me caution that it's the beginning of the year. And I can't see -- we can't see too far forward to project things much higher than 5%, 5.3% in this domain. Let's go to FLIR for a second. Overall, before we acquired FLIR, in 2020, their revenues of about $1.924 billion. And of course, that was the year that they really enjoyed the elevated skin temperature products, which contributed about $100 million to their revenue. If you go through 2021 and you add up pre-acquisition and post-acquisition revenue for the whole year for FLIR, it was $1.895 billion. So it went down about $29 million, which means that we made up most of that $100 million decrement that we saw in the elevated skin temperature, which was also reflected primarily in the industrial segment businesses, which were down about $46 million. Next year, we're projecting those businesses to improve by about 5.9%. And overall, the total business to increase to almost -- to $2 billion or increase from where we are today, 5%, 5.5% to $2 billion. And then if you track the diverse defense and Gray Marine, et cetera, Gray Marine had a great year. That's part of, of course, the industrial segment, almost 15.9%. We think it moderate about 3% next year. Defense businesses enjoyed some pickup from $768 million to $785 million in 2020 to '21, but we're projecting another 6.4% increase going into '22. So -- and almost increases in all areas. So in sum total, we think that our overall digital imaging businesses, which would be both of those combined will be about $3.2 billion in revenue, which would be an increase of about 5%, maybe a little more over this year. No, no. This is all --\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. Yes, very helpful. Yes. So maybe just switching gears, I was surprised to see we received a couple of quarters now where A&D electronics have really picked up. And I believe you said aerospace is up over 30%. How much of this is just easy comps? Or is this the real sign of things -- of activity picking up in that area, do you think?\nRobert Mehrabian: Well, first, let me go into the aerospace part. Of course, that's the tilted towards commercial aerospace, that's a small portion of our overall portfolio. It's about $120 million, $125 million. But we look at real bidding from '20 to '21, from 2019 to '20, and that business just hit the bottom -- it went down about $100 million. We took cost out, as we always do. We took the cost out, and some of the comps, therefore, were easy as we come into the new year. That business has grown significantly and our margins are over 30% because of -- we kept the lower cost and improve the revenue year-over-year. But by and large aerospace business, like most of our other businesses is a small fraction of our overall portfolio. And that's what I always kind of emphasize the fact that we like to have a balanced portfolio, even in digital imaging -- we have a balanced portfolio between machine vision, health care, aerospace, geospatial, thermal, unmanned, surveillance, components, et cetera. So none of these businesses get hurt. And the point back to aerospace and defense. The other thing that's happened is we worked very hard to improve our margins in the defense part of that business. So if you look year-over-year, the margins in our Aerospace and Defense business from '21 to '22 because of the good The overall year margin went to 21.3% and increased 745 basis points with respect to '20. And we think in '22, we can increase it another 80 basis I hope that answers your question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen. \nJoseph Giordano: Hey, guys. Does anything -- as you look across all the different parts of your business, does anything feel kind of unsustainably high? Or -- and conversely, does anything feel like it's clearly inflecting off of levels and moving higher?\nRobert Mehrabian: Boy, you would ask that, Joe. I think the only thing I would say, no, nothing looks sustaining the just causes the comps to be a little tougher, right? I mentioned about digital imaging. When you kind of hit the ball out of the park, now you go up to bat again, you might hit singles rather than hit it out of the park. Some of the later cycle businesses like Aerospace, we're enjoying in bonds. And I think that's going to keep moving, and it's going to be good. And our marine businesses are -- we have the best book-to-bill ratio in our instrument is in our marine businesses. So we think that's going to go up significantly. But again, going back, you look at our overall Marine business, which ranges from defense to underwater vehicles, some oil, gas and all, overall, it's about $450 million, $425 million this year, maybe over $460 million next year. It's not a big chunk of our portfolio. So if it goes down or up 10%, 15%, it doesn't affect us very much. So I don't see he's getting out of whack. There are some areas that I think if we do the right things, we're going to enjoy significant benefits. Let me give you 1 example. We have about $450 million of unmanned vehicle business portfolio. About $150 million is underwater. It's $150 million is on the ground, and $150 million is in our drones that we got from FLIR. So if we can combine some of those technologies, if we can couple those capabilities together, then I think over the long run, that business can grow much faster than any of the businesses on their own stand-alone. So -- and that's the kind of stuff that excites me at this time. Can we put those things together and kind of get the kind of base that you're talking about? \nJoseph Giordano: Yes. That was going to be my next question. Like, kind of where do you think -- I know you don't want to talk revenue synergies or anything like that with FLIR, but kind of where do you think this can go in terms of like an overall pitch of the portfolio? Like, does this -- how does the scale help you when you're going to market or bidding certain applications?\nRobert Mehrabian: Well, by now that, by nature, relatively conservative. But just let me say that we have managed to take a significant amount of cost from FLIR. And we took as much cost this year as we talked we take between this year and next year combined. So that business is now stabilized. We're not going to squeeze that business anymore. We just took a lot of cost out in the whole management, top management, the, of course, public company. And then they have zillions or consultants that we don't need. And we did all of that without increasing our own corporate budget, which is important. So where else do we have synergies. We have some synergies in costs right there. The other areas are some of our purchasing powers have improved because of the coupling of the and then go to market together is important. And I think those synergies are small in each area, but they add up to significant numbers. Don't give you 1 example. We have a gas and flame business that we bought from 3M. It's a really good business. When we bought it, it had about 12% margins. Last year, the margins went over 20%. FLIR has a gas detection camera that we're trying to couple the tour and sell it together. The same thing goes with enormous number of FLIR commercial products in the thermography business and a lot of our visible cameras. And we're trying to couple those together, and FLIR had some mid-market cameras. We coupled that already with high-end cameras. So there are a lot of synergies. I've kind of baked that in so far for next year in our 5% overall revenue growth to about $3.2 billion. But I think if we have the synergies going forward, it could improve more than that. But right now, we're trying to keep our stable or cost reductions so that we don't get smacked with some cost increases and then slowly work our synergies as we go forward.\nJoseph Giordano: Can I just have you clarify one thing as we went through a lot of numbers, and I was trying to write everything down have missed some stuff. I know that organic is a little bit tricky because part of FLIR is inorganic for the year. And if you were to totally segregate these 2 things. How fast organically do you think FLIR on its own, like the totality of FLIR is going to grow in '22? And then total legacy ex FLIR Teledyne? And then where do you think the FLIR are in -- where were they in '21? And where are they in '22? Just FLIR.\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. Just FLIR, let me go back to '20 because that's a good starting position. They were at $1.924 billion in '20. In '21, if you take before and after the acquisition, they went down 1.5% to $1.895. And that was primarily because of they didn't have the elevated skin temperature sales, okay? So if you take that as a basis, $1.895 billion, we're projecting a 5.5% revenue increase in 2022, all organic, to about $2 billion. If you take our legacy Digital Imaging businesses, they went up 15.6% from '20 to '21. We don't think that's sustainable. At this time, I mean I always emphasize at this time. We think that can go from $1.14 billion to $1.2 billion, which is another 5.3% increase. So if you combine the 2, you're talking about somewhere between about 5.4% increase in revenue, organically, all in. Does that answer your question?\nJoseph Giordano: And the FLIR margins?\nRobert Mehrabian: FLIR margin is going to go down a little bit primarily because of -- as I mentioned before, I don't know if you were on the call there, well the Q2 was really good because they produce most of that material earning in Q2. Their margins are going to be close to 24%. And our own legacy margins are going to be above 23.8%, which, by the way, that's 200 basis points higher than what we had in 2020. So if we can maintain that and increase it together, I think it's going to be tough. We may have a little reduction in overall margin, let's say, basis, 40 basis points, be close to 24%, which is pretty good. Our margins in digital imaging and our instrumentation are very close to one another as we're projecting in '22 at almost 24% each. And as I said, in aerospace and defense, we've called up to 22%. So I'm happy with that scenario.\nOperator:  We now go to Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. \nNoah Poponak: Robert, could you spend a little more time on exactly why Digital Imaging -- legacy, ex FLIR, has had suddenly such high growth rates? I mean, I know the compares are kind of easy, but they're not that easy. It didn't draw down that much in 2020. And I understand you've given the detail on what each of the pieces did, and I know the trends in those businesses, but it's sort of an out of nowhere step function in the growth rate that you've had for a few quarters here. If you could just better educate me on what the successes are driving that?\nRobert Mehrabian: Sure. And I'll try not to emphasize brilliant management on Noah\u2019s part, because he's sitting here.\nNoah Poponak: Whatever the right answer is --\nRobert Mehrabian: No, let me take a couple of pieces of that. When the pandemic hit, our health care business has suffered because a lot of the selected X-ray treatment and even cancer treatment took a significant hit because the hospitals were overloaded. As things eased up a little bit, both our X-ray business and our X-ray source business went -- ticked up. And so it enjoyed a 14% increase. That's the highest in the quarter, that was up 19.5%. So it averaged about 13.4%. So we picked it up as the year went on. And that was really driven by the fact that people started having more surgeries and treatments, et cetera. In the machine vision business, our inspection businesses went up significantly throughout the year. And if you take our scientific cameras, which are also very important, they are used in all kinds of applications, including looking at details of called sources, and there you have very fast cameras, which we do. We started the year okay, but then it started picking up. And by quarter 4, it was over 36%. So it's nothing that happened all suddenly. It was just a slow increase in those businesses as we went along. And MEMS, we have a unique capability in both promo that we bought this MicroLine MEMS business. There's a scarcity of independent MEMS foundries, we are probably one of the top independent foundries in the world. And so with the shortages that are happening customers are coming where they can get stuff and where we can make them. And so that's helped us a lot too. That overall year-over-year increased 10% -- 9.4% but picked up almost 18% in Q4. So it's not any one thing, it's a lot of these little things adding up. What we're trying to do is we're trying to give conservative guidance for '22 because the comps are so tough. And then as I said before, we have to kind of tip to our way through these supply chain issues. I mean I guess the numbers are impressive, but the decent amount of that detail you gave there is COVID and some of the movement around that and then supply chain, all of which hopefully don't last forever or at least to the degree they do impact they have today. Do you worry about not only a tough compare, but then just a resetting back to normal of some of those items? Or you just have enough incremental penetration you can find to keep growing that business. I think just to walk out of my shoes, my conservative shoes, I'd be surprised if we don't do better as we go on.\nNoah Poponak: And then in the FLIR piece, the numbers you've provided on a multiyear basis there, very helpful and transparent. Those are pretty in line with where they were trending and what the outlook was for the business. So it sounds like we know you haven't divested anything, and I thought there might have been some pieces in there you didn't quite see as aligned with Teledyne for the long term. I thought you might have some stuff that you just kind of let roll off with a focus on profitability and cash flow. It looks like that hasn't happened, that you've determined essentially all of legacy FLIR stays with Teledyne. Is that right?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. Yes. The answer is yes. And then -- by the way, there's a little difference between -- you covered for a long time. So you probably know those businesses historically, the trends, better than I do. Having said that, they may have projected revenues, robust revenues year-over-year. But I am not sure how many of them they hit -- so when I say $2 billion in 2022, I kind of feel that we can achieve that. Having said that, let's talk about this divestiture issue. You recall that at one time, they were thinking of selling their Raymarine businesses. Well, we don't because we have a huge number of marine businesses that fit tightly with that business. We have our whole Marine effort with all the capabilities we have in underwater imaging and then our LiDAR businesses, that's a go for us. That business has done very well in 2021, and we're projecting it to grow. And that's not even counting the synergies that we should enjoy in that domain. So frankly, I don't see any part of that business that we would divest. It's a good portfolio. That's why we pay a dear price for us to get it.\nNoah Poponak: And just 1 last one, if I might. The Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment margin increased pretty significantly through the year last year, even though the sequential revenue change isn't that significant. And historically, it doesn't have that -- doesn't quite have that seasonality. So why -- I guess, why did it? Or should I be thinking about that -- why isn't the margin exiting the year kind of sustainable in that business?\nRobert Mehrabian: Well, two reasons, Noah. First, as I mentioned before, the aerospace portion of that business came back because we took the cost out and the revenue -- any revenue increase just was really huge gross margins. So that increased tremendously. And frankly, in 2020, that was depressed versus 2019. That was depressed because of the cost cutting that we did in the aerospace portion of that. The other thing is on the defense portion of that, we had some really nice programs. We kind of stabilized that. We have really good new managers up there. And so that's helped us. And then lastly, in the aerospace part, we're enjoying good aftermarket. The aftermarket in that domain is pretty good. And OEM is coming back, while OEM margins are a little less than we enjoy we'd like to think, especially in '22 and '23, with the aftermarket because they have already our products on the aircraft. We think that will be good. And then we have some really exciting new products coming out like we've mentioned this, you may recall, we have an aircraft -- on-aircraft monitoring -- air monitoring product that we're introducing. And it's kind of built on their monitoring products that we have in our instrument businesses for outside the aircraft I think that's going to be a very good product because everybody when you get on an airplane, was the first thing you worry about nowadays is the quality of the year.\nNoah Poponak: Yes. So essentially relative to the fourth quarter, you have to bring costs back on compared to the drop-through that you experienced in the fourth quarter?\nRobert Mehrabian: No, I don't think so. I think the mix between OEM and aftermarket, the margin should stay about the same. But as we said, in overall aerospace and defense market we expect an 80-basis point increase in margin between '21 and '22 for the full year.\nOperator: And we have no additional questions in queue. The queue is clear.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, John. I'll now ask Jason to conclude our conference call.\nJason VanWees: Thanks, Robert. And again, thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning.

            "content": "Thank you, Jason, and good morning, and thank you for joining our earnings call. 2021 was a defining year for Teledyne with record sales and adjusted earnings, operating margin and cash flow. Furthermore, with the successful acquisition and integration of Teledyne FLIR, Teledyne has further evolved into a global sensing and decision support technology company. We provide specialty sensors, cameras, instrumentation, algorithms and software across the electromagnetic spectrum, and unmanned systems in the subsea, land and air domains. I've never been more pleased with our portfolio of businesses in its simple description. We are a high-technology commercial industrial business balanced across multiple end markets with a resilient, predictable portion of long-cycle government business. In the fourth quarter, our operational execution remained very strong. We achieved revenue -- record revenue, 70% greater than last year, driven by organic growth of 8.4% and the remaining 61.6% of sales increase contributed by Teledyne FLIR. Sales growth was especially strong in our commercial imaging and electronic test and measurement instrumentation businesses. In addition, our Aerospace Defense Electronics segment saw continued growth in government and space markets, along with ongoing recovery in commercial aerospace. Despite significant noncash purchase accounting charges, fourth quarter GAAP earnings per share of $3.39 decreased only 2.6% compared to last year. Excluding acquisition-related charges, earnings were $4.56 per share, an increase of 23.9% on a comparable basis from 2020. Compared to the midpoint of our fourth quarter earnings outlook in October, which was $4.12, stronger sales contributed about $0.12 per share, improved margins roughly $0.25 plus a small $0.07 per share increase related to discrete tax items, which, by the way, specifically excludes a larger tax benefit related to clear foreign tax matters appearing in the GAAP results. Cash flow was also all-time quarterly record, allowing repayment of $345 million of debt and our leverage ratio declined from 2.9% -- declined 2 to 2.9 from 3.8, which was the number we had immediately after the FLIR acquisition. Turning to 2022 outlook. The overall demand environment across our businesses remains favorable. Nevertheless, supply chain constraints continue to limit shipments. Given this, we think, a reasonable outlook for total company organic sales growth at this time is between 4% and 5%. Coupled with a full year sales contribution of approximately $2 billion from FLIR, this equates to total revenue of just under $5.5 billion. Of course, if supply chain challenges ease or as it's necessary, we were able to increase pricing to offset inflation more than at the present time. We will increase the revenue outlook throughout the year as we did in 2021, where we achieved full year organic revenue growth of 8.2% relative to our initial outlook in January of 2021 of 5% to 6%. I will now comment on the performance of our 4 business segments. In our Digital Imaging segment, fourth quarter sales increased 209%, largely due to the FLIR acquisition. But organic growth in our combined commercial and government imaging businesses was also very strong at 18.6%. Sales growth was strongest for industrial and scientific vision sensors and systems. In addition, we had record health care sales with revenue greater than any pre-pandemic period. GAAP segment operating margin was 11.6%, but adjusted for purchase accounting and transaction costs, segment margin was 23.3%. In our Instrumentation segment, fourth quarter sales increased 6.9% versus last year. Sales of electronic test and measurement systems, which include oscilloscopes and protocol analyzers, were very strong and increased 13% year-over-year to record levels. Sales of environmental instruments increased 3.2% from last year with sales related to human health and safety markets, such as drug discovery and gas and flame detection being the strongest in the quarter. Sales of marine instruments increased 6.5% in the quarter. In addition, quarterly orders were the strongest in the last 7 years with fourth quarter book-to-bill of 1.35. Overall, Instrumentation segment operating profit increased 5.5% in the fourth quarter and 19% in 2021, with full year segment operating margin increasing 226 basis points or 218 basis points, excluding intangible asset amortization. In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, fourth quarter sales increased 12.5%, driven by 6.4% growth in defense, space and industrial sales, combined with 38.5% increase in sales of commercial aerospace products. GAAP segment operating profit increased 75% and margin 888 basis points greater than last year. Finally, in the Engineered Systems segment, fourth quarter revenue decreased 15.6% on operating profit and margin decline due to lower sales. And also since we exited the higher-margin cruise missile turbine engine business earlier this past year. Before turning the call over to Sue, I want to make a few concluding remarks. First, as noted in yesterday's 8-K filing, an appeals court in Sweden, generally affirmed a lower court ruling made in March of 2020 regarding a clear tax method dating back to 2012. The court determined an estimated tax liability of $303 million. This outcome was anticipated by us and the associated liability was accrued as noted in our most recent 10-Q. We do not plan to appeal the decision and expect to pay the tax in the first quarter of 2022. Finally, regarding environmental, social and governance efforts for ESG, Teledyne's sustainability journey began more than 20 years ago with the belief that demand for environmental monitoring instruments would outgrow general industrial process implementation. Our first 3 acquisitions were Advanced Pollution Instrumentation, Monitor Labs and Tekmar, 3 companies dedicated to analyzing trace contaminants in air and water. Today, our imaging sensors enable greenhouse gas and pollution monitoring from space. Our environmental instruments provide data on the concentration of chemicals and particulates in ambient air and our autonomous underwater floats and vehicles enable the monitoring of ocean temperature and solidity from the surface to deep subsea. While we have highlighted our strategy and products in our last 3 annual reports, next month, we will publish an inaugural corporate social responsibility or CSR report. Here, we will further highlight our sustainability efforts as well as disclose matrices regarding greenhouse gas emission and reduction targets workplace safety and employee and management diversity.  I'll now turn the call over to Sue. Thank you, Sue. We would now like to take your questions. John, if you're ready to proceed with the questions and answers, please go ahead. Thanks, Mike. First, we are rapidly bringing our leverage down. 2.9 leverage ratio that we currently enjoy is the number that we were really thinking would happen by the end of '22. So having moved that forward, I think by the end of '22, we should be in, what I would say, in an investment-grade range.  We are -- at the present time, we are pursuing bolt-on acquisitions but in the long term, we would also look at larger acquisitions. What do I mean by large? Anything that goes beyond a couple of billion dollars takes a little time, so even at this time, we can look at those things we take because it takes 10 months to a year to close. Having said all of that, our longer-term leverage ratio is somewhere between 1.5 to 2.5. So if we get down to 2.5 or less by the end of 2022, we'll be in good shape to do all these things. Yeah. Mike, its Robert. So, Mike, I guess -- I think our '22 number is something like a little over $900 million. '23 will still be over $1 billion. We might be able to improve on that as we go along. But right now with what I see or what we see in organic growth and also CapEx and other expenses, that's about the range. Yeah, Greg, the Digital Imaging we ended full-year at a little over 24%. If you exclude the not one-time charges, it's a tough comp for us in '22. And the reason I say that is in Q2, when we acquired FLIR, they have always had their hockey stick sales profile during a quarter. So, at the beginning half of the quarter, they had a lot of costs which they made out in the second quarter of the quarter, as they sold product. And what we enjoyed this year was significant increase in the second half of third quarter, after we close the transaction right in the middle of the quarter on May 14. So that helped us with the margin.  Having said that, when you strip away all the one-time charges except for intangibles, we still think we're going to be in 22% close to 24%, 23.9%, 24 %, which is a little less than 21%. But we're stripping everything out there except intangibles. And those are pretty good margins and it's probably the result of the fact that we're able to maintain our reduced cost structure that we enjoyed implemented after the FLIR acquisition.  Now, if we can increase, as I said earlier, if we can increase price to make up -- better make up for inflation, I think our -- and with where our sales as robust as they have been, I think our margins will definitely increase. Yes. Let's start with price increase for us. In '21, on the average, we increase price about 2%, and we had volume increase of 6.2% and that resulted in the overall organic growth of 8.2%.  On the flip side, we had some price increases from our suppliers. We were fortunate in that one because we instituted a very strong procurement program starting in 2019 before the pandemic. And because of that, we also ended up with some good contracts longer-term contracts with some of our supplies. Having said all of that, I think about $2 billion that we buy from our various suppliers between the -- in the new Teledyne, I think we are going to have some price increases from them that are going to be in the 2% to 3%, maybe a little more. But we are offsetting that right now in 2022 with our own price increases of 1.5% to 2%, but maybe we can do a little better than that.  Right now, we're predicting -- projecting our volume to go up 2.5% to 3% on top of the price increase which goes with the current outlook that I gave you between 4% and 5%. Having said, that if an increase prices more and as we go down the year like we did in '21 and things turn out to be working for us our organic growth should be better, just like it was in 2021. I can only do the short-term, Jim. In Q1, the way we're looking at it, it's probably going to affect us somewhere about $80 million right now, what we see. Of course, we are working very hard on that one. We have buyers across our company focused on that, but more importantly where you also using buyers across the globe, specifically more in the far east that identify parts for us. So, if we have, let's say, 500 parts shortages across the company, they can usually find something about -- something around 60% to 70% for us. And then, of course, we have to qualify and use them.  Now we also have our semiconductor board manufacturers. They are also looking for parts for us at the same time. So we have this cooperative activity going on that I think has helped us so far certainly in 2021. Right now we're looking at $80 million decrements. But as we did in Q4, we'll overcome some of that as we go forward and we've kind of bake that in to our projections. So I don't think supply chain is going to kill us as it does in some of the other companies. Right. Well, let me start with the first part of your question, which is book-to-bill. In the instrument area, book-to-bill is about 1.08. So pretty healthy. In Q4 it was higher, it was like 1.16, but the average is out over the fourth quarter there is 1.08. The strongest category there being enjoyed by marine. Nevertheless, all of our programs, all of our businesses in the instrument business have -- in the instrument segment have ratios over 1.  In Digital Imaging we have about 1.05, healthier in our historical Digital Imaging which includes of course, -- e2v and other things, that is really doing well. It's about 1.3. FLIR is less than 1. And the reason for that is primarily in their defense businesses, which are both lumpy and also they -- there are projecting at this time the kind of programs that we anticipate. That's why by the way, we restructured the management of that business under JihFen Lei, who was, as you know, the Deputy for Research and Engineering Acting Deputy for Research and Engineering in Department of Defense. And we think that's going to come along fine.  In AD&E, Aerospace and Defense segment, there was over 1, it was 1.04. And in Engineered System, which is big programs fairly lumpy was close to 1. So overall, I'd say if you look at the total company, at the end of 2021 averaged over 2021, we're talking about 1.05, which I think, at this time for us that's a pretty healthy number. And then, let me go to the second part of your question which had to do with margins. We have significant margin improvement in all of our businesses except fairly flat in Engineered Systems in '21. Let me start with that because the trick is to maintain those margins as we move into '22 and as we grow.  First, in Instruments, our margins increased from '20 to '21, 218 basis points and we expect to increase that another 30 basis points to 23.8%. As I mentioned, in Digital Imaging, overall we have some tough comps, our margins may decline just a little bit maybe 30, 40 basis points. But I think as we improve our revenue and pricing, that should take care of that. In Aerospace and Defense, our margins between 2021 and 2020 increased 745%, and we expect to improve that another 80 basis points in 2022. Engineered Systems is the toughest comp we had because we did exit the turbine engine business and we think we're going to have some margin shrinkage there. Maybe 40, 50 basis points, but it's of course 48% of the company.  So, overall, I think total company margins right now with the organic growth that I projected between 4% and 5%, I think, our total margins were the company will improve about 20 basis points to 21.5%. But as I said before, if we can enjoy a little more price increases and if our revenue goes up, just like it did '21, then our margins will go up accordingly. I think that helps. I would say, Kristine, overall, things are improving. There are pockets where things have not improved. Basically, the lead times are increased a little bit. And the trick is, of course, to make sure that you build certain products that you're waiting for a single part or 2 parts, build those products and put them on the shelf and be ready to move as soon as you secure the part. That especially becomes important in something like our cameras. We have thousands of cameras that can go out as soon as the part arrives. And because of the efforts, Kristine, that I mentioned before, with buyers across the world, especially in the Far East, looking for specifically people dedicated for looking for parts for us, we're able to offset those. I think, overall, the -- across our portfolio, part shortages are not that important in certain areas like aerospace and defense and certain parts of Digital Imaging. For example, some of the people that supply us semiconductor products for our Digital Imaging, that is the people that make the various products that we designed, they're also our customers. So there is a little bit of a -- we enjoy a little bit of leverage there, in that what goes around comes around. So we enjoy that leverage. So I would say the serious matter, but it's not as serious as other companies are suffering from. Kristine, I've never got to admit it's easy because if it were easy, then we would -- we'd enter a different world. What is happening to us is that we can't get price increases where our products have superior performance. So if someone is going to buy a camera, that's got very specific requirements for their application, and we provided, then we can enjoy price increases. In our protocol analyzers and oscilloscopes, where we have very unique positions, we're way ahead of the curve on other people. we can enjoy significant price increases. On the other hand, if you're making a product in the ambient particulate or ambient air monitoring and you're in China, and they're emphasizing by Chinese, and they are not really that interested in paying a high price for a product that's really superior then you don't have as much price advantage and you have to compete with what the market dictates. Fortunately, for us, Kristine, as you travel across our portfolio of products, across the company because our end markets are so diverse, you get really -- because of our balanced portfolio, you get some places where can enjoy serious price increases and some places that you have to stay competitive. So what you do is you just focus on cutting costs, focused on improving manufacturing operations. Well, I can tell you, we measure ourselves against the very best-in-class. We've closed our margin gap significantly over the last 5 years. We have improved margins about 400 basis points. Now going forward another 5 years, where I sit here now, I'll say if we can improve 40 to 50 basis points a year, it'd be great. We've closed the gap very fast. On the other hand, if things go our way, which seems to have gone our way in the past, we could do better than that. But sitting here right now, I'd say, 40 to 50 basis points looking forward. Yes. There are two parts to it, Andrew. Of course, there's our legacy digital imaging, and there's our new acquisition clear. So if you would bear with me, I'd like to separate the 2 for a minute. And then, of course, going forward, we're going to talk as if there were one. But let me start with our historical Digital Imaging. Without acquisitions, between '20 and '21, we enjoyed 15.5%, 15.6% increase in revenue from about $986 million to $1.140 billion. And then -- if you look at our machine vision within that, some cameras, scientific cameras, and sensors, that really did well. It was -- in the fourth quarter, it was 29%. And in the fourth quarter, it was about 36%, forgive me. Overall during the year was 29%.  Health care, which as you know, we make x-rays as well as x-ray source components for cancer treatment. We had our best quarter we've had in the last -- ever, this year. And it increased 19.5% in Q4 and 15.8% for the year.  And then we also had growth in our aerospace and defense in that segment. Fourth quarter, about 4.8%, over the year about 4.1%. And then MEMS, as you know, our Micro Electro Mechanical Systems, fabs and factories, we enjoyed about 17.9% for fourth quarter and 12.3%. So fourth quarter was a great quarter. We had a little decline in our J-S ratio, but that's a very small part of that portfolio. It's only $60 million. So $2 million or $3 million would look like a lot of money, but it essentially didn't grow year-over-year. Now -- looking -- again, I'm going to stay with this segment for a while. Looking forward to 2022, at this time, we're projecting about 5.35% growth for next year, something to go to about $1.2 billion. And that varies across the various products. A much more moderated increases that we had in 2021. But again, let me caution that it's the beginning of the year. And I can't see -- we can't see too far forward to project things much higher than 5%, 5.3% in this domain. Let's go to FLIR for a second. Overall, before we acquired FLIR, in 2020, their revenues of about $1.924 billion. And of course, that was the year that they really enjoyed the elevated skin temperature products, which contributed about $100 million to their revenue. If you go through 2021 and you add up pre-acquisition and post-acquisition revenue for the whole year for FLIR, it was $1.895 billion. So it went down about $29 million, which means that we made up most of that $100 million decrement that we saw in the elevated skin temperature, which was also reflected primarily in the industrial segment businesses, which were down about $46 million. Next year, we're projecting those businesses to improve by about 5.9%. And overall, the total business to increase to almost -- to $2 billion or increase from where we are today, 5%, 5.5% to $2 billion. And then if you track the diverse defense and Gray Marine, et cetera, Gray Marine had a great year. That's part of, of course, the industrial segment, almost 15.9%. We think it moderate about 3% next year. Defense businesses enjoyed some pickup from $768 million to $785 million in 2020 to '21, but we're projecting another 6.4% increase going into '22. So -- and almost increases in all areas. So in sum total, we think that our overall digital imaging businesses, which would be both of those combined will be about $3.2 billion in revenue, which would be an increase of about 5%, maybe a little more over this year. No, no. This is all -- Well, first, let me go into the aerospace part. Of course, that's the tilted towards commercial aerospace, that's a small portion of our overall portfolio. It's about $120 million, $125 million. But we look at real bidding from '20 to '21, from 2019 to '20, and that business just hit the bottom -- it went down about $100 million. We took cost out, as we always do. We took the cost out, and some of the comps, therefore, were easy as we come into the new year. That business has grown significantly and our margins are over 30% because of -- we kept the lower cost and improve the revenue year-over-year. But by and large aerospace business, like most of our other businesses is a small fraction of our overall portfolio. And that's what I always kind of emphasize the fact that we like to have a balanced portfolio, even in digital imaging -- we have a balanced portfolio between machine vision, health care, aerospace, geospatial, thermal, unmanned, surveillance, components, et cetera. So none of these businesses get hurt. And the point back to aerospace and defense. The other thing that's happened is we worked very hard to improve our margins in the defense part of that business. So if you look year-over-year, the margins in our Aerospace and Defense business from '21 to '22 because of the good The overall year margin went to 21.3% and increased 745 basis points with respect to '20. And we think in '22, we can increase it another 80 basis I hope that answers your question. Boy, you would ask that, Joe. I think the only thing I would say, no, nothing looks sustaining the just causes the comps to be a little tougher, right? I mentioned about digital imaging. When you kind of hit the ball out of the park, now you go up to bat again, you might hit singles rather than hit it out of the park. Some of the later cycle businesses like Aerospace, we're enjoying in bonds. And I think that's going to keep moving, and it's going to be good. And our marine businesses are -- we have the best book-to-bill ratio in our instrument is in our marine businesses. So we think that's going to go up significantly. But again, going back, you look at our overall Marine business, which ranges from defense to underwater vehicles, some oil, gas and all, overall, it's about $450 million, $425 million this year, maybe over $460 million next year. It's not a big chunk of our portfolio. So if it goes down or up 10%, 15%, it doesn't affect us very much. So I don't see he's getting out of whack. There are some areas that I think if we do the right things, we're going to enjoy significant benefits. Let me give you 1 example. We have about $450 million of unmanned vehicle business portfolio. About $150 million is underwater. It's $150 million is on the ground, and $150 million is in our drones that we got from FLIR. So if we can combine some of those technologies, if we can couple those capabilities together, then I think over the long run, that business can grow much faster than any of the businesses on their own stand-alone. So -- and that's the kind of stuff that excites me at this time. Can we put those things together and kind of get the kind of base that you're talking about? Well, by now that, by nature, relatively conservative. But just let me say that we have managed to take a significant amount of cost from FLIR. And we took as much cost this year as we talked we take between this year and next year combined. So that business is now stabilized. We're not going to squeeze that business anymore. We just took a lot of cost out in the whole management, top management, the, of course, public company. And then they have zillions or consultants that we don't need. And we did all of that without increasing our own corporate budget, which is important. So where else do we have synergies. We have some synergies in costs right there. The other areas are some of our purchasing powers have improved because of the coupling of the and then go to market together is important. And I think those synergies are small in each area, but they add up to significant numbers. Don't give you 1 example. We have a gas and flame business that we bought from 3M. It's a really good business. When we bought it, it had about 12% margins. Last year, the margins went over 20%. FLIR has a gas detection camera that we're trying to couple the tour and sell it together. The same thing goes with enormous number of FLIR commercial products in the thermography business and a lot of our visible cameras. And we're trying to couple those together, and FLIR had some mid-market cameras. We coupled that already with high-end cameras. So there are a lot of synergies. I've kind of baked that in so far for next year in our 5% overall revenue growth to about $3.2 billion. But I think if we have the synergies going forward, it could improve more than that. But right now, we're trying to keep our stable or cost reductions so that we don't get smacked with some cost increases and then slowly work our synergies as we go forward. Yes. Just FLIR, let me go back to '20 because that's a good starting position. They were at $1.924 billion in '20. In '21, if you take before and after the acquisition, they went down 1.5% to $1.895. And that was primarily because of they didn't have the elevated skin temperature sales, okay? So if you take that as a basis, $1.895 billion, we're projecting a 5.5% revenue increase in 2022, all organic, to about $2 billion. If you take our legacy Digital Imaging businesses, they went up 15.6% from '20 to '21. We don't think that's sustainable. At this time, I mean I always emphasize at this time. We think that can go from $1.14 billion to $1.2 billion, which is another 5.3% increase. So if you combine the 2, you're talking about somewhere between about 5.4% increase in revenue, organically, all in. Does that answer your question? FLIR margin is going to go down a little bit primarily because of -- as I mentioned before, I don't know if you were on the call there, well the Q2 was really good because they produce most of that material earning in Q2. Their margins are going to be close to 24%. And our own legacy margins are going to be above 23.8%, which, by the way, that's 200 basis points higher than what we had in 2020. So if we can maintain that and increase it together, I think it's going to be tough. We may have a little reduction in overall margin, let's say, basis, 40 basis points, be close to 24%, which is pretty good. Our margins in digital imaging and our instrumentation are very close to one another as we're projecting in '22 at almost 24% each. And as I said, in aerospace and defense, we've called up to 22%. So I'm happy with that scenario. Sure. And I'll try not to emphasize brilliant management on Noah's part, because he's sitting here. No, let me take a couple of pieces of that. When the pandemic hit, our health care business has suffered because a lot of the selected X-ray treatment and even cancer treatment took a significant hit because the hospitals were overloaded. As things eased up a little bit, both our X-ray business and our X-ray source business went -- ticked up. And so it enjoyed a 14% increase. That's the highest in the quarter, that was up 19.5%. So it averaged about 13.4%. So we picked it up as the year went on. And that was really driven by the fact that people started having more surgeries and treatments, et cetera. In the machine vision business, our inspection businesses went up significantly throughout the year. And if you take our scientific cameras, which are also very important, they are used in all kinds of applications, including looking at details of called sources, and there you have very fast cameras, which we do. We started the year okay, but then it started picking up. And by quarter 4, it was over 36%. So it's nothing that happened all suddenly. It was just a slow increase in those businesses as we went along. And MEMS, we have a unique capability in both promo that we bought this MicroLine MEMS business. There's a scarcity of independent MEMS foundries, we are probably one of the top independent foundries in the world. And so with the shortages that are happening customers are coming where they can get stuff and where we can make them. And so that's helped us a lot too. That overall year-over-year increased 10% -- 9.4% but picked up almost 18% in Q4. So it's not any one thing, it's a lot of these little things adding up. What we're trying to do is we're trying to give conservative guidance for '22 because the comps are so tough. And then as I said before, we have to kind of tip to our way through these supply chain issues. I mean I guess the numbers are impressive, but the decent amount of that detail you gave there is COVID and some of the movement around that and then supply chain, all of which hopefully don't last forever or at least to the degree they do impact they have today. Do you worry about not only a tough compare, but then just a resetting back to normal of some of those items? Or you just have enough incremental penetration you can find to keep growing that business. I think just to walk out of my shoes, my conservative shoes, I'd be surprised if we don't do better as we go on. Yes. Yes. The answer is yes. And then -- by the way, there's a little difference between -- you covered for a long time. So you probably know those businesses historically, the trends, better than I do. Having said that, they may have projected revenues, robust revenues year-over-year. But I am not sure how many of them they hit -- so when I say $2 billion in 2022, I kind of feel that we can achieve that. Having said that, let's talk about this divestiture issue. You recall that at one time, they were thinking of selling their Raymarine businesses. Well, we don't because we have a huge number of marine businesses that fit tightly with that business. We have our whole Marine effort with all the capabilities we have in underwater imaging and then our LiDAR businesses, that's a go for us. That business has done very well in 2021, and we're projecting it to grow. And that's not even counting the synergies that we should enjoy in that domain. So frankly, I don't see any part of that business that we would divest. It's a good portfolio. That's why we pay a dear price for us to get it. Well, two reasons, Noah. First, as I mentioned before, the aerospace portion of that business came back because we took the cost out and the revenue -- any revenue increase just was really huge gross margins. So that increased tremendously. And frankly, in 2020, that was depressed versus 2019. That was depressed because of the cost cutting that we did in the aerospace portion of that. The other thing is on the defense portion of that, we had some really nice programs. We kind of stabilized that. We have really good new managers up there. And so that's helped us. And then lastly, in the aerospace part, we're enjoying good aftermarket. The aftermarket in that domain is pretty good. And OEM is coming back, while OEM margins are a little less than we enjoy we'd like to think, especially in '22 and '23, with the aftermarket because they have already our products on the aircraft. We think that will be good. And then we have some really exciting new products coming out like we've mentioned this, you may recall, we have an aircraft -- on-aircraft monitoring -- air monitoring product that we're introducing. And it's kind of built on their monitoring products that we have in our instrument businesses for outside the aircraft I think that's going to be a very good product because everybody when you get on an airplane, was the first thing you worry about nowadays is the quality of the year. No, I don't think so. I think the mix between OEM and aftermarket, the margin should stay about the same. But as we said, in overall aerospace and defense market we expect an 80-basis point increase in margin between '21 and '22 for the full year. Thank you, John. I'll now ask Jason to conclude our conference call."

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert, and then I will discuss our first quarter and full year 2022 outlook. In the fourth quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $295.6 million compared with cash flow of $236.4 million for the same period of 2020. Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $261.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared with $217 million in 2020. For the full year 2021, free cash flow was $794.6 million excluding FLIR transaction-related cash payments net of tax. Capital expenditures were $34 million in the fourth quarter compared to $19.4 million for the same period of 2020. Depreciation and amortization expense was $86.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared with $28.7 million in 2020. In addition, noncash inventory step-up expense for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $47.8 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $3.62 billion of net debt. That is approximately $4.1 billion of debt less cash of $474.7 million. Stock option compensation expense was $6.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to $5.9 million for the same period of 2020. Resulting from the FLIR acquisition, restricted stock unit expense for FLIR employees was $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.  Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the first quarter of 2022 will be in the range of $3.12 to $3.22 per share with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $4.02 to $4.10. And for the full year 2022, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $14.10 to $14.55, and on a non-GAAP basis, $17.60 to $18. The 2022 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 22.8%.  I'll now pass the call back to Robert."

Here is Robert. \nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Jason. Good morning and thank you for joining our earnings call. I'm very pleased with both our operational execution and our financial performance in the third quarter. We achieved record revenue 75.2% greater than last year driven by organic growth of 11.9% and the remaining 63.3% of sales increase contributed by Teledyne FLIR. Revenue increased organically in every major business group, but was especially strong in our Commercial Imaging and Electronic Test and Measurement Instrumentation businesses where organic growth for each was greater than 20% in the quarter. Furthermore, orders exceeded sales for the fourth consecutive quarter with a third quarter book-to-bill of 1.1. GAAP earnings per share of $2.81 increased 13.3% compared to last year and was $0.03 less than our record GAAP third quarter earnings achieved in 2019. However, excluding acquisition-related charges earnings were $4.34 per share in the third quarter an increase of 61.9% on a comparable basis from 2020. Cash flow was a third quarter record allowing repayment of $300 million of debt while our leverage ratio declined to 3.3% from 3.7% at the end of the second quarter. Teledyne FLIR performed strongly in its first full quarter. Integration efforts have been swift and we are increasingly excited about the long-term future with Teledyne. We continue to accelerate the pace of planned synergies and currently expect to achieve our annualized cost saving target of $80 million before the middle of 2022 as opposed to the end of 2022 as we described in our July earnings call and compared with 2024 as noted when we announced the transaction in January of 2021. Regarding our execution in the quarter, Teledyne is not immune to supply chain issues inflation and other operational challenges. However, to-date we've been successfully navigating and managing these issues. And today we are pleased to increase our full year sales, margin and earnings outlook compared outlook we presented in July. On a full year basis we now think a reasonable outlook for organic sales growth in 2021 is approximately 7% to 7.5% led by forecasted growth of almost 13% in Digital Imaging which excludes Teledyne FLIR. This translates to total sales of $4.59 billion with contribution of $2.4 billion from Digital Imaging including FLIR. I will now further comment on the performance of the four business segments. In our Digital Imaging segment, third quarter sales increased 217.3%, largely due to the FLIR acquisition, but organic growth in our combined commercial and government imaging businesses was also very strong at 17.9%. Sales of industrial and scientific vision systems were a record and healthcare sales returned to pre-pandemic levels. GAAP segment, operating margin was 12.5%. But adjusted for transaction costs and purchase accounting segment margin was 23.9%. In our Instrumentation segment, overall quarter sales increased 9% versus last year. Sales of test and electronic test and measurement systems, which include oscilloscopes and protocol analyzers were exceptionally strong and increased 20.8% year-over-year to record levels. Sales of Environmental Instruments increased 7.6% from last year with sales related to human health and safety market such as drug discovery and gas and flame detection being strongest in the quarter. Sales of Marine Instrumentation increased 3.2% in the quarter. In addition, orders were the strongest in the last six quarters with a quarter book-to-bill of 1.13. Overall, Instrumentation segment operating profit increased 24.3% with segment operating margin increasing 270 basis points or 247 basis points excluding intangible asset amortization. In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, third quarter sales increased 11.7%, driven by 8.4% growth in Defense, Space and Industrial sales, combined with a 27% increase in sales of commercial aerospace products versus last year's pandemic-related tough quarter. GAAP operating profit increased 34.5% with margin 375 basis points greater than last year. Finally, in the Engineered Systems segment, third quarter revenue increased 1.4% but operating profit and margin declined slightly, since we exited the higher-margin turbine engine business earlier this year. But before turning the call over to Sue, I want to comment on our margin and earnings outlook. For several years, we've been on a journey to move our overall operating margin from the low teens to over 20%. Over the last 2.5 years, we've made tremendous progress with \u2013 notwithstanding the pandemic and the recent supply chain and inflationary pressures. Today, the approximate $1 increase in our earnings outlook is primarily the result of further improvement in our full year 2021 forecasted operating margin, which excluding acquisition-related charges is 100 basis points better at approximately 21% from our 20% forecast in July. And now to, Sue. \nSue Main: Thank you, Robert and good morning, everyone. I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert, and then I will discuss our fourth quarter and full-year 2021 outlook. In the third quarter cash flow from operating activities was $192.8 million, including all acquisition-related costs. Excluding acquisition-related cash costs, net of tax cash from operations was $194.9 million compared with cash flow of $150.3 million for the same period of 2020. Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, excluding acquisition-related costs was $165.7 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared with $135.1 million in 2020. Capital expenditures were $29.2 million in the third quarter compared to $15.2 million for the same period of 2020. Depreciation and amortization expense was $90.2 million for the third quarter of 2021 compared with $29.2 million in 2020. In addition, non-cash inventory step-up expense for the third quarter of 2021 was $35.2 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $3.89 billion of net debt. That is approximately $4.44 billion of debt less cash of $561.8 million. Stock option compensation expense was $5.8 million for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $5.7 million for the same period of 2020. Resulting from the FLIR acquisition, restricted stock unit expense for FLIR employees was $1.8 million in the third quarter of 2021. Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2021, will be in the range of $2.53 to $2.69 per share with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $4.07 to $4.17. And for the full-year 2021 our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $9.13 to $9.29; and on a non-GAAP basis $16.35 and to $16.45 compared with our prior outlook of $15.25 to $15.50. The 2021 full-year estimated tax rate excluding discrete items. is expected to be 23.9%. In addition, we currently expect less discrete tax items in 2021 compared with 2020. I'll now pass the call back to Robert. \nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Sue. We would now like to take your questions. Operator Brad, if you're ready to proceed with the question and answers please go ahead. Brad? \nOperator:  And we can go right now to Greg Konrad with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nGreg Konrad: Good morning and great quarter.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Greg. \nGreg Konrad: Maybe just to start I mean you talked about a lot of the higher outlook based on the margin. At least on the beat it seems pretty broad-based across segments. I mean how do you think about the drivers there and just sustainability given tailwinds or potential headwinds? And I think previously you've always had a target of how much margin expansion you'd like to capture per year. I mean has anything changed around that as margins have reset higher? \nRobert Mehrabian: Well, I think, Greg, our expectation is that our margins will keep increasing, as we projected. We think it's still maybe 60 basis points per year above where we are. And I say that -- perhaps earlier I may have said the 100 basis points but our margins have moved up to 21% on Q3. So it's going to get a little tougher but we intend to improve margins as we go along.\nGreg Konrad: And then, just -- I mean, you mentioned accelerating the FLIR synergies the middle of next year. I mean, what allowed you to pull that forward? And maybe what does that mean for the longer-term potential to drive productivity and take costs out of the business?\nRobert Mehrabian: I think, in addition to wages, which are significant about -- net benefits about $45 million. The more important thing that we've been able to manage to do is reduce dependence on third-party consultants, legal savings and frankly, lobbyists. As you know, Greg, we don't have lobbyists at Teledyne. So, of course, the Board fees and public relations and so on, those help. But third-party consultants and legal lobbyists and others, I'd say $28 million, $30 million. \nGreg Konrad: And then, just last one for me. I mean, you briefly mentioned inflation before. I mean, how do you think about the offsets there? How much within the supply chain versus -- are there specific areas of the business where maybe you have more flexibility around pricing? Just trying to think about broader risk of price mix.\nRobert Mehrabian: So far when we look at the PPI, inflations are pretty high. We're not experiencing as much as we anticipated in the price pressure to us from our suppliers. Having said that, some of our suppliers more recently have come out with 20%, 25% price increases. Good part of it is, we have long-term agreements with some of them. So those would moderate. As for ourselves, so far this year, we've been able to increase prices on the average about 2%. What that means, in some businesses, we can't obviously increase prices, because we have long-term contracts Greg. But in other businesses, we do have the ability to increase prices. So on the average, we've increased 2%. Our intention is to continue doing that. And perhaps, especially, next year, we'll start early and see how much elasticity we have in our prices.\nGreg Konrad: Thank you.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Greg.\nOperator: And next we can go to the line of Mike Maugeri with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nMike Maugeri: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for the time. So I'm just curious, within your government business, are there any watch items like new starts or programs with significant ramps that you're keeping a closer eye on while the U.S. is operating under this continuing resolution?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes, Mike. I think -- first let me start by saying our government businesses are about 26%, 27% of our total. The two opportunities that we are keeping an eye on are underwater vehicles and there is a medium underwater UUV that the government is soliciting proposals on. And we're bidding on that across the Engineered Systems and our Marine businesses together, just like we do with gliders and other things. And then there's the large underwater vehicle that we expect to bid on. Some of the other -- in Digital Imaging, we have the wide field of view or what's called WFOV early warning satellite. That's an opportunity for us. Our next-generation overhead persistent infrared, OPIR, is another one. And the downside, if there is a downside, is we have to rebid at our NASA program, what we call MASI, which is the Mission Systems program later this year. We bid on it yet, but the decision would be later. And there's always a risk when you're doing that. But overall, there's a whole range of new programs that are available to us even under the continuing resolution.\nMike Maugeri: Got it. And then, to the point in your release about the recovery in the longer-cycle business, now that you have that would you sort of be willing to talk about the early trends that you're seeing into next year within the business?\nRobert Mehrabian: Right now, I would say that opportunities would be in our Marine businesses primarily, because the oil prices, as you're well aware Mike, have moved up significantly. And we had a book-to-bill of 1.13 this quarter. We also think that we will have more opportunities in Aerospace and Defense businesses, especially on the aerospace side as people start traveling more. We think that Marine may have an upside next year of maybe $25 million and controls, which is our computers that go on various aircraft. That can have a similar number $20 million to $25 million. Those are longer-cycle businesses, and so far they look all right. On the shorter cycle which the other side of the Instrument, we enjoyed a 9% increase overall. And T&M, our test and measurement is doing well. And we hope that with our new products that we keep developing that will have some bump next year too.\nMike Maugeri: Got it. Thank you.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: And next we can go to the line of Elizabeth Grenfell with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nElizabeth Grenfell: Hi. Good morning. When we think about the FLIR integration and the acceleration and the timeline to achieving the initial cost savings, where do you think we could potentially see additional upside to, I think before the top side had been to $100 million. I mean how much additional headwind or how much additional headroom is there into achieving additional cost synergies and savings?\nRobert Mehrabian: Elizabeth, let me start with, I hope I didn't misquote myself. Our top side savings for which we moved forward from 2024 to 2022 is $80 million. Having said that, there are other opportunities, but there would be more opportunities in developing products between FLIR's offerings and Teledyne's offerings. And as we move the revenue up and keep our cost down, we think that will help improve our margins. But we haven't factored that in the revenue synergies yet, because right now we're still integrating. We've integrated some of the businesses very quickly. Like, they make midrange vision systems and make high-end vision systems and those we've coupled right away and that's worked out really well. But we're still working on the rest of the stuff. Like in the Marine, Raymarine and our Marine businesses, there are opportunities. There are opportunities between their Raymarine businesses and our software businesses and underwater software businesses at Karas. We're working on all of those. As we do that I think those would create more savings as we go forward.\nElizabeth Grenfell: Okay. And then, as you continue to delever, how are you considering or thinking about the M&A environment and additional opportunities to grow inorganically?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. Elizabeth, first on the delivering, we're not sitting at 3.3x net debt to EBITDA. We hope to take that down to about 2.7 by the end of 2022. That would be our marker. As we look at that when you're, kind of, start getting confident that you're going to go there you start looking at larger acquisition potentials because those things take a little time to get eight, nine months. But in the interim, we will look at and we are looking at smaller acquisitions. As we did back in 2017 when we acquired e2v, our debt to EBITDA ratio was pretty high. We very quickly delevered over the next three years. But in the interim we also bought about $500 million of smaller assets. So we'll do the shorter term. We'll do small acquisitions. In the longer term, we've promised the rating agencies that we won't do anything very big but then we are sure we can hit our targets.\nElizabeth Grenfell: Okay. Thank you.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you Elizabeth.\nOperator: And next we can go to the line of Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nJim Ricchiuti: Hi, good morning. Robert, a question on the FLIR business. Organic growth there looks like it was fairly modest. And I don't recall them having much of an EST contribution in last year's Q3. Is any of this either portfolio realignment? Their commercial business appears to be doing okay. I think the machine vision business probably was pretty healthy. Is it their government related business that was a little slower?\nRobert Mehrabian: Actually Jim if I may their EST business, which was out of their components, which they make the sensors and the solutions businesses, the commercial solution businesses was -- generated about $40 million in revenue last year in Q3 let's say $35 million to $40 million, and their Q3 last year including that was about $466 million. This year's third quarter the revenue is $474 million. So if you -- with no EST revenue. So if you were to look at it, apples-to-apples and take the $40 million out of the $466 million, you're looking more like a $426 million, $427 million last year versus the $474 million. So there's significant growth there. Second, they've had -- we've had reasonably good growth in our Defense segment, the FLIR Defense segment of about 3.5% this year versus last year, primarily coming from the unmanned systems. So there's been growth in the commercial as well as in the defense businesses. If you were to moderate things if you were to subtract the EST sales last year third quarter.\nJim Ricchiuti: No. Thanks for clarifying that. You're right. They did about $90 million in Q2, and even though it was down to $40 million Q3 that's still a fairly significant contribution. Thanks for pointing that out, Robert. On the test and measurement business, you guys have performed really well there. And what I'm wondering is structurally is there anything changing in that business in that market? Is it market share gains? Is it the activity you're seeing in the protocol analyzer business? Are you gaining share do you think in the scopes business?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yeah, Jim both. What -- first of all, we're hitting on all cylinders on our protocol analyzer businesses. If you combine our protocol analyzer and oscilloscopes sales that was a record for us, all-time record this quarter. We see very strong demand for our protocol analyzers like PCI Express, as well as high-definition multimedia video products. The other thing that we've been successful at is we've combined our oscilloscopes with our protocol analyzers, which saves significant amount of time for engineers that are developing interfaces between products. And that's been a real winner for us. So it's a combination. Good market for oscilloscopes, great market for protocol analyzers and an upside when you combine the two together with new products.\nJim Ricchiuti: Got it. And two quick final questions. Just -- and this next question may be difficult to answer, but you do seem to be navigating the component environment fairly well. But I'm wondering if you can say whether there's been any identifiable disruption to revenues. In other words, revenues that you perhaps would have been able to achieve in the quarter but you just -- it's just challenging to get parts?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yeah. Jim, that's a great question. Yeah, I can answer that because we track that one very closely. First, in the quarter, I'd say we probably didn't enjoy about $40 million of revenue that we could have not because of shortages. Now we were fortunate because the way our portfolio of business is laid out as you're very familiar with we can make some of that up in other places. We have a balanced portfolio and these shortages are not hitting everything we do. And by the way those are not lost sales. They just moved to Q4. We expect to have a similar number in Q4. We're looking at Q1 of next year and see similar issues. So we -- it's kind of a shifting game, but we make it up by pulling in from other parts of our portfolio. Having said that, we have an extremely active program from our -- the procurement side where we have a major initiative in procurement automation, but we also have procurement working with our -- interestingly with our suppliers in the Far East who provide us PCBAs. They have access to components that go into those PCBAs and they're helping us get some of the computer chips and other components that we need. And we also have some dedicated people in the Far East doing the same thing. So it's a combination. Take the $40 million, push it forward. Then take $40 million from next -- this current quarter, push it forward, pull in some stuff where we can and kind of as I said before we're navigating it. I think so far, we've done okay.\nJim Ricchiuti: Got it. And last question Robert, you alluded to a fairly strong book-to-bill in Marine. Can you give us a sense of book-to-bill in the various segments Digital Imaging and the A&D and... \nRobert Mehrabian: Sure. Sure, Jim. Let me start with Marine. I gave that. In environmental and test and measurement, it's 1.05 in Q3. Recall that we had -- in T&M we had record sales in Q3. So 1.05 is pretty good. Digital Imaging I'd say 1.12; AD&E which is our Defense and Aerospace businesses 1.06; Engineered Systems 1.05 about Jim; and overall, that brings it to about 1.1.\nJim Ricchiuti: Got it. Thanks very much. Congratulations on the quarter.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Jim.\nOperator: And we'll move to the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Good morning, guys.\nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning.\nAndrew Buscaglia: On that book-to-bill comment, can you -- within Digital Imaging, can you indicate how bookings are for FLIR?\nRobert Mehrabian: They're modest, but they're in the 1.1 in the Digital Imaging side. \nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. Okay. So still above 1 though? \nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. \nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. Okay. And then -- sorry what was that? \nRobert Mehrabian: No I said in the Digital Imaging side. The total -- yes. \nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. And you talked fairly positively about government. You're still gaining your fair share of government awards potentially. Would FLIR help -- are there any related to FLIR that you could talk to? And then maybe not so much near term, but anything you see on the horizon in 2022 as that was always kind of a sore spot for them in terms of winning new awards that are meaningful? \nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. I got to tell you that we're holding our own there. Things have moved a little to the right. Probably we got some nice orders especially for example in the US border control where we delivered light vehicle surveillance systems. We have some DARPA program on -- that could lead to other activities in the personal protected biosystems. Overall, I think we're holding our own there and I expect we'd do okay. But again, Andrew what is -- to me what's important is, even if you look at our government businesses with FLIR, we have a balanced portfolio. And unfortunately, they may have suffered a little bit because too focused the portfolio. We have a balanced portfolio between our Engineered Systems, the FLIR unmanned both ground and air systems and integrated systems. And then we have of course our Defense programs in our Aerospace and Defense. So we gained about 3.5% in those programs -- in our government programs in Q3. That may sound modest when you look at the overall growth of 11.9% organic, but I'm happy with that. If we can keep that pace in this time going forward, we should be okay. \nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. And maybe just lastly, you're seeing some of your longer-cycle businesses pick up a bit. I know it's small, but can you just comment on what's going on with Energy specifically your sales tied to Energy exposure? \nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. I think the first is because of the oil prices, we expect that we get about a 3% increase from 2021 to 2022 in total sales from let's say, $150 million up maybe to $175 million. That's a little more than 3%, as I think about it but -- that's more like 2.1%. But having said that, again, I'll fall back on what we've constructed our portfolio. We get 3% here 4% there. We get Defense. We get Energy. We get our short-cycle businesses. And then of course Digital Imaging, we're hitting on all cylinders there. We think we're going to be okay. So, there's upside in Energy, but I'm not counting on it to move the whole company. The whole company would move because of all the pieces that we have put together that protect us by the way on the downside as you well know Andrew.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. Thanks Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you. Do we have any other questions coming up.\nOperator: Currently we just have -- Joe's line is open and nobody's following Joe. \nRobert Mehrabian: Okay. Joe? \nJoe Giordano: Guys can you hear me? \nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. Yes. \nJoe Giordano: So you kind of hinted at this already, but if you were to kind of think about FLIR ex the EST, what do you think is like the true growth rate that you're exiting 2021 into '22? And is that kind of a sustainable rate into '22?\nRobert Mehrabian: Right now, if you subtract out EST which as I mentioned, we had no revenue this year, I think it would be in the mid-single digits, just like we think Teledyne should be.\nJoe Giordano: Yes. And then, if you were to contemplate -- yes, go ahead.\nRobert Mehrabian: No. I'll just say this. When we started the year, we -- Joe, when we started the year, we said our organic growth would be 5.5% to 6%. As we get to summertime in July, we said it'd be 6.6%. And then, when we came today, I said it'd be between 7% and 7.5%, 7.25%. So, I'm hoping and I use the word hoping that when I say mid-single digits like 5% that would be a good beginning for us next year.\nJoe Giordano: Yes. Understood. If you're talking about getting to like an $80 million run rate in savings by mid '22 for FLIR, what does that kind of imply for a margin there? I mean, if you want to talk EBITDA, whatever is easiest to talk about?\nRobert Mehrabian: Well, I think, I mentioned earlier, we anticipate to improve our margins 50 to 60 basis points across the company year-over-year. And whether it's non-GAAP or EBITDA -- by the way, our EBITDA now is about -- this quarter was 24.2%. I think that will help improve our non-GAAP margins up. For FLIR today, it's about 24%, which is significantly higher than we've enjoyed historically. And for 2021 our overall margin, we expect the non-GAAP margin, which excludes of course the intangibles and cost stuff associated with the purchase accounting. If you go to 21% and if we can enjoy 50 basis points on top of that, some of the contribution -- FLIR's contribution coming from FLIR, we'd be very happy with that. Again, bear with me on this Joe. I'm giving you what I'm seeing in January happening throughout next year. As we get to January, if nothing terrible happens in the world, hopefully we'll do better. But right now, I'll stay with the 50 basis points.\nJoe Giordano: And then just one last question more high level. There's been talk -- stories recently about China with nuclear gliders and suborbital and -- can you just talk about like what this means for space-based detection and sensing and where you guys are positioned there and how that market can develop further, given like kind of new threats that we need to deal with?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. We have two examples that I can give you. One of them is, in our Engineered Systems segment. We have a contract, where we're developing a wind tunnel for vehicles that are of the nature that you just mentioned. And that's very important because to test hypersonic vehicles, you want to have a wind tunnel to be able to do that -- a hot wind tunnel. We have a small program, $50 million, which we think will be followed by another bigger program that is specifically for hypersonic vehicles. On the other side, we do have sensors in the A&D segment of FLIR and also especially that -- I meant Digital Imaging in general. But we have sensors that are being developed and used computers -- edge computers that are located on various vehicles for detection of high-speed missiles. And if that market starts growing then we do have a series of products. And then we have one that, I cannot describe too much. We do have a very strong program \u2013 programs I say, multiple programs in our imaging businesses here in Thousand Oaks that's the one that locates infrared and other sensors on satellites and space vehicles. And those are classified programs and we're enjoying some really good opportunities. That actually led to growth of our imaging programs.\nJoe Giordano: Thanks, guys.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you very much.\nOperator: We do have a follow-up question. We'll go to the line of Mike Maugeri with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nMike Maugeri: Hey. Thanks for let in me back-on. Unless, I missed it somewhere Robert, would you be able to go around the horn on the change in growth rate at the segments that drove the change in guidance?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yeah. Let me see. I can do that. So in July, we anticipated that the growth rate in Instruments would be about 6%, 6.2% and we expect that to continue. In Digital Imaging in July, we anticipated about 11.8%. We're raising that to about 13%. In our Aerospace and Defense segment in July, we anticipated 4.4% about and now we think it'll be closer to 6%. Engineered Systems we expect it to shrink about 1.7%, and it will shrink 1.7%. When you add those up, Mike in July we anticipated that our organic growth would be about 6.6%. If you add the numbers up that I just mentioned round them up, it'll be between 7% to 7.5% let's say, 7.25% organic growth. And that's kind of going around the horn as you mentioned.\nMike Maugeri: Thank you.\nRobert Mehrabian: For sure.\nOperator: And currently, no further questions in queue.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Brad. I'll now ask Jason to conclude the conference call please.\nJason VanWees: Thanks, Robert. And again, if anyone has follow-up questions my number is on the earnings release. Please feel free to call and e-mail me. And Brad, if you could give the replay information and conclude the call we'd be appreciative. Thanks everyone.\nOperator: Certainly. Thank you.

            "content": "Thank you, Jason. Good morning and thank you for joining our earnings call. I'm very pleased with both our operational execution and our financial performance in the third quarter. We achieved record revenue 75.2% greater than last year driven by organic growth of 11.9% and the remaining 63.3% of sales increase contributed by Teledyne FLIR. Revenue increased organically in every major business group, but was especially strong in our Commercial Imaging and Electronic Test and Measurement Instrumentation businesses where organic growth for each was greater than 20% in the quarter. Furthermore, orders exceeded sales for the fourth consecutive quarter with a third quarter book-to-bill of 1.1. GAAP earnings per share of $2.81 increased 13.3% compared to last year and was $0.03 less than our record GAAP third quarter earnings achieved in 2019. However, excluding acquisition-related charges earnings were $4.34 per share in the third quarter an increase of 61.9% on a comparable basis from 2020. Cash flow was a third quarter record allowing repayment of $300 million of debt while our leverage ratio declined to 3.3% from 3.7% at the end of the second quarter. Teledyne FLIR performed strongly in its first full quarter. Integration efforts have been swift and we are increasingly excited about the long-term future with Teledyne. We continue to accelerate the pace of planned synergies and currently expect to achieve our annualized cost saving target of $80 million before the middle of 2022 as opposed to the end of 2022 as we described in our July earnings call and compared with 2024 as noted when we announced the transaction in January of 2021. Regarding our execution in the quarter, Teledyne is not immune to supply chain issues inflation and other operational challenges. However, to-date we've been successfully navigating and managing these issues. And today we are pleased to increase our full year sales, margin and earnings outlook compared outlook we presented in July. On a full year basis we now think a reasonable outlook for organic sales growth in 2021 is approximately 7% to 7.5% led by forecasted growth of almost 13% in Digital Imaging which excludes Teledyne FLIR. This translates to total sales of $4.59 billion with contribution of $2.4 billion from Digital Imaging including FLIR. I will now further comment on the performance of the four business segments. In our Digital Imaging segment, third quarter sales increased 217.3%, largely due to the FLIR acquisition, but organic growth in our combined commercial and government imaging businesses was also very strong at 17.9%. Sales of industrial and scientific vision systems were a record and healthcare sales returned to pre-pandemic levels. GAAP segment, operating margin was 12.5%. But adjusted for transaction costs and purchase accounting segment margin was 23.9%. In our Instrumentation segment, overall quarter sales increased 9% versus last year. Sales of test and electronic test and measurement systems, which include oscilloscopes and protocol analyzers were exceptionally strong and increased 20.8% year-over-year to record levels. Sales of Environmental Instruments increased 7.6% from last year with sales related to human health and safety market such as drug discovery and gas and flame detection being strongest in the quarter. Sales of Marine Instrumentation increased 3.2% in the quarter. In addition, orders were the strongest in the last six quarters with a quarter book-to-bill of 1.13. Overall, Instrumentation segment operating profit increased 24.3% with segment operating margin increasing 270 basis points or 247 basis points excluding intangible asset amortization. In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, third quarter sales increased 11.7%, driven by 8.4% growth in Defense, Space and Industrial sales, combined with a 27% increase in sales of commercial aerospace products versus last year's pandemic-related tough quarter. GAAP operating profit increased 34.5% with margin 375 basis points greater than last year. Finally, in the Engineered Systems segment, third quarter revenue increased 1.4% but operating profit and margin declined slightly, since we exited the higher-margin turbine engine business earlier this year. But before turning the call over to Sue, I want to comment on our margin and earnings outlook. For several years, we've been on a journey to move our overall operating margin from the low teens to over 20%. Over the last 2.5 years, we've made tremendous progress with \u2013 notwithstanding the pandemic and the recent supply chain and inflationary pressures. Today, the approximate $1 increase in our earnings outlook is primarily the result of further improvement in our full year 2021 forecasted operating margin, which excluding acquisition-related charges is 100 basis points better at approximately 21% from our 20% forecast in July. And now to, Sue. Thank you, Sue. We would now like to take your questions. Operator Brad, if you're ready to proceed with the question and answers please go ahead. Brad? Thank you, Greg. Well, I think, Greg, our expectation is that our margins will keep increasing, as we projected. We think it's still maybe 60 basis points per year above where we are. And I say that -- perhaps earlier I may have said the 100 basis points but our margins have moved up to 21% on Q3. So it's going to get a little tougher but we intend to improve margins as we go along. I think, in addition to wages, which are significant about -- net benefits about $45 million. The more important thing that we've been able to manage to do is reduce dependence on third-party consultants, legal savings and frankly, lobbyists. As you know, Greg, we don't have lobbyists at Teledyne. So, of course, the Board fees and public relations and so on, those help. But third-party consultants and legal lobbyists and others, I'd say $28 million, $30 million. So far when we look at the PPI, inflations are pretty high. We're not experiencing as much as we anticipated in the price pressure to us from our suppliers. Having said that, some of our suppliers more recently have come out with 20%, 25% price increases. Good part of it is, we have long-term agreements with some of them. So those would moderate. As for ourselves, so far this year, we've been able to increase prices on the average about 2%. What that means, in some businesses, we can't obviously increase prices, because we have long-term contracts Greg. But in other businesses, we do have the ability to increase prices. So on the average, we've increased 2%. Our intention is to continue doing that. And perhaps, especially, next year, we'll start early and see how much elasticity we have in our prices. Thank you, Greg. Yes, Mike. I think -- first let me start by saying our government businesses are about 26%, 27% of our total. The two opportunities that we are keeping an eye on are underwater vehicles and there is a medium underwater UUV that the government is soliciting proposals on. And we're bidding on that across the Engineered Systems and our Marine businesses together, just like we do with gliders and other things. And then there's the large underwater vehicle that we expect to bid on. Some of the other -- in Digital Imaging, we have the wide field of view or what's called WFOV early warning satellite. That's an opportunity for us. Our next-generation overhead persistent infrared, OPIR, is another one. And the downside, if there is a downside, is we have to rebid at our NASA program, what we call MASI, which is the Mission Systems program later this year. We bid on it yet, but the decision would be later. And there's always a risk when you're doing that. But overall, there's a whole range of new programs that are available to us even under the continuing resolution. Right now, I would say that opportunities would be in our Marine businesses primarily, because the oil prices, as you're well aware Mike, have moved up significantly. And we had a book-to-bill of 1.13 this quarter. We also think that we will have more opportunities in Aerospace and Defense businesses, especially on the aerospace side as people start traveling more. We think that Marine may have an upside next year of maybe $25 million and controls, which is our computers that go on various aircraft. That can have a similar number $20 million to $25 million. Those are longer-cycle businesses, and so far they look all right. On the shorter cycle which the other side of the Instrument, we enjoyed a 9% increase overall. And T&M, our test and measurement is doing well. And we hope that with our new products that we keep developing that will have some bump next year too. Thank you, Mike. Elizabeth, let me start with, I hope I didn't misquote myself. Our top side savings for which we moved forward from 2024 to 2022 is $80 million. Having said that, there are other opportunities, but there would be more opportunities in developing products between FLIR's offerings and Teledyne's offerings. And as we move the revenue up and keep our cost down, we think that will help improve our margins. But we haven't factored that in the revenue synergies yet, because right now we're still integrating. We've integrated some of the businesses very quickly. Like, they make midrange vision systems and make high-end vision systems and those we've coupled right away and that's worked out really well. But we're still working on the rest of the stuff. Like in the Marine, Raymarine and our Marine businesses, there are opportunities. There are opportunities between their Raymarine businesses and our software businesses and underwater software businesses at Karas. We're working on all of those. As we do that I think those would create more savings as we go forward. Yes. Elizabeth, first on the delivering, we're not sitting at 3.3x net debt to EBITDA. We hope to take that down to about 2.7 by the end of 2022. That would be our marker. As we look at that when you're, kind of, start getting confident that you're going to go there you start looking at larger acquisition potentials because those things take a little time to get eight, nine months. But in the interim, we will look at and we are looking at smaller acquisitions. As we did back in 2017 when we acquired e2v, our debt to EBITDA ratio was pretty high. We very quickly delevered over the next three years. But in the interim we also bought about $500 million of smaller assets. So we'll do the shorter term. We'll do small acquisitions. In the longer term, we've promised the rating agencies that we won't do anything very big but then we are sure we can hit our targets. Thank you Elizabeth. Actually Jim if I may their EST business, which was out of their components, which they make the sensors and the solutions businesses, the commercial solution businesses was -- generated about $40 million in revenue last year in Q3 let's say $35 million to $40 million, and their Q3 last year including that was about $466 million. This year's third quarter the revenue is $474 million. So if you -- with no EST revenue. So if you were to look at it, apples-to-apples and take the $40 million out of the $466 million, you're looking more like a $426 million, $427 million last year versus the $474 million. So there's significant growth there. Second, they've had -- we've had reasonably good growth in our Defense segment, the FLIR Defense segment of about 3.5% this year versus last year, primarily coming from the unmanned systems. So there's been growth in the commercial as well as in the defense businesses. If you were to moderate things if you were to subtract the EST sales last year third quarter. Yeah, Jim both. What -- first of all, we're hitting on all cylinders on our protocol analyzer businesses. If you combine our protocol analyzer and oscilloscopes sales that was a record for us, all-time record this quarter. We see very strong demand for our protocol analyzers like PCI Express, as well as high-definition multimedia video products. The other thing that we've been successful at is we've combined our oscilloscopes with our protocol analyzers, which saves significant amount of time for engineers that are developing interfaces between products. And that's been a real winner for us. So it's a combination. Good market for oscilloscopes, great market for protocol analyzers and an upside when you combine the two together with new products. Yeah. Jim, that's a great question. Yeah, I can answer that because we track that one very closely. First, in the quarter, I'd say we probably didn't enjoy about $40 million of revenue that we could have not because of shortages. Now we were fortunate because the way our portfolio of business is laid out as you're very familiar with we can make some of that up in other places. We have a balanced portfolio and these shortages are not hitting everything we do. And by the way those are not lost sales. They just moved to Q4. We expect to have a similar number in Q4. We're looking at Q1 of next year and see similar issues. So we -- it's kind of a shifting game, but we make it up by pulling in from other parts of our portfolio. Having said that, we have an extremely active program from our -- the procurement side where we have a major initiative in procurement automation, but we also have procurement working with our -- interestingly with our suppliers in the Far East who provide us PCBAs. They have access to components that go into those PCBAs and they're helping us get some of the computer chips and other components that we need. And we also have some dedicated people in the Far East doing the same thing. So it's a combination. Take the $40 million, push it forward. Then take $40 million from next -- this current quarter, push it forward, pull in some stuff where we can and kind of as I said before we're navigating it. I think so far, we've done okay. Sure. Sure, Jim. Let me start with Marine. I gave that. In environmental and test and measurement, it's 1.05 in Q3. Recall that we had -- in T&M we had record sales in Q3. So 1.05 is pretty good. Digital Imaging I'd say 1.12; AD&E which is our Defense and Aerospace businesses 1.06; Engineered Systems 1.05 about Jim; and overall, that brings it to about 1.1. Thank you, Jim. Good morning. They're modest, but they're in the 1.1 in the Digital Imaging side. Yes. No I said in the Digital Imaging side. The total -- yes. Yes. I got to tell you that we're holding our own there. Things have moved a little to the right. Probably we got some nice orders especially for example in the US border control where we delivered light vehicle surveillance systems. We have some DARPA program on -- that could lead to other activities in the personal protected biosystems. Overall, I think we're holding our own there and I expect we'd do okay. But again, Andrew what is -- to me what's important is, even if you look at our government businesses with FLIR, we have a balanced portfolio. And unfortunately, they may have suffered a little bit because too focused the portfolio. We have a balanced portfolio between our Engineered Systems, the FLIR unmanned both ground and air systems and integrated systems. And then we have of course our Defense programs in our Aerospace and Defense. So we gained about 3.5% in those programs -- in our government programs in Q3. That may sound modest when you look at the overall growth of 11.9% organic, but I'm happy with that. If we can keep that pace in this time going forward, we should be okay. Yes. I think the first is because of the oil prices, we expect that we get about a 3% increase from 2021 to 2022 in total sales from let's say, $150 million up maybe to $175 million. That's a little more than 3%, as I think about it but -- that's more like 2.1%. But having said that, again, I'll fall back on what we've constructed our portfolio. We get 3% here 4% there. We get Defense. We get Energy. We get our short-cycle businesses. And then of course Digital Imaging, we're hitting on all cylinders there. We think we're going to be okay. So, there's upside in Energy, but I'm not counting on it to move the whole company. The whole company would move because of all the pieces that we have put together that protect us by the way on the downside as you well know Andrew. Thank you. Do we have any other questions coming up. Okay. Joe? Yes. Yes. Right now, if you subtract out EST which as I mentioned, we had no revenue this year, I think it would be in the mid-single digits, just like we think Teledyne should be. No. I'll just say this. When we started the year, we -- Joe, when we started the year, we said our organic growth would be 5.5% to 6%. As we get to summertime in July, we said it'd be 6.6%. And then, when we came today, I said it'd be between 7% and 7.5%, 7.25%. So, I'm hoping and I use the word hoping that when I say mid-single digits like 5% that would be a good beginning for us next year. Well, I think, I mentioned earlier, we anticipate to improve our margins 50 to 60 basis points across the company year-over-year. And whether it's non-GAAP or EBITDA -- by the way, our EBITDA now is about -- this quarter was 24.2%. I think that will help improve our non-GAAP margins up. For FLIR today, it's about 24%, which is significantly higher than we've enjoyed historically. And for 2021 our overall margin, we expect the non-GAAP margin, which excludes of course the intangibles and cost stuff associated with the purchase accounting. If you go to 21% and if we can enjoy 50 basis points on top of that, some of the contribution -- FLIR's contribution coming from FLIR, we'd be very happy with that. Again, bear with me on this Joe. I'm giving you what I'm seeing in January happening throughout next year. As we get to January, if nothing terrible happens in the world, hopefully we'll do better. But right now, I'll stay with the 50 basis points. Yes. We have two examples that I can give you. One of them is, in our Engineered Systems segment. We have a contract, where we're developing a wind tunnel for vehicles that are of the nature that you just mentioned. And that's very important because to test hypersonic vehicles, you want to have a wind tunnel to be able to do that -- a hot wind tunnel. We have a small program, $50 million, which we think will be followed by another bigger program that is specifically for hypersonic vehicles. On the other side, we do have sensors in the A&D segment of FLIR and also especially that -- I meant Digital Imaging in general. But we have sensors that are being developed and used computers -- edge computers that are located on various vehicles for detection of high-speed missiles. And if that market starts growing then we do have a series of products. And then we have one that, I cannot describe too much. We do have a very strong program \u2013 programs I say, multiple programs in our imaging businesses here in Thousand Oaks that's the one that locates infrared and other sensors on satellites and space vehicles. And those are classified programs and we're enjoying some really good opportunities. That actually led to growth of our imaging programs. Thank you very much. Yeah. Let me see. I can do that. So in July, we anticipated that the growth rate in Instruments would be about 6%, 6.2% and we expect that to continue. In Digital Imaging in July, we anticipated about 11.8%. We're raising that to about 13%. In our Aerospace and Defense segment in July, we anticipated 4.4% about and now we think it'll be closer to 6%. Engineered Systems we expect it to shrink about 1.7%, and it will shrink 1.7%. When you add those up, Mike in July we anticipated that our organic growth would be about 6.6%. If you add the numbers up that I just mentioned round them up, it'll be between 7% to 7.5% let's say, 7.25% organic growth. And that's kind of going around the horn as you mentioned. For sure. Thank you, Brad. I'll now ask Jason to conclude the conference call please."

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert, and then I will discuss our fourth quarter and full-year 2021 outlook. In the third quarter cash flow from operating activities was $192.8 million, including all acquisition-related costs. Excluding acquisition-related cash costs, net of tax cash from operations was $194.9 million compared with cash flow of $150.3 million for the same period of 2020. Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, excluding acquisition-related costs was $165.7 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared with $135.1 million in 2020. Capital expenditures were $29.2 million in the third quarter compared to $15.2 million for the same period of 2020. Depreciation and amortization expense was $90.2 million for the third quarter of 2021 compared with $29.2 million in 2020. In addition, non-cash inventory step-up expense for the third quarter of 2021 was $35.2 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $3.89 billion of net debt. That is approximately $4.44 billion of debt less cash of $561.8 million. Stock option compensation expense was $5.8 million for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $5.7 million for the same period of 2020. Resulting from the FLIR acquisition, restricted stock unit expense for FLIR employees was $1.8 million in the third quarter of 2021. Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2021, will be in the range of $2.53 to $2.69 per share with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $4.07 to $4.17. And for the full-year 2021 our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $9.13 to $9.29; and on a non-GAAP basis $16.35 and to $16.45 compared with our prior outlook of $15.25 to $15.50. The 2021 full-year estimated tax rate excluding discrete items. is expected to be 23.9%. In addition, we currently expect less discrete tax items in 2021 compared with 2020. I'll now pass the call back to Robert."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Teledyne Second Quarter Earnings Call 2021.  As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. And I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jason VanWees. Please go ahead.\nJason VanWees: Thank you and good morning everyone. This is Jason VanWees, Executive Vice President, and I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to Teledyne\u2019s second quarter earnings release conference call. And of course, we released our earnings earlier this morning before the market opened.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Jason and good morning and thank you for joining our earnings call. For over two decades now, we have continuously improved our portfolio of businesses, our operations and our financial performance, and along the way, significantly compounded earnings, cash flow and shareholder returns. It is worth noting that just over 10 years ago, a major milestone occurred when we divested our aviation piston engine business and all of its associated liabilities. While initiated earlier, immediately following that divestiture, we accelerated our pace of change by making increasingly significant and successful acquisitions within our digital imaging and instrumentation businesses. Our recent acquisition of FLIR accelerates Teledyne\u2019s evolution into a more attractive higher margin industrial technology company, while at the same time maintaining our balanced portfolio, primarily focused on commercial markets, but with a resilient and predictable backbone of government businesses. For example, in the second quarter of 2021, 75% of total company sales were derived from U.S. commercial and international customers and 25% of sales from the U.S. government. In the past several weeks, we have made rapid progress integrating FLIR by implementing Teledyne processes such as acceleration of financial forecasting and reporting, increasing visibility of sales and costs across the organization while continuing to enhance players\u2019 compliance standards. Furthermore, we have eliminated significant corporate overhead, consultants and other third-party service providers. And as a result, we now expect to achieve our annualized cost savings target of $80 million before the end of 2022 as approach to 2024 as described in our final merger proxy.\nAl Pichelli: Thank you, Robert. In our Digital Imaging segment, second quarter sales increased 143.9%, largely due to the FLIR acquisition, but organic growth was 17%. Segment operating margin was 14.6% and 27.5% when adjusting for transaction costs and purchase accounting, although this was unusually high as Robert mentioned earlier. In our Instrumentation segment, overall second quarter sales increased 10.6% versus last year. Sales of environmental instruments increased 19.6% from last year. Sales of most product categories increased and total quarterly sales were just slightly lower than the peak level before the COVID pandemic. Sales of electronic test and measurement systems were exceptionally strong and increased 24.6% year-over-year to record levels. Sales of our marine instrumentation decreased 4.5% in the quarter. However, orders were the strongest in the last five quarters with the second quarter book-to-bill of 1.13. Overall, Instrumentation segment operating profit increased 33.2%, with segment operating margin increasing over 360 basis points with or without intangible asset amortization. Moving to the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, second quarter sales increased 6.5%, driven by an 8.1% growth in defense, space and industrial sales, combined with flat year-over-year sales of commercial aerospace products. GAAP segment operating profit increased 62.3%, with margins 640 basis points greater than last year. In the Engineered Systems segment, second quarter revenue decreased 1.5%, primarily due to greater sales from missile defense and marine manufacturing programs more than offset by lower sales of electronic manufacturing services products and turbine engines as we exited the cruise missile engine business at the end of the first quarter. Despite slightly lower sales, segment operating profit and margin increased slightly when compared with last year. I will now turn the call to Sue who will offer some additional commentary regarding the third quarter and our full year 2021 earnings outlook.\nSue Main: Thank you, Al and good morning everyone. I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and Al and then I will discuss our third quarter and full year 2021 outlook. In the second quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $211.3 million, including all acquisition-related. Excluding acquisition-related cash costs, net of tax, cash from operations was $278.0 million compared with cash flow of $155.8 million for the same period of 2020. Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures excluding acquisition-related costs, was $257.2 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared with $139.2 million in 2020. Capital expenditures were $20.8 million in the second quarter compared to $16.6 million for the same period of 2020.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Sue. We would now like to take your questions. Operator, if you are ready to proceed with the questions and answers, please go ahead.\nOperator: Yes, thank you.  Our first question comes from Mike Maugeri with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nMike Maugeri: Hey, good morning. Thanks for the time. Can you just add some color around the operating performance at legacy Digital Imaging? You touched on it a bit with the 6 weeks versus the 8 weeks, but can you just color in some of that performance?\nRobert Mehrabian: Right. Thanks Mike. On the legacy Digital Imaging business standalone, the margins were 24.4%. And that of last year, if you add back the intangibles, the margins were 21.5%. So in the legacy Digital Imaging, the margins improved about 280 basis points.\nMike Maugeri: Okay, that\u2019s great. And what sort of drove that, were there some sort of cost initiatives or was it just mix, any other color?\nRobert Mehrabian: Both. Our cost from a \u2013 labor costs were maintained flat year-over-year and sales increased 17% and the other one was the mix margin. We had better mix of machine vision, which has our highest margins.\nMike Maugeri:\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. Our primary objective this year, Mike, in capital deployment is to reduce our debt as fast as we can. We have \u2013 we expect to generate more cash the rest of the year and we anticipate that by year end this year, our debt-to-cap would be better than what we projected or about 3.3x in terms of ratio of net debt to EBITDA. We also expect that by the end of 2022 we can reduce that net debt to EBITDA to 2.7x, which is where at the high end of what we feel is comfortable for us. So, our immediate task is to pay down debt \u2013 generate cash, pay down debt. Having said all of that, we do have the capacity to make smaller bolt-on acquisitions that we have done historically and we would do that if such opportunities arise.\nMike Maugeri: Great. Thank you.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJoe Giordano: Hey guys. Good morning.\nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe Giordano: So I know it\u2019s early to talk 2022, but can you just give us some high-level thoughts on how FLIR contribution starts to look on a normalized basis for a full year once we \u2013 if we start thinking about $80 million in run rate savings into next year?\nRobert Mehrabian: Well, let me start with what we have this year, Joe, if I may. As I mentioned before, we think that on a non-GAAP basis, we will have an upside of about \u2013 with $2 to $2.20 in terms of earnings. If we can maintain that momentum for next year, where we would enjoy probably the full year benefit of the cost reduction, I would say we may be able to increase that to as high as $2.50 from this year\u2019s $2 and $2.20. The only reason I say that is the full year dilution we will experience from share count. Our share count in Q3, Q2 was 43.7%, 44 million shares. Next year, full year, we will have a 48 million share count plus as we will have in Q3, Q4 of this year. So there is going to be some of that. And frankly, the other side of it to is that we haven\u2019t really had an opportunity to put all of our internal cost reduction inside FLIR for next year yet. These cost reductions we spoke about were generally related to corporate expenses, employee expenses, costs and third-party expenses and consultants. The \u2013 I hope that there\u2019ll be other opportunities that we can enjoy over the \u201822, but it\u2019s only 8 weeks in. It\u2019s a little hard to predict right now.\nJoe Giordano: So you brought the $80 million in 2 years, basically. What are your thoughts on upside to that target? I know it\u2019s still pretty early, but thoughts on like longer term there and maybe on revenue synergy potential from the deal?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. I would say, Joe, I would raise that to $100 million from $80 million to $100 million on the upside. I would say from a revenue synergies, we haven\u2019t looked at that very carefully, but there are areas that we intend to enjoy some synergies. Specifically, for example, FLIR has, as you know, a pretty strong gray marine business and marine thermal products business. We have a very broad portfolio of marine underwater as well as sonar and other products, so there should be some synergies there. There is also going to be synergies in our unmanned products. FLIR is very strong in UAVs and ground-based unmanned vehicles. And of course, we have a tremendous portfolio of underwater vehicles, so we think there might be revenue synergies for both of us there. So that\u2019s the beginning, we\u2019re kind of looking at it right now. And finally, I\u2019d say FLIR does have an extremely good channel for some of our \u2013 some of their products, which we might be able to enjoy in some of our own infrared products through those channels.\nJoe Giordano: And then just last for me. I know you mentioned FLIR, you expect $1.3 billion in sales this year. What does that take \u2013 if you had \u2013 if you owned it for the full year, what do you think organic for FLIR is in 2021? And what do you think like a more normalized growth rate is once we get over the comps from like the thermal sensing with COVID?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. I think, as you know, last year, the full year revenue was $1.923 billion. We expect it, on a full year basis, to remain flat at about $1.915 billion, $1.9 billion, $1.92 billion. So flat. Having said that, as you mentioned, Joe, the big headwind that we have year-over-year in Teledyne FLIR is that last year, they enjoyed about $100 million of elevated skin temperature product sales. This year, that\u2019s gone away, essentially disappeared. So we\u2019re making that up with other products, some of it in the solutions business, some of it in marine and some of it in the defense business, especially in the unmanned integrated systems businesses. So that kind of sets the tone year-over-year of no growth but being able to offset the $100 million of headwind in UIS \u2013 I mean in ESP. Having said that, I am going to look forward to just enjoying the same kind of growth that we enjoyed this year, excluding ESP. If you take that out of the $1.92 billion, the rest of the portfolio grew about 5% organically. So my expectation would be that if everything else being equal and no wheels come off the truck, that we will be able to enjoy that next year.\nJoe Giordano: Alright, thanks. I will jump back in queue.\nRobert Mehrabian: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nJim Ricchiuti: Hi, good morning. \nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning, Jim.\nJim Ricchiuti: Congratulations on this first quarter with FLIR. Robert, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how we might think about the gross margins of the combined company going forward as you really move through the integration process?\nRobert Mehrabian: Well, that\u2019s a very good question. So let me see if I can answer it properly. Our gross margins as Teledyne, as a standalone company, historical margins have been around 39% \u2013 38% to 39%. Last year, it was up 38.3%. This year first quarter was 38.9%. And second quarter, on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the one-time costs. I think what\u2019s going to happen at the gross margins, if you take ours in 2020 at 38. 3%, I think it\u2019d be safe to say that we can move that up to 43%, maybe 43.3%. And that would be a nice 4% improvement in gross margin with Teledyne FLIR. That\u2019s about the best I can do at this time forward this year. We are right now looking at what will happen in the future. Again, let me go back and emphasize one thing. Because of the hockey stick nature of the revenue in Q2 at FLIR, the SG&A for Q2 was significantly lower than it normalized should be. It was more like 20%, and it really should be between an average about 25% to 27%. So that\u2019s I\u2019m factoring those in at this time.\nJim Ricchiuti: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And what can you say about this hockey stick performance from FLIR in Q2? What contributed to that? And if I may, just a question, and then I\u2019ll jump back into the queue, if you or Al, could you just give us any flavor for how your bookings look for the combined company? Thank you.\nRobert Mehrabian: Sure, Jim. First, the hockey stick nature. I think that\u2019s been a historical practice at Teledyne FLIR. They have always shipped more in the last 2 weeks of the month than in the first 2 weeks of the month. And the last 2 weeks of the quarter, I should say, in the last 2 weeks of the year. Now we\u2019re not exactly totally blameless ourselves. We \u2013 I can\u2019t say our revenues are totally linear, but we\u2019ve worked very, very hard over the years to linearize our revenues within the month and within the quarter, month-over-month, everybody has to report on the revenues and bookings weekly. So this is an issue that doesn\u2019t have an overnight answer. But we\u2019re going to work very hard to introduce some of our own practices, working with the FLIR segment execs, sub-segment execs, which, by the way, are really outstanding and get that linearize the shipment. The pager of doing that is that you come down to the end of the month or end of the quarter, something happens or something doesn\u2019t get shipped now you\u2019ve really suffered. You suffered in revenue, you suffered in earnings. So we\u2019re going to work on that. Let me go back to book-to-bill, the question you asked. In terms of Teledyne, stand-alone first, what I\u2019d call legacy Teledyne at this point. We expect that our book-to-bill in \u2013 will be above one especially in instruments, I think it will be about 1.7. That includes very strong orders in marine, as I mentioned, in the second and third quarter. In Digital Imaging, excluding FLIR, it was about 1.16 in Q2. But FLIR is below 1. So combined, we think we will be slightly over 1 in Q2 by 1.03, 1.04. Aerospace and Defense in Teledyne good orders bookings, the book-to-bill is about 1.2. Engineered Systems, which is very lumpy is about 1.17. So overall, I\u2019d say, including Teledyne FLIR, we\u2019re going to be over 1 in Q2, maybe 1.06, 1.07.\nJim Ricchiuti: Got it. Thanks very much.\nRobert Mehrabian: Sure, Jim.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Greg Konrad with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nGreg Konrad: Good morning. \nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning, Greg.\nGreg Konrad: Just to start on organic growth. I mean, you brought up the forecast for the year a bit to 6.5, which is a little bit of acceleration from what you saw in Q2. You gave some color around Digital Imaging. But can you maybe talk about different segments, expectations for organic growth and maybe how that changed and maybe where there is risks and opportunities in the back half of the year?\nRobert Mehrabian: Sure. Greg, first, if you go back to January of 2021, we project the net organic growth of about 5.5%, 5.6%. In April, things were started improving with projected organic growth of about 6%. And in this earnings we\u2019ve moved that up to 6.6%. That\u2019s overall what I would say, legacy Teledyne that excluding the FLIR acquisition. If you break that down into its components, instruments, we anticipate with some risks in there, about 6.2%. Digital Imaging, 11.8%, almost 12% for the year, that\u2019s our fastest moving business. We think in Aerospace and Defense, especially now, we\u2019re seeing a little more recovery in the aerospace businesses. We think that will be about 4.4%, 4.5%. And we see a slight \u2013 decrease in Engineered Systems something of the order of 1.5%, primarily because, as Al said, we don\u2019t have the turbine engines for the rest of the year. You roll out of that up you end up with 6.5%, 6.6%. Now if the economy continues to improve at a pace that it\u2019s going, especially in our Instrumentation and Digital Imaging businesses, we could improve on that somewhat. But right now, to the best of our ability to project, we\u2019re projecting revenue for the year about \u2013 without FLIR, about 3290, and with FLIR about 4582.\nGreg Konrad: That\u2019s very helpful. And then you gave a little color on Digital Imaging margins, but Instrumentation was also very impressive in the quarter. I mean, how do you think about margins there? Was that mix? I mean \u2013 and obviously, marine was down a little bit. I mean, how do you see those margins kind of playing out?\nRobert Mehrabian: Well, let me start with Instrumentation overall. Yes, marine was a little down, but it was down in revenue. The margins were pretty healthy overall, Instrumentation margin in Q2, on a non-GAAP basis. The reason I\u2019m doing this non-GAAP is we do have some intangibles that come in all of these groups. And to compare year-over-year, if I do it non-GAAP, excludes Teledyne legacy GAAP \u2013 I mean intangible amortization. Last year, Instrumentation overall margin was 20.4%. This year Q2 is 24%, and we expect to finish the year at 23.2%, which would be almost a 200 basis point improvement, 193 basis point improvement over 2020. And I would distribute that to the fact that the mix of businesses are very good. Our environmental businesses are doing very well and our T&M businesses, which have really high margins because of our oscilloscopes and, of course, our protocols, those margins are superior. So almost 200 basis point improvement year-over-year in Instruments margin, including Marine is \u2013 we\u2019re very happy about that. In legacy Digital Imaging, again, our margins for Q2 were really good at 24.4% versus last year\u2019s Q2 of 21.5%. We anticipate to end the year, that is excluding Teledyne FLIR, with margins of 23.1% versus last year\u2019s of a 21.5%, 21.4%, so an improvement of 175 basis points. FLIR, of course, we had tremendous margin in Q2, just 30%, slightly over. I think that will come down closer to 22% as the year goes on based on the hockey stick nature that I described before. And so overall, Digital Imaging should end up about this year about 22.7% with Teledyne FLIR. Our Aerospace and Defense businesses are doing really well, but year-over-year comparisons of we think we will end the year at 18.8% margins, which is 492 basis points improvement over last year, but last year we took some one-time charges, we took a lot of cost out of that the Aerospace side of the business, but nevertheless, that\u2019s almost a 500 basis point improvement in margin. And I expect Engineered Systems to be relatively flat. Roll all of that up, we \u2013 from a segment perspective, on a non-GAAP basis, we should enjoy margins of 21. 3% based on everything I know right now, versus last year, 18.7%. And if you throw in the corporate expenses, again, I should reiterate on a non-GAAP basis, we will end up about 20% in margin versus 16.8% last year, which is over 300 basis points improvement. Does that help?\nGreg Konrad: Yes, that\u2019s perfect. And just one last one for me, kind of big picture. I mean, Teledyne has always been consistent with, let\u2019s say, biased to the upside, whether that\u2019s margin expansion each year or organic growth through the cycle. I mean, how do you think about this \u2013 the FLIR acquisition changing the enterprise? I mean, I get a lot of questions about 2022. You already pulled forward the synergies from when you first expected. How does it kind of change the opportunity set, whether it\u2019s annual margin expansion or organic growth as we kind of go forward?\nRobert Mehrabian: Well, let me start by saying behaviors don\u2019t change. We are going to be the same. We are not going to change. We are going to be conservative in our projections. We are always going to try and do better than that. We don\u2019t like taking risks by being too effervescent in our projections. Having said that, having met more the FLIR executive team and they make presentations to the Board gives for them next three days, all of them are going to be working with us. They are really good. They have three outstanding executives that reports to our Executive Vice President, Edwin Roks. And we anticipate they were the same as the rest of Teledyne. Focus on cost, focus on improving margins, focus on growing their top line and where appropriate, we will make the small acquisitions until we pay down our debt. I don\u2019t expect our behavior to change. We will keep improving.\nGreg Konrad: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg. Please go ahead.\nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning Andrew.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Good morning. That\u2019s Berenberg. So, can you \u2013 hey, Robert...\nRobert Mehrabian:\nArabian 4059:\nAndrew Buscaglia: Yes, right. Well, yes, Robert, thanks appreciate your candidates on the call. And I was wondering, can you add on to the kind of the last comment, can you talk a little bit about what are you seeing with FLIR that has surprised you, whether it\u2019s good or bad? It sounds like some of these managers are surprising you in terms of the quality of how they are operating. But is there anything you would like to disclose that you didn\u2019t expect \u2013 since having made the acquisition or vice versa where you are surprised that some growth potential you see where you didn\u2019t expect that to be the case when you initially bought FLIR. Anything you could add there would be great.\nRobert Mehrabian: Well, when we look at the FLIR portfolio, there are really four segments made out of former eight businesses. Three of the segments which would be the Solutions segment, the components or OEM segment and the Unmanned Integrated Systems segment, which comprise about $1.5 billion of the $1.9 billion. We are pleasantly impressed with those three segments. They have good leadership in the three segments with Roger Wells, leading UIS, Paul Clayton, leading OEM and Components and Roger \u2013 and Rickard Lindvall, leading the solution businesses. These are really healthy businesses. From their personnel perspective, well I wasn\u2019t surprised because we have visited them many, many times before the acquisition. I was very pleased not only with what we have seen, but also their presentations, yesterday to the Board were just superb. The fourth sub-segment is the one that has some issues. And that\u2019s the Surveillance segment, which is about $400 million. What\u2019s happened there in that segment is that they have had multiple leadership changes, almost annually for the last 4 years to 5 years. There have been kind of milking that cow for the last few years in terms of cash. And they have not paid attention to new product development as much as they should. In that case, what we have done is we have done something \u2013 we brought in a Teledyne executive that worked for us before back to run that business. We have this Teledyne executive, her name is JihFen Lei, regarded to run the surveillance business. She used to be one of our executives in our digital imaging business. She went to the government to DoD to work in the research and technology groups. She ended up this year as acting  for DoD\u2019s Research and Technology programs, huge program all of the laboratories, all of the businesses. She just joined us two weeks ago. So, I was able to \u2013 fortunate to bring her back and she has been here two and a half weeks. She will lead the Surveillance segment which is the one that we need to work on. And I know she will fix that with her job and will get her new products in there and put that on a healthy footing. Having said that, once we solve that I think the four sub-segments are going to be superb with the leadership and then with  and then with the combination with legacy Teledyne companies, with all the synergies we can enjoy. We have great aspirations that works for the combined company.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. What \u2013 I am curious with the decisions you have put, we are all under digital imaging, why don\u2019t you break that up with your aerospace and defense exposure and  is that a possibility in the future?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. I think the arrangements of the segments are a possibility. But you are going to rock before you start thinking about running. So, safe now keeping it where it is and then drawing lines of communication and collaboration is what we are doing. For example, one of the things we have done very successfully over the last 3 years at Teledyne is our procurement initiatives. We have significant savings that have come out of our procurement. We bought about $1.2 billion worth of products. FLIR buys another $700 million, $800 million of products. We are going to introduce our procurement initiatives there. Eventually, we may do some realignment, but not right now.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. And lastly, Robert, I thought it was \u2013 it\u2019s impressive if you can hit these net debt-to-EBITDA targets that you put out there. Do you care to provide some color on what free cash flow could be this year or how to think about that? I realize it\u2019s kind of a messy couple of quarters.\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes, it is. I think the way I look at it is where we are going to end up the year, everything else being equal. Sue mentioned where we were in Q2, we had a really good Q2. We think we will be around $750 million to $800 million, excluding charges. I want to get there because we want to increase our available cash to pay-down debt from what is now about $670 million, $680 million to over $1 billion, so we can do that. On a go-forward basis, if we didn\u2019t \u2013 if we don\u2019t have those charges and we go-forward, so I think $1 billion is a nice number and I feel comfortable of if one can get that number may be in \u201822, maybe I think \u201823 would be more healthier because we have some more expenses in \u201822.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Maugeri with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nMike Maugeri: Hi. Thanks for getting me back in. It\u2019s contingent gears in your commercial aerospace business and I know that ACES is certifying 320 now, but have you seen any demand indicators that have them with sort of point toward a change in behavior on monitoring the cabin environment post-COVID. And then generally just those types of products. Do you sell those to the manufacturers or ? Thank you.\nRobert Mehrabian: Right. As  products in the aftermarket coming out of controls even directly to airlines and we have a decline Mike. We have at least two major airlines testing their cabin environmental sensors. We have great folks for that. As you know we qualified the 737 before in March and then we have surveillance of A-320 which was the bulk of the carriers. We are right now introducing those just to give it to them for a free use and they can test it. But we are not going to do that. So, we have high expectations for that. Just like in some ways there were many versions were mean to reduce the wireless ground make many years ago. Overall on the aerospace businesses things are picking up flat this quarter, year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter. But these are picking up. We are seeing something like in the second quarter orders about 1.2 book to bill. And that\u2019s very healthy for us because that\u2019s a high margin business also. So, we are initially with the Boeing putting their vaccine operation and some of the other airlines specially becoming profitable and we are optimistic that this business will come back slowly, but surely.\nMike Maugeri: Thanks.\nRobert Mehrabian: Sure Mike.\nOperator: You have a question from Joe Giordano with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJoe Giordano: Hi guys. Thanks for getting me back on. I was going to ask about free cash flow. But Robert I think you just answered it a question ago. So, maybe I will just finish with maybe not a bunch going on, but in your space launches and what\u2019s going on in the commercial landscape. Can you maybe just talk about what gives you excited in the space as opposed to you whether it\u2019s through NASA or European Space Agency or commercial like where you think you are best positioned where you are most excited about?\nRobert Mehrabian: Well, I think first and foremost, we really like our job working  and visible in the space domain, anything to do with satellites. We practically supply all of the detectors for space-based observation, both looking out and looking to the earth, including a lot of the environmental studies, whether it\u2019s carbon or whatever. We own a big chunk of that market. But now we are moving to the classified space. So, we have some great imaging products in the classified space programs. Now in the space travel as whatever color you want to call that. Yes, we make some products for \u2013 in terms of equipment, but we are not that involved in there right now. I think our focus has to be remained with sensors and information technologies for the immediate future, where we have a strategic advantage because we can make infrared sensors and nobody else can. And with each of these visible sensors, and now having other channels with FLIR for our infrared products, we think that would be the place I see an upside for us. I don\u2019t know if \u2013 I am a little cautious on commercial space development. We do have some piece of communication in the OneWeb program, as you know, that everybody wants to build  satellites and based upon the  you can imagine.\nJoe Giordano: Yes, definitely. And just one quick clarification, when you said $1 billion in cash flow for \u201822, \u201823 something like that, was that a free cash flow comment or is that operating cash flow? Thank you.\nRobert Mehrabian: That\u2019s free.\nJoe Giordano: That\u2019s what I thought. Thanks.\nRobert Mehrabian: I moved it a year the minute you said free\u2026\nJoe Giordano: I got it.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you. Operator, are there any other questions.\nOperator: There is no one else in the queue.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you. In that case, I would like to ask Jason to conclude our conference call. And I want to thank all of you for doing so much homework to ask questions that kept me on my toes. Thank you. Jason?\nJason VanWees: Thanks, Robert. And again, thanks, everyone, for being on our call today. If you have other follow-up questions or seek more detail, you can always call me as usual with the number in the earnings release. So Amy, if you would go ahead and give the replay information. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. This conference will be available for replay starting today at 10 a.m. Pacific through midnight on August 28. The dial-in number is 1-866-207-1041 with an access code of 1317751. That does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Event conferencing service. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Robert. In our Digital Imaging segment, second quarter sales increased 143.9%, largely due to the FLIR acquisition, but organic growth was 17%. Segment operating margin was 14.6% and 27.5% when adjusting for transaction costs and purchase accounting, although this was unusually high as Robert mentioned earlier. In our Instrumentation segment, overall second quarter sales increased 10.6% versus last year. Sales of environmental instruments increased 19.6% from last year. Sales of most product categories increased and total quarterly sales were just slightly lower than the peak level before the COVID pandemic. Sales of electronic test and measurement systems were exceptionally strong and increased 24.6% year-over-year to record levels. Sales of our marine instrumentation decreased 4.5% in the quarter. However, orders were the strongest in the last five quarters with the second quarter book-to-bill of 1.13. Overall, Instrumentation segment operating profit increased 33.2%, with segment operating margin increasing over 360 basis points with or without intangible asset amortization. Moving to the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, second quarter sales increased 6.5%, driven by an 8.1% growth in defense, space and industrial sales, combined with flat year-over-year sales of commercial aerospace products. GAAP segment operating profit increased 62.3%, with margins 640 basis points greater than last year. In the Engineered Systems segment, second quarter revenue decreased 1.5%, primarily due to greater sales from missile defense and marine manufacturing programs more than offset by lower sales of electronic manufacturing services products and turbine engines as we exited the cruise missile engine business at the end of the first quarter. Despite slightly lower sales, segment operating profit and margin increased slightly when compared with last year. I will now turn the call to Sue who will offer some additional commentary regarding the third quarter and our full year 2021 earnings outlook."

            "name": "Robert Mehrabian",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason and good morning and thank you for joining our earnings call. For over two decades now, we have continuously improved our portfolio of businesses, our operations and our financial performance, and along the way, significantly compounded earnings, cash flow and shareholder returns. It is worth noting that just over 10 years ago, a major milestone occurred when we divested our aviation piston engine business and all of its associated liabilities. While initiated earlier, immediately following that divestiture, we accelerated our pace of change by making increasingly significant and successful acquisitions within our digital imaging and instrumentation businesses. Our recent acquisition of FLIR accelerates Teledyne's evolution into a more attractive higher margin industrial technology company, while at the same time maintaining our balanced portfolio, primarily focused on commercial markets, but with a resilient and predictable backbone of government businesses. For example, in the second quarter of 2021, 75% of total company sales were derived from U.S. commercial and international customers and 25% of sales from the U.S. government. In the past several weeks, we have made rapid progress integrating FLIR by implementing Teledyne processes such as acceleration of financial forecasting and reporting, increasing visibility of sales and costs across the organization while continuing to enhance players' compliance standards. Furthermore, we have eliminated significant corporate overhead, consultants and other third-party service providers. And as a result, we now expect to achieve our annualized cost savings target of $80 million before the end of 2022 as approach to 2024 as described in our final merger proxy. Thank you, Sue. We would now like to take your questions. Operator, if you are ready to proceed with the questions and answers, please go ahead. Right. Thanks Mike. On the legacy Digital Imaging business standalone, the margins were 24.4%. And that of last year, if you add back the intangibles, the margins were 21.5%. So in the legacy Digital Imaging, the margins improved about 280 basis points. Both. Our cost from a \u2013 labor costs were maintained flat year-over-year and sales increased 17% and the other one was the mix margin. We had better mix of machine vision, which has our highest margins. Thank you, Mike. Good morning, Joe. Well, let me start with what we have this year, Joe, if I may. As I mentioned before, we think that on a non-GAAP basis, we will have an upside of about \u2013 with $2 to $2.20 in terms of earnings. If we can maintain that momentum for next year, where we would enjoy probably the full year benefit of the cost reduction, I would say we may be able to increase that to as high as $2.50 from this year's $2 and $2.20. The only reason I say that is the full year dilution we will experience from share count. Our share count in Q3, Q2 was 43.7%, 44 million shares. Next year, full year, we will have a 48 million share count plus as we will have in Q3, Q4 of this year. So there is going to be some of that. And frankly, the other side of it to is that we haven't really had an opportunity to put all of our internal cost reduction inside FLIR for next year yet. These cost reductions we spoke about were generally related to corporate expenses, employee expenses, costs and third-party expenses and consultants. The \u2013 I hope that there'll be other opportunities that we can enjoy over the \u201822, but it's only 8 weeks in. It's a little hard to predict right now. Yes. I would say, Joe, I would raise that to $100 million from $80 million to $100 million on the upside. I would say from a revenue synergies, we haven't looked at that very carefully, but there are areas that we intend to enjoy some synergies. Specifically, for example, FLIR has, as you know, a pretty strong gray marine business and marine thermal products business. We have a very broad portfolio of marine underwater as well as sonar and other products, so there should be some synergies there. There is also going to be synergies in our unmanned products. FLIR is very strong in UAVs and ground-based unmanned vehicles. And of course, we have a tremendous portfolio of underwater vehicles, so we think there might be revenue synergies for both of us there. So that's the beginning, we're kind of looking at it right now. And finally, I'd say FLIR does have an extremely good channel for some of our \u2013 some of their products, which we might be able to enjoy in some of our own infrared products through those channels. Yes. I think, as you know, last year, the full year revenue was $1.923 billion. We expect it, on a full year basis, to remain flat at about $1.915 billion, $1.9 billion, $1.92 billion. So flat. Having said that, as you mentioned, Joe, the big headwind that we have year-over-year in Teledyne FLIR is that last year, they enjoyed about $100 million of elevated skin temperature product sales. This year, that's gone away, essentially disappeared. So we're making that up with other products, some of it in the solutions business, some of it in marine and some of it in the defense business, especially in the unmanned integrated systems businesses. So that kind of sets the tone year-over-year of no growth but being able to offset the $100 million of headwind in UIS \u2013 I mean in ESP. Having said that, I am going to look forward to just enjoying the same kind of growth that we enjoyed this year, excluding ESP. If you take that out of the $1.92 billion, the rest of the portfolio grew about 5% organically. So my expectation would be that if everything else being equal and no wheels come off the truck, that we will be able to enjoy that next year. Sure. Good morning, Jim. Well, that's a very good question. So let me see if I can answer it properly. Our gross margins as Teledyne, as a standalone company, historical margins have been around 39% \u2013 38% to 39%. Last year, it was up 38.3%. This year first quarter was 38.9%. And second quarter, on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the one-time costs. I think what's going to happen at the gross margins, if you take ours in 2020 at 38. 3%, I think it'd be safe to say that we can move that up to 43%, maybe 43.3%. And that would be a nice 4% improvement in gross margin with Teledyne FLIR. That's about the best I can do at this time forward this year. We are right now looking at what will happen in the future. Again, let me go back and emphasize one thing. Because of the hockey stick nature of the revenue in Q2 at FLIR, the SG&A for Q2 was significantly lower than it normalized should be. It was more like 20%, and it really should be between an average about 25% to 27%. So that's I'm factoring those in at this time. Sure, Jim. First, the hockey stick nature. I think that's been a historical practice at Teledyne FLIR. They have always shipped more in the last 2 weeks of the month than in the first 2 weeks of the month. And the last 2 weeks of the quarter, I should say, in the last 2 weeks of the year. Now we're not exactly totally blameless ourselves. We \u2013 I can't say our revenues are totally linear, but we've worked very, very hard over the years to linearize our revenues within the month and within the quarter, month-over-month, everybody has to report on the revenues and bookings weekly. So this is an issue that doesn't have an overnight answer. But we're going to work very hard to introduce some of our own practices, working with the FLIR segment execs, sub-segment execs, which, by the way, are really outstanding and get that linearize the shipment. The pager of doing that is that you come down to the end of the month or end of the quarter, something happens or something doesn't get shipped now you've really suffered. You suffered in revenue, you suffered in earnings. So we're going to work on that. Let me go back to book-to-bill, the question you asked. In terms of Teledyne, stand-alone first, what I'd call legacy Teledyne at this point. We expect that our book-to-bill in \u2013 will be above one especially in instruments, I think it will be about 1.7. That includes very strong orders in marine, as I mentioned, in the second and third quarter. In Digital Imaging, excluding FLIR, it was about 1.16 in Q2. But FLIR is below 1. So combined, we think we will be slightly over 1 in Q2 by 1.03, 1.04. Aerospace and Defense in Teledyne good orders bookings, the book-to-bill is about 1.2. Engineered Systems, which is very lumpy is about 1.17. So overall, I'd say, including Teledyne FLIR, we're going to be over 1 in Q2, maybe 1.06, 1.07. Sure, Jim. Good morning, Greg. Sure. Greg, first, if you go back to January of 2021, we project the net organic growth of about 5.5%, 5.6%. In April, things were started improving with projected organic growth of about 6%. And in this earnings we've moved that up to 6.6%. That's overall what I would say, legacy Teledyne that excluding the FLIR acquisition. If you break that down into its components, instruments, we anticipate with some risks in there, about 6.2%. Digital Imaging, 11.8%, almost 12% for the year, that's our fastest moving business. We think in Aerospace and Defense, especially now, we're seeing a little more recovery in the aerospace businesses. We think that will be about 4.4%, 4.5%. And we see a slight \u2013 decrease in Engineered Systems something of the order of 1.5%, primarily because, as Al said, we don't have the turbine engines for the rest of the year. You roll out of that up you end up with 6.5%, 6.6%. Now if the economy continues to improve at a pace that it's going, especially in our Instrumentation and Digital Imaging businesses, we could improve on that somewhat. But right now, to the best of our ability to project, we're projecting revenue for the year about \u2013 without FLIR, about 3290, and with FLIR about 4582. Well, let me start with Instrumentation overall. Yes, marine was a little down, but it was down in revenue. The margins were pretty healthy overall, Instrumentation margin in Q2, on a non-GAAP basis. The reason I'm doing this non-GAAP is we do have some intangibles that come in all of these groups. And to compare year-over-year, if I do it non-GAAP, excludes Teledyne legacy GAAP \u2013 I mean intangible amortization. Last year, Instrumentation overall margin was 20.4%. This year Q2 is 24%, and we expect to finish the year at 23.2%, which would be almost a 200 basis point improvement, 193 basis point improvement over 2020. And I would distribute that to the fact that the mix of businesses are very good. Our environmental businesses are doing very well and our T&M businesses, which have really high margins because of our oscilloscopes and, of course, our protocols, those margins are superior. So almost 200 basis point improvement year-over-year in Instruments margin, including Marine is \u2013 we're very happy about that. In legacy Digital Imaging, again, our margins for Q2 were really good at 24.4% versus last year's Q2 of 21.5%. We anticipate to end the year, that is excluding Teledyne FLIR, with margins of 23.1% versus last year's of a 21.5%, 21.4%, so an improvement of 175 basis points. FLIR, of course, we had tremendous margin in Q2, just 30%, slightly over. I think that will come down closer to 22% as the year goes on based on the hockey stick nature that I described before. And so overall, Digital Imaging should end up about this year about 22.7% with Teledyne FLIR. Our Aerospace and Defense businesses are doing really well, but year-over-year comparisons of we think we will end the year at 18.8% margins, which is 492 basis points improvement over last year, but last year we took some one-time charges, we took a lot of cost out of that the Aerospace side of the business, but nevertheless, that's almost a 500 basis point improvement in margin. And I expect Engineered Systems to be relatively flat. Roll all of that up, we \u2013 from a segment perspective, on a non-GAAP basis, we should enjoy margins of 21. 3% based on everything I know right now, versus last year, 18.7%. And if you throw in the corporate expenses, again, I should reiterate on a non-GAAP basis, we will end up about 20% in margin versus 16.8% last year, which is over 300 basis points improvement. Does that help? Well, let me start by saying behaviors don't change. We are going to be the same. We are not going to change. We are going to be conservative in our projections. We are always going to try and do better than that. We don't like taking risks by being too effervescent in our projections. Having said that, having met more the FLIR executive team and they make presentations to the Board gives for them next three days, all of them are going to be working with us. They are really good. They have three outstanding executives that reports to our Executive Vice President, Edwin Roks. And we anticipate they were the same as the rest of Teledyne. Focus on cost, focus on improving margins, focus on growing their top line and where appropriate, we will make the small acquisitions until we pay down our debt. I don't expect our behavior to change. We will keep improving. Good morning Andrew. Arabian 4059: Well, when we look at the FLIR portfolio, there are really four segments made out of former eight businesses. Three of the segments which would be the Solutions segment, the components or OEM segment and the Unmanned Integrated Systems segment, which comprise about $1.5 billion of the $1.9 billion. We are pleasantly impressed with those three segments. They have good leadership in the three segments with Roger Wells, leading UIS, Paul Clayton, leading OEM and Components and Roger \u2013 and Rickard Lindvall, leading the solution businesses. These are really healthy businesses. From their personnel perspective, well I wasn't surprised because we have visited them many, many times before the acquisition. I was very pleased not only with what we have seen, but also their presentations, yesterday to the Board were just superb. The fourth sub-segment is the one that has some issues. And that's the Surveillance segment, which is about $400 million. What's happened there in that segment is that they have had multiple leadership changes, almost annually for the last 4 years to 5 years. There have been kind of milking that cow for the last few years in terms of cash. And they have not paid attention to new product development as much as they should. In that case, what we have done is we have done something \u2013 we brought in a Teledyne executive that worked for us before back to run that business. We have this Teledyne executive, her name is JihFen Lei, regarded to run the surveillance business. She used to be one of our executives in our digital imaging business. She went to the government to DoD to work in the research and technology groups. She ended up this year as acting  for DoD's Research and Technology programs, huge program all of the laboratories, all of the businesses. She just joined us two weeks ago. So, I was able to \u2013 fortunate to bring her back and she has been here two and a half weeks. She will lead the Surveillance segment which is the one that we need to work on. And I know she will fix that with her job and will get her new products in there and put that on a healthy footing. Having said that, once we solve that I think the four sub-segments are going to be superb with the leadership and then with  and then with the combination with legacy Teledyne companies, with all the synergies we can enjoy. We have great aspirations that works for the combined company. Yes. I think the arrangements of the segments are a possibility. But you are going to rock before you start thinking about running. So, safe now keeping it where it is and then drawing lines of communication and collaboration is what we are doing. For example, one of the things we have done very successfully over the last 3 years at Teledyne is our procurement initiatives. We have significant savings that have come out of our procurement. We bought about $1.2 billion worth of products. FLIR buys another $700 million, $800 million of products. We are going to introduce our procurement initiatives there. Eventually, we may do some realignment, but not right now. Yes, it is. I think the way I look at it is where we are going to end up the year, everything else being equal. Sue mentioned where we were in Q2, we had a really good Q2. We think we will be around $750 million to $800 million, excluding charges. I want to get there because we want to increase our available cash to pay-down debt from what is now about $670 million, $680 million to over $1 billion, so we can do that. On a go-forward basis, if we didn't \u2013 if we don't have those charges and we go-forward, so I think $1 billion is a nice number and I feel comfortable of if one can get that number may be in \u201822, maybe I think \u201823 would be more healthier because we have some more expenses in \u201822. Thank you. Right. As  products in the aftermarket coming out of controls even directly to airlines and we have a decline Mike. We have at least two major airlines testing their cabin environmental sensors. We have great folks for that. As you know we qualified the 737 before in March and then we have surveillance of A-320 which was the bulk of the carriers. We are right now introducing those just to give it to them for a free use and they can test it. But we are not going to do that. So, we have high expectations for that. Just like in some ways there were many versions were mean to reduce the wireless ground make many years ago. Overall on the aerospace businesses things are picking up flat this quarter, year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter. But these are picking up. We are seeing something like in the second quarter orders about 1.2 book to bill. And that's very healthy for us because that's a high margin business also. So, we are initially with the Boeing putting their vaccine operation and some of the other airlines specially becoming profitable and we are optimistic that this business will come back slowly, but surely. Sure Mike. Well, I think first and foremost, we really like our job working  and visible in the space domain, anything to do with satellites. We practically supply all of the detectors for space-based observation, both looking out and looking to the earth, including a lot of the environmental studies, whether it's carbon or whatever. We own a big chunk of that market. But now we are moving to the classified space. So, we have some great imaging products in the classified space programs. Now in the space travel as whatever color you want to call that. Yes, we make some products for \u2013 in terms of equipment, but we are not that involved in there right now. I think our focus has to be remained with sensors and information technologies for the immediate future, where we have a strategic advantage because we can make infrared sensors and nobody else can. And with each of these visible sensors, and now having other channels with FLIR for our infrared products, we think that would be the place I see an upside for us. I don't know if \u2013 I am a little cautious on commercial space development. We do have some piece of communication in the OneWeb program, as you know, that everybody wants to build  satellites and based upon the  you can imagine. That's free. I moved it a year the minute you said free... Thank you. Operator, are there any other questions. Thank you. In that case, I would like to ask Jason to conclude our conference call. And I want to thank all of you for doing so much homework to ask questions that kept me on my toes. Thank you. Jason?"

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Teledyne first quarter earnings call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will have a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time.  As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn our conference over to the host, Jason VanWees. Please go ahead.\nJason VanWees: Good morning. Thank you everyone. This is Jason VanWees, Executive Vice President and I would like to welcome folks to our first quarter 2021 earnings release conference call. We released our earnings earlier this morning before the market opened.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you Jason and good morning and thank you for joining our earnings call. We began 2021 with a best first quarter sales, earnings, operating margin and cash flow in the company's history. Furthermore, we achieved these GAAP results despite incurring $39 million or $0.79 per share of expenses related to the pending acquisition of FLIR. Excluding these nonrecurring charges, earnings increased 39.2% compared to last year. Operating margin increased 426 basis points and our free cash flow nearly doubled. In addition, I am very pleased with the breadth of our financial performance across Teledyne. Year-over-year sales increased in nearly every major business category except commercial aerospace, which is now only 4% of our total sales. The recovery in our short cycle commercial business is unfolding nicely. And our government businesses are also growing and performing well in both cases, strongest within our digital imaging segment. Also in the first quarter, we received all-time record orders, with a book-to-bill of 1.15X, resulting in quarter-end backlog of approximately $1.8 billion. Given our strong first quarter, we now think a reasonable outlook for the total company organic sales growth in 2021 is approximately 6%, led by forecasted growth of about 10% in digital imaging, excluding FLIR. And now, with respect to the FLIR acquisition. Over the last few months, while transaction certainty progressively increased, Teledyne performed in-person visits covering 90% of all FLIR owned sites, several on multiple occasions. Most importantly, we were also granted access to the operating management in all key functional areas. To summarize, FLIR's people, products, technology and manufacturing are outstanding. I am now even more excited about the prospect FLIR as part of the Teledyne family.\nAl Pichelli: Thank you Robert. In our instrumentation segment, overall first quarter sales increased 0.5% versus last year. Sales of environmental instruments increased 5% from last year. Sales of most product categories increased with the strongest year-over-year organic growth resulting from the gas and flame detection products acquired in 2019. Sales of our electronic test and measurement systems increased 4.8% year-over-year. Sales of marine instrumentation decreased 6.7% in the quarter. However our operating profit increased due to aggressive cost management and business simplification and stabilization initiatives. Overall, instruments segment operating margin increased 291 basis points to 20.7%. Turning to digital imaging segment. First quarter sales increased 6.7%. GAAP segment operating margin was 19.7%, an increase of 200 basis points year-over-year. Now, turning to the aerospace and defense electronics segment. First quarter sales declined 3.3% as greater defense sales were more than offset by the 28.5% decline in sales of commercial aerospace products. GAAP segment operating margin increased over 1,000 basis points to 18.7% versus 8.6% in 2020. In the engineered systems segment, first quarter revenue increased 8.5%, primarily due to greater sales from defense and other manufacturing programs as well as electronic manufacturing services products. Segment operating margin increased 242 basis points when compared with last year. I will now turn the call to Sue, who will offer some additional commentary regarding the second quarter and our full year 2021 outlook.\nSue Main: Thank you Al and good morning everyone. I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and Al and then I will discuss our second quarter and full year 2021 outlook. In the first quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $124.9 million, compared with cash flow of $76.4 million for the same period of 2020.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you Sue. We would now like to take your questions. Sean, if you are ready to proceed with the questions and answers, please go ahead.\nOperator: . Our first question is going to come from the line of Greg Konrad from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nGreg Konrad: Good morning.\nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning Greg.\nGreg Konrad: Maybe just to start on margins before I get to full year. I mean it seems like a lift in instrumentation and engineered systems. You are probably running well ahead of the guidance that you laid out last quarter. Can you maybe just update us on your thoughts on organic margins for the year?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. Greg, the instrumentation, when we started the year, probably because it's primarily a short cycle business, we were not sure about how much revenue and therefore margins we would have. So we projected margin improvement of about 10 basis points. We think the margins are now going to be closer to 140 basis points for the year, which is an increase of about 130 basis points.\nGreg Konrad: That's helpful. And then you mentioned that you guys have visited over 90% of the FLIR sites. I mean any update just when we think about synergies or maybe some of the potential longer term revenue synergies, if anything surprising as you continue the diligence into the close?\nRobert Mehrabian: Well, I think the most important thing that we found out in our visits were the quality of the operations and the people. We really haven't focused yet on revenue synergies, well, we have looked at synergies in the operating area, primarily by using some of the methodology, Greg, that we have used in our own operations such as procurement savings which have been substantial for us last year and are supposed to be the same this year as well as the some of the cost reductions that we mentioned earlier vis-\u00e0-vis the $40 million of cost savings that we expect to enjoy in the first year and growing to $80 million over time. So those would be the synergies at this time. In terms of revenue synergies, we haven't really looked at that very closely. And frankly, we operate in different markets. There are things we can't obviously look at very quickly would be, how do we jointly go to market team in areas where we have complementary products.\nGreg Konrad: And then just last one. I mean I remember back to e2v, you gave us adjusted numbers because there were large expenses and you kind of did that this quarter and I am assuming that will continue going forward. But any updated thoughts on, even if it's not the presented number, at least presenting ex-amortization just given that's probably going to be fairly accretive as you get into next year?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. I think the EPS accretion, it need to be, were substantial, partially because there we really improved margins. For FLIR on the other hand, if we exclude intangibles, which as you said would be substantial and the one-time costs that we will, we think that in 2022 we should have EPS accretion of about 20% or more. Of course, again, excluding the intangibles, which is substantial.\nGreg Konrad: Thank you.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you Greg.\nOperator: Thank you. And then next, we are going to go to the line of Blake Gendron from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nBlake Gendron: Yes. Thanks for your time this morning. I just want to follow-up on the synergy question, maybe not so much focused on cost or revenue but working capital here in terms of supply chain overlap. Is there any way we can think about maybe free cash conversion on a standalone basis versus incremental synergies there when you combine the two entities?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. I think, again, to do this properly, Blake, I have to exclude the one-time charges because while we have some handle on our charges at the time for the rest of the year, we don't have a really good handle on what FLIR's charges would be. The one area I think the conversion overall is going to be better than 100%. Having said that, inventory built up at FLIR, from what we saw in 2019 and 2020, was substantial and partially because of the elevated skin temperature programs that they enjoyed. So they have a significant inventory built up in that and some other areas that we have to look at very carefully. And we may have to write those up. We may have to write those down. But we will see as we get to it. But overall, our projections are that we ourselves should have free cash flow that slightly surpasses last year. And last year was a record year for us at $547 million, $445 million. So if we can exceed that ourselves and do well with the FLIR cash flow, that's very important, Blake, because we intend to pay down our debt as fast as we possibly can over the next two years.\nBlake Gendron: That's really helpful color. I wanted to switch gears to digital imaging. You called out strength in some of the short cycle markets, specifically industrial, scientific and geospatial. Does that include healthcare? Because we are seeing hospital volumes improve. So I am wondering if that could be an incremental tailwind as we move forward here and into vaccine rollout and normalization? And then, very small to go to a commercial aero in digital imaging but wondering how you expect that to evolve over the medium to longer term?\nRobert Mehrabian: Let me start with the healthcare. Healthcare, year-over-year, 2019 to 2020, we had about a 13.7% decrease in revenue from $255 million to $220 million. This year, we are starting to see some improvement and we anticipate that between our CMOS X-ray panels as well as some of the equipment that we supply for X-ray sources, we would have an increase of about 9% over last year to approximately $240 million. So that kind of speaks to what you just said. The recovery is a little slower than we anticipated but it is there. We getting some really good orders in that domain, more in the flat panel displays with the X-ray sources kind of lagging a little bit but still coming up. Going back to the question vis-\u00e0-vis regular, the commercial systems. Commercial aero in digital imaging, first it's small. Second,, it's not that dependent on airline traffic. It's different than anything else. It's primarily in space domain. And we have not seen any deterioration there and actually we think that that on our aerospace and defense in the digital imaging domain, we think we will see about a 7% improvement in revenue this year from $270 million last year to maybe to $290 million this year. So the only area of aerospace that we are taking some punishment is in the aerospace businesses in Teledyne's normal defense and aerospace domain.\nBlake Gendron: Makes sense. I really appreciate the time. Thanks for the answers.\nRobert Mehrabian: Sure Blake.\nOperator: Thank you. Then next, we will go to the line of Jim Ricchiuti from Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nJim Ricchiuti: Hi. Good morning. Just a couple of questions. Just, you related to the fact that you have seen a little bit of stronger margin profile in parts of the instrumentation business. I am just wondering, as you look out into the second half of the year, where do you see the most opportunity for margin expansion in the different business units? It sounds like you are, with healthcare coming on, digital imaging margins look better.\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. If you go to instrumentation, we did have some significant improvements in margin in environmental and test and measurement in the first quarter. And we expect those to continue for the rest of the year. We also had some improvement in margin in the marine businesses, even though revenue as Al mentioned, was down somewhat. We think the revenue will catch the rest of the year and as that does, the margin's there will improve also. So we think overall instrumentation, we have the best margins in environmental area, about 23%. Second best margins in our test and measurement, over 21%. And marine is approaching over 19%. So when you roll it all up, we are going to get close to 20.9% in instrumentation. And I think that's going to be healthy for us, especially if marine as we expect because of the oil prices going up to about $65 currently. If that improves, then I think that segment is going to do really well. That's why I said, our outlook for the margins has improved 130 basis points since January of this year.\nJim Ricchiuti: Got it. And Robert, with all of the well-publicized reports about component constraints and Al, maybe you want to respond to this, are you guys seeing any disruption in the business from this? Or are you able to manage the supply chain well enough?\nRobert Mehrabian: Both. First, obviously, we are seeing constraints, Jim. There's no question about that, both in the electronics components as well as in printed circuit boards. It's affecting a lot of our businesses. But having said that, we have, even though we do have very tight control of our inventory, we have approved buying some of the critical components ahead of time. And the other thing is, because of our collaborative and across Teledyne effort in procurement, we are able now to approach our suppliers as one fairly large customer. Get their forecasts in terms of their timelines for delivering product and putting orders ahead of time. Having said all of that, we are managing it. But we also are getting products from foundries, for example, that come to our wafers that we get. In that case, we are fortunate because the guys who supplies wafers are also our customers. So in some areas, we think we are going to be okay. In other areas, I am very cautiously optimistic. But this thing can really spin out of control and then we will have to deal with it again.\nJim Ricchiuti: Yes. Okay. So last question, thank you for that. Yes, last question, just your nice bookings number for the quarter and backlog and I am just wondering as we think about the way you are characterizing the business and the acceleration and growth that seems to be suggested in the recent filings looking out to next year, where do you see the potential for accelerating growth and which areas of the business? I assume some of the businesses that have been weaker that recovered, but I am just wondering if there's anything else you can call out?\nRobert Mehrabian: I think our primary areas is digital imaging. For me to say digital imaging is going to grow organically 10% year-over-year, I don't know if I have ever done something like that. So I feel pretty bullish to kind of predict that. I think we will end the year with a book-to-bill in digital imaging of 1.08, maybe 1.10. So that's our first area. I think in the instrumentation area, we are right now over one. But a lot of that is short cycle businesses. If marine comes back as we expect and the other areas come back as we expect, we think, specially in test and measurement, we could have as much as 8% growth, in environmental 6%, 6.5%. And if marine comes back, that would be another 2%. So overall, I think instrumentation should give us about 5.3%, 5.2% for the year. For us that's again very good because those are the highest margin businesses. Engineered systems, I think would be fairly flat year-over-year. We don't expect aerospace to really come back that much this year. It's probably a two year cycle. But our defense businesses are doing okay. So I anticipate in aerospace and defense combined to enjoy a 4% of revenue improvement this year. Roll all of that together and you are going to end up with about 6% for the company, which would be one of our healthier organic growth rates in revenue in the recent past.\nJim Ricchiuti: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you Jim.\nOperator: And then next, we are going to go to the line of Joe Giordano from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJoe Giordano: Hi everyone. Good morning.\nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning Joe.\nJoe Giordano: Yes, I just wanted to talk about semiconductor and test and measurement and how you are thinking about the sustainability of strength there given some of the plans from some of the large manufacturers? I know you are more on the R&D side. But just curious for your color there?\nRobert Mehrabian: Well, test and measurement, let me start there. We really enjoyed a good year in test and measurement, primarily because of being able to put out new products continuously. As you know, we have two areas that we focus on there. One of them is our oscilloscopes. And the other is protocols which are the rules that chips communicate with one another. We continue to put new products out. Like last week alone, we announced three products in oscilloscopes and protocols. But more importantly, what our guys have been able to do is marry those two businesses, those two products together. So now people can do protocol development and analysis using the oscilloscopes as real time observation of the signals. And that's going to be very good for that area. You also asked me about semi. In digital imaging is primarily where we focus on the semi market. And there as mask and wafer inspection, that's been a really good market for us. If I look at our growth in vision systems, which includes flat panel displays as well as semi inspection, we anticipate that year-over-year to be about 12% to 13% revenue growth. So that kind of speaks for that. And then lastly, I would point out one example of why digital imaging and relevant semiconductor markets are doing so well for us. We do have a product that comes off our MEMS foundry in Canada. These are pellicles which are very thin, one-tenth of a human hair thickness but six to eight inches in diameter consumable products that are used in extreme UV lithography for very fine semiconductors. They essentially are screens that protect the wafers below them. And in that area, we have really done well and have now captured that market and we have a wonderful customer there. And so overall, to answer your question, test and measurement, I talked about. And in the semi, the products that we supply to them are doing pretty well.\nJoe Giordano: And just to follow up on one of the other question asked already about your ability to source components and the scarcity going on. How do you get comfortable with FLIR's ability to do that historically? And now that you are taking over there, your ability to be able to source that much in additional that you need to cover their operations as well as smoothly as you covered your own?\nRobert Mehrabian: The answer is, Jim, I don't know yet. But having said that, because as I mentioned, they do have substantial inventory and we have to obviously dig into that to see what they are using. I think that would be right now an area that we will have to bring our procurement to it. On the other hand, FLIR also gets wafers and they also make a lot of their own sensors, both on the cooled and the uncooled side. So as long as we can enjoy having the wafers and as long as we can enjoy doing some of the developments, specially in antimonide for the cooled and VOx for the uncooled, I think It should be alright. But having said all of that, we just haven't looked at it that deeply. We anticipate that there would some challenges. But we will deal with those just like we deal with challenges that come up in our business.\nJoe Giordano: Thank you.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you Joe.\nOperator: . Next, we will go to the line of Andrew Buscaglia from Berenberg Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Good morning guys.\nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning Andrew.\nAndrew Buscaglia: I was hoping you could talk a little bit about, so just to clarify, digital imaging, are you calling for 10% for the full year up? I know you gave the subcomponent there. And then I don't believe you talked about a couple of the segments. I don't believe you talked about margins for digital imaging or any of the electronics which at least where A&D had a really strong start to the year. So what's kind of your outlook on the margins there?\nRobert Mehrabian: Okay. Let me start with the margins, please. Right now, we think digital imaging margins should go up about 150 basis points over last year well. So just north of 21%, let's say 21%. Aerospace and defense, we are going to have significant margin improvement. As Al mentioned, we had a really good uptick in the first quarter, partially because we had one-time charges last year in our aerospace but nevertheless, having said that, we think the margins are going to be approaching 18.5%, maybe 18.6%, which would be 490 basis points improvement over last year. Engineered systems going to be relatively flat. So if you take the instruments margin that I mentioned before, which was 20.9% and bring it all the way down, we think the company operating margin, I mentioned in January that we thought it would be about 17%. Now, we are projecting the total company operating margin to be closer for the year to 17.6%.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay.\nRobert Mehrabian: But all of this is excluding, of course, anything that has to do with the acquisition of FLIR. I don't know whether I answered your call, your question.\nAndrew Buscaglia: And digital imaging, the top-end, I know you gave some subcomponent outlook there. But I think you had called for about 9% growth for the year. Is that now closer to 10%, is what you are saying?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. It's closer to 10% led by our vision products, cameras, including scientific cameras, sensors, as I mentioned for semi flat panel display, et cetera. And everything there is all going to do well. The only way that maybe flat year-over-year is our geospatial. Everything else seems to be growing really well.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. And then lastly, I am having a little bit difficulty just getting to the midpoint of your guide. And I think it might be, should we be modeling in some transaction costs to add back? Secondly the interest expense was elevated this quarter. I guess we can't really assume a flat line, we have got to add that back up. I guess, how do you get to the midpoint of your guide with some of the below the line items?\nRobert Mehrabian: Well, if you look up the guidance that Sue provided, the $12 to $12.20, that excludes FLIR's transaction costs. So you have to look at it at this time, you have to look at that excluding interest expenses related to the FLIR acquisition as well as some of the legal expenses that come above the line. Now, once we acquire FLIR, assuming the shareholders approve the transaction, then what we will do is, we will have to put the interest for the total company as part of our moving forward normal cost in GAAP. But there are going to be some other costs associated with the transaction that are going to be substantial. Those would be one-time charges and as we talked earlier, we call those intangibles. Later on also would be inventory write-ups and other things. Having said all of that, the $12 to $12.20 excludes the FLIR transaction costs which in the first quarter were about $39 million. $5.9 million of it was above the line which was legal fees and also fees for bankers. And the rest of it or about $33 million was interest and getting the bonds and redeeming some of the bonds that we already had outstanding. So I hope that answers your question. Come July, we will kind of clean this up and do it. What did we say in April, as Teledyne stands alone, how are we looking at FLIR, what we expect to happen there, we will learn a lot more about them as they do their own earnings. I think it's May 6. And then we will project what the combined company would be like with and without the one-time costs. And as I mentioned earlier, we think it's going to be a credit, even on a GAAP basis in 2022.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Got it. And I was hoping, Robert, could you maybe provide a little more color on one more thing. In the S-4, the internal projection that FLIR had for their defense technology business was about 12% CAGR. It seems like as you will learn more about the company, you are talking about quality of the assets and the people. Are those some of the projections something you would sign off on that there is a lot of growth in that defense segment which just hadn't transpired for that company to-date?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. Let me start, Andrew, if I may with a little precaution. How should I put it? We are a little bit concerned that may be the projections for them were a little aggressive in the S-4. Having said that, we have now looked at their businesses a little differently than the way they reported into two segments, which is the industrial segment and the defense segment. We have gone back, Andrew and looked at the businesses from a division of perspective the way they were in 2014 which were fixed divisions. So we have gone back and fortunately they were kind enough and good enough to provide us with the financial data in those divisions. And then they have added two new things to it. And I am going to come to the defense question that you asked. One of them is a small vision products that they bought in Canada, Point Grey, which they report as part of their components business. And that business is fairly stable. It's a small business of the order of $80 million. Now coming to the next area which is new, so now they have kind of, if you look at it the way I just mentioned, they have eight divisions the way we look at it. The way we look at the defense segment, it really has one part of it that is really new and that's their unmanned systems, both UAV and ground-based unmanned system. And that has enjoyed reading good growth, primarily because they have made some good acquisitions and they have also starting with an acquisition they made in 2016, Prox Dynamics, which makes the very small UAVs. And they have enjoyed about $260 million in revenue in 2020 in that unmanned segment which is both ground-based and UAVs. That business, I think, will grow. And I think that business will grow significantly from our perspective. And I am hoping that it will grow enough to make up for some of the detriment that we see from the business that they provided, elevated skin temperature products that are going to go down maybe last year well over $100 million, go down to less than $20 million or whatever. Having said that, so we are hoping that, as you mentioned, the defense businesses because of the acquisitions are now kicking in fully years, that those would makeup the detriment in the EST business. I don't know if I have answered your question but I think that's the best I can do at this time.\nAndrew Buscaglia: No, it's helpful. Thank you.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you Andrew.\nOperator: And at this time, I have no further questions in queue.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you Sean. I will now ask Jason VanWees to conclude our conference call. Jason?\nJason VanWees: Thanks Robert. And again thanks to everyone for joining the call this morning. Of course, if you have follow-up questions, please feel free to call me at the number on the earnings release. Sean, if you could end the call and provide the replay details for everyone, I would appreciate it. Good bye.\nOperator: Yes. Thank you.

            "content": "Thank you Robert. In our instrumentation segment, overall first quarter sales increased 0.5% versus last year. Sales of environmental instruments increased 5% from last year. Sales of most product categories increased with the strongest year-over-year organic growth resulting from the gas and flame detection products acquired in 2019. Sales of our electronic test and measurement systems increased 4.8% year-over-year. Sales of marine instrumentation decreased 6.7% in the quarter. However our operating profit increased due to aggressive cost management and business simplification and stabilization initiatives. Overall, instruments segment operating margin increased 291 basis points to 20.7%. Turning to digital imaging segment. First quarter sales increased 6.7%. GAAP segment operating margin was 19.7%, an increase of 200 basis points year-over-year. Now, turning to the aerospace and defense electronics segment. First quarter sales declined 3.3% as greater defense sales were more than offset by the 28.5% decline in sales of commercial aerospace products. GAAP segment operating margin increased over 1,000 basis points to 18.7% versus 8.6% in 2020. In the engineered systems segment, first quarter revenue increased 8.5%, primarily due to greater sales from defense and other manufacturing programs as well as electronic manufacturing services products. Segment operating margin increased 242 basis points when compared with last year. I will now turn the call to Sue, who will offer some additional commentary regarding the second quarter and our full year 2021 outlook."

            "content": "Thank you Jason and good morning and thank you for joining our earnings call. We began 2021 with a best first quarter sales, earnings, operating margin and cash flow in the company's history. Furthermore, we achieved these GAAP results despite incurring $39 million or $0.79 per share of expenses related to the pending acquisition of FLIR. Excluding these nonrecurring charges, earnings increased 39.2% compared to last year. Operating margin increased 426 basis points and our free cash flow nearly doubled. In addition, I am very pleased with the breadth of our financial performance across Teledyne. Year-over-year sales increased in nearly every major business category except commercial aerospace, which is now only 4% of our total sales. The recovery in our short cycle commercial business is unfolding nicely. And our government businesses are also growing and performing well in both cases, strongest within our digital imaging segment. Also in the first quarter, we received all-time record orders, with a book-to-bill of 1.15X, resulting in quarter-end backlog of approximately $1.8 billion. Given our strong first quarter, we now think a reasonable outlook for the total company organic sales growth in 2021 is approximately 6%, led by forecasted growth of about 10% in digital imaging, excluding FLIR. And now, with respect to the FLIR acquisition. Over the last few months, while transaction certainty progressively increased, Teledyne performed in-person visits covering 90% of all FLIR owned sites, several on multiple occasions. Most importantly, we were also granted access to the operating management in all key functional areas. To summarize, FLIR's people, products, technology and manufacturing are outstanding. I am now even more excited about the prospect FLIR as part of the Teledyne family. Thank you Sue. We would now like to take your questions. Sean, if you are ready to proceed with the questions and answers, please go ahead. Good morning Greg. Yes. Greg, the instrumentation, when we started the year, probably because it's primarily a short cycle business, we were not sure about how much revenue and therefore margins we would have. So we projected margin improvement of about 10 basis points. We think the margins are now going to be closer to 140 basis points for the year, which is an increase of about 130 basis points. Well, I think the most important thing that we found out in our visits were the quality of the operations and the people. We really haven't focused yet on revenue synergies, well, we have looked at synergies in the operating area, primarily by using some of the methodology, Greg, that we have used in our own operations such as procurement savings which have been substantial for us last year and are supposed to be the same this year as well as the some of the cost reductions that we mentioned earlier vis-a\u0300-vis the $40 million of cost savings that we expect to enjoy in the first year and growing to $80 million over time. So those would be the synergies at this time. In terms of revenue synergies, we haven't really looked at that very closely. And frankly, we operate in different markets. There are things we can't obviously look at very quickly would be, how do we jointly go to market team in areas where we have complementary products. Yes. I think the EPS accretion, it need to be, were substantial, partially because there we really improved margins. For FLIR on the other hand, if we exclude intangibles, which as you said would be substantial and the one-time costs that we will, we think that in 2022 we should have EPS accretion of about 20% or more. Of course, again, excluding the intangibles, which is substantial. Thank you Greg. Yes. I think, again, to do this properly, Blake, I have to exclude the one-time charges because while we have some handle on our charges at the time for the rest of the year, we don't have a really good handle on what FLIR's charges would be. The one area I think the conversion overall is going to be better than 100%. Having said that, inventory built up at FLIR, from what we saw in 2019 and 2020, was substantial and partially because of the elevated skin temperature programs that they enjoyed. So they have a significant inventory built up in that and some other areas that we have to look at very carefully. And we may have to write those up. We may have to write those down. But we will see as we get to it. But overall, our projections are that we ourselves should have free cash flow that slightly surpasses last year. And last year was a record year for us at $547 million, $445 million. So if we can exceed that ourselves and do well with the FLIR cash flow, that's very important, Blake, because we intend to pay down our debt as fast as we possibly can over the next two years. Let me start with the healthcare. Healthcare, year-over-year, 2019 to 2020, we had about a 13.7% decrease in revenue from $255 million to $220 million. This year, we are starting to see some improvement and we anticipate that between our CMOS X-ray panels as well as some of the equipment that we supply for X-ray sources, we would have an increase of about 9% over last year to approximately $240 million. So that kind of speaks to what you just said. The recovery is a little slower than we anticipated but it is there. We getting some really good orders in that domain, more in the flat panel displays with the X-ray sources kind of lagging a little bit but still coming up. Going back to the question vis-a\u0300-vis regular, the commercial systems. Commercial aero in digital imaging, first it's small. Second,, it's not that dependent on airline traffic. It's different than anything else. It's primarily in space domain. And we have not seen any deterioration there and actually we think that that on our aerospace and defense in the digital imaging domain, we think we will see about a 7% improvement in revenue this year from $270 million last year to maybe to $290 million this year. So the only area of aerospace that we are taking some punishment is in the aerospace businesses in Teledyne's normal defense and aerospace domain. Sure Blake. Yes. If you go to instrumentation, we did have some significant improvements in margin in environmental and test and measurement in the first quarter. And we expect those to continue for the rest of the year. We also had some improvement in margin in the marine businesses, even though revenue as Al mentioned, was down somewhat. We think the revenue will catch the rest of the year and as that does, the margin's there will improve also. So we think overall instrumentation, we have the best margins in environmental area, about 23%. Second best margins in our test and measurement, over 21%. And marine is approaching over 19%. So when you roll it all up, we are going to get close to 20.9% in instrumentation. And I think that's going to be healthy for us, especially if marine as we expect because of the oil prices going up to about $65 currently. If that improves, then I think that segment is going to do really well. That's why I said, our outlook for the margins has improved 130 basis points since January of this year. Both. First, obviously, we are seeing constraints, Jim. There's no question about that, both in the electronics components as well as in printed circuit boards. It's affecting a lot of our businesses. But having said that, we have, even though we do have very tight control of our inventory, we have approved buying some of the critical components ahead of time. And the other thing is, because of our collaborative and across Teledyne effort in procurement, we are able now to approach our suppliers as one fairly large customer. Get their forecasts in terms of their timelines for delivering product and putting orders ahead of time. Having said all of that, we are managing it. But we also are getting products from foundries, for example, that come to our wafers that we get. In that case, we are fortunate because the guys who supplies wafers are also our customers. So in some areas, we think we are going to be okay. In other areas, I am very cautiously optimistic. But this thing can really spin out of control and then we will have to deal with it again. I think our primary areas is digital imaging. For me to say digital imaging is going to grow organically 10% year-over-year, I don't know if I have ever done something like that. So I feel pretty bullish to kind of predict that. I think we will end the year with a book-to-bill in digital imaging of 1.08, maybe 1.10. So that's our first area. I think in the instrumentation area, we are right now over one. But a lot of that is short cycle businesses. If marine comes back as we expect and the other areas come back as we expect, we think, specially in test and measurement, we could have as much as 8% growth, in environmental 6%, 6.5%. And if marine comes back, that would be another 2%. So overall, I think instrumentation should give us about 5.3%, 5.2% for the year. For us that's again very good because those are the highest margin businesses. Engineered systems, I think would be fairly flat year-over-year. We don't expect aerospace to really come back that much this year. It's probably a two year cycle. But our defense businesses are doing okay. So I anticipate in aerospace and defense combined to enjoy a 4% of revenue improvement this year. Roll all of that together and you are going to end up with about 6% for the company, which would be one of our healthier organic growth rates in revenue in the recent past. Thank you Jim. Good morning Joe. Well, test and measurement, let me start there. We really enjoyed a good year in test and measurement, primarily because of being able to put out new products continuously. As you know, we have two areas that we focus on there. One of them is our oscilloscopes. And the other is protocols which are the rules that chips communicate with one another. We continue to put new products out. Like last week alone, we announced three products in oscilloscopes and protocols. But more importantly, what our guys have been able to do is marry those two businesses, those two products together. So now people can do protocol development and analysis using the oscilloscopes as real time observation of the signals. And that's going to be very good for that area. You also asked me about semi. In digital imaging is primarily where we focus on the semi market. And there as mask and wafer inspection, that's been a really good market for us. If I look at our growth in vision systems, which includes flat panel displays as well as semi inspection, we anticipate that year-over-year to be about 12% to 13% revenue growth. So that kind of speaks for that. And then lastly, I would point out one example of why digital imaging and relevant semiconductor markets are doing so well for us. We do have a product that comes off our MEMS foundry in Canada. These are pellicles which are very thin, one-tenth of a human hair thickness but six to eight inches in diameter consumable products that are used in extreme UV lithography for very fine semiconductors. They essentially are screens that protect the wafers below them. And in that area, we have really done well and have now captured that market and we have a wonderful customer there. And so overall, to answer your question, test and measurement, I talked about. And in the semi, the products that we supply to them are doing pretty well. The answer is, Jim, I don't know yet. But having said that, because as I mentioned, they do have substantial inventory and we have to obviously dig into that to see what they are using. I think that would be right now an area that we will have to bring our procurement to it. On the other hand, FLIR also gets wafers and they also make a lot of their own sensors, both on the cooled and the uncooled side. So as long as we can enjoy having the wafers and as long as we can enjoy doing some of the developments, specially in antimonide for the cooled and VOx for the uncooled, I think It should be alright. But having said all of that, we just haven't looked at it that deeply. We anticipate that there would some challenges. But we will deal with those just like we deal with challenges that come up in our business. Thank you Joe. Good morning Andrew. Okay. Let me start with the margins, please. Right now, we think digital imaging margins should go up about 150 basis points over last year well. So just north of 21%, let's say 21%. Aerospace and defense, we are going to have significant margin improvement. As Al mentioned, we had a really good uptick in the first quarter, partially because we had one-time charges last year in our aerospace but nevertheless, having said that, we think the margins are going to be approaching 18.5%, maybe 18.6%, which would be 490 basis points improvement over last year. Engineered systems going to be relatively flat. So if you take the instruments margin that I mentioned before, which was 20.9% and bring it all the way down, we think the company operating margin, I mentioned in January that we thought it would be about 17%. Now, we are projecting the total company operating margin to be closer for the year to 17.6%. But all of this is excluding, of course, anything that has to do with the acquisition of FLIR. I don't know whether I answered your call, your question. Yes. It's closer to 10% led by our vision products, cameras, including scientific cameras, sensors, as I mentioned for semi flat panel display, et cetera. And everything there is all going to do well. The only way that maybe flat year-over-year is our geospatial. Everything else seems to be growing really well. Well, if you look up the guidance that Sue provided, the $12 to $12.20, that excludes FLIR's transaction costs. So you have to look at it at this time, you have to look at that excluding interest expenses related to the FLIR acquisition as well as some of the legal expenses that come above the line. Now, once we acquire FLIR, assuming the shareholders approve the transaction, then what we will do is, we will have to put the interest for the total company as part of our moving forward normal cost in GAAP. But there are going to be some other costs associated with the transaction that are going to be substantial. Those would be one-time charges and as we talked earlier, we call those intangibles. Later on also would be inventory write-ups and other things. Having said all of that, the $12 to $12.20 excludes the FLIR transaction costs which in the first quarter were about $39 million. $5.9 million of it was above the line which was legal fees and also fees for bankers. And the rest of it or about $33 million was interest and getting the bonds and redeeming some of the bonds that we already had outstanding. So I hope that answers your question. Come July, we will kind of clean this up and do it. What did we say in April, as Teledyne stands alone, how are we looking at FLIR, what we expect to happen there, we will learn a lot more about them as they do their own earnings. I think it's May 6. And then we will project what the combined company would be like with and without the one-time costs. And as I mentioned earlier, we think it's going to be a credit, even on a GAAP basis in 2022. Yes. Let me start, Andrew, if I may with a little precaution. How should I put it? We are a little bit concerned that may be the projections for them were a little aggressive in the S-4. Having said that, we have now looked at their businesses a little differently than the way they reported into two segments, which is the industrial segment and the defense segment. We have gone back, Andrew and looked at the businesses from a division of perspective the way they were in 2014 which were fixed divisions. So we have gone back and fortunately they were kind enough and good enough to provide us with the financial data in those divisions. And then they have added two new things to it. And I am going to come to the defense question that you asked. One of them is a small vision products that they bought in Canada, Point Grey, which they report as part of their components business. And that business is fairly stable. It's a small business of the order of $80 million. Now coming to the next area which is new, so now they have kind of, if you look at it the way I just mentioned, they have eight divisions the way we look at it. The way we look at the defense segment, it really has one part of it that is really new and that's their unmanned systems, both UAV and ground-based unmanned system. And that has enjoyed reading good growth, primarily because they have made some good acquisitions and they have also starting with an acquisition they made in 2016, Prox Dynamics, which makes the very small UAVs. And they have enjoyed about $260 million in revenue in 2020 in that unmanned segment which is both ground-based and UAVs. That business, I think, will grow. And I think that business will grow significantly from our perspective. And I am hoping that it will grow enough to make up for some of the detriment that we see from the business that they provided, elevated skin temperature products that are going to go down maybe last year well over $100 million, go down to less than $20 million or whatever. Having said that, so we are hoping that, as you mentioned, the defense businesses because of the acquisitions are now kicking in fully years, that those would makeup the detriment in the EST business. I don't know if I have answered your question but I think that's the best I can do at this time. Thank you Andrew. Thank you Sean. I will now ask Jason VanWees to conclude our conference call.

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, it's my pleasure to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Jason VanWees. Please go ahead.\nJason VanWees: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. This is Jason VanWees, Vice Chairman of Teledyne, and I'd like to welcome everyone to Teledyne's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Release Conference Call. We released our earnings earlier this morning before the market opened. Joining me today are Teledyne's Chairman, President and CEO, Robert Mehrabian; Senior Vice President and CFO, Sue Main; Senior Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, Melanie Cibik. Also joining today is Edwin Roks, EVP of Teledyne. After remarks by Robert and Sue, we will ask for your questions. Of course though, before we get started, attorneys have reminded me to tell you that all forward-looking statements made this morning are subject to various, risks, assumptions and caveats as noted in the earnings release and our periodic SEC filings and of course, actual results may differ materially. In order to avoid potential selective disclosures, this call is simultaneously being webcast and a replay both via webcast and dial-in will be available for approximately one month. Here is Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Jason. Good morning, and thank you for joining our earnings call. 2022 ended up being an excellent year. We concluded it with all-time record quarterly and full year sales and earnings per share. During 2022, Teledyne, as with many other companies, found itself faced with external forces beyond our control. These were inflation, strong dollar and part shortages. Nevertheless, with continued -- we continued our long history of navigating difficult market environment and we ultimately delivered earnings in excess of our own expectations. Excluding foreign currency headwinds, which negatively impacted fourth quarter sales growth by approximately 2.6%, growth in local currency would have been 5.7%. Excluding ETM acquisition, core growth in local currency would have been approximately 5%. GAAP operating margin of 19.3% was an all-time record and non-GAAP operating margin of 22.4% increased 95 basis points from last year. GAAP and non-GAAP earnings of $4.74 and $4.94, respectively, were also records for Teledyne. Fourth quarter free cash flow was reasonably healthy, but included interest payments of approximately $30 million, which last year were made in the third quarter of 2021. While we completed the acquisition of ETM, our leverage ratio continued to decline from 3.8 times in May of 2021 when we acquired FLIR to 2.4 times at the end of 2022. Finally, our acquisition pipeline remains healthy as evidenced by the recent addition of ChartWorld, whose maritime navigation software and hardware tools bridge a product and technology gap between our Teledyne Marine and Raymarine businesses. Turning to our 2023 full year outlook. While still very early in 2023 and with many unknowns, including projections of a recession, we're inclined to offer an initial revenue and earnings outlook in line with consensus expectations. On revenue, we see total 2023 sales growth of approximately 5%, including incremental sales from recent bolt-on acquisitions. For our backlog-driven long-cycle businesses, we expect growth to be higher than average. For the majority of our short-cycle commercial businesses, foreign currency headwinds will impact the first quarter of 2023 where comparisons are tough and economic uncertainty and export regulations remain fluid. We continue to see overall growth, not contraction in these businesses, but expect that growth will be less than the total company average. On the other hand, supply chain constraints are improving, albeit modestly. There are a few minors other non puts and takes such as increased scope on our NASA contract at Engineered Systems equally offset by the 2022 completion of our OneWeb contract in the Aerospace and Electronics segments, but no other significant items to highlight this early in the year. Our earnings outlook approximately 50 basis points of margin improvement in 2023 and we currently think instrumentation and digital imaging will be above-average contributors to this, while margins at Aerospace and Defense Electronics may be flat or declined slightly, given especially tough comps as a greater mix in 2023 of Defense Electronics relative to commercial aerospace aftermarket sales. I will now further comment on the performance of our four segments. In our Digital Imaging segment, fourth quarter sales were relatively flat despite currency translation headwind of approximately 3.5%. Sales increased year-over-year for our industrial and scientific vision systems, as well as our low-dose high-resolution digital x-ray detectors. Sales of commercial infrared imaging cameras and components also increased and were at record levels since closing the FLIR acquisition in May of 2021. While total FLIR-related sales increased sequentially from the third quarter, sales of some surveillance and unmanned ground systems declined from last year on especially tough comparison. On the other hand, sales of unmanned air systems increased considerably year-over-year. GAAP segment operating margin was 18.8% and adjusted for intangible asset amortization only, segment margin was 23.8%, approximately 50 basis points greater than the fourth quarter of last year. In our Instrumentation segment, overall fourth quarter sales increased 7.9% versus last year, despite approximately 2.4% of FX translation headwind. Sales of electronic test and measurement systems, which include oscilloscopes, digitizers and protocol analyzers increased 3.8% year-over-year despite a tough comparison with the fourth quarter of last year's. Sales of motor oscilloscopes and protocol analyzers remained healthy with continued strength in products for industry standards such as peripheral component, Interconnect Express or PCI Express and Universal Serial Bus or USB. Sales of environmental instruments increased 9%, compared with last year with greater sales of both drug discovery and laboratory instruments, as well as air monitoring and process gas analyzers. Sales of marine instrumentation increased 9.8% in the quarter, primarily due to a strong marine defense sales and the ongoing recovery in offshore energy markets. Overall, Instrumentation segment operating profit increased 18.4% in the fourth quarter with GAAP operating margin increasing 215 basis points to 24.2% and 162 basis points on a non-GAAP basis excluding intangible asset amortization, which brought the non-GAAP margins to 25.3%. In Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, fourth quarter sales increased 8.9%, driven by broad-based growth of both defense and commercial aerospace products. GAAP and non-GAAP segment operating profit increased approximately 30% with margins over 480 basis points greater than last year. In the Engineered Systems segment, Fourth quarter revenue increased 6.7%, but operating profit declined given lower margins for some of our electronic manufacturing service products. Before I turn the call over to Sue, I want to make a couple of concluding remarks. First, I was very pleased that Teledyne was able to overcome issues faced by most companies in 2022. Despite the macroeconomic and supply chain challenges noted earlier, our results exceeded the top end of our earnings outlook issued at any point during the year. While difficult to predict outcomes in 2023, we are reasonably confident that a number of our long-cycle businesses serving defense, medical, energy and aerospace markets will grow. While demand is more difficult to predict in our short-cycle instrumentation and imaging businesses, supply chain constraints and the previous premiums for gray market electronic components have begun to ease modestly. Given the strength of our balanced business portfolio and our management's long history of navigating challenging markets, I am optimistic that Teledyne will continue on its successful path in 2023. I will now turn the call over to Sue.\nSusan Main: Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and then I will discuss our first quarter and full year 2023 outlook. In the fourth quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $237.7 million, compared with cash flow of $295.6 million for the same period of 2021. The fourth quarter of 2022 reflected greater interest payments due to the timing of fixed rate bond interest and increased inventory purchases, compared with the fourth quarter of 2021. Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures was $203.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared with $261.6 million in 2021. Capital expenditures were $34.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared with $34 million in 2021. Depreciation and amortization expense was $81.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, compared with $86.2 million. In addition, non-cash inventory step-up expense for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $47.8 million with no comparable amount recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022. We ended the quarter with approximately $3.28 billion of net debt, that is approximately $3.92 billion of debt less cash of $638.1 million. Our stock option compensation expense was $6.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared with $6.4 million in 2021. Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the first quarter of 2023 will be in the range of $3.57 to $3.69 per share with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $4.37 to $4.47 and for the full year 2023, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $15.80 to $16.10 and on a non-GAAP basis, $19 to $19.20. The 2023 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items is expected to be 23%. I will now pass the call to Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Sue. We would now like to take your questions. Operator, if you are ready to proceed with the questions and answers, please go ahead.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll begin today with a question from Greg Konrad representing Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nGreg Konrad: Good morning.\nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning, Greg.\nGreg Konrad: Good quarter. And then, I mean, maybe just to start, given your commentary around supply chain and long cycle outperforming in 2023, can you maybe just update us on your expectations for defense across the businesses? I mean, it seems like peers have called out somewhat underperformance on supply chain this year. What are you seeing just in terms of the supply side and also in terms of demand?\nA - Robert Mehrabian: Frankly, we think defense, while the growth was relatively modest in 2022 was 2% to 3%, that's our generally our U.S. government businesses. We think in 2023, it'll be about 5% organic growth. So we are relatively optimistic. And then\u2026\nGreg Konrad: And then, I mean, I was pleasantly surprised with just margins in the commentary. I mean, some of them seem very outside across the segment. Just in terms of your margin commentary for this year, what are some of the assumptions around price and inflation, add backs and just looking at that Q4 outperformance, anything unusual in that just let me think about the opportunities for 2023.\nRobert Mehrabian: Well, I think basically in 2022, we hit just about every cylinder at the end of the quarter, especially the last month, month-and-a-half that we stand out very favorably. Of 2023, we think Q1 is going to be softer just like we had in 2022. Mostly, we have some headwinds from FX in the first quarter. We think there will be a decline in our revenue, maybe as much as 10%, but we don't know. It's too early. Maybe 1% of headwind, maybe 1% of revenue decline, I would say that. On the other hand, I think, we will pick up in Q2, Q3, Q4, just like we did this year. Right now, early in the year, the first two weeks, we had some slower orders in some of our short-cycle businesses, but the last two weeks they seem to be picking up. So overall, Greg, I am optimistic about 2023 altogether.\nGreg Konrad: And then, maybe just sneaking one last one in. I mean, how are you thinking about free cash flow in 2023, just given top line growth, margin expansion and any working capital needs? I mean, in the past, you talked about a target, how are you thinking about 2023 in terms of free cash flow?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes, I think just pausing for a second because this would be asked. In 2022, we were a little short on cash. Well, a little $200 million, to be exact, and we think that's not going to happen in 2023. We think our cash in 2023 is going to be higher, approximately $900 million in cash, whereas in 2022, we really have to be very careful. We build a little more inventory than we wanted to primarily because of the shortages. We fell about $30 million short on revenue in the fourth quarter because of shortages. Also in 2022, there was that lack of R&D deductibility, which everybody has referred to, that costs us about $40 million. And we had about $60 million of more cash taxes, which brings us to just $400 million [ph]. We don't think that's going to repeat itself in 2023. So, we're optimistic.\nGreg Konrad: Thank you.\nOperator: And next, we're going to go to the line of Elizabeth Grenfell, representing Bank of America. Your line is open.\nElizabeth Grenfell: Just a couple of questions. One, in the 5% revenue growth guidance, could you just break out what is price and what is volume in that?\nRobert Mehrabian: I think it\u2019s a little too early to do both, but I\u2019ll tell you that\u2019s about 3.5% of organic growth and then 1.5% from our acquisitions that we made including the most recent one that we announced. If you look at projections from GDP and inflation at the current time, I am one of those people that doesn\u2019t really believe in these projections at this point. But the projections are that pre-GDP in the U.S. will only grow 1.4% in 2023 and inflation will drop to about 2.7%, overall developed markets probably GDP will grow 1.1%. That's where the projections are maybe a little higher in inflation. But Elizabeth, it's a little too early for me. I don't think the economies know either. So, I'll just say that we expect to have an organic growth of 3.5% at this time. If things move like they did in 2022, hopefully, we'll increase that and of course, we'll make more acquisitions, too.\nElizabeth Grenfell: Okay. And then, can you give us a little more detail on your outlook by segment and where you see the most opportunity for upside?\nRobert Mehrabian: Sure. First, I think in the instrumentation, which includes marine, environmental and test and measurement, we expect growth to be about 5% or average of the company. Of course, that doesn't have acquisitions in it. In the Digital Imaging segment as a whole, we again expect a 5% growth, maybe 5.1%; aerospace and defense, maybe 4%; and Engineered Systems, maybe a little over 5%. Part of the reason for aerospace and defense being a little less than the average, last year, we had that OneWeb program that we ended successfully, which contributed about $20 million in revenue. On the other hand, in Engineered Systems, we think we'll be a little above the average, because we won that very successfully won the NASA MOSSI contract, which adds about $20 million. So, that's - at this point, that's all I can say about that.\nElizabeth Grenfell: Thank you very much.\nRobert Mehrabian: Sure, Elizabeth.\nOperator: And we'll go to the line of Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nJim Ricchiuti: Hi, thank you. So is it the short-cycle commercial business where if you looked at 2023, Robert, where there might be some upside or are there some parts of the long-cycle business that could drive the upside versus the 5% that you are talking about for the company as a whole?\nRobert Mehrabian: I think if I broke it down, the marine businesses have a little longer look at them. We think marine as a whole also because the energy -- offshore energy markets are improving and our projections for that are over 7%, maybe as much as 7.5% in marine. And in the short-cycle businesses, which is environmental and test and measurement, we think that will be about 3.5% together. We think that I have already talked about some of the others. In digital imaging, where we did have a really good year and a really good fourth quarter which was in DALSA and e2v. We think we are going to be relatively flat organically, but we made some acquisitions, so that should give us about with the acquisitions maybe 3.8%. We think FLIR would do better last next year, maybe a little over 5%, 6%. So -- and the -- it's built between defense and aerospace, defense is longer cycle than aerospace. If you discount the $20 million that we don't have in web, we think defense will grow some, Aerospace may be flat, more short cycle and I've already talked about Engineered Systems and the MOSSO, which we won which are longer-cycle businesses. We feel comfortable there.\nJim Ricchiuti: So, Robert, it sounds like you are relatively positive on constructive on what you are seeing out in the market. If I look at your commercial businesses, you alluded to some variability in bookings trends in some parts of the business and maybe you can provide a little bit more color on that. But is there anything that you are seeing in the commercial areas, whether it's test and measurement or machine vision that might be consistent with a slowing economy?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes, a little bit. I think you hit it on the head. Just a sliver, I'd say in -- if you look at Marine, our book-to-bill in the fourth quarter was 1.15. That's why I said it's longer cycle, we feel good about it. We're just going to specifically what you said, environmental and test and measurement, while for the whole year, our book-to-bill is about 1 in the fourth quarter, it dropped down to 0.96. To me, that's a sliver lower. So we are a little cautious about that. So DALSA, e2v dropped even further a little bit and I think FLIR would be okay, but some of our vision systems and scientific cameras, we just hit it out of the park in the fourth quarter and we think we're a little cautious about predicting. On the other side, I mean, just to cut to the chase, the other side is that it's very early. Everybody is predicting one thing or another. All we're doing is we are kind of hunker down and we are going to do what we always do. If we have to cut, we have cut and if we have to hire, we\u2019ll hire and we\u2019ll do what we have to do to make our numbers.\nJim Ricchiuti: Was the book-to-bill, last question, was the book-to-bill around 1 for the company as a whole?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes, just under 1, about 0.96, 0.97, but that has Engineered Systems in it, which was 0.9%, but that's but it's very lumpy. For the year, Engineered System was 1.12, which is a long-cycle business. For the year, the company was closer to 1.\nJim Ricchiuti: Got it. Thanks very much.\nRobert Mehrabian: For sure.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJoe Giordano: Hey guys. How are you?\nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning, Joe. Very well.\nJoe Giordano: I've been hearing more people talk about risks, what may be in the second half of the year from prices actually going down just given some of the deflationary characteristics you're seeing in prices paid and things like that. Is that something that you're seeing, like how do you think about price and your ability to continue to raise or is it more about supporting where they are now?\nRobert Mehrabian: Well, in 2022, we added, Joe, we added about 4% in pricing. And then, if you hold against that, what we ended up spending, we had wages go up 4.5, overall buying stuff about $2.5 billion of direct and indirect materials, that went up overall, about 6.7%. Of course, that's on the cost of goods sold. I am only saying this because I want to put this in perspective. So, we increased prices across the board, 4%. Our materials inflation was 3.7% negative. Our wages were 1% negative to sales. So when you add those two, sales, materials inflation was and wage inflation was 4.7% negative. We increased prices 4%. So, net-net, we suffered about 60 basis points of determent between the two. Now, going forward, we expect to increase prices. How much? It's difficult to predict because as you said, some people are talking about decreasing prices in the second half. But we have to increase prices somewhat because we are going to have more inflation that we inherited and we are going to have to -- we are giving our employees about 4% raises across the board. So, to make up for that we have to increase prices somewhat. It depends on how the market behaves itself. We are right now saying our overall margins are going to improve 50 basis points versus last year and that's pretty good. So, we'll have less broker premiums. Last year, we paid $90 million excess fees to our brokers for parts. We think in 2023, that will maybe be half. So, I mean, it's a long answer to a short question. There is a lot of unknowns, but I feel we'll maintain our crisis and maybe increase on that level.\nJoseph Giordano: If I think about your -- the bottom-end of your guide, I mean it's a pretty narrow guide, but if I think about the bottom-end of that guide, how protected do you think you are if there is like, what kind of recessionary outlook does that have? If we do -- some of these macro indicators are pretty bad. If we do go into a recession, do you feel like you have coverage there at the bottom-end of the guide and like which businesses? Like do you -- are you anticipating declines at certain businesses at the bottom-end?\nRobert Mehrabian: Well, the longer cycle businesses are less cyclical which would be our government defense about 25%, medical, scientific, energy, aerospace in overall, which constitutes about 40% of our portfolio, I don\u2019t think those are going to be affected. On the flip side, the short cycle businesses will constitute 60% of our overall portfolio. If the world macroeconomic really suffers, obviously, we are going to have to take some hits. As you said, we have a very narrow range that we came out with, primarily because we're not sure what's going to happen. We could have probably had a larger range, but coming out of 2020 as strongly as we did, we feel okay about that.\nJoseph Giordano: Just the last one for me. Have you internally started adding things like, have you started to be a little bit more judicious on expenses and travel and things like that in anticipation of things weakening? Or is that you'll adjust as necessary?\nRobert Mehrabian: Oh no, that's a mode of our operation. It's something we do day in and day out regardless of what the macroeconomics are. We control everything. We controlled expenses in travel, we eliminate square footage of our manufacturing facilities. Everything we do we're vigilant and that's the only way we made it through 2022 as well as we did and we're going to continue that.\nJoseph Giordano: Thanks, guys.\nRobert Mehrabian: For sure.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go to the line of Guy Hardwick representing Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nGuy Hardwick: Hi, good morning. So it's been about 20 months since Teledyne closed on FLIR. Can you give us a bit of insight as to how to combine the portfolios is progressing, whether there is any -- if we've seen some revenue benefits from combining the two technology platforms? I mean in the past, you've done the same with DALSA and e2v. I'm just wondering if there is any comparable success stories or potential success stories to come from that?\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Guy. Good question. The answer is yes. We have some new products. We are -- we have some new markets, especially in machine vision and for example, also mapping or FLIR has this Raymarine business and we've had this geospatial business, where we do a lot of hydrographic mapping and the most recent acquisition that we made ChartWorld bridges the gap between those two. I don't know if we would have bought ChartWorld if we didn\u2019t have FLIR, we were just hold geospatial. So, those are really good. The other thing is that, FLIR has really exceptional products in the unmanned air vehicle domain. And we have had historically good products at Teledyne legacy in the underwater domain. FLIR also brings now ground-based vehicles. So now, if you look at the combination of the two companies, we have about $450 million or so of revenue in unmanned vehicles, unmanned air vehicles, unmanned ground vehicles, unmanned underwater vehicles. And there is a lot of common technologies between those three in terms of control, because of software in terms of digitization and imaging. So, those are some examples, GUY, after 20 months. But that will, of course, grow as a function of time.\nGuy Hardwick: Okay. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up. I am just trying to understand the FX guidance implied in your guidance, because it looks like at current rates that FX actually could be a tailwind in the second half?\nRobert Mehrabian: It could be. As we think in the first half, certainly, first quarter, we think it's going to be a 1% headwind versus 2.1% to 2.5% last year. Having said that, I don't think anybody knows. I don't think the economies know, they might say, but they don't know. I don't think anybody knows what's going to happen. I certainly don't ever put it that way.\nGuy Hardwick: Okay. But can you just clarify what rates you perhaps think about dollar euro rate you have currently?\nRobert Mehrabian: Well, currently, it's 1.09.\nGuy Hardwick: That's not what you're using in guidance, though, right?\nRobert Mehrabian: We're using about 1.06.\nGuy Hardwick: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And there are no other questions queued up at this time.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you very much. Operator, I will now ask Jason to conclude our conference call.\nJason VanWees: Thanks, Tom, and thanks, everyone, for joining, of course, if you have follow-up questions, certainly feel free to call me or email me. My phone number on the earnings release. And Tom, if you could give the replay information on the call and conclude we'd appreciate it. Thanks you.\nOperator: Absolutely. Thank you.

            "content": "Thank you, Jason. Good morning, and thank you for joining our earnings call. 2022 ended up being an excellent year. We concluded it with all-time record quarterly and full year sales and earnings per share. During 2022, Teledyne, as with many other companies, found itself faced with external forces beyond our control. These were inflation, strong dollar and part shortages. Nevertheless, with continued -- we continued our long history of navigating difficult market environment and we ultimately delivered earnings in excess of our own expectations. Excluding foreign currency headwinds, which negatively impacted fourth quarter sales growth by approximately 2.6%, growth in local currency would have been 5.7%. Excluding ETM acquisition, core growth in local currency would have been approximately 5%. GAAP operating margin of 19.3% was an all-time record and non-GAAP operating margin of 22.4% increased 95 basis points from last year. GAAP and non-GAAP earnings of $4.74 and $4.94, respectively, were also records for Teledyne. Fourth quarter free cash flow was reasonably healthy, but included interest payments of approximately $30 million, which last year were made in the third quarter of 2021. While we completed the acquisition of ETM, our leverage ratio continued to decline from 3.8 times in May of 2021 when we acquired FLIR to 2.4 times at the end of 2022. Finally, our acquisition pipeline remains healthy as evidenced by the recent addition of ChartWorld, whose maritime navigation software and hardware tools bridge a product and technology gap between our Teledyne Marine and Raymarine businesses. Turning to our 2023 full year outlook. While still very early in 2023 and with many unknowns, including projections of a recession, we're inclined to offer an initial revenue and earnings outlook in line with consensus expectations. On revenue, we see total 2023 sales growth of approximately 5%, including incremental sales from recent bolt-on acquisitions. For our backlog-driven long-cycle businesses, we expect growth to be higher than average. For the majority of our short-cycle commercial businesses, foreign currency headwinds will impact the first quarter of 2023 where comparisons are tough and economic uncertainty and export regulations remain fluid. We continue to see overall growth, not contraction in these businesses, but expect that growth will be less than the total company average. On the other hand, supply chain constraints are improving, albeit modestly. There are a few minors other non puts and takes such as increased scope on our NASA contract at Engineered Systems equally offset by the 2022 completion of our OneWeb contract in the Aerospace and Electronics segments, but no other significant items to highlight this early in the year. Our earnings outlook approximately 50 basis points of margin improvement in 2023 and we currently think instrumentation and digital imaging will be above-average contributors to this, while margins at Aerospace and Defense Electronics may be flat or declined slightly, given especially tough comps as a greater mix in 2023 of Defense Electronics relative to commercial aerospace aftermarket sales. I will now further comment on the performance of our four segments. In our Digital Imaging segment, fourth quarter sales were relatively flat despite currency translation headwind of approximately 3.5%. Sales increased year-over-year for our industrial and scientific vision systems, as well as our low-dose high-resolution digital x-ray detectors. Sales of commercial infrared imaging cameras and components also increased and were at record levels since closing the FLIR acquisition in May of 2021. While total FLIR-related sales increased sequentially from the third quarter, sales of some surveillance and unmanned ground systems declined from last year on especially tough comparison. On the other hand, sales of unmanned air systems increased considerably year-over-year. GAAP segment operating margin was 18.8% and adjusted for intangible asset amortization only, segment margin was 23.8%, approximately 50 basis points greater than the fourth quarter of last year. In our Instrumentation segment, overall fourth quarter sales increased 7.9% versus last year, despite approximately 2.4% of FX translation headwind. Sales of electronic test and measurement systems, which include oscilloscopes, digitizers and protocol analyzers increased 3.8% year-over-year despite a tough comparison with the fourth quarter of last year's. Sales of motor oscilloscopes and protocol analyzers remained healthy with continued strength in products for industry standards such as peripheral component, Interconnect Express or PCI Express and Universal Serial Bus or USB. Sales of environmental instruments increased 9%, compared with last year with greater sales of both drug discovery and laboratory instruments, as well as air monitoring and process gas analyzers. Sales of marine instrumentation increased 9.8% in the quarter, primarily due to a strong marine defense sales and the ongoing recovery in offshore energy markets. Overall, Instrumentation segment operating profit increased 18.4% in the fourth quarter with GAAP operating margin increasing 215 basis points to 24.2% and 162 basis points on a non-GAAP basis excluding intangible asset amortization, which brought the non-GAAP margins to 25.3%. In Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, fourth quarter sales increased 8.9%, driven by broad-based growth of both defense and commercial aerospace products. GAAP and non-GAAP segment operating profit increased approximately 30% with margins over 480 basis points greater than last year. In the Engineered Systems segment, Fourth quarter revenue increased 6.7%, but operating profit declined given lower margins for some of our electronic manufacturing service products. Before I turn the call over to Sue, I want to make a couple of concluding remarks. First, I was very pleased that Teledyne was able to overcome issues faced by most companies in 2022. Despite the macroeconomic and supply chain challenges noted earlier, our results exceeded the top end of our earnings outlook issued at any point during the year. While difficult to predict outcomes in 2023, we are reasonably confident that a number of our long-cycle businesses serving defense, medical, energy and aerospace markets will grow. While demand is more difficult to predict in our short-cycle instrumentation and imaging businesses, supply chain constraints and the previous premiums for gray market electronic components have begun to ease modestly. Given the strength of our balanced business portfolio and our management's long history of navigating challenging markets, I am optimistic that Teledyne will continue on its successful path in 2023. I will now turn the call over to Sue. Thank you, Sue. We would now like to take your questions. Operator, if you are ready to proceed with the questions and answers, please go ahead. Good morning, Greg. Well, I think basically in 2022, we hit just about every cylinder at the end of the quarter, especially the last month, month-and-a-half that we stand out very favorably. Of 2023, we think Q1 is going to be softer just like we had in 2022. Mostly, we have some headwinds from FX in the first quarter. We think there will be a decline in our revenue, maybe as much as 10%, but we don't know. It's too early. Maybe 1% of headwind, maybe 1% of revenue decline, I would say that. On the other hand, I think, we will pick up in Q2, Q3, Q4, just like we did this year. Right now, early in the year, the first two weeks, we had some slower orders in some of our short-cycle businesses, but the last two weeks they seem to be picking up. So overall, Greg, I am optimistic about 2023 altogether. Yes, I think just pausing for a second because this would be asked. In 2022, we were a little short on cash. Well, a little $200 million, to be exact, and we think that's not going to happen in 2023. We think our cash in 2023 is going to be higher, approximately $900 million in cash, whereas in 2022, we really have to be very careful. We build a little more inventory than we wanted to primarily because of the shortages. We fell about $30 million short on revenue in the fourth quarter because of shortages. Also in 2022, there was that lack of R&D deductibility, which everybody has referred to, that costs us about $40 million. And we had about $60 million of more cash taxes, which brings us to just $400 million [ph]. We don't think that's going to repeat itself in 2023. So, we're optimistic. I think it's a little too early to do both, but I'll tell you that's about 3.5% of organic growth and then 1.5% from our acquisitions that we made including the most recent one that we announced. If you look at projections from GDP and inflation at the current time, I am one of those people that doesn't really believe in these projections at this point. But the projections are that pre-GDP in the U.S. will only grow 1.4% in 2023 and inflation will drop to about 2.7%, overall developed markets probably GDP will grow 1.1%. That's where the projections are maybe a little higher in inflation. But Elizabeth, it's a little too early for me. I don't think the economies know either. So, I'll just say that we expect to have an organic growth of 3.5% at this time. If things move like they did in 2022, hopefully, we'll increase that and of course, we'll make more acquisitions, too. Sure. First, I think in the instrumentation, which includes marine, environmental and test and measurement, we expect growth to be about 5% or average of the company. Of course, that doesn't have acquisitions in it. In the Digital Imaging segment as a whole, we again expect a 5% growth, maybe 5.1%; aerospace and defense, maybe 4%; and Engineered Systems, maybe a little over 5%. Part of the reason for aerospace and defense being a little less than the average, last year, we had that OneWeb program that we ended successfully, which contributed about $20 million in revenue. On the other hand, in Engineered Systems, we think we'll be a little above the average, because we won that very successfully won the NASA MOSSI contract, which adds about $20 million. So, that's - at this point, that's all I can say about that. Sure, Elizabeth. I think if I broke it down, the marine businesses have a little longer look at them. We think marine as a whole also because the energy -- offshore energy markets are improving and our projections for that are over 7%, maybe as much as 7.5% in marine. And in the short-cycle businesses, which is environmental and test and measurement, we think that will be about 3.5% together. We think that I have already talked about some of the others. In digital imaging, where we did have a really good year and a really good fourth quarter which was in DALSA and e2v. We think we are going to be relatively flat organically, but we made some acquisitions, so that should give us about with the acquisitions maybe 3.8%. We think FLIR would do better last next year, maybe a little over 5%, 6%. So -- and the -- it's built between defense and aerospace, defense is longer cycle than aerospace. If you discount the $20 million that we don't have in web, we think defense will grow some, Aerospace may be flat, more short cycle and I've already talked about Engineered Systems and the MOSSO, which we won which are longer-cycle businesses. We feel comfortable there. Yes, a little bit. I think you hit it on the head. Just a sliver, I'd say in -- if you look at Marine, our book-to-bill in the fourth quarter was 1.15. That's why I said it's longer cycle, we feel good about it. We're just going to specifically what you said, environmental and test and measurement, while for the whole year, our book-to-bill is about 1 in the fourth quarter, it dropped down to 0.96. To me, that's a sliver lower. So we are a little cautious about that. So DALSA, e2v dropped even further a little bit and I think FLIR would be okay, but some of our vision systems and scientific cameras, we just hit it out of the park in the fourth quarter and we think we're a little cautious about predicting. On the other side, I mean, just to cut to the chase, the other side is that it's very early. Everybody is predicting one thing or another. All we're doing is we are kind of hunker down and we are going to do what we always do. If we have to cut, we have cut and if we have to hire, we'll hire and we'll do what we have to do to make our numbers. Yes, just under 1, about 0.96, 0.97, but that has Engineered Systems in it, which was 0.9%, but that's but it's very lumpy. For the year, Engineered System was 1.12, which is a long-cycle business. For the year, the company was closer to 1. For sure. Good morning, Joe. Very well. Well, in 2022, we added, Joe, we added about 4% in pricing. And then, if you hold against that, what we ended up spending, we had wages go up 4.5, overall buying stuff about $2.5 billion of direct and indirect materials, that went up overall, about 6.7%. Of course, that's on the cost of goods sold. I am only saying this because I want to put this in perspective. So, we increased prices across the board, 4%. Our materials inflation was 3.7% negative. Our wages were 1% negative to sales. So when you add those two, sales, materials inflation was and wage inflation was 4.7% negative. We increased prices 4%. So, net-net, we suffered about 60 basis points of determent between the two. Now, going forward, we expect to increase prices. How much? It's difficult to predict because as you said, some people are talking about decreasing prices in the second half. But we have to increase prices somewhat because we are going to have more inflation that we inherited and we are going to have to -- we are giving our employees about 4% raises across the board. So, to make up for that we have to increase prices somewhat. It depends on how the market behaves itself. We are right now saying our overall margins are going to improve 50 basis points versus last year and that's pretty good. So, we'll have less broker premiums. Last year, we paid $90 million excess fees to our brokers for parts. We think in 2023, that will maybe be half. So, I mean, it's a long answer to a short question. There is a lot of unknowns, but I feel we'll maintain our crisis and maybe increase on that level. Well, the longer cycle businesses are less cyclical which would be our government defense about 25%, medical, scientific, energy, aerospace in overall, which constitutes about 40% of our portfolio, I don't think those are going to be affected. On the flip side, the short cycle businesses will constitute 60% of our overall portfolio. If the world macroeconomic really suffers, obviously, we are going to have to take some hits. As you said, we have a very narrow range that we came out with, primarily because we're not sure what's going to happen. We could have probably had a larger range, but coming out of 2020 as strongly as we did, we feel okay about that. Oh no, that's a mode of our operation. It's something we do day in and day out regardless of what the macroeconomics are. We control everything. We controlled expenses in travel, we eliminate square footage of our manufacturing facilities. Everything we do we're vigilant and that's the only way we made it through 2022 as well as we did and we're going to continue that. For sure. Thank you, Guy. Good question. The answer is yes. We have some new products. We are -- we have some new markets, especially in machine vision and for example, also mapping or FLIR has this Raymarine business and we've had this geospatial business, where we do a lot of hydrographic mapping and the most recent acquisition that we made ChartWorld bridges the gap between those two. I don't know if we would have bought ChartWorld if we didn't have FLIR, we were just hold geospatial. So, those are really good. The other thing is that, FLIR has really exceptional products in the unmanned air vehicle domain. And we have had historically good products at Teledyne legacy in the underwater domain. FLIR also brings now ground-based vehicles. So now, if you look at the combination of the two companies, we have about $450 million or so of revenue in unmanned vehicles, unmanned air vehicles, unmanned ground vehicles, unmanned underwater vehicles. And there is a lot of common technologies between those three in terms of control, because of software in terms of digitization and imaging. So, those are some examples, GUY, after 20 months. But that will, of course, grow as a function of time. It could be. As we think in the first half, certainly, first quarter, we think it's going to be a 1% headwind versus 2.1% to 2.5% last year. Having said that, I don't think anybody knows. I don't think the economies know, they might say, but they don't know. I don't think anybody knows what's going to happen. I certainly don't ever put it that way. Well, currently, it's 1.09. We're using about 1.06. Thank you very much. Operator, I will now ask Jason to conclude our conference call."

And then, I mean, maybe just to start, given your commentary around supply chain and long cycle outperforming in 2023, can you maybe just update us on your expectations for defense across the businesses? I mean, it seems like peers have called out somewhat underperformance on supply chain this year. What are you seeing just in terms of the supply side and also in terms of demand? And then, I mean, I was pleasantly surprised with just margins in the commentary. I mean, some of them seem very outside across the segment. Just in terms of your margin commentary for this year, what are some of the assumptions around price and inflation, add backs and just looking at that Q4 outperformance, anything unusual in that just let me think about the opportunities for 2023. And then, maybe just sneaking one last one in. I mean, how are you thinking about free cash flow in 2023, just given top line growth, margin expansion and any working capital needs? I mean, in the past, you talked about a target, how are you thinking about 2023 in terms of free cash flow? Thank you."

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and then I will discuss our first quarter and full year 2023 outlook. In the fourth quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $237.7 million, compared with cash flow of $295.6 million for the same period of 2021. The fourth quarter of 2022 reflected greater interest payments due to the timing of fixed rate bond interest and increased inventory purchases, compared with the fourth quarter of 2021. Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures was $203.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared with $261.6 million in 2021. Capital expenditures were $34.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared with $34 million in 2021. Depreciation and amortization expense was $81.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, compared with $86.2 million. In addition, non-cash inventory step-up expense for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $47.8 million with no comparable amount recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022. We ended the quarter with approximately $3.28 billion of net debt, that is approximately $3.92 billion of debt less cash of $638.1 million. Our stock option compensation expense was $6.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared with $6.4 million in 2021. Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the first quarter of 2023 will be in the range of $3.57 to $3.69 per share with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $4.37 to $4.47 and for the full year 2023, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $15.80 to $16.10 and on a non-GAAP basis, $19 to $19.20. The 2023 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items is expected to be 23%. I will now pass the call to Robert."

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this call is being recorded. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to our host, Mr. Jason VanWees. Please go ahead.\nJason VanWees: Good morning, everyone. This is Jason VanWees, Vice Chairman of Teledyne and I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to Teledyne\u2019s third quarter 2022 earnings release conference call. We released our earnings earlier this morning before the market opened. Joining me today are Teledyne\u2019s Chairman, President and CEO, Robert Mehrabian; Senior Vice President and CFO, Sue Main; SVP, General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, Melanie Cibik; and also Edwin Roks, Executive VP of Teledyne. After remarks by Robert and Sue, we will ask for your questions. Of course though, before we get started, attorneys have reminded me to tell you that all forward-looking statements made this morning are subject to various assumptions, risks and caveats as noted in the earnings release and our periodic SEC filings. And of course, actual results may differ materially. In order to avoid potential selective disclosures, this call is simultaneously being webcast and a replay both via webcast and dial-in will be available for approximately 1 month. Here is Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Jason. Good morning and thank you for joining our earnings call. I am very pleased with our performance this quarter as well as Teledyne\u2019s long history of navigating challenging markets. Despite the strong dollar, supply chain constraints and inflation, we achieved record third quarter sales, earnings, operating margin and free cash flow. Excluding foreign currency headwind, which negatively impacted third quarter sales growth by approximately 3% or $39 million, core growth in local currency would have been 6.9%. In addition, year-over-year reported sales increased in all segments despite the FX headwind. Non-GAAP earnings of $4.54, was a third quarter record and just shy of our all-time record. And our earnings quality was also very high given our largest effective tax rate in several years. Overall, orders and demand remained strong, which is a testament to the strength of our balanced business portfolio. Total company book-to-bill was 1.06x and while orders remained reasonably healthy in our short-cycle commercial businesses that were particularly strong in our longer cycle government, marine and aviation businesses and quarter end external backlog of approximately $3.2 billion was also a record. Record third quarter free cash flow of $252 million improved for the second consecutive quarter and was 116% of adjusted net income. Our acquisition pipeline is growing and we are pleased to announce \u2013 we were pleased to announce the pending acquisition of ETM earlier this morning. Turning to our 2022 full year outlook, with our strong operating performance in the third quarter, we were able to increase our full year earnings outlook while derisking the prior heavily weighed Q4 forecast. On revenue, given our current exchange rate and the U.S. government\u2019s continuing resolution as well as the evolving semiconductor and technology export controls, we are a bit cautious at this time and now project full year sales of roughly $5.45 billion. In the third quarter, we also took the opportunity to refocus Teledyne FLIR by eliminating some smaller money-losing products to help improve our margins. And as a result, we had some cost towards our revenue. Finally, while supply chain constraints continue to limit shipments, we have seen a modest \u2013 very modest improvement in recent weeks at least with regard to availability of certain printed circuit boards as well as electronic components. I will now further comment on the performance of our four segments. Starting with our Digital Imaging segment, third quarter sales increased 2.3% despite currency translation headwind of nearly 4%. Sales growth was strongest for industrial and scientific vision sensors and systems as well as for our low-dose high-resolution digital X-ray detectors. Sales of commercial infrared imaging cameras and components also increased. GAAP segment operating margin was 17.2%, but adjusted for intangible asset amortization, segment margin was 22.9%, a 170 basis point improvement from the second quarter of this year. In our Instrumentation segment, overall third quarter sales increased 6.7% versus last year. Sales of electronic test and measurement systems, which include oscilloscopes, digitizers and protocol analyzers, remained strong and increased 9.7% year-over-year with growth in all major geographies and product categories. Sales of protocol analyzers across numerous industry standards such as Peripheral Component Interconnect Express or PCI Express, Universal Serial Bus or USB, and high-definition multimedia interface, HDMI, remains strong as well as sales of oscilloscopes and our unique crossing product, which combine oscilloscopes and protocol analyzers together. Sales of environmental instruments increased 6.3% compared with last year with greater sales of both drug discovery and laboratory instruments as well as air monitoring and process gas analyzers. Sales of marine instrumentation increased 5.1% in the quarter, primarily due to new record sales of autonomous underwater vehicles for both defense and commercial oceanography applications. Overall, Instrumentation segment profit increased 12.9% in the third quarter with GAAP operating margin increasing 126 basis points to 23.2% and 83 basis points on a non-GAAP basis. Excluding intangible asset amortization, the margins increased to 24.5%. In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, third quarter sales increased 4.8%, primarily driven by a 20.7% increase in sales of commercial aerospace products. GAAP segment operating profit increased 23.4%, with margin 349 basis points greater than last year. And finally, in our Engineered Systems segment, third quarter revenue increased 7.2% and operating profit also increased slightly. Before turning the call over to Sue, I wanted to make a couple of concluding remarks. Over the last 18 months, we have endured the same challenges as most companies, that is record inflation, supply chain constraints and now strong U.S. dollar. At the same time, we completed the integration of Teledyne FLIR, our largest acquisition and then we rapidly deleveraged. While the operating environment remains challenging, we are glad to be back to doing what we do best, investing in our businesses to drive organic growth, being vigilant on costs and simplifying our operations to increase margins and finally, acquiring and integrating complementary businesses. And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Sue.\nSue Main: Thank you, Robert and good morning everyone. I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and then I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2022 outlook. In the third quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $268.9 million compared with cash flow of $192.8 million for the same period of 2021. The third quarter of 2022 reflected stronger trade receivable collections compared with the third quarter of 2021. Free cash flow that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures was $252.2 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared with $163.6 million in 2021 which included $2.1 million of after cash \u2013 cash payments related to the FLIR transaction. Capital expenditures were $16.7 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared with $29.2 million in 2021. Depreciation and amortization expense was $80.8 million for the third quarter of 2022 compared with $90.2 million. In addition, non-cash inventory step-up expense for the third quarter of 2021 was $35.2 million with no comparable amount recorded in the third quarter of 2022. We ended the quarter with approximately $3.44 billion of net debt. That is approximately $3.9 billion of debt less cash of $479.3 million. Stock option compensation expense was $3.7 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared with $5.8 million in 2021. Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2022 will be in the range of $3.67 to $3.80 per share with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $4.46 to $4.56. And for the full year 2022, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $15.46 to $15.60, and on a non-GAAP basis, $17.70 to $17.80. The 2022 full year estimated tax rate excluding discrete items is expected to be 23.1%. I will now pass the call back to Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you very much, Sue. We would now like to take your questions. Operator, if you are ready to proceed with the questions and answers. Please go ahead.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Greg Konrad with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nGreg Konrad: Good morning.\nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning, Greg.\nGreg Konrad: Maybe just to start, Digital Imaging had a nice margin pickup and recovery from kind of H1. Can you maybe talk about the margin dynamics around price mix and how you think about the recovery there or maybe expectations for the year?\nRobert Mehrabian: Well, let me start with expectations for the year and then see if I can answer the rest. Actually, if you look at the year, we have net pricing improvement across all of our businesses of about 3.6% of sales, but that includes Digital Imaging. On the other hand, we have also against that, we have inflation, Greg, and price increases in the products that we buy. The price increases in the products that we buy have been about 3.4%. We also have salary increases of about 4%. So our net pricing increases have kind of offset the headwind that I have \u2013 that we have from price increases to us, that is inflation. The flipside of that is that we have had to pay a little extra for scarce products like complex FPGAs and others that we could not build into our price. So that we have had a headwind there, I am going to say about 2%, about $50 million. So fundamentally, Digital Imaging has done well. They have improved their margins, but it\u2019s been a relatively tight year up to now.\nGreg Konrad: And then can you maybe comment on just the Defense business more broadly? I mean it seems like you\u2019re getting quite a few of contracts, some at FLIR, some in the broader business. I mean broader market commentary seems to think that demand outstrips supply right now. I mean how do you think about the timing of some of these new defense opportunities and kind of the outlook there?\nRobert Mehrabian: I think the \u2013 in general, what we\u2019re finding is that in our Defense businesses, our book-to-bill has improved significantly. Now for the third quarter, actually, our government businesses were down slightly, but the book-to-bill, which is an important part for us, has improved both in FLIR, it\u2019s close to 1x, but in our Aerospace and Defense Electronics is closer to 1.5x and in Engineered Systems to 1.35x. The \u2013 what we\u2019re finding is that the demand for electronic components and systems, including parts that are going to Javelin and other weapons that are being depleted, those are coming back strong. We also have really good orders in systems that are being developed like a wide field of new tracking layer, which is for missile tracking basically. We\u2019ve had orders \u2013 good orders, and we will have programs of about 60 million over 2 years. And that goes across a lot of our products. So in general, you\u2019re right. We\u2019ve had \u2013 we\u2019ve seen strength in our Defense businesses and some moderation in our commercial businesses as time has gone on.\nGreg Konrad: And then just last one, kind of a clarification question. I mean you called out the 3% headwind from FX. Just want to clarify, is that only a translation headwind? Or are you seeing any changes to competition just when you\u2019re competing with maybe a local currency competitor?\nRobert Mehrabian: No. It\u2019s really a headwind from FX. It\u2019s a translation only. It started the year at about 1%, went to 2% in Q2, 3% in Q3, and we\u2019re estimating about 2% in Q4, for a total, Greg, of $110 million hit that we\u2019re taking to our revenue for the full year. So if we didn\u2019t have this translation only, we would have revenues \u2013 another $110 million in revenues.\nGreg Konrad: Thank you.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Greg.\nOperator: And next, we can go to Joe Giordano with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJoe Giordano: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe Giordano: Last quarter, very modest cut, I think, took some people by surprise. Now a bit of a raise here. We\u2019re kind of in the same zone at the end of the day, despite all of that. So kind of like what are the big changes? Did some kind of key risks that you were thinking about next \u2013 last quarter maybe not materialize to the same extent? Because it was kind of like a lot of movement to get to the same place, I guess, at the end of the day.\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. Well, when we started the last quarter, we weren\u2019t sure how much prices we could \u2013 of our price increases would stick. And obviously, we were also concerned whether we could manage our margins that take cost out to improve our margins. All of those coupled with the fact that our commercial orders held up pretty well, like in the Imaging businesses, helped us along the way. So in a way, yes, we were looking at \u2013 we weren\u2019t in trouble in any way. We were just kind of very cautious because the headwinds were unpredictable. But as we took some cost out and increased prices, and we had good cash flow, by the way, it\u2019s given us a lot more confidence. So we raised our outlook and de-risked Q4 at the same time.\nJoe Giordano: Yes. No, that\u2019s fair. I think when we spoke last quarter, your view for Digital Imaging margins was something like 22% ish for this quarter and then maybe 23% for next quarter. It looks like you\u2019re 3 months ahead of that, so you\u2019re at 23% now. Should we expect Digital Imaging margins to increase further in the fourth quarter?\nRobert Mehrabian: A little bit, yes. I think overall in the fourth quarter \u2013 well, let me go talk to the year, which is easier for me to do. For the year, we think we will be at 22.2%, which would be about 20 bps better than last year. So I think Q4 is going to be better about 22.9%, 22.7% of that range. Again, I\u2019m a little cautious here because there is some softness in the commercial market. But again, our Defense businesses are picking up.\nJoe Giordano: Yes. That makes sense. And then just last for me. I mean I know it\u2019s early and we don\u2019t want to talk about \u201823, but I know that there was this bogey out there for a while now about the potential for you guys to do, give or take, around $1 billion of free cash flow in 2023. Is that still in this world like a reasonable target to shoot for? Or is it \u2013 is that kind of not achievable given FX and all these other things we\u2019ve talked about for the last 6 months?\nRobert Mehrabian: Let me say, I think $1 billion for \u201823 is a little too high because we have capitalized R&D that we have to worry about. But having said that, if you look at the big picture, which is the way I approached this, we started the year \u2013 we started after the FLIR acquisition with a net debt-to-EBITDA of 3.7x. We\u2019re down to about 2.5x now. By the end of the year, everything else going along, we will be down to 2.4x. If all goes well by the end of next year and then by the end of \u201824, we will be down to 0.9x. But that gives us a lot of cash to do acquisitions. And that includes making maybe $500 million of acquisitions in the interim. So the way I look at cash flow is a longer-term view. We probably won\u2019t make the full $1 billion. We will come close, but most importantly, we will be levered and be able to make acquisitions. At the same time, put us in a position where we can do something bigger if we want to later on.\nJoe Giordano: Thank you.\nOperator: And next, we will go to Elizabeth Grenfell with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nElizabeth Grenfell: Hi, good morning. Can you give us a few details around the acquisition that you announced this morning?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. I\u2019d be happy to. It\u2019s really, it\u2019s a \u2013 while we didn\u2019t disclose the terms, it\u2019s got about 112 employees. It\u2019s in Northern California. What it does is really it gives us two very important components to our \u2013 ads to our products that we don\u2019t have. First, in the microwave area, we make traveling-wave tubes. But in order to drive these tubes, you need a power supply. So far, we\u2019ve had to go to other people to buy the power supplies for our tubes. And we\u2019ve been looking for that, and there is a scarcity of suppliers in that domain. With this acquisition, now we can essentially supply a system of both tubes and power supplies. For example, in a given application, we were studying, we sell the tubes and they add up to about $300,000 for that application. When we put the power supply with the tubes together, we can sell it over $2 million. So that\u2019s in the Defense area. The second area is in our Medical field where we supply products that go into cancer therapy, radiotherapy, X-ray systems to kill cancer. We basically have a product that makes microwave \u2013 high energy pulsed microwave that are used in that system. And we\u2019ve added to that \u2013 we seriously sell that for about $10,000. We\u2019ve added to that more components, and we\u2019ve gotten to where we sell about $40,000, $50,000 of products in a system. But again, what we didn\u2019t have is the power supply, cooling system, the whole system that you can use in developing the high-energy X-rays. And that, again, is something that ETM brings to us. So what happens is a content that used to be $10,000, we have grown it to maybe $40,000, now can grow over $100,000 per radiotherapy system. And they have really good customer contacts and they have been accepted by the customers as have we with our own products. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re making this acquisition. It\u2019s complementary to both our Defense as well as our radiotherapy businesses.\nElizabeth Grenfell: Okay. Great. And then the impact of the portfolio shaping you did within Teledyne FLIR this quarter, how much of an impact did that have on margins?\nRobert Mehrabian: It improved margins slightly, but more importantly, what we\u2019re doing is we took the costs out by reducing the workforce. It was a product line, for example, that they bought just before our acquisition in December of 2020. We bought them in May of 2021. It was a product where they were trying to produce basically commercial \u2013 industrial, commercial UAVs, unsuccessful, difficult business to be in. We have \u2013 in FLIR, we have really good products in the defense domain that we sell substantial amounts of. But to compete in the industrial domain, that was a product that we had to kill.\nElizabeth Grenfell: Okay. And then if I could shift \u2013 speak one more in, please. How are you thinking about the supply chain headwinds now? And when, if you think they\u2019ll abate? And then the sales that are being lost because of challenges are those continuing to shift to the right or are they starting to disappear, any way to think about that?\nRobert Mehrabian: Elizabeth, let me answer the second part of the question first. What\u2019s happening to us is that we have about a $60 million shortfall in sales that rolls over quarter over quarter. So it\u2019s not cumulative. It\u2019s not like you have four quarters of $60 million loss in sales that adds to $240 million, just $60 million. What happens, it gets delayed, we get parts. The next quarter, we ship what we couldn\u2019t ship, then we get delayed again. So we may start the quarter looking, saying, it\u2019s going to hurt us by $100 million, but we recover from that, so it\u2019s a $60 million problem for us right now. The flipside, the first part of your question, we are seeing some improvement especially in the more simpler printed circuit board assemblies. For example, to sell our cameras from Teledyne, DALSA and e2v, we need about 1,000 circuit boards a day on occasion. And that was drying up for various reasons. We\u2019ve managed to address that problem. So that\u2019s good. We also have some improvement in components. Having said that, we still have really tight market for more complex systems like field-programmable gate arrays, which \u2013 gate arrays, which are FPGAs. And there, what\u2019s happening is the supply shortages are such that people are allocating certain number to each company. We have a very effective effort underway to combine all of our needs across Teledyne, prioritize them and give our priority numbers to our suppliers. Having said that, that is not improving. Some of our suppliers are asking for non-cancelable orders that go out a year from now. And so you have to make choices there, obviously. And we\u2019re also doing that. So part of it is relaxing the PCBAs, but part of it with the field-programmable gate arrays, that\u2019s not. So it\u2019s a mixture. But I\u2019d say, overall, there is improvement.\nElizabeth Grenfell: Great. Thank you very much.\nRobert Mehrabian: Sure.\nOperator: And next, we go to Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nJim Ricchiuti: Thank you. Good morning. Robert, you alluded to the short-cycle business holding up reasonably well. And I\u2019m just wondering, as you think about that area of your business in a mild recessionary environment, which areas do you see the business beginning to soften the first? And are you seeing any signs of that in your bookings in any of that short-cycle business?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. In some of the products that we make \u2013 I\u2019ll start with Digital Imaging. In some of the products that we make, for example, that go into warehouses, as the demand is softening in that domain, then obviously, they don\u2019t need as much of our products for automation and improvement of delivery of their products. On the other hand, we \u2013 because we have such a broad portfolio of products that range from security to traffic to firefighting, not all of them are kind of getting impacted simultaneously. That\u2019s why we think it\u2019s \u2013 the downward pressure is not as great for us because of the diversity of our products. Now if you went outside Digital Imaging, for example, in our Instruments domain where we have environmental instruments, we have oscilloscopes, protocols, we have marine instruments, we have marine vehicles. There, things are a lot better. We think it might soften but it hasn\u2019t softened much yet. We are getting in the Instruments our book-to-bill is still 1.05x. So what happens is that\u2019s the thing that Jason and I always talk about is the breadth of our products and both in terms of who we supply to and what people buy our products for, but also the diversity of our \u2013 geographic diversity of our products, where that\u2019s protecting us. So we might have softness in some areas. But overall, I think we\u2019re doing okay.\nJim Ricchiuti: Okay. And just on the comment that you made about M&A and certainly you could see the net leverage really coming down fairly meaningfully over the next 1 to 2 years. You alluded to 2024 potentially giving you the opportunity to do a big deal. Are you averse to doing a larger deal in \u201823? Or is it a case of \u2013 there are a lot of \u2013 there are smaller deals that you could do and you\u2019ll just maybe gauge how the macro environment is and whether valuations potentially come down for certain larger assets?\nRobert Mehrabian: Good point. Right now, if you look at the market for public companies as Jason often says, people always look in the rearview mirror, right? So everybody is looking in the rearview mirror, including us, and you\u2019re seeing 52-week highs, right, in the back. It might be 9 months ago, nevertheless, it\u2019s there. So expectations are what you see in your rearview mirror. If we go forward and things persist the way they are and people see lower numbers looking backwards, then I think we will have more opportunities. Right now, what our focus is to see if we can do more bolt-ons as we have done historically. When we acquired e2v in 2017, our ratio, net debt-to-EBITDA ratio went up almost to 3x. What we did \u2013 it came down by the end of \u201820. 2.5 years later or so, it came down to essentially zero. And we in the interim, made another $500 million of acquisitions during that period. So, the number I quoted for 2024 includes us being able to spend maybe $600 million of smaller acquisitions. As to the bigger acquisitions, I think we are waiting a little \u2013 obviously, we have some things in mind, but we ought to wait a little bit before people\u2019s \u2013 people are not so effervescent about their evaluations.\nJim Ricchiuti: And is your interest mainly in the commercial area, or has anything changed with respect to how the defense environment looks?\nRobert Mehrabian: Right now, we still like our commercial businesses. But we are also seeing, as you saw, we also bought something at least a bolt-on in the defense domain, partially bolt-on \u2013 partially defense in the bolt-on. We will do some bolt-ons in the defense, especially if they fit our portfolio. But on the larger stuff, it would be either commercial or a mixture of the two, like FLIR was. FLIR was 60% commercial, 40% defense. And so we will look at that, whether it\u2019s 70%-30% or 60%-40%. We look at the combo.\nJim Ricchiuti: Alright. Thanks very much and congratulations on the quarter.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we will go to Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Hey. Good morning guys.\nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning Andrew.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Along the lines of the short cycle discussion, specifically, can you just comment on FLIR \u2013 FLIR\u2019s more industrial assets, which can be pretty volatile and can move pretty quickly, especially to the downside in a downturn? I guess what are you seeing with pace of orders or anything, any indication how that\u2019s trending in that business? And then generally, how are FLIR margins settling? And I know they have been kind of volatile during this integration process. So, can you update us on how you feel about that?\nRobert Mehrabian: Sure. Let me start with the products. Generally, I would say because of the breadth of the products, while there are some softness in some areas, just like our \u2013 rest of our digital imaging, FLIR\u2019s book-to-bill right now is close to 1x, 0.98x, which is in some ways better than DALSA, e2v. From \u2013 because of the \u2013 again, because of the breadth of the products that they have from tomography instruments to infrared detectors to maritime systems, security, traffic, I don\u2019t think we are going to get hit on all of those all at once, and we are not. The only problem that we have at FLIR, if I may call it that, is that historically, their revenues have been more skewed to the end of the quarter rather than evenly paced during the quarter like the rest of our digital imaging is. So, the only risk there is you get closer to the end of the quarter and something unforeseen happens. And then it can hurt you. We are working very hard to flatten that out. It will take us \u2013 we have the same problem in every acquisition we have made, large acquisitions, whether it was DALSA or e2v or others. And so we are working very hard to flatten that curve, the shipment curve. Having said that, coming back to margins, I think margins are settling in. They \u2013 from a non-GAAP perspective, while there has been some volatility, as you appropriately noted, I think will settle by the end of the year, we will settle to about overall in digital imaging to 22.2%. FLIR will be a little bit down from that. But generally, we should be okay. We are looking forward to really \u2013 last year was an odd year because we bought FLIR in the middle of the second quarter, and we essentially shipped 12 weeks of product with 8 weeks of cost. Again, because of that, end of the quarter shipment that I mentioned. So, that skewed the numbers. But things are fairly well stabilized now. And I think what we are looking for is make sure we get to our 22.2% by the end of the year for all of our digital imaging and then hunker down and improve that next year.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then you gave some nice color on the ETM deal. I might have missed this, but how big is this company? And maybe any information you can provide on their margin profile, where you expect those to go?\nRobert Mehrabian: Alright. Obviously, we have been hesitant to talk about it, but it\u2019s going to be probably in our Q anyways in a few days, maybe later on. But it\u2019s got about 112 people. The reason I am a little hesitant about the sales, which are about $50 million, is that they also buy products from us. So, they buy our traveling-wave tubes, including with their power supplies and they sell them. So, the deal is going to be accretive. How many cents depends on how you look at the cost of borrowing. Could be accretive $0.02, $0.03, $0.04, if we say the cost of borrowing is 4%, 5%. On the other hand, our cost of borrowing is not 4%, 5% because our average cost of borrowing with our fixed borrowing and cash is more like 2%. So, it\u2019s going to be accretive, revenue a little shy around $50 million, with some pass-through of our own products. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s helpful.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. Yes, very helpful. Just trying to get an idea of the size. Okay. Thank you, guys. Thanks Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian: Sure.\nOperator: Next, we will go to Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKristine Liwag: Hey. Good morning everyone.\nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning.\nKristine Liwag: Robert, on the supply chain, it really sounds like it\u2019s starting to ease for you and your mitigating actions have been paying off. But can you provide a quantitative update? Last quarter, you had mentioned that the 800 of 900 missing components were resolved. Where are we at this quarter? And how does that trend from here?\nRobert Mehrabian: It\u2019s getting better. Last \u2013 and you are correct. But we started the year, this year, Kristine, by having about 36% of our missing components. Of course, the components were a lower number when we started the year. There were more like 500 components and we are at 35% that we couldn\u2019t get at that time. We are now over 1,000 components, 1,100 components. But the missing percentage has gone down to about 6%, 7%. So, you are absolutely right. There is the improvement. The flip side is that of the 1,100 components, where we are missing maybe 65 or as I said, 60 open parts, the delay in those are kind of getting longer. And the demand on us is, okay, we are going to allocate so many to you, and you will get it next April. The flip side is it\u2019s a non-cancelable order. I wish I had products like that. I would love to be in that business myself. So, it\u2019s getting better, but still a challenge.\nKristine Liwag: I see. And then in terms of \u2013 maybe back to digital imaging, you had mentioned a return to portfolio simplification activities. Now, you have pruned a very small loss-making product line. But as you assess that portfolio having owned FLIR now for a few quarters, are you evaluating a potentially larger cost-cutting initiative or a divestiture, or is this kind of insulated and minimal?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. I think it\u2019s the latter. No, we are \u2013 in all of our products, I know in all of our businesses, we do 80-20, which means we take some products that are unique and they don\u2019t make money. We take the product lines out and then increase our products that are making us a lot of money. We are doing that at FLIR like we do at Teledyne. But no, we are not going to divest any large part of FLIR. We are happy with what we have and we are actually probably going to add some to certain areas.\nKristine Liwag: Very helpful color. And if I could sneak in one more. Back to your comment on the supply chain, you mentioned that for some of the missing items, the lead times are getting longer. What\u2019s driving those incremental headwinds? I mean I would think with some of the demand in other parts of semiconductors, for example, we are seeing rolling consumer demand, shouldn\u2019t that free up capacity for your orders? And I guess I am just surprised that we are seeing some things continue to lengthen instead of really get resolved sooner.\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. In some of the discrete components like using commercial domain, things are okay. They are improving. On the other hand, in some of the memory stuff it\u2019s \u2013 the length is getting longer. The lead times are longer. But depends on the complexity. Let me just kind of go through it. If you look at memory devices, lead times are getting lower. On the other hand, if you look at more complex devices, like microcontrollers, processors, the lead times are still 4 weeks to 60 weeks. So, it\u2019s kind of a mixture and depends on what device we are looking for. For the simpler components and as I have said, printed circuit boards, we are making some real improvements there, and we feel very good about that. But some of those also require our people to go into the suppliers\u2019 factory and schedule our products on a daily basis to get them out. So, it\u2019s a mixture.\nKristine Liwag: Great. Thank you very much.\nRobert Mehrabian: Sure.\nOperator: And next, we will go to Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNoah Poponak: Hey. Good morning everybody.\nRobert Mehrabian: Good Noah.\nNoah Poponak: Robert, I just wanted to go back to your commentary around the bid-ask spread in the M&A process. Some other companies that have a similar strategy to yours have pointed to that, but it pretty recently suggesting that, that hasn\u2019t really broken yet. You have a deal this morning. You are saying the pipeline looks good. You are quantifying what you could potentially spend in the immediate-term. So, I guess maybe in some ways, you have already answered this, but I am just really curious to put a finer point, like has \u2013 now that public markets peaked almost a year ago, has that bid-ask spread challenge cracked and that spread has narrowed, or are you just saying that it hasn\u2019t yet, but it eventually has to?\nRobert Mehrabian: I think in the private deals it\u2019s probably cracked a little bit. And the reason for that is private entrepreneurs are looking at things \u2013 they are looking at the world, Noah, the way it is evolving, right. The uncertainty in the future is becoming much more pronounced at this time. So, entrepreneurs that have built a business like the one we just bought, that \u2013 those people have been in business since 1973, they are becoming more reasonable because they see things are not going to get better in the short-term. So, on the smaller deals like that, I think you are right. We are seeing some better pricing. Having said that, on the bigger deals and public companies, they are still seeing 52-week highs in the background. Until we get beyond that, which is going to be another six months, four months, where people are not looking at, look my high was $500. And I am now trading at $350, they look in the mirror and say, well, my high was more like $400 and now we are at $350. Then I think it\u2019s going to be more actionable.\nNoah Poponak: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. You have referenced reducing cost and also price increases. Can you just provide a little bit more detail on where in the business you have done that? And how sizable are we talking on each side?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. It depends on the business. Some businesses, we have a hard time increasing prices because of the programs that we have, long-term programs. But let me just give you an example. In digital imaging, DALSA, e2v, for example, we have been able to increase prices about 4.7%. In marine, where we supply unmanned vehicle, but also a lot of connectivity products for oil and gas, we have also been able to increase prices about 4.7%. On the other hand, in some of our defense products, we have hardly cracked price or gotten about 1% or 2%. Having said that, on the average across the company, our price increases have been about 3.6% year-to-date. And against that, we have wage increases that are 4%. And then products, material that we buy that have been about 3.4%. That\u2019s excluding the extra 2% that we pay for scarce materials. So, that\u2019s been a wash between the price increases and the inflation. Where we hurt is, of course, we are spending $50-plus million extra on getting our scarce products. So, I think over time, that will go away too.\nNoah Poponak: Okay. And lastly, which products or segments did you allow to roll off of FLIR?\nRobert Mehrabian: Just really, there was just an Altavian product that they bought in December of 2020, about four months, five months before we bought them. Actually, we were already in discussions with them, and they picked that up. And it was \u2013 I think it\u2019s basically an industrial, commercial drone business, not in a very difficult market. There are 20 companies that \u2013 of that ilk that are competing with one another. Me on that domain, I would rather buy the truck and put in our very really advanced imaging systems on somebody else\u2019s truck. I don\u2019t want to build those inexpensive trucks. So, that\u2019s the one.\nNoah Poponak: Okay. Thank you.\nRobert Mehrabian: Sure Noah.\nOperator: And currently, no further questions in queue.\nEnd of Q&A:\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you very much. We would \u2013 if you would be kind enough operator, I am going to ask Jason to conclude our conference call, and then we will stop.\nJason VanWees: Thanks Robert. And again thanks everyone for joining us this morning. Brad, if you could give the replay information at the end of the call that would be great. And if you have follow-up questions, certainly do feel free to call me as well. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Thank you.

            "name": "Robert Mehrabian",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason. Good morning and thank you for joining our earnings call. I am very pleased with our performance this quarter as well as Teledyne's long history of navigating challenging markets. Despite the strong dollar, supply chain constraints and inflation, we achieved record third quarter sales, earnings, operating margin and free cash flow. Excluding foreign currency headwind, which negatively impacted third quarter sales growth by approximately 3% or $39 million, core growth in local currency would have been 6.9%. In addition, year-over-year reported sales increased in all segments despite the FX headwind. Non-GAAP earnings of $4.54, was a third quarter record and just shy of our all-time record. And our earnings quality was also very high given our largest effective tax rate in several years. Overall, orders and demand remained strong, which is a testament to the strength of our balanced business portfolio. Total company book-to-bill was 1.06x and while orders remained reasonably healthy in our short-cycle commercial businesses that were particularly strong in our longer cycle government, marine and aviation businesses and quarter end external backlog of approximately $3.2 billion was also a record. Record third quarter free cash flow of $252 million improved for the second consecutive quarter and was 116% of adjusted net income. Our acquisition pipeline is growing and we are pleased to announce \u2013 we were pleased to announce the pending acquisition of ETM earlier this morning. Turning to our 2022 full year outlook, with our strong operating performance in the third quarter, we were able to increase our full year earnings outlook while derisking the prior heavily weighed Q4 forecast. On revenue, given our current exchange rate and the U.S. government's continuing resolution as well as the evolving semiconductor and technology export controls, we are a bit cautious at this time and now project full year sales of roughly $5.45 billion. In the third quarter, we also took the opportunity to refocus Teledyne FLIR by eliminating some smaller money-losing products to help improve our margins. And as a result, we had some cost towards our revenue. Finally, while supply chain constraints continue to limit shipments, we have seen a modest \u2013 very modest improvement in recent weeks at least with regard to availability of certain printed circuit boards as well as electronic components. I will now further comment on the performance of our four segments. Starting with our Digital Imaging segment, third quarter sales increased 2.3% despite currency translation headwind of nearly 4%. Sales growth was strongest for industrial and scientific vision sensors and systems as well as for our low-dose high-resolution digital X-ray detectors. Sales of commercial infrared imaging cameras and components also increased. GAAP segment operating margin was 17.2%, but adjusted for intangible asset amortization, segment margin was 22.9%, a 170 basis point improvement from the second quarter of this year. In our Instrumentation segment, overall third quarter sales increased 6.7% versus last year. Sales of electronic test and measurement systems, which include oscilloscopes, digitizers and protocol analyzers, remained strong and increased 9.7% year-over-year with growth in all major geographies and product categories. Sales of protocol analyzers across numerous industry standards such as Peripheral Component Interconnect Express or PCI Express, Universal Serial Bus or USB, and high-definition multimedia interface, HDMI, remains strong as well as sales of oscilloscopes and our unique crossing product, which combine oscilloscopes and protocol analyzers together. Sales of environmental instruments increased 6.3% compared with last year with greater sales of both drug discovery and laboratory instruments as well as air monitoring and process gas analyzers. Sales of marine instrumentation increased 5.1% in the quarter, primarily due to new record sales of autonomous underwater vehicles for both defense and commercial oceanography applications. Overall, Instrumentation segment profit increased 12.9% in the third quarter with GAAP operating margin increasing 126 basis points to 23.2% and 83 basis points on a non-GAAP basis. Excluding intangible asset amortization, the margins increased to 24.5%. In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, third quarter sales increased 4.8%, primarily driven by a 20.7% increase in sales of commercial aerospace products. GAAP segment operating profit increased 23.4%, with margin 349 basis points greater than last year. And finally, in our Engineered Systems segment, third quarter revenue increased 7.2% and operating profit also increased slightly. Before turning the call over to Sue, I wanted to make a couple of concluding remarks. Over the last 18 months, we have endured the same challenges as most companies, that is record inflation, supply chain constraints and now strong U.S. dollar. At the same time, we completed the integration of Teledyne FLIR, our largest acquisition and then we rapidly deleveraged. While the operating environment remains challenging, we are glad to be back to doing what we do best, investing in our businesses to drive organic growth, being vigilant on costs and simplifying our operations to increase margins and finally, acquiring and integrating complementary businesses. And now I'll turn the call over to Sue. Thank you very much, Sue. We would now like to take your questions. Operator, if you are ready to proceed with the questions and answers. Please go ahead. Good morning, Greg. Well, let me start with expectations for the year and then see if I can answer the rest. Actually, if you look at the year, we have net pricing improvement across all of our businesses of about 3.6% of sales, but that includes Digital Imaging. On the other hand, we have also against that, we have inflation, Greg, and price increases in the products that we buy. The price increases in the products that we buy have been about 3.4%. We also have salary increases of about 4%. So our net pricing increases have kind of offset the headwind that I have \u2013 that we have from price increases to us, that is inflation. The flipside of that is that we have had to pay a little extra for scarce products like complex FPGAs and others that we could not build into our price. So that we have had a headwind there, I am going to say about 2%, about $50 million. So fundamentally, Digital Imaging has done well. They have improved their margins, but it's been a relatively tight year up to now. I think the \u2013 in general, what we're finding is that in our Defense businesses, our book-to-bill has improved significantly. Now for the third quarter, actually, our government businesses were down slightly, but the book-to-bill, which is an important part for us, has improved both in FLIR, it's close to 1x, but in our Aerospace and Defense Electronics is closer to 1.5x and in Engineered Systems to 1.35x. The \u2013 what we're finding is that the demand for electronic components and systems, including parts that are going to Javelin and other weapons that are being depleted, those are coming back strong. We also have really good orders in systems that are being developed like a wide field of new tracking layer, which is for missile tracking basically. We've had orders \u2013 good orders, and we will have programs of about 60 million over 2 years. And that goes across a lot of our products. So in general, you're right. We've had \u2013 we've seen strength in our Defense businesses and some moderation in our commercial businesses as time has gone on. No. It's really a headwind from FX. It's a translation only. It started the year at about 1%, went to 2% in Q2, 3% in Q3, and we're estimating about 2% in Q4, for a total, Greg, of $110 million hit that we're taking to our revenue for the full year. So if we didn't have this translation only, we would have revenues \u2013 another $110 million in revenues. Thank you, Greg. Good morning, Joe. Yes. Well, when we started the last quarter, we weren't sure how much prices we could \u2013 of our price increases would stick. And obviously, we were also concerned whether we could manage our margins that take cost out to improve our margins. All of those coupled with the fact that our commercial orders held up pretty well, like in the Imaging businesses, helped us along the way. So in a way, yes, we were looking at \u2013 we weren't in trouble in any way. We were just kind of very cautious because the headwinds were unpredictable. But as we took some cost out and increased prices, and we had good cash flow, by the way, it's given us a lot more confidence. So we raised our outlook and de-risked Q4 at the same time. A little bit, yes. I think overall in the fourth quarter \u2013 well, let me go talk to the year, which is easier for me to do. For the year, we think we will be at 22.2%, which would be about 20 bps better than last year. So I think Q4 is going to be better about 22.9%, 22.7% of that range. Again, I'm a little cautious here because there is some softness in the commercial market. But again, our Defense businesses are picking up. Let me say, I think $1 billion for \u201823 is a little too high because we have capitalized R&D that we have to worry about. But having said that, if you look at the big picture, which is the way I approached this, we started the year \u2013 we started after the FLIR acquisition with a net debt-to-EBITDA of 3.7x. We're down to about 2.5x now. By the end of the year, everything else going along, we will be down to 2.4x. If all goes well by the end of next year and then by the end of \u201824, we will be down to 0.9x. But that gives us a lot of cash to do acquisitions. And that includes making maybe $500 million of acquisitions in the interim. So the way I look at cash flow is a longer-term view. We probably won't make the full $1 billion. We will come close, but most importantly, we will be levered and be able to make acquisitions. At the same time, put us in a position where we can do something bigger if we want to later on. Yes. I'd be happy to. It's really, it's a \u2013 while we didn't disclose the terms, it's got about 112 employees. It's in Northern California. What it does is really it gives us two very important components to our \u2013 ads to our products that we don't have. First, in the microwave area, we make traveling-wave tubes. But in order to drive these tubes, you need a power supply. So far, we've had to go to other people to buy the power supplies for our tubes. And we've been looking for that, and there is a scarcity of suppliers in that domain. With this acquisition, now we can essentially supply a system of both tubes and power supplies. For example, in a given application, we were studying, we sell the tubes and they add up to about $300,000 for that application. When we put the power supply with the tubes together, we can sell it over $2 million. So that's in the Defense area. The second area is in our Medical field where we supply products that go into cancer therapy, radiotherapy, X-ray systems to kill cancer. We basically have a product that makes microwave \u2013 high energy pulsed microwave that are used in that system. And we've added to that \u2013 we seriously sell that for about $10,000. We've added to that more components, and we've gotten to where we sell about $40,000, $50,000 of products in a system. But again, what we didn't have is the power supply, cooling system, the whole system that you can use in developing the high-energy X-rays. And that, again, is something that ETM brings to us. So what happens is a content that used to be $10,000, we have grown it to maybe $40,000, now can grow over $100,000 per radiotherapy system. And they have really good customer contacts and they have been accepted by the customers as have we with our own products. So that's why we're making this acquisition. It's complementary to both our Defense as well as our radiotherapy businesses. It improved margins slightly, but more importantly, what we're doing is we took the costs out by reducing the workforce. It was a product line, for example, that they bought just before our acquisition in December of 2020. We bought them in May of 2021. It was a product where they were trying to produce basically commercial \u2013 industrial, commercial UAVs, unsuccessful, difficult business to be in. We have \u2013 in FLIR, we have really good products in the defense domain that we sell substantial amounts of. But to compete in the industrial domain, that was a product that we had to kill. Elizabeth, let me answer the second part of the question first. What's happening to us is that we have about a $60 million shortfall in sales that rolls over quarter over quarter. So it's not cumulative. It's not like you have four quarters of $60 million loss in sales that adds to $240 million, just $60 million. What happens, it gets delayed, we get parts. The next quarter, we ship what we couldn't ship, then we get delayed again. So we may start the quarter looking, saying, it's going to hurt us by $100 million, but we recover from that, so it's a $60 million problem for us right now. The flipside, the first part of your question, we are seeing some improvement especially in the more simpler printed circuit board assemblies. For example, to sell our cameras from Teledyne, DALSA and e2v, we need about 1,000 circuit boards a day on occasion. And that was drying up for various reasons. We've managed to address that problem. So that's good. We also have some improvement in components. Having said that, we still have really tight market for more complex systems like field-programmable gate arrays, which \u2013 gate arrays, which are FPGAs. And there, what's happening is the supply shortages are such that people are allocating certain number to each company. We have a very effective effort underway to combine all of our needs across Teledyne, prioritize them and give our priority numbers to our suppliers. Having said that, that is not improving. Some of our suppliers are asking for non-cancelable orders that go out a year from now. And so you have to make choices there, obviously. And we're also doing that. So part of it is relaxing the PCBAs, but part of it with the field-programmable gate arrays, that's not. So it's a mixture. But I'd say, overall, there is improvement. Sure. Yes. In some of the products that we make \u2013 I'll start with Digital Imaging. In some of the products that we make, for example, that go into warehouses, as the demand is softening in that domain, then obviously, they don't need as much of our products for automation and improvement of delivery of their products. On the other hand, we \u2013 because we have such a broad portfolio of products that range from security to traffic to firefighting, not all of them are kind of getting impacted simultaneously. That's why we think it's \u2013 the downward pressure is not as great for us because of the diversity of our products. Now if you went outside Digital Imaging, for example, in our Instruments domain where we have environmental instruments, we have oscilloscopes, protocols, we have marine instruments, we have marine vehicles. There, things are a lot better. We think it might soften but it hasn't softened much yet. We are getting in the Instruments our book-to-bill is still 1.05x. So what happens is that's the thing that Jason and I always talk about is the breadth of our products and both in terms of who we supply to and what people buy our products for, but also the diversity of our \u2013 geographic diversity of our products, where that's protecting us. So we might have softness in some areas. But overall, I think we're doing okay. Good point. Right now, if you look at the market for public companies as Jason often says, people always look in the rearview mirror, right? So everybody is looking in the rearview mirror, including us, and you're seeing 52-week highs, right, in the back. It might be 9 months ago, nevertheless, it's there. So expectations are what you see in your rearview mirror. If we go forward and things persist the way they are and people see lower numbers looking backwards, then I think we will have more opportunities. Right now, what our focus is to see if we can do more bolt-ons as we have done historically. When we acquired e2v in 2017, our ratio, net debt-to-EBITDA ratio went up almost to 3x. What we did \u2013 it came down by the end of \u201820. 2.5 years later or so, it came down to essentially zero. And we in the interim, made another $500 million of acquisitions during that period. So, the number I quoted for 2024 includes us being able to spend maybe $600 million of smaller acquisitions. As to the bigger acquisitions, I think we are waiting a little \u2013 obviously, we have some things in mind, but we ought to wait a little bit before people's \u2013 people are not so effervescent about their evaluations. Right now, we still like our commercial businesses. But we are also seeing, as you saw, we also bought something at least a bolt-on in the defense domain, partially bolt-on \u2013 partially defense in the bolt-on. We will do some bolt-ons in the defense, especially if they fit our portfolio. But on the larger stuff, it would be either commercial or a mixture of the two, like FLIR was. FLIR was 60% commercial, 40% defense. And so we will look at that, whether it's 70%-30% or 60%-40%. We look at the combo. Thank you. Good morning Andrew. Sure. Let me start with the products. Generally, I would say because of the breadth of the products, while there are some softness in some areas, just like our \u2013 rest of our digital imaging, FLIR's book-to-bill right now is close to 1x, 0.98x, which is in some ways better than DALSA, e2v. From \u2013 because of the \u2013 again, because of the breadth of the products that they have from tomography instruments to infrared detectors to maritime systems, security, traffic, I don't think we are going to get hit on all of those all at once, and we are not. The only problem that we have at FLIR, if I may call it that, is that historically, their revenues have been more skewed to the end of the quarter rather than evenly paced during the quarter like the rest of our digital imaging is. So, the only risk there is you get closer to the end of the quarter and something unforeseen happens. And then it can hurt you. We are working very hard to flatten that out. It will take us \u2013 we have the same problem in every acquisition we have made, large acquisitions, whether it was DALSA or e2v or others. And so we are working very hard to flatten that curve, the shipment curve. Having said that, coming back to margins, I think margins are settling in. They \u2013 from a non-GAAP perspective, while there has been some volatility, as you appropriately noted, I think will settle by the end of the year, we will settle to about overall in digital imaging to 22.2%. FLIR will be a little bit down from that. But generally, we should be okay. We are looking forward to really \u2013 last year was an odd year because we bought FLIR in the middle of the second quarter, and we essentially shipped 12 weeks of product with 8 weeks of cost. Again, because of that, end of the quarter shipment that I mentioned. So, that skewed the numbers. But things are fairly well stabilized now. And I think what we are looking for is make sure we get to our 22.2% by the end of the year for all of our digital imaging and then hunker down and improve that next year. Alright. Obviously, we have been hesitant to talk about it, but it's going to be probably in our Q anyways in a few days, maybe later on. But it's got about 112 people. The reason I am a little hesitant about the sales, which are about $50 million, is that they also buy products from us. So, they buy our traveling-wave tubes, including with their power supplies and they sell them. So, the deal is going to be accretive. How many cents depends on how you look at the cost of borrowing. Could be accretive $0.02, $0.03, $0.04, if we say the cost of borrowing is 4%, 5%. On the other hand, our cost of borrowing is not 4%, 5% because our average cost of borrowing with our fixed borrowing and cash is more like 2%. So, it's going to be accretive, revenue a little shy around $50 million, with some pass-through of our own products. I don't know if that's helpful. Sure. Good morning. It's getting better. Last \u2013 and you are correct. But we started the year, this year, Kristine, by having about 36% of our missing components. Of course, the components were a lower number when we started the year. There were more like 500 components and we are at 35% that we couldn't get at that time. We are now over 1,000 components, 1,100 components. But the missing percentage has gone down to about 6%, 7%. So, you are absolutely right. There is the improvement. The flip side is that of the 1,100 components, where we are missing maybe 65 or as I said, 60 open parts, the delay in those are kind of getting longer. And the demand on us is, okay, we are going to allocate so many to you, and you will get it next April. The flip side is it's a non-cancelable order. I wish I had products like that. I would love to be in that business myself. So, it's getting better, but still a challenge. Yes. I think it's the latter. No, we are \u2013 in all of our products, I know in all of our businesses, we do 80-20, which means we take some products that are unique and they don't make money. We take the product lines out and then increase our products that are making us a lot of money. We are doing that at FLIR like we do at Teledyne. But no, we are not going to divest any large part of FLIR. We are happy with what we have and we are actually probably going to add some to certain areas. Yes. In some of the discrete components like using commercial domain, things are okay. They are improving. On the other hand, in some of the memory stuff it's \u2013 the length is getting longer. The lead times are longer. But depends on the complexity. Let me just kind of go through it. If you look at memory devices, lead times are getting lower. On the other hand, if you look at more complex devices, like microcontrollers, processors, the lead times are still 4 weeks to 60 weeks. So, it's kind of a mixture and depends on what device we are looking for. For the simpler components and as I have said, printed circuit boards, we are making some real improvements there, and we feel very good about that. But some of those also require our people to go into the suppliers' factory and schedule our products on a daily basis to get them out. So, it's a mixture. Sure. Good Noah. I think in the private deals it's probably cracked a little bit. And the reason for that is private entrepreneurs are looking at things \u2013 they are looking at the world, Noah, the way it is evolving, right. The uncertainty in the future is becoming much more pronounced at this time. So, entrepreneurs that have built a business like the one we just bought, that \u2013 those people have been in business since 1973, they are becoming more reasonable because they see things are not going to get better in the short-term. So, on the smaller deals like that, I think you are right. We are seeing some better pricing. Having said that, on the bigger deals and public companies, they are still seeing 52-week highs in the background. Until we get beyond that, which is going to be another six months, four months, where people are not looking at, look my high was $500. And I am now trading at $350, they look in the mirror and say, well, my high was more like $400 and now we are at $350. Then I think it's going to be more actionable. Yes. It depends on the business. Some businesses, we have a hard time increasing prices because of the programs that we have, long-term programs. But let me just give you an example. In digital imaging, DALSA, e2v, for example, we have been able to increase prices about 4.7%. In marine, where we supply unmanned vehicle, but also a lot of connectivity products for oil and gas, we have also been able to increase prices about 4.7%. On the other hand, in some of our defense products, we have hardly cracked price or gotten about 1% or 2%. Having said that, on the average across the company, our price increases have been about 3.6% year-to-date. And against that, we have wage increases that are 4%. And then products, material that we buy that have been about 3.4%. That's excluding the extra 2% that we pay for scarce materials. So, that's been a wash between the price increases and the inflation. Where we hurt is, of course, we are spending $50-plus million extra on getting our scarce products. So, I think over time, that will go away too. Just really, there was just an Altavian product that they bought in December of 2020, about four months, five months before we bought them. Actually, we were already in discussions with them, and they picked that up. And it was \u2013 I think it's basically an industrial, commercial drone business, not in a very difficult market. There are 20 companies that \u2013 of that ilk that are competing with one another. Me on that domain, I would rather buy the truck and put in our very really advanced imaging systems on somebody else's truck. I don't want to build those inexpensive trucks. So, that's the one. Sure Noah."

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and then I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2022 outlook. In the third quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $268.9 million compared with cash flow of $192.8 million for the same period of 2021. The third quarter of 2022 reflected stronger trade receivable collections compared with the third quarter of 2021. Free cash flow that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures was $252.2 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared with $163.6 million in 2021 which included $2.1 million of after cash \u2013 cash payments related to the FLIR transaction. Capital expenditures were $16.7 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared with $29.2 million in 2021. Depreciation and amortization expense was $80.8 million for the third quarter of 2022 compared with $90.2 million. In addition, non-cash inventory step-up expense for the third quarter of 2021 was $35.2 million with no comparable amount recorded in the third quarter of 2022. We ended the quarter with approximately $3.44 billion of net debt. That is approximately $3.9 billion of debt less cash of $479.3 million. Stock option compensation expense was $3.7 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared with $5.8 million in 2021. Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2022 will be in the range of $3.67 to $3.80 per share with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $4.46 to $4.56. And for the full year 2022, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $15.46 to $15.60, and on a non-GAAP basis, $17.70 to $17.80. The 2022 full year estimated tax rate excluding discrete items is expected to be 23.1%. I will now pass the call back to Robert."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time.  As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to our host, Jason VanWees. Please go ahead.\nJason VanWees: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. This is Jason VanWees, Vice Chairman, and I'd like to welcome everyone to Teledyne's second quarter 2022 earnings release conference call. We released our earnings earlier this morning. Joining me today are Teledyne's Chairman, President and CEO, Robert Mehrabian; Senior Vice President and CFO, Sue Main; Senior Vice President, General Counsel, Chief  and also Edwin Roks, Executive VP of Teledyne. After remarks by Robert and Sue, we will ask for your questions. Of course, though, before we get started our attorneys have reminded me to tell you that all forward-looking statements made this morning are subject to various assumptions, risks and caveats, as noted in the earnings release and our periodic SEC filings. And of course, actual results may differ materially. In order to avoid potential selective disclosures, this call is simultaneously being webcast and a replay both via dial-in and webcast will be available for approximately one month. Here is Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Jason. Good morning, and thank you for joining our earnings call. In the second quarter sales increased nearly 21% to about $1.36 billion. In addition, our GAAP operating profit, operating margins and earnings per share were all time or second quarter records. Non-GAAP earnings declined slightly but last year's non-GAAP margin and earnings resulted in part from a disproportionate amount of sales relative to costs near the end of the quarter at Teledyne FLIR, as well as lower share count, both due to the mid-quarter closing of the FLIR transaction in May 2021. Including increased foreign currency headwinds, which negatively impacted second quarter sales growth by over 1.7% or approximately $23 million, organic growth was 8.2% and accelerated from the first quarter of 2022. Our short cycle commercial instrumentation and imaging businesses grew strongly in the quarter, and sales from our long cycle Aerospace and Marine businesses also increased. Finally, our US government sales including Teledyne FLIR increased from last year, despite lower defense department outlays in the second quarter of 2022. In summary, year-over-year sales increased in all segments and reported product lines. Overall demand remained strong and we achieved record quarterly orders with a total company book-to-bill of 1.08 times. Orders were particularly strong Teledyne FLIR, where book-to-bill was approximately 1.25. Free cash flow improved from the first quarter, but planned inventory levels remained elevated to counter continuing supply chain risk. Finally, our leverage ratio declined to 2.5 times, and having reached our targeted leverage range, we are again pursuing acquisitions and are pleased to have recently completed our first small bolt-on acquisition of Teledyne FLIR. Turning now to our 2022 outlook, given the recent and significant appreciation of the US dollar, ongoing supply chain constraints and inflation, we believe it's prudent to revise our reported revenue and adjusted earnings outlook modestly for the remainder of the year. Foreign currency translation impacts our three largest segment, and approximately 20% of our total sales with digital imaging and particularly, Teledyne FLIR impacted considerably more than other segments. In addition, supply chain concerns continue to limit shipments. Electronic component and other material shortages negatively impacted second quarter sales by approximately $60 million, and we are assuming that a similar shortfall will continue in the remainder of the year. We have countered both of these headwinds through our various procurement initiatives and strong execution. Nevertheless, we expect total company year-over-year reported organic sales growth of about 4% in each of the third and fourth quarters of 2022, compared with the prior outlook of roughly 5% to 6% resulting in a few - full year estimated sales of about $5.47 billion. Despite these headwinds, we continue to see full year organic sales growth which excludes FLIR of just over 6%, and full year sales from Teledyne FLIR slightly greater than the peak sales in 2020, which included over $125 million from cameras for elevated skin temperature testing. Finally, while foreign currency sales and costs are reasonably balanced at Teledyne, there is no delays and impact on earnings. We also remain a bit cautious regarding cost impact of inflation, therefore, we're modestly revising our full year adjusted earnings outlook by $0.30 at the midpoint, or approximately 1.7% lower than in April. I will now turn the call over to - no sorry, I'm going to continue with our performance of our business segments. In digital imaging, second quarter sales increased 32.9%, largely due to FLIR acquisition, but organic growth in our combined commercial and government imaging businesses was also very strong at 10.3%. Sales growth was strongest for industrial and scientific vision sensors and systems, as well as for our low dose high resolution digital X-ray detectors. GAAP operating margin was 15.2%, but adjusted for intangible asset amortization segment margin was 21.2%. In our Instrumentation segment, overall second quarter sales increased 7.4% versus last year's. Sales of electronic test and measurement systems, which include oscilloscopes, digitizers and protocol analyzers remained strong and increased 11.3% year-over-year. Sales of environmental instruments increased 2.4% compared with last year, with greater sales from certain human health and drug discovery products offset by lower sales of industrial and laboratory gas detection devices. Sales of marine instrumentation increased 9.9% in the quarter due to improved energy  record sales of autonomous underwater vehicles for both defense and commercial oceanography applications. Overall, instrumentation segment operating profit increased 13.9% in the second quarter with operating margin increasing 136 basis points, or 108 basis points excluding intangible asset amortization. In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, second quarter sales increased 10.8% driven by a 3.4% growth in defense, space and industrial sales combined  43.9% increase in sales of commercial aerospace products. GAAP operating margin increased 55.2% with margin 749 basis points . Finally, in the Engineered Systems segment, second quarter revenue increased slightly, but operating profit and margin declined primarily due to lower sales of fixed price electronics systems. Before turning the call over to Sue, I want to make a few concluding remarks. We continue to focus on strong execution in order this to minimize ongoing supply chain risk, inflation and now increased currency headwinds. While the operating environment remains challenging, we're highly confident of our balanced and resilient mix of commercial and government businesses across a broad range of geographies and end market. Furthermore, uncertain times have traditionally created opportunities for Teledyne, for example,  the change in interest rates, we were able to repurchase fixed rate debt issued just last year at a substantial discount. And while relatively small, the cash paid for the first acquisition for Teledyne FLIR was negotiated and paid in euros. Given the strength of our management, operations and balance sheet now, specifically with our leverage ratio at 2.5 times which we expect to be further reduced in the balance of the year, we're able to continue to seek similar and larger acquisitions in the future. And now, I will turn the call over to Sue.\nSue Main: Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert, and then I will discuss our third quarter and full year 2022 outlook. In the second quarter cash flow from operating activities was $196.9 million compared with cash flow of $211.3 million for the same period of 2021. The second quarter of 2022 reflected higher purchases of inventories and higher income tax payments compared with the second quarter of 2021. Free cash flow, that is, cash from operating activities less capital expenditures was $176.1 million in the second quarter of 2022, compared with $190.5 million in 2021, which included $66.7 million of after-tax cash payments related to the FLIR transaction. Capital expenditures were $20.8 million for both second quarter periods. Depreciation and amortization expense was $82.7 million for the second quarter of 2022, compared with $59.7 million in 2021, which reflected the timing of the FLIR acquisition midway through the second quarter of 2021. We ended the quarter with approximately $3.6 billion - $3.67 billion of net debt, that is approximately $3.95 billion of debt less cash of $278.8 million. Stock option compensation expense was $3.6 million for both the second quarter periods. Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the third quarter of 2022 will be in the range of $3.36 to $3.54 per share, with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $4.20 to $4.35. And for the full year 2022, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $15.13 to $15.45, and on a non-GAAP basis $17.45 to $17.70. The 2022 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items is expected to be 23.1%. I'll now pass the call back to Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Sue. We would now like to take your questions. Operator, if you are ready to proceed with the questions-and-answers, please go ahead.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our first question comes from the line of Greg Konrad with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nGreg Konrad: Good morning.\nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning, Greg.\nGreg Konrad: Interesting last name there. But yes, just I mean, I guess it's uncharacteristic for Teledyne to cut guidance. I mean a lot of times, you have contingency and just low P ratings in your guidance. And I mean the commentary was helpful. But is there any way to maybe parse across the segments? I mean, it seems like A&D might be running ahead of your guidance, digital imaging below. Can you just maybe give us some more color around how you're thinking about the growth and margin outlook for the segments?\nRobert Mehrabian: Right. It is uncharacteristic, Greg, you're right, and I admit it. There are three things that have happened. Two, we were dealing with fairly successfully, and that would be overall inflation and basically parts shortages. We seem to be rolling $60 million every quarter over and over. So in total, they continue at that level. The one that just hit us very hard was foreign currency. Foreign currency translation basically affects 20% of our business. And the reason it hit digital imaging the hardest, that's where we have most of our foreign currency transactions. You're right and they did well. Instruments did okay. Engineered Systems was down slightly, but Engineered Systems now is only 8% of our portfolio. It's foreign currency that hit us about 1.7% in Q2 or about $23 million, $25 million in revenue. And we expect it to continue in Q3 and Q4. I think that's the fundamental change that we saw. And it was mostly, of course, in digital imaging. And we have not changed our guidance this is the fourth times in 22 years. And it's something we do not do, except the three continuing headwinds that we see. We could handle two, but the third one just is too much at this time. Hopefully, we'll execute better as we move along in the rest of the year.\nGreg Konrad: And I appreciate that. I mean, I guess everything you're saying is more on the supply side, let's say, rather than the demand side. And you mentioned the book-to-bill, but maybe there are areas that have risk. I mean I'm thinking about tech spending and what we've heard from some of the tech companies. I mean anywhere where you've seen any demand deterioration or kind of concerns? Or is this really all more supply and FX driven?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. I think the quick answer is no. Our demand has been very strong. Maybe as a function of time, we may have some demand decline, especially in our discretionary businesses, which are really primarily Raymarine. So there, I think demand was softer. But across the board, the demand has been pretty good.\nGreg Konrad: And then just last one for me. I mean you mentioned FLIR bookings, I guess they were 25% above sales. We've seen some nice awards there. How does that maybe intersect with the supply chain and kind of ability to deliver on these? And let me just think about defense getting better. Is that more of a 2023 item, just given supply chain? Or how you're thinking about the kind of the cadence there?\nRobert Mehrabian: I think we have supply chain challenges there as we have across our businesses. I think what we're looking at is improving our revenue there in the fourth quarter - in the third and fourth quarter better than we have in the first two quarters and mostly in the fourth quarter. So we have the same problems across the board. At FLIR, the unusual situation that we've had to slowly - and we're correcting Edwin Roks, who runs our digital imaging businesses is working very hard on it, is to linearize the sales over the quarters. And that's been hard because FLIR has historically always sold more in the last month and the last week of the quarter than early on, and that causes issues, especially if you have some supply chain issues that can cause you to miss last minute revenue. So we're taking all of that into consideration in what we've put out in our earnings release.\nGreg Konrad: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Joe Giordano, Cowen. Please go ahead.\nRobert Mehrabian: Joe, how are you?\nJoe Giordano: Hi, I'm doing well. Thanks, guys. Good morning. Can you just talk a little bit about price and what you guys have been doing in the quarter and maybe more recently, given FX changes? Is this changing the way you're going to market a little bit?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. Our price increases for the year, we anticipate it to be about 3% of sales. It's a little more in the Q3 and Q4 than it was in Q2. In Q2, it was less than 3%, which has not been really - we're just put in some increases in prices, especially in some of our instrument businesses where we could, and that would be in Q3. So overall, I'd say, Joe, it's about 3%. The flip side is that the cost increases due to inflation and also wages that we have exceeded that, I'm going to say, by 0.5%, 0.6%, and that's causing some issues. But we kind of knew that would happen and we kind of worked on that very hard. The thing that kind of suddenly came out of at us was the change in the exchange rate starting in April, and that was the hard part.\nJoe Giordano: So when I look at margins, running hot in AD&E just on the mix with the lower OE content and then running now lower than people would have thought in imaging. As you start thinking about the next couple of quarters, what's like a good - none of those are probably totally representative of like the normalized. So like  we think about margins coming out of this in a more normal situation?\nRobert Mehrabian: Well, let me start with versus April, which would be a good way to go. As I said before, in instruments for the full year, we expect margins to improve about 50 to 55 basis points. In Digital Imaging now, we expect it to be lower by 130 basis points from what - for the full year. In Aerospace and Defense, we have a good run there, primarily because you know commercial aerospace is coming back, and so we expect improvements in margin of 150 basis points. And lastly, as I said, in a smaller segment, which is our Engineered segment, maybe 60 basis points decline. When you add all of that up, it's about 45 basis points decline across the company. That's - I think that's versus April, that's what the summary is.\nJoe Giordano: And if I was to think about coming out of this, though, like I know it's too early to look at '23 guidance. But like if I was to think about coming out of this versus the second half run rate that Imaging in Aerospace, specifically are going to have. Like is the Aerospace margins a level from which to grow from? Or is that like too hard of a comp? And vice versa, does the Imaging second half provide a pretty attractive like exit rate for you to improve on? Thanks.\nRobert Mehrabian: I think you're correct on Aerospace and Defense. It already has full year margins of 25.5%, which is pretty high. It could go up a little bit. I think there are opportunities going to be in Digital Imaging and also in Engineered Systems. The margins in instruments are already pretty healthy approaching 25%.\nJoe Giordano: Thanks, guys. I'll pass along.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Elizabeth Grenfell, Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nElizabeth Grenfell: Hi, good morning.\nRobert Mehrabian: Hi. Good morning, Elizabeth.\nElizabeth Grenfell: Hi. As we think about things that have slipped to the right because of supply chain challenges, are those going to be able to be shipped later at a later date? Or...\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. Good question. Very good question. First, let me back up a second. When we started Q2, we had supply chain challenges. We have a very strong program in procurement. And we were able to offset about $120 plus millions of supply chain challenges by buying through brokers, by buying our own buyers in Asia by a variety of techniques. And so we offset the $120 million plus of revenue that was in danger. That left us with $60 million that we couldn't. But that $60 million is rolling in a way quarter-to-quarter, it's not additive. And what happens is that we think that right now, that's going to continue for the next two quarters and that's where our estimates are coming from. But having said that, because we have elevated our inventory over time that this is going to dissipate. There's no question about that. Whether the over time is going to be early next year or later next year, but over time, this is going to - it's not lost revenue and it's not lost inventory. It's just lost revenue for the time being. So it's going to improve.\nElizabeth Grenfell: Great. Thank you very much.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jim Ricchiuti, Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nJim Ricchiuti: All right. Thank you. Good morning. Robert, I could appreciate the sudden change in currency. But I wanted to go back to supply chain. Have you guys perhaps underestimated the impact of supply chain or in that maybe you thought it would improve a little sooner? Or is this just something that you've been tracking and it's just not getting better and this was in line with what you'd expected?\nRobert Mehrabian: Jim, yes, it's improved only because we're able to find more parts. We have, for example, if you look at year-to-date, we have about - we're missing about 900, what we call, important critical parts. They range from computer chips that go into our vision systems to FPGAs et cetera. And out of the 900, we've actually located 800 through the various processes. Sometimes, we redesigned the product, if we can, if it's very easy to redesign. Sometimes we buy a part and we have to obviously qualify it. So - and sometimes, we just buy parts through brokers. What I didn't estimate within the estimate was that the broker purchases would be as expensive as they are. We're paying sometimes as much as 70% premium for the same part when we buy through a broker because they're going out and finding the part. But it's - that's not unusual. If you create a vacuum eventually, air comes in, right? So you got these brokers that are doing pretty good work and making a lot of money. When that happens, supply chain is going to change eventually, and it is. The only places that I would say we may be underestimated is that some of the very high-end and complex components where the orders that our suppliers are quoting are 12 to 24 months out. And they're also asking to - for us to put in noncancelable orders. So you have to be very helpful in the latter, of course. So I don't think we underestimated it. It's just that things didn't get better at all. And we're not counting on it getting better in the rest of the year. I think 2022 is going to be different. If some of this stuff continues the way it is, we'll redesign more products. I mean, just the way it is, we'll redesign and eventually come out of it. I don't think it's going to go way beyond 2023.\nJim Ricchiuti: Got it. And one of the things that struck by - I - was the Defense business. I thought you might have shown a little bit more growth in Q2. Is this just more indicative of the pattern we've seen at FLIR over the years, where it's just going to be skewed more toward the Q4 period?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. Here's the problem, while Defense budgets are up, the outlays are not. It's kind of like a constricting a dam that's constricting the flow. The flip side of it is that if you look at the second quarter and you look at FLIR particularly, the defense side of FLIR actually increased 8%. It's the commercial side of FLIR that was flat or just slightly down primarily due to Raymarine, the maritime that I mentioned, which are discretionary. But the defense side increased year-over-year. Actually, if you looked at FLIR Q2 of last year, full Q2 of last year versus Q2 of this year. That is look at how much they sold before we acquired them, how much they sold after we acquired them, versus how much they sold this quarter. Overall, FLIR's revenue was up 2.8% primarily because of their defense business being up 8%. So with this recent awards, we feel very good about that. And we have very strong leadership in our defense businesses under JihFen, who used to be with us, went to Department of Defense ended up at the very end of her career there to be acting Deputy Secretary of Research and Engineering. So we feel good about that. And we are expecting things to improve there.\nJim Ricchiuti: And last question from me, and I'll go back into the queue is just you mentioned Raymarine potentially as the macroeconomic environment deteriorates that could be impacted. But just given the way the portfolio has changed now with FLIR. As you look at the broader portfolio, which areas of the business might potentially be precursors of some change in demand that you might see if the economic environment changes more quickly?\nRobert Mehrabian: I think the canary in the mine, if you want to say put it that way, is going to be some of our commercial Digital Imaging products. We saw some declines in certain areas. There are different reasons for it, for example, in our health care, Digital Imaging because the COVID things went soft. But now it's growing very fast and doing really well and taking market share. But I would say some of our commercial Digital Imaging would be a good signal for us from a market perspective. But we have - because we - overall, because we have relatively small, very limited exposure to consumer demand, we don't see that affecting us. We're not - 50% of our portfolio is Defense, Aerospace, Medical, Energy. Those markets are going to be fine.\nJim Ricchiuti: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia, Berenberg. Please go ahead.\nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Good morning, guys. Good morning. So last quarter, you guys sounded a little bit more net positive on the outlook in Defense, obviously, with what's going on in the world. What is your view at this point? And do you foresee some potential awards or projects that aren't currently embedded in your guidance moving awards maybe before year-end?\nRobert Mehrabian: Well, yes. So, as you know, Andrew, we've had a succession of awards recently in the Defense that have been - and we put news releases out on most of them. And most of them by in the FLIR area. We think some of our European awards are a little delayed. As you know, to get, for example, if you were to get things to Ukraine, you have to go through one of the other NATO countries. And some of those are taking time. The flip side is that some of the larger awards that we've had, for example, US Army's family of weapons site for individuals, which are mounted devices that go in rifles, that's a $500 million reward. But we're in the early phase, so we expect that the increased revenue for that will come in future periods rather than immediately. We've had a major award from the Danish Ministry of Defense for mobile sensor systems. And we also had, as we announced, we had a really nice award for our very small AUVs, which are Black Hornet from the Norwegian government. And those awards, while they've been made, the shipments are starting to come now. And we expect those awards will lead to more revenue in the future as we move forward from small prototype production or small-scale production to full rate production. So we feel very good about that. But the worst that we've had and some that we're going to get especially in Europe.\nAndrew Buscaglia: And how much of this new activity is solely dependent on the Russia and Ukraine conflict continuing? Or put another way, if that dives down, do you see some of this activity or interest in your product evaporate?\nRobert Mehrabian: No. I think the programs we're participating in they're really just greater budgets in the US and NATO countries. And I don't think that's going to go away in any foreseeable future. As you can judge, the invasion of Ukraine has been a lesson to everybody that you cannot be in a situation where you are liable. And I think those budgets are here to stay. And the NATO alliance is getting tighter and their budgets are going up, US budgets going up in all domains. There are programs in the US that we participate in related to high-performance infrared sensors in space to track missiles. There's - I think that's here to stay.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. And maybe one more, if I may, just because on this topic, you talked a little bit more positively about M&A now that your leverage is at a target. What area is interest to you? Is it going to fall under - are you targeting areas in defense? Or is that more outside of Digital Imaging to broaden your - the balance of your portfolio?\nRobert Mehrabian: I would say in all areas, I would probably exclude strictly government services businesses, type businesses. We've seen things across our segments. So it's not necessarily pure one segment or another. Our emphasis has been Digital Imaging will continue, and we like instruments. But there are certain areas of aerospace and defense like in our connector businesses where our margins are superior to everything else. So we would not exclude that. We won't buy something. We will not participate in something in the government services business, for example.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. Thanks, Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you.\nOperator:  Our next question is from the line of Kristine Liwag, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKristine Liwag: Hi, good morning, everyone.\nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning, Kristine.\nKristine Liwag: You've mentioned to return to M&A now that you've hit your target leverage range. With a sharp increase in interest rates, have you seen asset prices come down to preserve your return thresholds? And also, in terms of timing, there's a lot of economic uncertainty. Do you think now is the time to look at these assets or wait and see how the economic environment unfolds?\nRobert Mehrabian: Great question, Kristine. Let me first go to the first part of the question. I think some of the expectations out there have moderated, and will continue to moderate, especially with the stock market down, S&P is down almost 15%, 16% this year. So expectations are moderating somewhat. Let me go to the second part, which has to do, if we don't do anything, our ratio which is now 2.5 times will continue going down. By year-end, it'll be 2.3 times. If you don't do anything by the end, the next year you'll be 1.7 times and so on and so forth. So we do have, by the way, the liquidity to buy things. Right now, if we look at our liquidity, we can buy things from our line of credit going over $1 billion. Having said that, we've always been very careful not to overstretch ourselves and not to overpay for things. So I think things are getting better. We'll look at some bolt-ons. But if you look at further forward 12 months or so, what happened last time when the markets and the economy declined, same thing is happening now. We come out of this stronger. Some people don't. And that's when we are able to buy them because their market prices have declined. So it's a continuing process. We - right now, if we look at our debt profile, we have almost no exposure to increased interest rates at this time, because 93% of our debt is fixed, the other 7% that's floating. We have cash against that, which is also floating. So we have 100% fixed debt at this time. So - and we have a good line of credit.\nKristine Liwag: Thank you for all the color.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Kristine.\nOperator: And at this time there are no other questions in queue.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, operator. I would now ask Jason to conclude our conference call.\nJason VanWees: Thanks, Robert. And again, thanks everyone for joining us this morning.

            "name": "Robert Mehrabian",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason. Good morning, and thank you for joining our earnings call. In the second quarter sales increased nearly 21% to about $1.36 billion. In addition, our GAAP operating profit, operating margins and earnings per share were all time or second quarter records. Non-GAAP earnings declined slightly but last year's non-GAAP margin and earnings resulted in part from a disproportionate amount of sales relative to costs near the end of the quarter at Teledyne FLIR, as well as lower share count, both due to the mid-quarter closing of the FLIR transaction in May 2021. Including increased foreign currency headwinds, which negatively impacted second quarter sales growth by over 1.7% or approximately $23 million, organic growth was 8.2% and accelerated from the first quarter of 2022. Our short cycle commercial instrumentation and imaging businesses grew strongly in the quarter, and sales from our long cycle Aerospace and Marine businesses also increased. Finally, our US government sales including Teledyne FLIR increased from last year, despite lower defense department outlays in the second quarter of 2022. In summary, year-over-year sales increased in all segments and reported product lines. Overall demand remained strong and we achieved record quarterly orders with a total company book-to-bill of 1.08 times. Orders were particularly strong Teledyne FLIR, where book-to-bill was approximately 1.25. Free cash flow improved from the first quarter, but planned inventory levels remained elevated to counter continuing supply chain risk. Finally, our leverage ratio declined to 2.5 times, and having reached our targeted leverage range, we are again pursuing acquisitions and are pleased to have recently completed our first small bolt-on acquisition of Teledyne FLIR. Turning now to our 2022 outlook, given the recent and significant appreciation of the US dollar, ongoing supply chain constraints and inflation, we believe it's prudent to revise our reported revenue and adjusted earnings outlook modestly for the remainder of the year. Foreign currency translation impacts our three largest segment, and approximately 20% of our total sales with digital imaging and particularly, Teledyne FLIR impacted considerably more than other segments. In addition, supply chain concerns continue to limit shipments. Electronic component and other material shortages negatively impacted second quarter sales by approximately $60 million, and we are assuming that a similar shortfall will continue in the remainder of the year. We have countered both of these headwinds through our various procurement initiatives and strong execution. Nevertheless, we expect total company year-over-year reported organic sales growth of about 4% in each of the third and fourth quarters of 2022, compared with the prior outlook of roughly 5% to 6% resulting in a few - full year estimated sales of about $5.47 billion. Despite these headwinds, we continue to see full year organic sales growth which excludes FLIR of just over 6%, and full year sales from Teledyne FLIR slightly greater than the peak sales in 2020, which included over $125 million from cameras for elevated skin temperature testing. Finally, while foreign currency sales and costs are reasonably balanced at Teledyne, there is no delays and impact on earnings. We also remain a bit cautious regarding cost impact of inflation, therefore, we're modestly revising our full year adjusted earnings outlook by $0.30 at the midpoint, or approximately 1.7% lower than in April. I will now turn the call over to - no sorry, I'm going to continue with our performance of our business segments. In digital imaging, second quarter sales increased 32.9%, largely due to FLIR acquisition, but organic growth in our combined commercial and government imaging businesses was also very strong at 10.3%. Sales growth was strongest for industrial and scientific vision sensors and systems, as well as for our low dose high resolution digital X-ray detectors. GAAP operating margin was 15.2%, but adjusted for intangible asset amortization segment margin was 21.2%. In our Instrumentation segment, overall second quarter sales increased 7.4% versus last year's. Sales of electronic test and measurement systems, which include oscilloscopes, digitizers and protocol analyzers remained strong and increased 11.3% year-over-year. Sales of environmental instruments increased 2.4% compared with last year, with greater sales from certain human health and drug discovery products offset by lower sales of industrial and laboratory gas detection devices. Sales of marine instrumentation increased 9.9% in the quarter due to improved energy  record sales of autonomous underwater vehicles for both defense and commercial oceanography applications. Overall, instrumentation segment operating profit increased 13.9% in the second quarter with operating margin increasing 136 basis points, or 108 basis points excluding intangible asset amortization. In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, second quarter sales increased 10.8% driven by a 3.4% growth in defense, space and industrial sales combined  43.9% increase in sales of commercial aerospace products. GAAP operating margin increased 55.2% with margin 749 basis points . Finally, in the Engineered Systems segment, second quarter revenue increased slightly, but operating profit and margin declined primarily due to lower sales of fixed price electronics systems. Before turning the call over to Sue, I want to make a few concluding remarks. We continue to focus on strong execution in order this to minimize ongoing supply chain risk, inflation and now increased currency headwinds. While the operating environment remains challenging, we're highly confident of our balanced and resilient mix of commercial and government businesses across a broad range of geographies and end market. Furthermore, uncertain times have traditionally created opportunities for Teledyne, for example,  the change in interest rates, we were able to repurchase fixed rate debt issued just last year at a substantial discount. And while relatively small, the cash paid for the first acquisition for Teledyne FLIR was negotiated and paid in euros. Given the strength of our management, operations and balance sheet now, specifically with our leverage ratio at 2.5 times which we expect to be further reduced in the balance of the year, we're able to continue to seek similar and larger acquisitions in the future. And now, I will turn the call over to Sue. Thank you, Sue. We would now like to take your questions. Operator, if you are ready to proceed with the questions-and-answers, please go ahead. Good morning, Greg. Right. It is uncharacteristic, Greg, you're right, and I admit it. There are three things that have happened. Two, we were dealing with fairly successfully, and that would be overall inflation and basically parts shortages. We seem to be rolling $60 million every quarter over and over. So in total, they continue at that level. The one that just hit us very hard was foreign currency. Foreign currency translation basically affects 20% of our business. And the reason it hit digital imaging the hardest, that's where we have most of our foreign currency transactions. You're right and they did well. Instruments did okay. Engineered Systems was down slightly, but Engineered Systems now is only 8% of our portfolio. It's foreign currency that hit us about 1.7% in Q2 or about $23 million, $25 million in revenue. And we expect it to continue in Q3 and Q4. I think that's the fundamental change that we saw. And it was mostly, of course, in digital imaging. And we have not changed our guidance this is the fourth times in 22 years. And it's something we do not do, except the three continuing headwinds that we see. We could handle two, but the third one just is too much at this time. Hopefully, we'll execute better as we move along in the rest of the year. Yes. I think the quick answer is no. Our demand has been very strong. Maybe as a function of time, we may have some demand decline, especially in our discretionary businesses, which are really primarily Raymarine. So there, I think demand was softer. But across the board, the demand has been pretty good. I think we have supply chain challenges there as we have across our businesses. I think what we're looking at is improving our revenue there in the fourth quarter - in the third and fourth quarter better than we have in the first two quarters and mostly in the fourth quarter. So we have the same problems across the board. At FLIR, the unusual situation that we've had to slowly - and we're correcting Edwin Roks, who runs our digital imaging businesses is working very hard on it, is to linearize the sales over the quarters. And that's been hard because FLIR has historically always sold more in the last month and the last week of the quarter than early on, and that causes issues, especially if you have some supply chain issues that can cause you to miss last minute revenue. So we're taking all of that into consideration in what we've put out in our earnings release. Joe, how are you? Yes. Our price increases for the year, we anticipate it to be about 3% of sales. It's a little more in the Q3 and Q4 than it was in Q2. In Q2, it was less than 3%, which has not been really - we're just put in some increases in prices, especially in some of our instrument businesses where we could, and that would be in Q3. So overall, I'd say, Joe, it's about 3%. The flip side is that the cost increases due to inflation and also wages that we have exceeded that, I'm going to say, by 0.5%, 0.6%, and that's causing some issues. But we kind of knew that would happen and we kind of worked on that very hard. The thing that kind of suddenly came out of at us was the change in the exchange rate starting in April, and that was the hard part. Well, let me start with versus April, which would be a good way to go. As I said before, in instruments for the full year, we expect margins to improve about 50 to 55 basis points. In Digital Imaging now, we expect it to be lower by 130 basis points from what - for the full year. In Aerospace and Defense, we have a good run there, primarily because you know commercial aerospace is coming back, and so we expect improvements in margin of 150 basis points. And lastly, as I said, in a smaller segment, which is our Engineered segment, maybe 60 basis points decline. When you add all of that up, it's about 45 basis points decline across the company. That's - I think that's versus April, that's what the summary is. I think you're correct on Aerospace and Defense. It already has full year margins of 25.5%, which is pretty high.

So, as you know, Andrew, we've had a succession of awards recently in the Defense that have been - and we put news releases out on most of them. And most of them by in the FLIR area. We think some of our European awards are a little delayed. As you know, to get, for example, if you were to get things to Ukraine, you have to go through one of the other NATO countries. And some of those are taking time. The flip side is that some of the larger awards that we've had, for example, US Army's family of weapons site for individuals, which are mounted devices that go in rifles, that's a $500 million reward. But we're in the early phase, so we expect that the increased revenue for that will come in future periods rather than immediately. We've had a major award from the Danish Ministry of Defense for mobile sensor systems. And we also had, as we announced, we had a really nice award for our very small AUVs, which are Black Hornet from the Norwegian government. And those awards, while they've been made, the shipments are starting to come now. And we expect those awards will lead to more revenue in the future as we move forward from small prototype production or small-scale production to full rate production. So we feel very good about that. But the worst that we've had and some that we're going to get especially in Europe. No. I think the programs we're participating in they're really just greater budgets in the US and NATO countries. And I don't think that's going to go away in any foreseeable future. As you can judge, the invasion of Ukraine has been a lesson to everybody that you cannot be in a situation where you are liable. And I think those budgets are here to stay. And the NATO alliance is getting tighter and their budgets are going up, US budgets going up in all domains. There are programs in the US that we participate in related to high-performance infrared sensors in space to track missiles. There's - I think that's here to stay. I would say in all areas, I would probably exclude strictly government services businesses, type businesses. We've seen things across our segments. So it's not necessarily pure one segment or another. Our emphasis has been Digital Imaging will continue, and we like instruments. But there are certain areas of aerospace and defense like in our connector businesses where our margins are superior to everything else. So we would not exclude that. We won't buy something. We will not participate in something in the government services business, for example. Thank you. Good morning, Kristine. Great question, Kristine. Let me first go to the first part of the question. I think some of the expectations out there have moderated, and will continue to moderate, especially with the stock market down, S&P is down almost 15%, 16% this year. So expectations are moderating somewhat. Let me go to the second part, which has to do, if we don't do anything, our ratio which is now 2.5 times will continue going down. By year-end, it'll be 2.3 times. If you don't do anything by the end, the next year you'll be 1.7 times and so on and so forth. So we do have, by the way, the liquidity to buy things. Right now, if we look at our liquidity, we can buy things from our line of credit going over $1 billion. Having said that, we've always been very careful not to overstretch ourselves and not to overpay for things. So I think things are getting better. We'll look at some bolt-ons. But if you look at further forward 12 months or so, what happened last time when the markets and the economy declined, same thing is happening now. We come out of this stronger. Some people don't. And that's when we are able to buy them because their market prices have declined. So it's a continuing process. We - right now, if we look at our debt profile, we have almost no exposure to increased interest rates at this time, because 93% of our debt is fixed, the other 7% that's floating. We have cash against that, which is also floating. So we have 100% fixed debt at this time. So - and we have a good line of credit. Thank you, Kristine. Thank you, operator. I would now ask Jason to conclude our conference call."

            "content": "Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert, and then I will discuss our third quarter and full year 2022 outlook. In the second quarter cash flow from operating activities was $196.9 million compared with cash flow of $211.3 million for the same period of 2021. The second quarter of 2022 reflected higher purchases of inventories and higher income tax payments compared with the second quarter of 2021. Free cash flow, that is, cash from operating activities less capital expenditures was $176.1 million in the second quarter of 2022, compared with $190.5 million in 2021, which included $66.7 million of after-tax cash payments related to the FLIR transaction. Capital expenditures were $20.8 million for both second quarter periods. Depreciation and amortization expense was $82.7 million for the second quarter of 2022, compared with $59.7 million in 2021, which reflected the timing of the FLIR acquisition midway through the second quarter of 2021. We ended the quarter with approximately $3.6 billion - $3.67 billion of net debt, that is approximately $3.95 billion of debt less cash of $278.8 million. Stock option compensation expense was $3.6 million for both the second quarter periods. Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the third quarter of 2022 will be in the range of $3.36 to $3.54 per share, with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $4.20 to $4.35. And for the full year 2022, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $15.13 to $15.45, and on a non-GAAP basis $17.45 to $17.70. The 2022 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items is expected to be 23.1%. I'll now pass the call back to Robert."

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's call will be recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our facilitator, Mr. Jason VanWees. Please go ahead, sir.\nJason VanWees: Thank you, Steve. This is Jason VanWees, Vice Chairman of Teledyne, and I'd like to welcome everyone to Teledyne's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Release Conference Call. We released our earnings earlier this morning before the market opened. Joining me today are Teledyne's Chairman, President and CEO, Robert Mehrabian; Senior Vice President and CFO, Sue Main; and Senior Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, Melanie Cibik. Also joining today is Edwin Roks, Executive VP of Teledyne. After remarks by Robert and Sue, we will ask for your questions. Of course, though, before we get started, our attorneys have reminded me to tell you that all forward-looking statements made this morning are subject to various assumptions, risks and caveats, as noted in the earnings release and our periodic SEC filings, and the actual results may differ materially. In order to avoid potential selective disclosures, this call is simultaneously being webcast and a replay, both via webcast and dial-in, will be available for approximately one month. Here is Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone, to our 19th [ph] earnings call since our spin-off in November of 2019, at which point, our stock price was approximately $9 a share. We began today -- we began 2002, we began with the greatest first quarter sales, earnings and adjusted operating margin in our company's history. Our results and operational execution continue to reflect exceptionally well-balanced business portfolio across both end markets and geographies. Demand throughout our short-cycle instrumentation and imaging businesses remain very robust, resulting in total organic sales growth of 7.8%, including approximately 100 basis points of currency translation headwind. We achieved record orders for our electronic test and measurement instrumentation and industrial imaging sensors and systems, even in a typically weak first quarter for these businesses. Sales from our longer-cycle commercial aerospace and marine businesses increased considerably from last year and backlog also grew. Both our GAAP and non-GAAP earnings were first quarter records. GAAP earnings per share was exactly doubled compared with 2021 and non-GAAP earnings increased 34%. I want to emphasize that our non-GAAP earnings exclude only acquired intangible asset amortization. But in the first quarter, it also excluded a large tax benefit related to FLIR foreign tax matters, which only appear in the GAAP results. While free cash flow was lower than last year, it reflected the following guidance: First, bond interest payments of over $36 million made only in the first quarter and again, will be made in the third quarter; second, annual incentive compensation paid only in the first quarter; and third, a significant investment in inventory to derisk revenue in future periods. These items will not be repeated in the second quarter. Nevertheless, our leverage ratio declined to 2.8x from 3.8x immediately after the FLIR transaction in May of 2021. Turning to our 2022 outlook. The overall demand environment across our businesses remain favorable. Even with supply chain constraints and currency translation headwind, we are increasing our expectation for the full year organic growth to approximately 6% from 4% to 5% communicated in January. Coupled with a few full year sales contribution, slightly less than $2 billion from FLIR, this equates to total revenue of just over $5.5 billion for the year, roughly equal to the current consensus. I will now further comment on the performance of our business segments. In our Digital Imaging segment, first quarter sales increased 185%, largely due to FLIR acquisition. But organic growth in our combined commercial and government imaging businesses was also very strong at 13.1%. Sales growth was strongest for industrial vision sensors and systems, as well as our low dose high resolution digital x-ray detectives. GAAP segment operating margin was 15.4, but adjusted for intangible asset amortization, segment margin was 21.9% or about 20 basis point greater than last year. In our Instrumentation segment, overall first quarter sales increased 7.8% versus last year. Sales of electronic test and measurement systems, which include oscilloscopes and protocol analyzers, were very strong and increased 19.1% year-over-year to record levels. Sales in the environmental instruments were flat compared to last year with greater sales from certain human health and drug discovery product offset by lower sales of industrial and laboratory gas detection devices. Sales of marine instrumentation increased 9.7% organically due to improved energy markets, but also record sales of autonomous underwater vehicles for both defense and commercial oceanography applications. Overall, Instrumentation segment, GAAP operating profit increased 20.5% in the first quarter with operating margin increasing 245 basis points or 229 basis points, excluding intangible asset amortization. Moving to our Aerospace and Defense Electronic segment, first quarter sales increased 9.9% driven by modest growth in defense based on industrial sales combined with greater than 50% increase in sales of commercial aerospace products. GAAP segment operating profit increased 51.6% with margin 710 basis points greater than last year. Finally, in our Engineered System segment, first quarter revenue decreased 8.9% and operating profit and margin declined due to lower sales, but especially since we exited the higher margin cruise missile turbine engine business, following the first quarter of last year. Before turning the call over to Sue, I wanted to make a couple of concluding remarks. Effective just this week, FLIR successfully fulfilled the terms of it consent agreement with the U.S. Department of State. Compliance has been always and will always be the critical component of our culture at Teledyne. But Teledyne FLIR has now moved beyond the extra burden and cost of numerous investigations and third-party audits. Finally, regarding our global defense business, which represents approximately 25% of our total sales, over the last six months, defense sales including that of Teledyne FLIR, declined slightly year-over-year and backlog also increased. However, this was more than offset by very strong commercial orders and sales across the company. But now with firmer U.S. and NATO budgets, the outlook for our defense has changed. Creating opportunities for greater defense sales, but also limiting risk for Teledyne is general economic growth decelerates in the future period. While the improvement in the sense may benefit future years the most. We are nevertheless seeing an increase in near-term bookings and opportunities, some of which we expect to benefit the second half of 2022. This is especially true for the Teledyne FLIR business portfolio, where are commercially derived, but military qualified products, they only require a purchase order as opposed to a lengthy appropriations process. I will now turn the call over to Sue.\nSue Main: Thank you, Robert and good morning everyone. I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert, and then I will discuss our second quarter and full year 2022 outlook. In the first quarter, adjusted cash flow from operating activities was $79.7 million compared with cash flow of $124.9 million for the same period of 2021. The adjusted cash flow excludes a onetime payment of $296.4 million to the Swedish tax authority related to a disputed pre-acquisition 2018 tax reassessment issued to a FLIR subsidiary in Sweden.  Adjusted free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $58.7 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared with $110.1 million in 2021. Capital expenditures were $21 million in the first quarter compared to $17.6 million for the same period of 2021. Depreciation and amortization expense was $86.9 million for the first quarter of 2022 compared to $29.3 million in 2021. We ended the quarter with approximately $3.85 billion of net debt. That is approximately $4.13 billion of debt, less cash of $284.3 million. Our stock compensation expense was $4.3 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to $4.2 million for the same period of 2021. Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the second quarter of 2022 will be in the range of $3.44 to $3.55 per share with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $4.32 to $4.40. For the full year 2022, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $15.34 to $15.66 and on a non-GAAP basis, $17.75 to $18. The latter being an increase at the midpoint to our prior outlook of $17.60 to $18 that we provided in January. The 2022 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 23.1%. I'll now pass the call back to Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Sue. And operator, we'd like to take questions. If you're ready to proceed with the questions-and-answers, please go ahead. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Greg Konrad of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nGreg Konrad: Good morning.\nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning, Greg.\nGreg Konrad: This might be a little bit greedy, and I appreciate the conservative nature of forecasting. But it sounded like you took up the organic growth outlook quite a bit with maybe a more minimal change in EPS that you announced this morning for the year. Can you maybe talk about the dynamics there? And then maybe given the comments on the supply chain, maybe some of the offsets to what seems like maybe slightly better volume.\nRobert Mehrabian: I don't know, Greg. What did you call it? Greedy?\nGreg Konrad: Greedy on that part, though.\nRobert Mehrabian: No, frankly, we are a conservative company. Right now, sitting here, we're worried about inflation, which is, as you know, is difficult. Supply chain issues, while we're managing them and have managed them successfully are still uncertain. There is no certainty as when that will change. So having said that, we expect revenue to grow. It was about \u2013 I think in January, I said it was 4.6% organic growth. Now I'm indicating with 6% or maybe a little more. Nevertheless having said that, we have to be conservative, because there's too much uncertainty. There's the supply chain, there's the inflation, there's the war in Europe. There's the shutdowns in China. And this is not the time to be information. This is the time to kind of focus on what we know we can deliver and go from there. So that's my answer to that. I don't know if that helps, Greg, or not?\nGreg Konrad: Yes. That's helpful. And then, I mean, just kind of baselining the outlook with the quarter. When I look at the margin, some of the segments were well ahead of at least our expectations, maybe digital imaging fell a little bit short. Can you maybe just level set us on the outlook for the year for margins by segment and kind of what you're expecting today?\nRobert Mehrabian: Sure. Let's start with digital imaging. For the full year, and I'm going to combine digital imaging together, FLIR and legacy Teledyne. We think for the full year, it will be about 23.3%. That's full year 2022, slightly less than what it was in full year 2021. Now in January, we were a little more present about that. We thought it would be closer to 23.9%. But we think now 23.3% is a better number, primarily because we are experiencing some supply chain issues there, plus we're having to pay higher prices when we do find the components that we need. Moving to the Instrumentation segment. In January, I mentioned that it would be about 22.8%, the margin. We're increasing that note by 50 basis points because of the tailwind that we have in test and measurement, oscilloscopes and protocol, we're increasing that margin now from 23.8% to 24.3%. Moving to Aerospace and Defense, the margin we expect to increase substantially from what we projected in January. In January, we projected a margin of 21.9%, and we expect it to grow almost 190 basis points to 24%. On the flip side, in our Engineered Systems segment, which has revenue of about $400 million, and it's primarily government businesses, we expect margins to end lower than what we expected in January and be at 10.4%. And so you roll all of that up for the segment. Right now, we're expecting the margin for all the segments combined to be 22.7%. And then when you put in corporate expense, et cetera, the total company margin would be 24.5%. I hope that helps, Greg.\nGreg Konrad: That's helpful. And I'm just going to sneak in one last one. I mean, you mentioned defense and kind of the increased opportunities. And I think at one point, people are worried about defense maybe bringing down the overall growth rate of Teledyne. Is there any way to maybe quantify what you're seeing in terms of maybe what you thought of as kind of the long-term defense growth rate prior and then post some of the budget tailwinds in NATO kind of what you're thinking at going forward today?\nRobert Mehrabian: Okay. Let me start with Q1. Overall, we saw some decreased in defense across our portfolio from Q1 of last year, about 2.5%. And most of that experience came in Teledyne FLIR. Now having said that, the longer term, we think our defense sales should decrease in the mid-single digits, which is if you take a negative 2.5% and go to, let's say, 5% or so, that 7.5% turnaround that would be though at the end of 2022 or likely 2022 and 2024. And the reason I say that is, while we've kind of chewed away on our defense backlog, we're not seeing significant opportunities, both in Europe as well as across the board in FMS sales. And I can give you examples of that. But we're seeing real demand for products that we have, especially in the FLIR businesses, Teledyne FLIR businesses. Some of them directly a result of the Ukraine conflict and some of them are, of course, because of the increased budgets that are coming in the nature alike.\nGreg Konrad: Thank you.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Greg.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Jim Ricchiuti of Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nJim Ricchiuti: Hi, thank you. Good morning. Robert, just in light of the comments you just made, I'm wondering, are you \u2013 is Teledyne thinking differently about longer-term inorganic opportunities in defense over the years, you guys have focused mainly on building up the commercial portfolio, and you've done that quite well. But I'm just wondering, as you think about the business, are you has anything changed in the way you're thinking about M&A going forward?\nRobert Mehrabian: Okay. Jim, good morning to you. First, let me back up and say, the way we look at defense, which is now about with FLIR included, Teledyne FLIR, it's about 25% of our portfolio. The way we like to think about that part of our portfolio is kind of like a shock absorber. When commercial businesses go up and down, especially if they go down and you have serious inflation and other things become very negative, it acts like a shock absorber. But having said that, you also have to look at what's happening across the world. And the way we see it is that the conflicts have caused significant change in demand for products, especially our products from our perspective. And we think we should be ready, which we are to enjoy the fruits of that. Having said that, I am not really that convinced, that we should change the balance of our portfolio towards defense. And I say that \u2013 with an M&A. And I say that because that I don't really think it's very prudent for a company like Teledyne to change strategy because of something that has happened or is happening. And I think our primary growth engine has always been our commercial businesses, and we have more opportunities there. So I think in M&A, we'll probably focus on commercial businesses. Having said that, we bought FLIR, and FLIR had a substantial defense business. And we observed it, but defense is good. It's got a predictable backlog, but it's not really \u2013 it doesn't have the kind of margins you can enjoy in the commercial domain.\nJim Ricchiuti: Got it. Thank you for that. And also, I appreciate the color on the segments in terms of the way you're viewing the operating margins for the year. I wonder if you could turn for a moment to gross margins, which were quite strong in Q1. And I'm wondering if you could elaborate on what some of the biggest factors were in that and maybe how we should be thinking about gross margins going forward. I know there's some puts and takes, obviously, some of the cost pressures, but mix also. But is there any color you could provide on the strength there?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. Jim, you're obviously very familiar with Teledyne. If you look at our Q1 gross margins last year, it was about 38.9% for the legacy Teledyne. We didn't have FLIR at the time. FLIR, on the other hand, Teledyne FLIR, enjoys higher gross margins than us about 55% or did historically or 50%, I'm sorry. So when you combine those two together, the combined company gross margin in the first quarter moved from 38.9% to 43%. Having said that, we also enjoyed higher margins in our test and measurement businesses because they grew significantly 19.2%, that's in our Instruments group. And our Aerospace and Defense margins moved up huge because of the about 50% increase in our commercial aerospace business. So we enjoyed two tailwinds: one, buying a business, which is now a significant part of our portfolio that had higher gross margins than our legacy businesses. And then turnaround that we experienced in our commercial aerospace business and then really good record or there's a revenue in our Test and Measurement businesses.\nJim Ricchiuti: In commercial air, presumably, you see that recovery continuing. It looks like from \u2013 at least from what we're hearing from hearing elsewhere. Is that fair to say?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes, I would say, so we do have some concern going forward only because the comps are going to be a little tougher in Q3, Q4. Last year, when the first quarter, we were in a trough, as you remember what we're encouraged. We do a lot of both OEM products for commercial aircraft. But we also do a lot of aftermarket products. So we're encouraged. Let me put it that.\nJim Ricchiuti: Okay, thanks. I\u2019ll jump back in the queue.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thanks, Jim.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Joe Giordano of Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJoe Giordano: Hey, good morning guys.\nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe Giordano: So, I just wanted to start with the growth rate in the FLIR defense portfolio for the quarter. I know that was down. So FLIR overall was down year-on-year. Just how was that \u2013 how did that 1Q play out relative to what you were thinking internally three months ago? And has your overall like mid-single-digit growth for the FLIR portfolio this year changed? And maybe you can \u2013 if you want to loop that in with like your updated views on organic growth by segment, that\u2019s probably helpful too.\nRobert Mehrabian: Sure. As you well know, Joe, FLIR, as you\u2019ve mentioned, the defense business is in FLIR, they declined year-over-year. If you went to the historical defense business. They declined about 10.9% year-over-year, but that\u2019s also consistent with our own Engineered Systems segment that declined about 9% year-over-year. Some of the primes that we were listening to this week, their businesses declined about 8%. Having said that, we think in Q2, the FLIR defense and our overall defense should be relatively flat and a pickup in the third and fourth quarters. I\u2019m going to say, plus 5%. And the reason I say that is because the overall market that we\u2019re seeing and the opportunities that we\u2019re seeing in the defense businesses are positive. Both in Europe, as well as in this country. So, when you look at it that way, yes, we did have a decline in Q1, but we had a decline in our existing defense business with specially Engineered Systems which also will recover as the year goes forward. In the year, overall, now you\u2019ve got to look at the other side of FLIR, which is their commercial businesses. The commercial businesses did reasonably well in the first quarter. They went up about 2.3% compared to last year. And last year, they had a little bit, not much, but they had a little bit of sales in elevated skin temperature products. So in total, I think we expect for the year, the revenue year-over-year to go up for the overall FLIR business, Teledyne FLIR, I should say, to about \u2013 from what was last year, $1.895 billion, if you rolled it all in historical as well as after the acquisition, to about 1.97% [ph], which would be the highest over the last two years. That will be a combination of defense and commercial. I hope that answers the question, Joe?\nJoe Giordano: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. I was just curious like your point on this is not the time to be effervescent and full year outlook because of what\u2019s going on in supply chain and what\u2019s going on with inflation. I think that\u2019s totally fair. If you look at your portfolio, like what\u2019s the most concerning part? Like which do you think is the least protected of all your businesses, if something which happen negative globally?\nRobert Mehrabian: I don\u2019t want eventually I guess, because I don\u2019t know. But let me say this. We have intentionally balanced our portfolio for just these kinds of times. When times get uncertain, various parts of our portfolio absorb the shock from the market and from the economies. That\u2019s why if you look at our history, when things \u2013 bad things happen, right afterwards, some other companies may not deal with it as well. Right after it works, we buy someone that has not done as well. So, I would say that I feel comfortable with our portfolio. We\u2019re guiding the Street on what we think we can deliver. And we don\u2019t want to be too as the world effervescent. On the other hand, if bad things continue happening as they are now might be a good opportunity for us coming out of this with a significant M&A. We don\u2019t see a warning sign at this time, Joe.\nJoe Giordano: Okay. And if I could just one last quick one. The test and measurement growth is really strong again. How sustainable is that at that level? Do we start moderating on the rates and kind of stay on a gross dollar basis at similar levels? How do you think about that business?\nRobert Mehrabian: Well, again, going with our team, I\u2019m going to say net GAAP earnings, gap of growth, net growth for the year should be about 4.5%, 5%, even though we had such a good first quarter. We\u2019re seeing better orders, by the way, even the last three weeks. But that\u2019s an area that we sell a significant amount of products in China. And nobody knows what\u2019s going to happen with the lockdowns there. And it\u2019s a short-cycle business and the comps are going to be tougher as we move forward because we did pretty well the last three quarters of last year. So, I would say, we\u2019ve increased our outlook from January a little bit from, let\u2019s say, 4% to 4.5%. We stay with that for now to see how things evolve as time goes on.\nJoe Giordano: Thanks guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia of Berenberg. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Hey good morning guys.\nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Buscaglia: So, I was hoping you could maybe add a little bit more commentary, specifically, you obviously sound more positive on defense and government business, specifically with FLIR, too. And FLIR has always kind of talked about these big longer-term programs of record they were after and very positive on their Unmanned Systems business, which was small, but \u2013 it\u2019s definitely an area they saw a big source of growth. Are the \u2013 when you make those comments, are you referencing those things like that? Or is there any other color you can give specifically into what kind of the nature of these awards are or potential opportunities you said?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. Let me first comment on the long-term legacy systems and programs of record. Some of that has happened, will happen. Some of it, I\u2019m not so sure, because I don\u2019t look through the same lens as the previous management did. Having said that, there are significant opportunities in Soldier Borne Sensor systems. And when you mentioned the unmanned systems, there\u2019s a range of as you well know, if you move to the air, there is, of course, the Black Hornet. Black Hornet 3, which is 5 inches in size, very silent, and go about a mile, come back performing GPS-denied environment. We\u2019re seeing real interest in that, and that\u2019s doing very well. On the flip side, on the grant systems, our PackBots are doing really well. Actually, some of them, we saw some videos are being used in Ukraine, by the Ukrainan forces that we trained before the war. In the [indiscernible] that we have, they\u2019re used and they\u2019re doing very well. Some of them actually are were on the new Ukraine\u2019s new helicopters in Kiev. Our IR sensors going to various drone manufacturers. And we\u2019re seeing a lot of demand across all of our unmanned systems for not just drones, but also for the sensors that go on top of those. We also have, in the longer term, as you said, programs. We also have an interesting opportunity, which has to do with a larger drone. That\u2019s a little bit like what is known as the Switchblade. That drone would be, if we can achieve a program of record, coming to the words you said. If we can achieve program of record for that drone, that would be a real winner. It\u2019s in the final stages of prototyping, we should be able to get some revenue by the end of the year. It has really strong capability. It\u2019s a vertical takeoff and landing drone. It has opportunities to carry munitions. It\u2019s recoverable. That is if you wave off an assignment, you can wave it within the last two seconds and bring it back. It\u2019s got 30-minute flight time and you kind of go out 20 kilometers. So, when I think about something like that, that\u2019s akin to an opportunity that we can enjoy when we get that certified and flying. Having said all of that, I think it\u2019s important to recognize that getting into programs of record is not that easy. And what we like to focus on is get what you can now sell what you can now and then plan for in the future over the long term, but don\u2019t hedge all of your eggs in that basket. I don\u2019t know whether that helps or not.\nAndrew Buscaglia: No, very helpful. No, sounds encouraging. And maybe you could comment, too, the other news this quarter is the consent agreement is going away. Can you just remind us the impact of that? It sounds like I forget if that is included in your kind of annual synergy estimate and where we stand with synergies from FLIR at this point?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. That the total cost of that for FLIR and then Teledyne was at the order of $80-some million. It started in 2018. And we successfully ended it this quarter. We had some expenses in Q1. We also had to pay $3.5 million, the government that we obligated to pay. We\u2019ve built that into the synergies for going forward already. But part of the reason that we\u2019re able to have the synergies that we enjoyed with Teledyne FLIR is that when we bought them, we said, look, we expected to have accretion in the first year. And we thought that at the time the accretion would be somewhere between $40 million to $80 million this year. So, when I see it right now, I would guess, $80 million would be the low end, and it would be closer to $100 million in synergies. And that kind of absorbs some of the opportunities that we see now that the consent decrease behind us.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. Got it.\nRobert Mehrabian: Okay.\nAndrew Buscaglia: All right. Thank you.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you. Thank you, Andrew.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Kristine Liwag of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKristine Liwag: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning, Kristine.\nKristine Liwag: Looking at the supply chain constraints, last quarter, you had mentioned that alternative sourcing has thus far proven successful in about 60% to 70% of cases. Are these trends holding steady, improving or worsening? And also what other initiatives can you implement to manage the risk?\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Kristine. That's a very good question. Let me start with the effect, the net effect. We think in the first quarter of this year, the one just behind us the effect of shortages affected us by about $74 million. We think going forward, that's not going to be changing all that much. Having said that we also were able to buy components, find components or redesign our products that let us sell over a $100 million of products that we couldn't have, if we had not enjoyed that. We have a very robust activity dealing with shortages in our procurement led by Paul DeLaRosa and 30 of our business units. So they do three things. First, they identify who has the shortages and what are the common suppliers for those shortages. And we then deal directly as a company with that supplier and prioritize what we can buy from them. So we may have shortages in various businesses, but one may not affect our revenue as much as the other. So we \u2013 that help us focus on the high priority ones. Second, we source from third parties, especially, we have our own people in the [indiscernible] plus we have some of our suppliers, primary suppliers for our semiconductor requirements that are looking for part. So if we're missing like 700 parts today, we may have already found maybe 450 parts that we can enjoy. But we have to of course bring them in and qualify them. We're not just going to take them and put them into our product. We have to qualify them, like we do everything else. And then we also, lastly, look at redesign that is, can we redesign not just a specific part, but can we redesign the product? I'd say the camera that we are selling to avoid the part that has significant shortage, especially if we see forward \u2013 looking forward. So long answer to your question is the following. One, yes, we're going to have some revenue shortfall because of that. But it's not going to be killing us. It's going be in the same level that we had. And part of it is alleviated, because we've also put in some inventory. That's one of the reasons that we talked about our cash. We've increased our inventory in setting on our shelves, our products, and also materials that we have either bought long term or products that once we get the part, we can get it out the door. There's a whole combination of these things that's kind of so far has helped us avoid significant effects on the company as a whole. I hope Kristine that answers your question.\nKristine Liwag: Yes, Robert, that was really helpful. And then if I could do a follow on, is the supply chain issue that you're seeing for legacy Teledyne the same as what you're seeing for FLIR or is there a difference between the two?\nRobert Mehrabian: Not much difference, Kristine. I think, there is digital imaging as an example, which is now 60% of our business. It's the same, because we make very similar products different end markets, similar product complexity, et cetera. So I would say it's the same. There's some exceptions here and there by and large, though that is the same.\nKristine Liwag: Great, thank you very much, Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian: Of course, Kristine.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNoah Poponak: Hi, good morning, everyone.\nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning, Noah.\nNoah Poponak: Robert, can you quantify how much inventory you added in that buffer stock process?\nRobert Mehrabian: I must say about 55 million. I hate to admit it, but it hurts me.\nNoah Poponak: Well, it seems sensible with what's happening at the moment. And it sounds like you're saying you don't expect that to alleviate anytime soon. So you'll just hold that, hold the inventory balance at that level as opposed to burning that down through the year that extra piece.\nRobert Mehrabian: We're going to burn down, Noah.\nNoah Poponak: Okay.\nRobert Mehrabian: It's either that or my clothes, but we're going to burn it down.\nNoah Poponak: I mean, if you're not expecting supply chain to improve, won't you need to hold buffer stock?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. We'll hold some, of course, we will Noah. But here's the thing. I think the combination of the things that I just mentioned, is making us feel a little more comfortable. The other thing is some of our businesses have been a little too conservative. We had a plan to reduce our inventory this year by a similar amount. So now it's gone up that much. So if we can bring it back that we still have ample inventory. We just have to move it around so that the measurement is such that it doesn't really hurt our cash flow. We have, for example \u2013 the problem we have, for example, with wafers. That's something that \u2013 that's long term, and we got to buy it. We buy 30,000 wafers in digital imaging. And we've got to buy it and we've got to keep it because that's one that you cannot buy in the market, whether it's East Asia or whether it's here, you can't buy that. So that one, we do. But there are other things that we can get rid of this year.\nNoah Poponak: Okay. Are you still expecting total company bottom line, full year free cash to net income conversion over 100%?\nRobert Mehrabian: Very close. Very close. At least, that's what I told the Board yesterday.\nNoah Poponak: Okay. On the cost input inflation piece, what is the rate of increase that you're seeing at the moment?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. That's a good question. There is \u2013 there's two parts to that. One of them is materials. And the other one is wages. On the material side, with everything that's going on in the world, our costs are increasing at this time, about 3.5% of our gross \u2013 cost of our goods. And frankly, we look at that from both the business side and also look at it from the corporate side. Wage inflation is a little less, maybe 3.25%. So \u2013 when you roll that up all together, we're seeing about cost increases of 3%, let's say. The flip side is we also are increasing prices ourselves, where we can, not in every program. We're pretty much offsetting that with price increases. So net-net, so far, being very careful and prudent in what we do. We've managed to negate those two when we'll have to work very hard to keep doing that.\nNoah Poponak: Are you raising price at a rate equal to or slightly greater than the cost inflation? Or are you actually maintaining the price cost gap that you previously had?\nRobert Mehrabian: I think we're \u2013 I would say we're maintaining.\nNoah Poponak: So you already had pricing and you're accelerating the pricing to maintain the price cost gap?\nRobert Mehrabian: That's it.\nNoah Poponak: Okay. And then last thing I wanted to ask is you've discussed the \u2013 a new opportunity set evolving on the national security front. As the combined business now, what percentage of your defense or government related to national security revenues are domestic versus international?\nRobert Mehrabian: Let me think, for example. I think about overall were 25%. I would say, about just under 20%, 19% is U.S. and DoD. And I'd say about 5% to 6% is foreign at this time.\nNoah Poponak: Got it. Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Noah.\nOperator: Our next question is a follow-up from the line of John \u2013 excuse me, Jim Ricchiuti of Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nJim Ricchiuti: Yes, I may have missed it, but Robert, I was wondering if you provided any information on book-to-bill, either for the company or for the segments if there was much variability in the book-to-bills that you saw in the different segments?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. No, that's a good question, Jim. Let me start with the total company, if I may. Book-to-bill is pretty healthy. It's 1.09%. We have really good backlog, by the way, the highest backlog that I remember, we have about $2.95 billion of backlog. And we backlog, we define very carefully. It's kind of money that we already know is going to come in. So our book-to-bill of 1.09% is pretty healthy, but it's variable across the company. Let's start with the Digital Imaging. Digital Imaging is a little less than the whole company, it's about 1.04%, but still healthy. In instruments, it's close to the company total. It's at 1.08% with marine being a little higher than environmental marine being at 1.13%. And test and measurement being at 1.07%. Environmental at 1.04%. So the total instrumentation is same as the company at 1.08%. Aerospace and defense electronics, as I mentioned, because of the commercial aerospace comeback, we have a 1.13 book to bill and an engineer systems where our revenue went done for the reasons I mentioned, partly because we are not going to \u2013 we got out of the turbine engine business after the first quarter of last year, plus we've been eating into our backlog. We have some really nice additions. Our book to bill is 1.38, but I'm always cautious on that one because that's a long-term program lumpy program wins. So overall 1.09, that's pretty good for us in this environment.\nJim Ricchiuti: Got it. That's helpful.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you.\nJim Ricchiuti: Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions in queue at this time.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you very much operator. I'll now ask Jason to conclude our conference call please.\nJason VanWees: Thanks Robert. And again, thanks everyone for joining us this morning.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert Mehrabian",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone, to our 19th [ph] earnings call since our spin-off in November of 2019, at which point, our stock price was approximately $9 a share. We began today -- we began 2002, we began with the greatest first quarter sales, earnings and adjusted operating margin in our company's history. Our results and operational execution continue to reflect exceptionally well-balanced business portfolio across both end markets and geographies. Demand throughout our short-cycle instrumentation and imaging businesses remain very robust, resulting in total organic sales growth of 7.8%, including approximately 100 basis points of currency translation headwind. We achieved record orders for our electronic test and measurement instrumentation and industrial imaging sensors and systems, even in a typically weak first quarter for these businesses. Sales from our longer-cycle commercial aerospace and marine businesses increased considerably from last year and backlog also grew. Both our GAAP and non-GAAP earnings were first quarter records. GAAP earnings per share was exactly doubled compared with 2021 and non-GAAP earnings increased 34%. I want to emphasize that our non-GAAP earnings exclude only acquired intangible asset amortization. But in the first quarter, it also excluded a large tax benefit related to FLIR foreign tax matters, which only appear in the GAAP results. While free cash flow was lower than last year, it reflected the following guidance: First, bond interest payments of over $36 million made only in the first quarter and again, will be made in the third quarter; second, annual incentive compensation paid only in the first quarter; and third, a significant investment in inventory to derisk revenue in future periods. These items will not be repeated in the second quarter. Nevertheless, our leverage ratio declined to 2.8x from 3.8x immediately after the FLIR transaction in May of 2021. Turning to our 2022 outlook. The overall demand environment across our businesses remain favorable. Even with supply chain constraints and currency translation headwind, we are increasing our expectation for the full year organic growth to approximately 6% from 4% to 5% communicated in January. Coupled with a few full year sales contribution, slightly less than $2 billion from FLIR, this equates to total revenue of just over $5.5 billion for the year, roughly equal to the current consensus. I will now further comment on the performance of our business segments. In our Digital Imaging segment, first quarter sales increased 185%, largely due to FLIR acquisition. But organic growth in our combined commercial and government imaging businesses was also very strong at 13.1%. Sales growth was strongest for industrial vision sensors and systems, as well as our low dose high resolution digital x-ray detectives. GAAP segment operating margin was 15.4, but adjusted for intangible asset amortization, segment margin was 21.9% or about 20 basis point greater than last year. In our Instrumentation segment, overall first quarter sales increased 7.8% versus last year. Sales of electronic test and measurement systems, which include oscilloscopes and protocol analyzers, were very strong and increased 19.1% year-over-year to record levels. Sales in the environmental instruments were flat compared to last year with greater sales from certain human health and drug discovery product offset by lower sales of industrial and laboratory gas detection devices. Sales of marine instrumentation increased 9.7% organically due to improved energy markets, but also record sales of autonomous underwater vehicles for both defense and commercial oceanography applications. Overall, Instrumentation segment, GAAP operating profit increased 20.5% in the first quarter with operating margin increasing 245 basis points or 229 basis points, excluding intangible asset amortization. Moving to our Aerospace and Defense Electronic segment, first quarter sales increased 9.9% driven by modest growth in defense based on industrial sales combined with greater than 50% increase in sales of commercial aerospace products. GAAP segment operating profit increased 51.6% with margin 710 basis points greater than last year. Finally, in our Engineered System segment, first quarter revenue decreased 8.9% and operating profit and margin declined due to lower sales, but especially since we exited the higher margin cruise missile turbine engine business, following the first quarter of last year. Before turning the call over to Sue, I wanted to make a couple of concluding remarks. Effective just this week, FLIR successfully fulfilled the terms of it consent agreement with the U.S. Department of State. Compliance has been always and will always be the critical component of our culture at Teledyne. But Teledyne FLIR has now moved beyond the extra burden and cost of numerous investigations and third-party audits. Finally, regarding our global defense business, which represents approximately 25% of our total sales, over the last six months, defense sales including that of Teledyne FLIR, declined slightly year-over-year and backlog also increased. However, this was more than offset by very strong commercial orders and sales across the company. But now with firmer U.S. and NATO budgets, the outlook for our defense has changed. Creating opportunities for greater defense sales, but also limiting risk for Teledyne is general economic growth decelerates in the future period. While the improvement in the sense may benefit future years the most. We are nevertheless seeing an increase in near-term bookings and opportunities, some of which we expect to benefit the second half of 2022. This is especially true for the Teledyne FLIR business portfolio, where are commercially derived, but military qualified products, they only require a purchase order as opposed to a lengthy appropriations process. I will now turn the call over to Sue. Thank you, Sue. And operator, we'd like to take questions. If you're ready to proceed with the questions-and-answers, please go ahead. Good morning, Greg. I don't know, Greg. What did you call it? Greedy? No, frankly, we are a conservative company. Right now, sitting here, we're worried about inflation, which is, as you know, is difficult. Supply chain issues, while we're managing them and have managed them successfully are still uncertain. There is no certainty as when that will change. So having said that, we expect revenue to grow. It was about \u2013 I think in January, I said it was 4.6% organic growth. Now I'm indicating with 6% or maybe a little more. Nevertheless having said that, we have to be conservative, because there's too much uncertainty. There's the supply chain, there's the inflation, there's the war in Europe. There's the shutdowns in China. And this is not the time to be information. This is the time to kind of focus on what we know we can deliver and go from there. So that's my answer to that. I don't know if that helps, Greg, or not? Sure. Let's start with digital imaging. For the full year, and I'm going to combine digital imaging together, FLIR and legacy Teledyne. We think for the full year, it will be about 23.3%. That's full year 2022, slightly less than what it was in full year 2021. Now in January, we were a little more present about that. We thought it would be closer to 23.9%. But we think now 23.3% is a better number, primarily because we are experiencing some supply chain issues there, plus we're having to pay higher prices when we do find the components that we need. Moving to the Instrumentation segment. In January, I mentioned that it would be about 22.8%, the margin. We're increasing that note by 50 basis points because of the tailwind that we have in test and measurement, oscilloscopes and protocol, we're increasing that margin now from 23.8% to 24.3%. Moving to Aerospace and Defense, the margin we expect to increase substantially from what we projected in January. In January, we projected a margin of 21.9%, and we expect it to grow almost 190 basis points to 24%. On the flip side, in our Engineered Systems segment, which has revenue of about $400 million, and it's primarily government businesses, we expect margins to end lower than what we expected in January and be at 10.4%. And so you roll all of that up for the segment. Right now, we're expecting the margin for all the segments combined to be 22.7%. And then when you put in corporate expense, et cetera, the total company margin would be 24.5%. I hope that helps, Greg. Okay. Let me start with Q1. Overall, we saw some decreased in defense across our portfolio from Q1 of last year, about 2.5%. And most of that experience came in Teledyne FLIR. Now having said that, the longer term, we think our defense sales should decrease in the mid-single digits, which is if you take a negative 2.5% and go to, let's say, 5% or so, that 7.5% turnaround that would be though at the end of 2022 or likely 2022 and 2024. And the reason I say that is, while we've kind of chewed away on our defense backlog, we're not seeing significant opportunities, both in Europe as well as across the board in FMS sales. And I can give you examples of that. But we're seeing real demand for products that we have, especially in the FLIR businesses, Teledyne FLIR businesses. Some of them directly a result of the Ukraine conflict and some of them are, of course, because of the increased budgets that are coming in the nature alike. Thank you, Greg. Okay. Jim, good morning to you. First, let me back up and say, the way we look at defense, which is now about with FLIR included, Teledyne FLIR, it's about 25% of our portfolio. The way we like to think about that part of our portfolio is kind of like a shock absorber. When commercial businesses go up and down, especially if they go down and you have serious inflation and other things become very negative, it acts like a shock absorber. But having said that, you also have to look at what's happening across the world. And the way we see it is that the conflicts have caused significant change in demand for products, especially our products from our perspective. And we think we should be ready, which we are to enjoy the fruits of that. Having said that, I am not really that convinced, that we should change the balance of our portfolio towards defense. And I say that \u2013 with an M&A. And I say that because that I don't really think it's very prudent for a company like Teledyne to change strategy because of something that has happened or is happening. And I think our primary growth engine has always been our commercial businesses, and we have more opportunities there. So I think in M&A, we'll probably focus on commercial businesses. Having said that, we bought FLIR, and FLIR had a substantial defense business. And we observed it, but defense is good. It's got a predictable backlog, but it's not really \u2013 it doesn't have the kind of margins you can enjoy in the commercial domain. Yes. Jim, you're obviously very familiar with Teledyne. If you look at our Q1 gross margins last year, it was about 38.9% for the legacy Teledyne. We didn't have FLIR at the time. FLIR, on the other hand, Teledyne FLIR, enjoys higher gross margins than us about 55% or did historically or 50%, I'm sorry. So when you combine those two together, the combined company gross margin in the first quarter moved from 38.9% to 43%. Having said that, we also enjoyed higher margins in our test and measurement businesses because they grew significantly 19.2%, that's in our Instruments group. And our Aerospace and Defense margins moved up huge because of the about 50% increase in our commercial aerospace business. So we enjoyed two tailwinds: one, buying a business, which is now a significant part of our portfolio that had higher gross margins than our legacy businesses. And then turnaround that we experienced in our commercial aerospace business and then really good record or there's a revenue in our Test and Measurement businesses. Yes, I would say, so we do have some concern going forward only because the comps are going to be a little tougher in Q3, Q4. Last year, when the first quarter, we were in a trough, as you remember what we're encouraged. We do a lot of both OEM products for commercial aircraft. But we also do a lot of aftermarket products. So we're encouraged. Let me put it that. Thanks, Jim. Good morning, Joe. Sure. As you well know, Joe, FLIR, as you've mentioned, the defense business is in FLIR, they declined year-over-year. If you went to the historical defense business. They declined about 10.9% year-over-year, but that's also consistent with our own Engineered Systems segment that declined about 9% year-over-year. Some of the primes that we were listening to this week, their businesses declined about 8%. Having said that, we think in Q2, the FLIR defense and our overall defense should be relatively flat and a pickup in the third and fourth quarters. I'm going to say, plus 5%. And the reason I say that is because the overall market that we're seeing and the opportunities that we're seeing in the defense businesses are positive. Both in Europe, as well as in this country. So, when you look at it that way, yes, we did have a decline in Q1, but we had a decline in our existing defense business with specially Engineered Systems which also will recover as the year goes forward. In the year, overall, now you've got to look at the other side of FLIR, which is their commercial businesses. The commercial businesses did reasonably well in the first quarter. They went up about 2.3% compared to last year. And last year, they had a little bit, not much, but they had a little bit of sales in elevated skin temperature products. So in total, I think we expect for the year, the revenue year-over-year to go up for the overall FLIR business, Teledyne FLIR, I should say, to about \u2013 from what was last year, $1.895 billion, if you rolled it all in historical as well as after the acquisition, to about 1.97% [ph], which would be the highest over the last two years. That will be a combination of defense and commercial. I hope that answers the question, Joe? I don't want eventually I guess, because I don't know. But let me say this. We have intentionally balanced our portfolio for just these kinds of times. When times get uncertain, various parts of our portfolio absorb the shock from the market and from the economies. That's why if you look at our history, when things \u2013 bad things happen, right afterwards, some other companies may not deal with it as well. Right after it works, we buy someone that has not done as well. So, I would say that I feel comfortable with our portfolio. We're guiding the Street on what we think we can deliver. And we don't want to be too as the world effervescent. On the other hand, if bad things continue happening as they are now might be a good opportunity for us coming out of this with a significant M&A. We don't see a warning sign at this time, Joe. Well, again, going with our team, I'm going to say net GAAP earnings, gap of growth, net growth for the year should be about 4.5%, 5%, even though we had such a good first quarter. We're seeing better orders, by the way, even the last three weeks. But that's an area that we sell a significant amount of products in China. And nobody knows what's going to happen with the lockdowns there. And it's a short-cycle business and the comps are going to be tougher as we move forward because we did pretty well the last three quarters of last year. So, I would say, we've increased our outlook from January a little bit from, let's say, 4% to 4.5%. We stay with that for now to see how things evolve as time goes on. Good morning, Andrew. Yes. Let me first comment on the long-term legacy systems and programs of record. Some of that has happened, will happen. Some of it, I'm not so sure, because I don't look through the same lens as the previous management did. Having said that, there are significant opportunities in Soldier Borne Sensor systems. And when you mentioned the unmanned systems, there's a range of as you well know, if you move to the air, there is, of course, the Black Hornet. Black Hornet 3, which is 5 inches in size, very silent, and go about a mile, come back performing GPS-denied environment. We're seeing real interest in that, and that's doing very well. On the flip side, on the grant systems, our PackBots are doing really well. Actually, some of them, we saw some videos are being used in Ukraine, by the Ukrainan forces that we trained before the war. In the [indiscernible] that we have, they're used and they're doing very well. Some of them actually are were on the new Ukraine's new helicopters in Kiev. Our IR sensors going to various drone manufacturers. And we're seeing a lot of demand across all of our unmanned systems for not just drones, but also for the sensors that go on top of those. We also have, in the longer term, as you said, programs. We also have an interesting opportunity, which has to do with a larger drone. That's a little bit like what is known as the Switchblade. That drone would be, if we can achieve a program of record, coming to the words you said. If we can achieve program of record for that drone, that would be a real winner. It's in the final stages of prototyping, we should be able to get some revenue by the end of the year. It has really strong capability. It's a vertical takeoff and landing drone. It has opportunities to carry munitions. It's recoverable. That is if you wave off an assignment, you can wave it within the last two seconds and bring it back. It's got 30-minute flight time and you kind of go out 20 kilometers. So, when I think about something like that, that's akin to an opportunity that we can enjoy when we get that certified and flying. Having said all of that, I think it's important to recognize that getting into programs of record is not that easy. And what we like to focus on is get what you can now sell what you can now and then plan for in the future over the long term, but don't hedge all of your eggs in that basket. I don't know whether that helps or not. Yes. That the total cost of that for FLIR and then Teledyne was at the order of $80-some million. It started in 2018. And we successfully ended it this quarter. We had some expenses in Q1. We also had to pay $3.5 million, the government that we obligated to pay. We've built that into the synergies for going forward already. But part of the reason that we're able to have the synergies that we enjoyed with Teledyne FLIR is that when we bought them, we said, look, we expected to have accretion in the first year. And we thought that at the time the accretion would be somewhere between $40 million to $80 million this year. So, when I see it right now, I would guess, $80 million would be the low end, and it would be closer to $100 million in synergies. And that kind of absorbs some of the opportunities that we see now that the consent decrease behind us. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, Kristine. Thank you, Kristine. That's a very good question. Let me start with the effect, the net effect. We think in the first quarter of this year, the one just behind us the effect of shortages affected us by about $74 million. We think going forward, that's not going to be changing all that much. Having said that we also were able to buy components, find components or redesign our products that let us sell over a $100 million of products that we couldn't have, if we had not enjoyed that. We have a very robust activity dealing with shortages in our procurement led by Paul DeLaRosa and 30 of our business units. So they do three things. First, they identify who has the shortages and what are the common suppliers for those shortages. And we then deal directly as a company with that supplier and prioritize what we can buy from them. So we may have shortages in various businesses, but one may not affect our revenue as much as the other. So we \u2013 that help us focus on the high priority ones. Second, we source from third parties, especially, we have our own people in the [indiscernible] plus we have some of our suppliers, primary suppliers for our semiconductor requirements that are looking for part. So if we're missing like 700 parts today, we may have already found maybe 450 parts that we can enjoy. But we have to of course bring them in and qualify them. We're not just going to take them and put them into our product. We have to qualify them, like we do everything else. And then we also, lastly, look at redesign that is, can we redesign not just a specific part, but can we redesign the product? I'd say the camera that we are selling to avoid the part that has significant shortage, especially if we see forward \u2013 looking forward. So long answer to your question is the following. One, yes, we're going to have some revenue shortfall because of that. But it's not going to be killing us. It's going be in the same level that we had. And part of it is alleviated, because we've also put in some inventory. That's one of the reasons that we talked about our cash. We've increased our inventory in setting on our shelves, our products, and also materials that we have either bought long term or products that once we get the part, we can get it out the door. There's a whole combination of these things that's kind of so far has helped us avoid significant effects on the company as a whole. I hope Kristine that answers your question. Not much difference, Kristine. I think, there is digital imaging as an example, which is now 60% of our business. It's the same, because we make very similar products different end markets, similar product complexity, et cetera. So I would say it's the same. There's some exceptions here and there by and large, though that is the same. Of course, Kristine. Good morning, Noah. I must say about 55 million. I hate to admit it, but it hurts me. We're going to burn down, Noah. It's either that or my clothes, but we're going to burn it down. Yes. We'll hold some, of course, we will Noah. But here's the thing. I think the combination of the things that I just mentioned, is making us feel a little more comfortable. The other thing is some of our businesses have been a little too conservative. We had a plan to reduce our inventory this year by a similar amount. So now it's gone up that much. So if we can bring it back that we still have ample inventory. We just have to move it around so that the measurement is such that it doesn't really hurt our cash flow. We have, for example \u2013 the problem we have, for example, with wafers. That's something that \u2013 that's long term, and we got to buy it. We buy 30,000 wafers in digital imaging. And we've got to buy it and we've got to keep it because that's one that you cannot buy in the market, whether it's East Asia or whether it's here, you can't buy that. So that one, we do. But there are other things that we can get rid of this year. Very close. Very close. At least, that's what I told the Board yesterday. Yes. That's a good question. There is \u2013 there's two parts to that. One of them is materials. And the other one is wages. On the material side, with everything that's going on in the world, our costs are increasing at this time, about 3.5% of our gross \u2013 cost of our goods. And frankly, we look at that from both the business side and also look at it from the corporate side. Wage inflation is a little less, maybe 3.25%. So \u2013 when you roll that up all together, we're seeing about cost increases of 3%, let's say. The flip side is we also are increasing prices ourselves, where we can, not in every program. We're pretty much offsetting that with price increases. So net-net, so far, being very careful and prudent in what we do. We've managed to negate those two when we'll have to work very hard to keep doing that. I think we're \u2013 I would say we're maintaining. That's it. Let me think, for example. I think about overall were 25%. I would say, about just under 20%, 19% is U.S. and DoD. And I'd say about 5% to 6% is foreign at this time. Thank you, Noah. Yes. No, that's a good question, Jim. Let me start with the total company, if I may. Book-to-bill is pretty healthy. It's 1.09%. We have really good backlog, by the way, the highest backlog that I remember, we have about $2.95 billion of backlog. And we backlog, we define very carefully. It's kind of money that we already know is going to come in. So our book-to-bill of 1.09% is pretty healthy, but it's variable across the company. Let's start with the Digital Imaging. Digital Imaging is a little less than the whole company, it's about 1.04%, but still healthy. In instruments, it's close to the company total. It's at 1.08% with marine being a little higher than environmental marine being at 1.13%. And test and measurement being at 1.07%. Environmental at 1.04%. So the total instrumentation is same as the company at 1.08%. Aerospace and defense electronics, as I mentioned, because of the commercial aerospace comeback, we have a 1.13 book to bill and an engineer systems where our revenue went done for the reasons I mentioned, partly because we are not going to \u2013 we got out of the turbine engine business after the first quarter of last year, plus we've been eating into our backlog. We have some really nice additions. Our book to bill is 1.38, but I'm always cautious on that one because that's a long-term program lumpy program wins. So overall 1.09, that's pretty good for us in this environment. Thank you. Thank you very much operator. I'll now ask Jason to conclude our conference call please."

            "content": "Thank you, Robert and good morning everyone. I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert, and then I will discuss our second quarter and full year 2022 outlook. In the first quarter, adjusted cash flow from operating activities was $79.7 million compared with cash flow of $124.9 million for the same period of 2021. The adjusted cash flow excludes a onetime payment of $296.4 million to the Swedish tax authority related to a disputed pre-acquisition 2018 tax reassessment issued to a FLIR subsidiary in Sweden.  Adjusted free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $58.7 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared with $110.1 million in 2021. Capital expenditures were $21 million in the first quarter compared to $17.6 million for the same period of 2021. Depreciation and amortization expense was $86.9 million for the first quarter of 2022 compared to $29.3 million in 2021. We ended the quarter with approximately $3.85 billion of net debt. That is approximately $4.13 billion of debt, less cash of $284.3 million. Our stock compensation expense was $4.3 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to $4.2 million for the same period of 2021. Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the second quarter of 2022 will be in the range of $3.44 to $3.55 per share with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $4.32 to $4.40. For the full year 2022, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $15.34 to $15.66 and on a non-GAAP basis, $17.75 to $18. The latter being an increase at the midpoint to our prior outlook of $17.60 to $18 that we provided in January. The 2022 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 23.1%. I'll now pass the call back to Robert."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Teledyne Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, it's my pleasure to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Jason VanWees. Please go ahead.\nJason VanWees : Thanks, Tom, and thanks, everyone. This is Jason VanWees, Vice Chairman. I would like to welcome everyone to Teledyne's Fourth Quarter and full year 2013 (sic) [2023] earnings release conference call. We released our earnings earlier this morning. Joining me today are Teledyne's Executive Chairman, Robert Mehrabian and our new but familiar management team, CEO, Edwin Roks, President and COO, George Bobb, Senior Vice President and CFO, Steve Blackwood, and also Melanie Cibik, EVP and General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary. After remarks by Robert, Edwin, George and Steve, we will ask for your questions. Of course, so before we get started, Tony's have reminded me to tell you that all forward-looking statements made this morning are subject to various assumptions, risks and caveats as noted in the earnings release and our periodic SEC filings. And of course, actual results may differ materially. In order to avoid potential selective disclosures, this call is simultaneously being webcast and a replay, both via webcast and dial-in, will be available for approximately 1 month. Here is Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian : Thank you, Jason, and good morning, and thank you for joining our earnings call. In the fourth quarter, we achieved all-time record sales and GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share. Sales increased primarily due to the performance of our Marine medical and aerospace businesses, which were more than able to compensate for the previously announced headwind in the industrial automation and laboratory instrumentation market. Furthermore, Overall, record orders exceeded sales in every business segment but were particularly strong in our Marine and Defense businesses. Leverage declined further to 1.9% and our balance sheet remains healthy. Finally, we continue to acquire complementary businesses, as shown by the acquisition of Zeno Networks in the fourth quarter. Compared with last year, fourth quarter and full year non-GAAP operating margin increased 27 and 57 basis points, respectively. Our broad-based strength in orders was encouraging, especially in the uncertain global macro environment today. Nevertheless, it's worth noting that most of the increase in orders was in our backlog-driven longer-cycle businesses. So converting the orders to sales will take a little time. In terms of 2024 outlook, we, therefore, think the quarterly sales and earnings ramp will be a bit greater than in recent years. So while we see annual 2024 sales growth of about 4%, we believe that typically seasonally low first quarter will be slightly under $1.4 billion or roughly flat with last year. I will now turn the call over to Edwin and George, who will further comment on the performance of our 4 business segments.\nEdwin Roks : Thank you, Robert. This is Edwin and I will report on the Digital Imaging segment, which is 56% of Teledyne's portfolio. And like Teledyne as a whole, this segment is a mix of longer-cycle businesses such as defense, space and health care, combined with shorter cycle markets, including industrial automation, semiconductor inspection and infrared components and cameras for application ranging from factory condition monitoring and maritime navigation. Fourth quarter 2023 sales was slightly lower compared to last year. Double-digit sales growth in each of X-ray products, FLIR surveillance systems and space-based infrared imaging detectors offset a significant year-over-year decline in sales of industrial imaging systems and Micro Electro Mechanical Systems, or MEMS. Fourth quarter sales of unmanned systems were at the greatest level in 2023 and but declined year-over-year due to a tough comparison. For the second quarter in a row, the FLIR business collective fleet were positive contributors to overall segment margin. In addition, FLIR quarterly sales increased year-over-year and were at the highest level in the last 2 years. George will now report on the other 3 segments, which will represent the remaining 44% of Teledyne.\nGeorge Bobb : Thanks, Evan. The instrumentation segment consists of our Marine, test and measurement and environmental businesses, which contributed a little over 23% of sales. For the total segment, overall fourth quarter sales increased 2.8% versus last year. Sales of marine instruments increased 14.7% in the quarter, primarily due to strong offshore energy sales, but also continued growth in global defense and ocean science markets. Sales of electronic test and measurement systems, which include oscilloscopes, digitizers and protocol analyzers were flat year-over-year. We continue to see some softness in sales of analyzers for electronic storage and data center applications. But this was largely offset by continued strong sales of oscilloscopes and a small amount of incremental sales from the Zeno acquisition. Sales of environmental instruments decreased 7.3% and with greater sales of air quality and gas and flame safety analyzers more than offset by lower sales of drug discovery and laboratory instruments. Overall, Instrumentation segment operating profit increased over 14% in the fourth quarter, with GAAP operating margin increasing 284 basis points to 27.1%, and 278 basis points on a non-GAAP basis to 28.1%, both all-time records for the segments. In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, which represents 13% of Teledyne sales, Fourth quarter sales increased 3.4%, primarily driven by growth of commercial aerospace products. GAAP and non-GAAP segment operating profit decreased approximately 5% year-over-year primarily due to a tough comparison with last year's all-time record segment margin. For the Engineered Systems segment, which contributes 8% to overall sales, fourth quarter revenue decreased 3.8%. But operating profit increased with margin up 325 basis points. I will now pass the call back to Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian : Thank you, George. In conclusion, we were pleased with our record performance in 2023. In the near term, we will continue to focus on growth in those businesses with favorable markets while cutting costs and protecting margins in businesses which are more challenged. And at the same time, we'll be acquiring and integrating complementary businesses. When certain markets like laboratory instrumentation, industrial automation or electronic test measurement recover, we will keep our cost structure in check and benefit handsomely. But if there are global or macroeconomic shocks in 2024, we will do what we've done in the past, execute well, generate record cash flow and complete some of our base and potentially larger acquisitions. I will now turn the call over to Steve.\nSteve Blackwood : Thank you, Robert, and good morning. I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert, and then I will discuss our first quarter and full year 2024 outlook. In the fourth quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $164.4 million compared with $237.7 million in 2022. Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures was $124.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with $203.6 million in 2022. Cash flow declined in the fourth quarter since we made $139 million of additional tax payments, which we were allowed to defer from the second and third quarter of 2023, due to IRS disaster relief. Without these catch-up tax payments, quarterly cash flow have been at an all-time record. Capital expenditures were $40.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and compared with $34.1 million in 2022. Depreciation and amortization expense was $77.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with $81.8 million in 2022. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.60 billion of net debt. That is approximately $3.24 billion of debt less cash of $48.3 million. Now turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the first quarter of 2024 and will be in the range of $3.73 to $3.86 with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $4.55 to $4.65 per share. And for the full year of 2024, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $17.15 to $17.53. And on a non-GAAP basis, $20.35 to $20.68. The 2024 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 22.5%. I will now pass the call back to Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian : Thank you, Steve. We would now like to take your questions. Tom, if you're ready to proceed with the questions and answers, please go ahead.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll begin today with a question from Jim Ricchiuti representing Needham & Company.\nJim Ricchiuti: I wanted to see if we could dig a little bit more into the way you see the year unfolding, it sounds like Q1 a little bit more seasonality. And I guess, with respect to the full year guidance, as you think about the balance of the year, are you making some assumptions of recovery in the shorter cycle business in the latter part of the year, particularly some of the areas that have been weaker, like the lab instrumentation and the industrial automation, machine vision area.\nRobert Mehrabian : Alright. Yes. We're right now expecting uptick in those businesses in the second half of the year. We think that what will happen is that we will have a linear ramp in sales and earnings throughout the year with about average revenue increase of about 4% and earnings as we've outlined up to $20.68, which would reflect also an improvement in margin from this year to next year of another almost 50 to 60 basis points. So yes, we're anticipating that. On the other hand, we're also adjusting our cost structure and if necessary, we'll do more. So that our earnings remain healthy.\nJim Ricchiuti: With respect to the margin improvement that you're anticipating I'm wondering how should we think about margins by some of the major business units just directionally?\nRobert Mehrabian : Sure. Jim, we are expecting margin improvement in every segment. A little lower in instruments, maybe 25 basis points. We already have very healthy margins there. On the other hand, in Digital Imaging, about 80 basis points. In Aerospace and Defense, we think we'll have 80 to 90 basis points. And engineered systems around 50 basis points. So overall, Jim, in the segment, we anticipate about 70 basis points margin improvement. And overall, for the company between 50 and 60 basis points. In a way, it's kind of similar to what we achieved this year. Which was about 60 basis points over last year.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Greg Konrad with Jefferies.\nGreg Konrad: Maybe just to follow up with the last question, but on the revenue side, given the commentary around book to bail, 4% growth for the year. Can you maybe talk about the assumptions between long and short cycle or from a segment basis for growth in 2024?\nRobert Mehrabian : Yes, Greg, let me give you the segment first. And then I'll try and answer the first question. From a segment perspective, with the instrumentation, would grow about 3.5% this year over last year. We think Digital Imaging will -- going back to instrumentation, there's a difference between the different businesses that we have. The marine businesses with healthy background backlog, as George mentioned, would grow about 6% to 6.5%, whereas environmental would be just under 3%, and we're expecting T&M to basically hold. Going to Digital Imaging. We believe that the overall sales increase would be above 4%. Aerospace and Defense, about 5%. Engineered Systems, about 4%. And when you add all of that up, we expect an average of about 4% at this time.\nGreg Konrad: And then maybe if we can just dig into digital imaging a little bit more. I mean the commentary and the release around product lines on the call was helpful. But is there any way just for Q4 in 2023 to kind of level set or put some numbers behind growth in space in health care versus maybe the declines you've seen in other parts of the portfolio?\nRobert Mehrabian : Sure. Let me start with Q4, please, and then I'll go to some of the others. In health care, we had really nice Q4. Revenue increased about 13.5% to 14%. In Aerospace and Defense, it increased about 5%. This offset basically weakness in our industrial and scientific vision systems. The flip side, if you go over to our FLIR businesses, we have really robust growth in our surveillance system, about 16.5%, and some of our detection products Overall, in Q4, FLIR revenue defense increased about 4.8%. Now going forward, to the future. I'll make a little distinction between DALSA e2v and FLIR. We think that DALSA e2v would have a modest growth of about 3%, offset by about 4.5% in FLIR. As mentioned earlier, clear defense especially, is experiencing really good order intake -- and we expect the growth there to exceed that of the rest of the imaging. So I can give you more detail, but that's basically a summary of it.\nOperator: We'll go to the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Jordan Lines on for Ron. I wanted to ask, so for the backlog growth in the defense wins that you guys are seeing, how are you guys thinking about the risk of the CR?\nRobert Mehrabian : Well, Sure. Obviously, CR is always an unpleasant occurrence for us. The way we're looking at it is we're only right now considering the orders that we have in house. We're not really looking at future orders. So book-to-bill has been healthy. These are longer-term programs. And frankly, we have some exciting new products coming out, which are being now tested. For example, if you look at our Black Hornet, we -- Black Hornet 3, which is our nano drones. Black Hornet 3 had a really good run over the past 5, 6 years. We've introduced a Black Hornet 4, which is already getting traction. We also have some really nice programs in space development agency, tranche true tracking layer as well as our international sales in that domain are healthy. So in some ways, while CR would be not a pleasant thing to experience. We've done it in the past. We've had CRs in many years. Right now, we're looking at what we have in our backlog, which is healthy.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. And then on the Unmanned Systems \u2013 Air systems that you guys cited as being lower for DI. Is that related to just sunsetting programs? Or what was driving that change?\nRobert Mehrabian : I think basically, it\u2019s tough comps rather than real declines. We think our drone businesses are healthy. We also have some businesses that our anti-drone or flame detection systems, which we\u2019re selling in Europe, which are very healthy. So I think it\u2019s just a matter of tough comps. Other than that, we feel very good about our drone businesses.\nOperator: A question from the line of Joe Giordano with TD.\nJoe Giordano: Close enough there. How are you doing?\nRobert Mehrabian : Good, Joe. Good.\nJoe Giordano: Can you -- I'll start on free cash flow. I think that at the end of the day, that probably came in a little lighter than you thought for the full year. Can you talk about how you think '24 shapes up and how working capital looks for the year?\nRobert Mehrabian : Yes, you're right. It came in a little lighter, but we made some really good progress in the third quarter, and especially in the fourth quarter, from our managed working capital perspective, we had some significant improvement in our -- trying to reduce our inventory. The flip side is, we also did not -- we're always like most companies suffering from not being able to get cash for our R&D. So I'd say but that affected us maybe $75 million or $60 million to $75 million. Our cash, nevertheless, if you looked at it, we paid down $680 million of debt in 2023. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio -- net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is about 1.9. So let me fast forward to 2024. We believe we'll do a little better in 2024 than we did in 2023. We'd like to think that we would have a 100% conversion, recognizing that there is always going to be this R&D headwind. Even though everybody in the Congress has agreed that the R&D program should be passed. I think nothing is passing in this Congress. So we're not -- we're assuming we don't get that. Nevertheless, we think will be somewhere between $900 million, $925 million and $1 billion. If we hit those numbers, which we think we will then our debt-to-EBITDA ratio should go down from 1.9 to closer to 1.1 to 1.2, which is -- which puts us in a really good position to be able to make both small and midsized acquisition.\nJoe Giordano: That's really helpful color. My last one, we've kind of talked about the a lot, but I just want to -- maybe if you can frame for the full year of '23, like how much down was like the industrial and scientific vision? And what did that do to margins? And then how did FLIR margins for the full year look year-on-year?\nRobert Mehrabian : Okay. Let me just pick the first part. Industrial and scientific vision, I'm going to say we're down about 2% year-over-year, larger declines in Q4 than that. In terms of the margins, FLIR margins actually improved significantly year-over-year. It went from 20.3% in 2022 to 22.1% in 2023, which was very healthy. As a consequence, we were able to hold the overall margins in Digital Imaging relatively flat.\nJoe Giordano: And you'd expect FLIR to expand margins again in '24, correct? Just inherent in that margin commentary?\nRobert Mehrabian : Yes. We think FLIR would have some margin expansion. But if you look at it as a whole segment that is our Digital Imaging segment, we expect margins to increase somewhere between 50 and 100 basis points in 2024.\nOperator: Next, let's go to the line of Kristine Liwag representing Morgan Stanley.\nKristine Liwag: Robert, last year, you talked about some facility consolidation at Digital Imaging. And you're also talking about 80 basis points in margin expansion this year for the segment. How much of that is from this consolidation from before on the floor integration? And how much of that is on better price cost? And ultimately, could we expect to see higher margins there if you have additional cost takeout you could do this year?\nRobert Mehrabian : Yes, Kristine, let me see if I can do this properly. We -- we are in the process, for example, now in terms of space consolidation. What we're doing is we're getting out of leased spaces and moving to owned spaces. For example, in Massachusetts, we have an own space in Bevrica, we're getting out of a lease space there, and that should be effective in March. That will help us say something of $500,000, $600,000, $700,000. The issue that we have whole consolidation overall is helpful. It's the growth of our businesses and the lower costs that we have put in place this year. that should be more helpful. So when Edwin thinks about or talks about margin improvement, he is looking at really a lower cost structure, which we've achieved maintaining that and getting some growth, especially from our longer-cycle businesses. So it's a combination of those. I would say, lower cost and growth trumping just space consolidation.\nKristine Liwag: Great color. And in terms of industrial automation and the laboratory instrumentation markets, you've talked about a rebound for the second half of the year. What metrics are you looking at? What indicators are you following to -- that you're watching out for this end market?\nRobert Mehrabian : For industrial automation, really is it's a combination of things. We're seeing, for example, some improvement in the semi market now, projections for improved semi market recovery. We'll also seeing some pickup in smartphones now, which is our consumer-related businesses, which affects our Micro Electro Mechanical Systems MEMS programs, in the other markets, especially laboratory instrumentation, we don't have as much visibility, frankly, we haven't seen these kind of declines before. So we think those should come back. But we're not counting on them a lot. We think there's a flip side of our environmental businesses, which is -- that's a part of which is the air quality, water quality monitoring, which have been very healthy. We have a nice backlog and -- we think the combination of those 2 will help us in that part of our instrumentation business.\nKristine Liwag: And last question for me. I mean, your current leverage position gives you flexibility to pursue more sizable deals? I mean, you've recently closed the Zeno acquisition. But in terms of larger deals, are valuations starting to look more attractive? And how is the 2024 pipeline shaping up?\nRobert Mehrabian : Yes. I have to tell you, valuations on the larger deals have not come down yet as much as we would like. We've looked at some of the prices that our competitors have paid for large ones, those are kind of out of our range of what we would consider. On the flip side, we see some opportunities in smaller bolt-on acquisitions, what we call single pearls, which are available, and we will be pursuing those. If you looked at our '68, '69 acquisitions over our history, the string of pearls are of '68, '69. And they are the easiest to integrate. We can fit them in and we can improve their margins as we go. The larger deals, we have to be a little more patient because right now, prices are still pretty high.\nOperator: Here's a question from Andrew Buscaglia with BNP.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Digital Imaging margin. So I wanted to ask on -- so you're going to start Q1 sounds like in a whole. First off is digital imaging margins, do you expect those down year-over-year and that effectively marks sort of a bottom for that segment as sales start to improve from there?\nRobert Mehrabian : No. The answer is no. I don't expect Digital Imaging margins to go down. I think that should go up a little bit in Q1 and then pick up the rest of the year. As I mentioned before, Andrew, this -- we think Digital Imaging as a whole should have margin improvement in '24, somewhere between 50 basis points and 100 basis points. We'd probably more prejudice towards the higher number. But nevertheless, no, I don't think we're expecting to suffer there because as we've done before, when some of our markets soften up, we take cost out. And then that helps maintain our margins. And the markets come back -- we really enjoy the margin improvement. So no, I don't think digital imaging is going to go down.\nAndrew Buscaglia: And you mean up year-over-year or up sequentially?\nRobert Mehrabian : Well, I think year-over-year first, it's going to between 50 to 100 basis points. I think -- and I think what would happen is if there's sequentially -- it will be sequential improvement. I don't expect things to go down.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Yes. Okay. And then in past quarters, you sort of broke out [indiscernible] book-to-bill versus legacy Teledyne book-to-bill. Do you have that? And then wondering your view on potential incremental defense awards as the year progresses?\nRobert Mehrabian : Sure. If you look at instrumentation, which is all legacy Teledyne in some ways. Which is marine, environmental and test and measurement. The book-to-bill in Q4 was 1.12 which is very healthy, driven primarily by Marine, which was really good. Digital Imaging, we -- or excluding FLIR, I'm just answering your question precisely, it was just over 1. Aerospace and Defense, it was closer to 1.2. That's historical paradigm. And Engineered Systems was just over 1. And then if you look at FLIR, which is our big acquisition, obviously, it was just over 1. So all in all, whether it's our historical Teledyne or Teledyne Plus FLIR, if you look at Q4, our book-to-bill was over more closer to 1.07%.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. And then a question on you're feeling on incremental defense awards throughout the year. Is there still a lot you're tracking?\nRobert Mehrabian : Yes. The answer is yes. We have a pretty good read on what's coming. We have some new products. I mentioned the Black Hornet 4. I mentioned the space Tranche 2. The primes that have gotten their awards in last week or we are up to all of them. And we feel good about that.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And let's go to the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.\nNoah Poponak: Robert, your full year 2024 framework is assuming 4% full year organic revenue growth. Is that correct?\nRobert Mehrabian : Yes, about 4%.\nNoah Poponak: And can you just repeat what you said about the first quarter top line revenue dollars or organic revenue growth?\nRobert Mehrabian : Yes. I think it'd be above 1.4 or a little under, if that's going to be our lowest quarter. And I'm saying that because of the short-cycle businesses that we're seeing. We have orders on long-cycle businesses. But we -- our short-cycle businesses -- we're assuming that will not recover much in Q1 and so it should be flat year-over-year in terms of revenue and then pick up.\nNoah Poponak: Got it. Okay. Just -- yes, I wasn't clear, but now I am. And I guess in those short-cycle businesses, I mean this has sort of been asked and discussed, but just have you actually seen concrete evidence of when that will pick up? Or I know a short cycle, but orders for it to pick up? Or are you just kind of making an assumption based on everything you know about the business? And then I guess you'll also have easier compares.\nRobert Mehrabian : That's very good. We look at our pipeline, as necessarily say that we have better orders at this time. But we're talking to our customers, we're looking at that inventory level, but they're sharing that with us. And we see that inventories are going down. As a consequence, we expect that we will start getting the orders. long cycle, of course, you understand that's much easier because we already have the orders, and we feel good about that. So the other thing that we do on the short cycle is we look at the generator trends that people are talking about in terms of what happened in the semi industry in the past number of quarters. And what's expected -- what people are projecting. We'd be thinking that environmental and test and measurement will eventually pick up. But we're also seeing some pickup in MEMS already in flame infrared as well as our maritime businesses. So that's what's encouraging. We see some lowering of inventories for our customers as well as some pickup in certain unique businesses of ours.\nNoah Poponak: Okay. That makes sense, and that's helpful. If I go to the 4% organic for the year, and then I do what you said with the segment margins, I think most of the things between that and the EPS are pretty straightforward. I get something above your EPS guidance. Is it safe to assume that you've just embedded some degree of conservatism relative to the lack of visibility in short cycle in the EPS range?\nRobert Mehrabian : Yes. You said it better than I could. We're always a little conservative. The other -- there's one other thing that I should mention. When we look at our segment, per se. And we look at increases in segment margins. We have to be cognizant of the fact that the new management, which is Edwin and George are now going to be their costs or their pay is going to reflect in the corporate portion. And we're also seeing a little higher medical and insurance premiums. So corporate, we expect would go up. That's why while the margins in the segment look much higher, the corporate margins are -- we're assuming they're going to be increasing about 50 to 60 basis points.\nNoah Poponak: Last one, some of your commentary makes it sound like the M&A pipeline is pretty full and pretty active and you're pretty optimistic about what you see. Other things you've said suggests there's a bid-ask spread and maybe it's a little tougher. So I guess, can you put a finer point on it in terms of how likely we are to see deals this year?\nRobert Mehrabian : Yes. Let me just say that the confusion may have reason because I was answering 2 questions at the same time. The first part was larger acquisitions because we -- our leverage ratio is obviously going down and it go down faster this year. The larger acquisitions right now that we look at are pretty expensive. People are paying prices that we are not going to. On the other hand, smaller acquisitions are available, and we expect to make some this year. So I think we'd be patient for the larger ones like we always have been and -- but we will make some smaller acquisitions this year. So we have a reasonable product line.\nOperator: Next is the question from Robert Jamieson with UBS.\nRobert Jamieson: Very helpful. Just one kind of smaller one on A&D electronics. Strong growth, like expected for next year and another 80 to 90 basis points of margin expansion. Just curious how you're thinking about the growth split within commercial aerospace between new builds and then MRO? And then how should we think about the puts and takes on margin there, maybe if like MRO is a little bit pressured next year?\nRobert Mehrabian : Let's stay with aerospace first. A significant amount of our revenue in aerospace is in the aftermarket. Because we have a very large embedded base in aircraft of various kinds. So we think that is going to be very helpful for us. We also are -- obviously, in 737, we have a product line that's going into that. And we think that's going to help us regardless of the current issues with builds and so on. On the defense side, we are seeing some good programs in modernization, stockpile, replacement. And we think those would be helpful to us. And obviously, we believe it will be a balance of improvement, both in aerospace and in defense perhaps 5% to 6%. 5% to 6% in each domain.\nRobert Jamieson: That's great. And then this is kind of more of a random question, but just -- we talked a little bit about capital allocation. You got a full funnel, probably going to look to do some smaller acquisitions. Absent anything large, and I know this would be a deviation for what we've seen over the last several years. But would you have any interest in buying back stock? And then I guess one other kind of thought or questions that random would be given like the float, would you ever consider a stock split to maybe make it a little bit easier to trade like tighten the bid-ask spread? And could that ever maybe make it easier for you to buy back stock?\nRobert Mehrabian : Split, no. And the reason -- let me start there. And the reason I say that that's a pain for our investors. And 90-plus percent of our investors are institutional investors. We don't want to cause that kind of a problem for them. We have very small fraction of our investors that are retail investors. Going back to buyback. Right now, we think our investment returns are much better reflected in acquisitions than stock buyback. You don't want to say never because stock goes down a lot, then it becomes attractive. I'm hoping that doesn't happen. We do have open authorization if we wanted to do that. But right now, I don't see that as long as we have attractive acquisitions, even small ones, we'll do those. And there's nothing wrong also having some cash on the side in these days. with the interest rates that we're seeing. So we have to pay down about $600 million of debt this year. In some ways, it's unfortunate because it's fixed debt at less than 1%. But then we don't have to pay down debt going in 2026. So we'll have a lot of cash available to do things. So we think we'll be okay.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We have a follow-up from Joe Giordano, he's representing TD Cohen.\nJoe Giordano: Just wanted to ask on the pricing environment because I know you said before that maybe you took less -- I mean, price was so strong for kind of everyone for a long time here. But I think in some areas, maybe in some of the vision products, you took less price than you probably could have to kind of maintain share. And just curious how the pricing environment has evolved since you made those comments and what you're thinking how price is a part of your guidance for next year?\nRobert Mehrabian : First point, backwards, in '23, we had some nice price increases. I'm going to say broadly 2% to 3%, let's say, 3%. We expect the same in '24. In some areas, obviously, we were able to increase price more than 3%. But in some areas like government contracts that are not peak [indiscernible] the cost plus then you can increase prices as such. So I think 2% to 3% is what we're looking at for '24.\nOperator: And we have no other participants queuing up at this time.\nSteve Blackwood : Thank you very much, Tom. I'll just have -- I'll ask Jason to please conclude our call.\nJason VanWees : Thanks, Robert. Again, thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. And if you have follow-up questions, please feel free to call me at the number on the earnings release. And Tom, if you could give the replay information, just a conclusion, that would be the ideal.\nOperator: One moment here. I pull that up -- sorry about that.

            "content": "Thank you, Robert. This is Edwin and I will report on the Digital Imaging segment, which is 56% of Teledyne's portfolio. And like Teledyne as a whole, this segment is a mix of longer-cycle businesses such as defense, space and health care, combined with shorter cycle markets, including industrial automation, semiconductor inspection and infrared components and cameras for application ranging from factory condition monitoring and maritime navigation. Fourth quarter 2023 sales was slightly lower compared to last year. Double-digit sales growth in each of X-ray products, FLIR surveillance systems and space-based infrared imaging detectors offset a significant year-over-year decline in sales of industrial imaging systems and Micro Electro Mechanical Systems, or MEMS. Fourth quarter sales of unmanned systems were at the greatest level in 2023 and but declined year-over-year due to a tough comparison. For the second quarter in a row, the FLIR business collective fleet were positive contributors to overall segment margin. In addition, FLIR quarterly sales increased year-over-year and were at the highest level in the last 2 years. George will now report on the other 3 segments, which will represent the remaining 44% of Teledyne."
        },
        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Robert Mehrabian",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason, and good morning, and thank you for joining our earnings call. In the fourth quarter, we achieved all-time record sales and GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share. Sales increased primarily due to the performance of our Marine medical and aerospace businesses, which were more than able to compensate for the previously announced headwind in the industrial automation and laboratory instrumentation market. Furthermore, Overall, record orders exceeded sales in every business segment but were particularly strong in our Marine and Defense businesses. Leverage declined further to 1.9% and our balance sheet remains healthy. Finally, we continue to acquire complementary businesses, as shown by the acquisition of Zeno Networks in the fourth quarter. Compared with last year, fourth quarter and full year non-GAAP operating margin increased 27 and 57 basis points, respectively. Our broad-based strength in orders was encouraging, especially in the uncertain global macro environment today. Nevertheless, it's worth noting that most of the increase in orders was in our backlog-driven longer-cycle businesses. So converting the orders to sales will take a little time. In terms of 2024 outlook, we, therefore, think the quarterly sales and earnings ramp will be a bit greater than in recent years. So while we see annual 2024 sales growth of about 4%, we believe that typically seasonally low first quarter will be slightly under $1.4 billion or roughly flat with last year. I will now turn the call over to Edwin and George, who will further comment on the performance of our 4 business segments. Thank you, George. In conclusion, we were pleased with our record performance in 2023. In the near term, we will continue to focus on growth in those businesses with favorable markets while cutting costs and protecting margins in businesses which are more challenged. And at the same time, we'll be acquiring and integrating complementary businesses. When certain markets like laboratory instrumentation, industrial automation or electronic test measurement recover, we will keep our cost structure in check and benefit handsomely. But if there are global or macroeconomic shocks in 2024, we will do what we've done in the past, execute well, generate record cash flow and complete some of our base and potentially larger acquisitions. I will now turn the call over to Steve. Thank you, Steve. We would now like to take your questions. Tom, if you're ready to proceed with the questions and answers, please go ahead. Alright. Yes. We're right now expecting uptick in those businesses in the second half of the year. We think that what will happen is that we will have a linear ramp in sales and earnings throughout the year with about average revenue increase of about 4% and earnings as we've outlined up to $20.68, which would reflect also an improvement in margin from this year to next year of another almost 50 to 60 basis points. So yes, we're anticipating that. On the other hand, we're also adjusting our cost structure and if necessary, we'll do more. So that our earnings remain healthy. Sure. Jim, we are expecting margin improvement in every segment. A little lower in instruments, maybe 25 basis points. We already have very healthy margins there. On the other hand, in Digital Imaging, about 80 basis points. In Aerospace and Defense, we think we'll have 80 to 90 basis points. And engineered systems around 50 basis points. So overall, Jim, in the segment, we anticipate about 70 basis points margin improvement. And overall, for the company between 50 and 60 basis points. In a way, it's kind of similar to what we achieved this year. Which was about 60 basis points over last year. Yes, Greg, let me give you the segment first. And then I'll try and answer the first question. From a segment perspective, with the instrumentation, would grow about 3.5% this year over last year. We think Digital Imaging will -- going back to instrumentation, there's a difference between the different businesses that we have. The marine businesses with healthy background backlog, as George mentioned, would grow about 6% to 6.5%, whereas environmental would be just under 3%, and we're expecting T&M to basically hold. Going to Digital Imaging. We believe that the overall sales increase would be above 4%. Aerospace and Defense, about 5%. Engineered Systems, about 4%. And when you add all of that up, we expect an average of about 4% at this time. Sure. Let me start with Q4, please, and then I'll go to some of the others. In health care, we had really nice Q4. Revenue increased about 13.5% to 14%. In Aerospace and Defense, it increased about 5%. This offset basically weakness in our industrial and scientific vision systems. The flip side, if you go over to our FLIR businesses, we have really robust growth in our surveillance system, about 16.5%, and some of our detection products Overall, in Q4, FLIR revenue defense increased about 4.8%. Now going forward, to the future. I'll make a little distinction between DALSA e2v and FLIR. We think that DALSA e2v would have a modest growth of about 3%, offset by about 4.5% in FLIR. As mentioned earlier, clear defense especially, is experiencing really good order intake -- and we expect the growth there to exceed that of the rest of the imaging. So I can give you more detail, but that's basically a summary of it. Well, Sure. Obviously, CR is always an unpleasant occurrence for us. The way we're looking at it is we're only right now considering the orders that we have in house. We're not really looking at future orders. So book-to-bill has been healthy. These are longer-term programs. And frankly, we have some exciting new products coming out, which are being now tested. For example, if you look at our Black Hornet, we -- Black Hornet 3, which is our nano drones. Black Hornet 3 had a really good run over the past 5, 6 years. We've introduced a Black Hornet 4, which is already getting traction. We also have some really nice programs in space development agency, tranche true tracking layer as well as our international sales in that domain are healthy. So in some ways, while CR would be not a pleasant thing to experience. We've done it in the past. We've had CRs in many years. Right now, we're looking at what we have in our backlog, which is healthy. I think basically, it's tough comps rather than real declines. We think our drone businesses are healthy. We also have some businesses that our anti-drone or flame detection systems, which we're selling in Europe, which are very healthy. So I think it's just a matter of tough comps. Other than that, we feel very good about our drone businesses. Good, Joe. Good. Yes, you're right. It came in a little lighter, but we made some really good progress in the third quarter, and especially in the fourth quarter, from our managed working capital perspective, we had some significant improvement in our -- trying to reduce our inventory. The flip side is, we also did not -- we're always like most companies suffering from not being able to get cash for our R&D. So I'd say but that affected us maybe $75 million or $60 million to $75 million. Our cash, nevertheless, if you looked at it, we paid down $680 million of debt in 2023. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio -- net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is about 1.9. So let me fast forward to 2024. We believe we'll do a little better in 2024 than we did in 2023. We'd like to think that we would have a 100% conversion, recognizing that there is always going to be this R&D headwind. Even though everybody in the Congress has agreed that the R&D program should be passed. I think nothing is passing in this Congress. So we're not -- we're assuming we don't get that. Nevertheless, we think will be somewhere between $900 million, $925 million and $1 billion. If we hit those numbers, which we think we will then our debt-to-EBITDA ratio should go down from 1.9 to closer to 1.1 to 1.2, which is -- which puts us in a really good position to be able to make both small and midsized acquisition. Okay. Let me just pick the first part. Industrial and scientific vision, I'm going to say we're down about 2% year-over-year, larger declines in Q4 than that. In terms of the margins, FLIR margins actually improved significantly year-over-year. It went from 20.3% in 2022 to 22.1% in 2023, which was very healthy. As a consequence, we were able to hold the overall margins in Digital Imaging relatively flat. Yes. We think FLIR would have some margin expansion. But if you look at it as a whole segment that is our Digital Imaging segment, we expect margins to increase somewhere between 50 and 100 basis points in 2024. Yes, Kristine, let me see if I can do this properly. We -- we are in the process, for example, now in terms of space consolidation. What we're doing is we're getting out of leased spaces and moving to owned spaces. For example, in Massachusetts, we have an own space in Bevrica, we're getting out of a lease space there, and that should be effective in March. That will help us say something of $500,000, $600,000, $700,000. The issue that we have whole consolidation overall is helpful. It's the growth of our businesses and the lower costs that we have put in place this year. that should be more helpful. So when Edwin thinks about or talks about margin improvement, he is looking at really a lower cost structure, which we've achieved maintaining that and getting some growth, especially from our longer-cycle businesses. So it's a combination of those. I would say, lower cost and growth trumping just space consolidation. For industrial automation, really is it's a combination of things. We're seeing, for example, some improvement in the semi market now, projections for improved semi market recovery. We'll also seeing some pickup in smartphones now, which is our consumer-related businesses, which affects our Micro Electro Mechanical Systems MEMS programs, in the other markets, especially laboratory instrumentation, we don't have as much visibility, frankly, we haven't seen these kind of declines before. So we think those should come back. But we're not counting on them a lot. We think there's a flip side of our environmental businesses, which is -- that's a part of which is the air quality, water quality monitoring, which have been very healthy. We have a nice backlog and -- we think the combination of those 2 will help us in that part of our instrumentation business. Yes. I have to tell you, valuations on the larger deals have not come down yet as much as we would like. We've looked at some of the prices that our competitors have paid for large ones, those are kind of out of our range of what we would consider. On the flip side, we see some opportunities in smaller bolt-on acquisitions, what we call single pearls, which are available, and we will be pursuing those. If you looked at our '68, '69 acquisitions over our history, the string of pearls are of '68, '69. And they are the easiest to integrate. We can fit them in and we can improve their margins as we go. The larger deals, we have to be a little more patient because right now, prices are still pretty high. No. The answer is no. I don't expect Digital Imaging margins to go down. I think that should go up a little bit in Q1 and then pick up the rest of the year. As I mentioned before, Andrew, this -- we think Digital Imaging as a whole should have margin improvement in '24, somewhere between 50 basis points and 100 basis points. We'd probably more prejudice towards the higher number. But nevertheless, no, I don't think we're expecting to suffer there because as we've done before, when some of our markets soften up, we take cost out. And then that helps maintain our margins. And the markets come back -- we really enjoy the margin improvement. So no, I don't think digital imaging is going to go down. Well, I think year-over-year first, it's going to between 50 to 100 basis points. I think -- and I think what would happen is if there's sequentially -- it will be sequential improvement. I don't expect things to go down. Sure. If you look at instrumentation, which is all legacy Teledyne in some ways. Which is marine, environmental and test and measurement. The book-to-bill in Q4 was 1.12 which is very healthy, driven primarily by Marine, which was really good. Digital Imaging, we -- or excluding FLIR, I'm just answering your question precisely, it was just over 1. Aerospace and Defense, it was closer to 1.2. That's historical paradigm.

So all in all, whether it's our historical Teledyne or Teledyne Plus FLIR, if you look at Q4, our book-to-bill was over more closer to 1.07%. Yes. The answer is yes. We have a pretty good read on what's coming. We have some new products. I mentioned the Black Hornet 4. I mentioned the space Tranche 2. The primes that have gotten their awards in last week or we are up to all of them. And we feel good about that. Yes, about 4%. Yes. I think it'd be above 1.4 or a little under, if that's going to be our lowest quarter. And I'm saying that because of the short-cycle businesses that we're seeing. We have orders on long-cycle businesses. But we -- our short-cycle businesses -- we're assuming that will not recover much in Q1 and so it should be flat year-over-year in terms of revenue and then pick up. That's very good. We look at our pipeline, as necessarily say that we have better orders at this time. But we're talking to our customers, we're looking at that inventory level, but they're sharing that with us.

            "content": "Thank you, Robert, and good morning. I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert, and then I will discuss our first quarter and full year 2024 outlook. In the fourth quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $164.4 million compared with $237.7 million in 2022. Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures was $124.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with $203.6 million in 2022. Cash flow declined in the fourth quarter since we made $139 million of additional tax payments, which we were allowed to defer from the second and third quarter of 2023, due to IRS disaster relief. Without these catch-up tax payments, quarterly cash flow have been at an all-time record. Capital expenditures were $40.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and compared with $34.1 million in 2022. Depreciation and amortization expense was $77.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with $81.8 million in 2022. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.60 billion of net debt. That is approximately $3.24 billion of debt less cash of $48.3 million. Now turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the first quarter of 2024 and will be in the range of $3.73 to $3.86 with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $4.55 to $4.65 per share. And for the full year of 2024, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $17.15 to $17.53. And on a non-GAAP basis, $20.35 to $20.68. The 2024 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 22.5%. I will now pass the call back to Robert. Thank you very much, Tom. I'll just have -- I'll ask Jason to please conclude our call."

            "content": "Thanks, Evan. The instrumentation segment consists of our Marine, test and measurement and environmental businesses, which contributed a little over 23% of sales. For the total segment, overall fourth quarter sales increased 2.8% versus last year. Sales of marine instruments increased 14.7% in the quarter, primarily due to strong offshore energy sales, but also continued growth in global defense and ocean science markets. Sales of electronic test and measurement systems, which include oscilloscopes, digitizers and protocol analyzers were flat year-over-year. We continue to see some softness in sales of analyzers for electronic storage and data center applications. But this was largely offset by continued strong sales of oscilloscopes and a small amount of incremental sales from the Zeno acquisition. Sales of environmental instruments decreased 7.3% and with greater sales of air quality and gas and flame safety analyzers more than offset by lower sales of drug discovery and laboratory instruments. Overall, Instrumentation segment operating profit increased over 14% in the fourth quarter, with GAAP operating margin increasing 284 basis points to 27.1%, and 278 basis points on a non-GAAP basis to 28.1%, both all-time records for the segments. In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, which represents 13% of Teledyne sales, Fourth quarter sales increased 3.4%, primarily driven by growth of commercial aerospace products. GAAP and non-GAAP segment operating profit decreased approximately 5% year-over-year primarily due to a tough comparison with last year's all-time record segment margin. For the Engineered Systems segment, which contributes 8% to overall sales, fourth quarter revenue decreased 3.8%. But operating profit increased with margin up 325 basis points. I will now pass the call back to Robert."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Jason VanWees. Please go ahead.\nJason VanWees: Thanks John and good morning everyone. This is Jason VanWees, Vice Chairman, and I'd like to welcome everyone to our third quarter 2023 earnings release conference call. We released our earnings earlier this morning before the market opened. Joining me today are Teledyne's Chairman, President and CEO, Robert Mehrabian\u2019 and Senior Vice President and CFO, Sue Main. Also joining today are Steve Blackwood who will assume the role of SVP and CFO on December 1st; Melanie Cibik, currently Senior Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary will be promoted to Executive Vice President on January 1st; and Edwin Roks and George Bobb, currently Executive VPs of Teledyne will assume the roles of CEO and President and COO, respectively, on January 1st. After remarks by Robert and Sue, we will ask for your questions. Of course, before we get started, our attorneys have reminded me to tell you that all forward-looking statements made this morning are subject to various assumptions, risks and caveats as noted in the earnings release and our periodic SEC filings and of course actual results may differ materially. In order to avoid potential selective disclosures, this call is simultaneously being webcast and a replay, both via webcast and dial-in, will be available for approximately one month. Here is Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Jason, and good morning and thank you for joining our earnings call. These are exciting times for Teledyne. We have new leadership coming in, but we also have continuity and resilience in our programs, in our operations and our ability to meet what we say we would do in our earnings. In the third quarter, as example, we achieved record operating margin and earnings per share. GAAP operating margin of 18.8% was a third quarter record. On a non-GAAP basis, the operating margin was 22.8%, which was an all time record for any quarter. Likewise, GAAP earnings per share of $14.15 (sic) [$4.15] was a third quarter record and non-GAAP earnings per share of $5.05 was an all-time record for Teledyne. Compared to last year, GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins increased 119 and 86 basis points, respectively, and both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share increased approximately 11%. Our overall third quarter performance was led by growth in our marine, medical, aerospace and certain defense businesses, coupled with vigilant cost control. There was, however, some deterioration in certain end markets such as industrial automation and laboratory instrumentation. Nevertheless, given our focus on operational excellence, operating margins increased, both sequentially and year-over-year in Digital Imaging and Instrumentation segments, helping generate record earnings. Given continued debt repayment through September, which totaled about $680 million year-to-date, our consolidated leverage ratio declined to just under 2 times. And finally, we're pleased to have added Xena Networks to our test and measurement businesses which also continued to perform very well in a challenging environment. In terms of our outlook, we now see total sales for 2023 growth of about 4% or a little less than the second half versus our July outlook with the fourth quarter sales being roughly $1.45 billion. Approximately half of this change in incremental -- is due to incremental currency translation headwind from July to now, and the balance being further deterioration in industrial automation and laboratory instrumentation markets mentioned earlier. However, given the strong margin and earnings achieved in the third quarter, we're raising our non-GAAP earnings outlook to $19.25 at the midpoint from a prior outlook of $19.10. I will now further comment on the performance of our four segments. Third quarter sales in our Digital Imaging segment were flat compared to last year. Sales of x-ray products, infrared imaging detectors and surveillance system increased year-over-year but were offset by lower sales of unmanned ground systems, and micro-electro-mechanical systems or MEMS. Sales of commercial marine hardware and software were flat, but declined organically. Finally, cameras and sensors for industrial automation declined compared to last year. Like Teledyne as a whole, the Digital Imaging business portfolio is exceptionally well balanced across market segments and geographies. With the help of bolt-on acquisitions and growth in our medical and defense markets, we were able to offset declines in industrial automation and its -- and the small portion of our overall portfolio that is associated with consumer discretionary spending. Despite of the flat revenue, margins performance improved considerably to record levels with the FLIR businesses collectively slightly higher than segment average margins. Turning to our Instrumentation businesses. This segment consists of marine instruments, test and measurement and environmental instruments. Overall, third quarter sales in Instrumentation segment increased 7.4% versus last year. Sales of marine instruments increased 20.5% in the quarter, primarily due to ongoing recovery in offshore energy markets and also greater sales of acoustic imaging systems. Sales of electronic test and measurement systems, which includes oscilloscopes, digitizers and protocol analyzers, collectively increased 2.5%. We continue to see some softness in sales of analyzers for electronic storage and data center application. But, this was more than offset by sales of devices for wireless and video protocols as well as continued strong sales of oscilloscopes. Demand for high-speed networking customers remains very healthy, and we see the Xena acquisition, enhancing our offerings in this market. Sales of environmental instruments decreased slightly compared to last year, with sales of air quality and gas and flame safety analyzers offsetting some decline in drug discovery and laboratory instruments. Overall, Instrumentation segment operating profit increased over 20% in the third quarter with GAAP operating margins increasing 277 basis points to 26% and 253 basis points on a non-GAAP basis to 27%. These were all-time records for this segment. Third quarter sales in our Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment increased 8.1%, driven by growth both in defense electronics and aerospace -- commercial aerospace products. GAAP and non-GAAP operating profit increased 11.5% with margins 81 basis points greater than last year. Finally, in the Engineering Systems segment, third quarter revenue increased 4.1%, but operating profit declined slightly, given an unfavorable product mix but also a tough comparison with the prior year period. So, in conclusion, we are pleased to continue to do what we know best, grow sales and margin in businesses with favorable markets, while cutting costs and protecting margins in those businesses where market trends are more challenging. At the same time, especially now that our leverage continues to decline, we should acquire and integrate complementary businesses. Before turning the call to Sue, I want to thank her for her more than 34 years of service to Teledyne, and I wish her very, very well-earned retirement. I will greatly miss her. And finally, I want to congratulate our other executives on their well-deserved promotions announced yesterday, and I and the entire Board are delighted that the same talented group of executives will continue to serve Teledyne's leadership. Sue?\nSue Main: Thank you, Robert, for the kind words, and good morning, everyone. I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert, and then I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2023 outlook. In the third quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $278.2 million. Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $255.2 million in the third quarter of 2023 compared with $252.2 million in 2022. Capital expenditures were $23 million in the third quarter of 2023 compared with $16.7 million in 2022. Depreciation and amortization expense was $76.9 million for the third quarter of 2023 compared with $80.8 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.74 billion of net debt. That is approximately $3.24 billion of debt less cash of $508.6 million. Our stock-based compensation expense was $8 million in the third quarter of 2023 compared with $6.7 million in 2022. Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2023 will be in the range of $4.07 to $4.21 per share with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $4.95 to $5.05. And for the full year 2023, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is now $15.82 and to $15.96. And on a non-GAAP basis, we are raising our outlook to $19.20 to $19.30. Both the fourth quarter and full year non-GAAP outlook excludes estimated pretax charges for further FLIR integration costs. The 2023 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 22.1%. I will now pass the call back to Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Sue. Operator, we'd now like to take questions. If you're ready to proceed with the questions and answers, please go ahead.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go to our first question, it\u2019s coming from Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company.\nJim Ricchiuti: Congratulations, Sue, and congratulations to everyone else, on the new appointments. Robert, maybe a question for you. You talked about the booking strength at FLIR last quarter. And I'm wondering how did that business fare Q3 from a booking standpoint? And what does the near-term outlook look like in the Teledyne FLIR business? And maybe as a follow-up, if you could provide a little bit more color on the overall level of bookings and the various bookings at the segment level. Thank you.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Jim. I would say on the FLIR specific, we're moving up to 0.93, 0.95 at the present time with improvements in the Defense segment. And Defense is going to be over 1 actually for FLIR business. We had an inflection in the Defense businesses there in the second quarter and we have some really good new awards that makes us feel good about that domain. Going to the rest of overall book-to-bill, Jim, I will exclude Engineered Systems because sometimes it would -- big, lumpy orders might increase book-to-bill to 1.4, 1.5 or dropping to 0.6 depending on the quarter. So, if I exclude that, I think we will be over 0.9 at this time. But that is not a big concern at the present because where we have some softness in certain markets, we are gaining traction in markets like energy, defense, healthcare, and that's why our margins are improving. And we're projecting better earnings as we go forward.\nJim Ricchiuti: Got it. And can you give an update on the facilities realignment at FLIR and when do you expect to see the meaningful improvement on margins as it relates to these moves or maybe you're already starting to see some of those benefits?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. Jim, we're already seeing those benefits. First of all, most everything will be done in the March to April time frame. The reductions in force, a majority of them have happened and the rest will happen in the Q4 time frame. The facility closures, transfer of one facility to another, that will happen in early next year. But having said that, coming back to the margins of -- FLIR margins have really improved this quarter, both because of the cost reduction, also because of the mix of businesses that we have and Digital Imaging as a whole, which includes DALSA and e2v. At the end of last quarter, we were looking at perhaps a little margin decrement of 15 basis points. That has not turned around. We expect for the year to be -- margins to be up 20 basis points. So about 35 basis points, 40 basis points improvement over a quarter because of the focus on cost.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Jordan on for Ron. I just had a quick question. Could you guys walk us through any of the exposure you guys have to the Israel-Palestine conflict? And if you're seeing any increase in heritage FLIR program interest or any changes coming from outlays?\nRobert Mehrabian: We have some background. I think, basically, we expect in the long term to have some orders in our defense businesses from that. We have -- we are a supplier, obviously, and we think that the conflict -- unfortunately, the conflict is what it is. But I think I'm not at liberty to disclose, but we have contributed to some of the defense mechanisms that are used by Israel. The other part is that the first thing that will happen is that there'd be a refreshment of the stockpiles in the defense businesses, both because of the conflict in Israel, but also as well as the conflict in Europe. And these are present themselves as obviously long-term opportunities, both the FLIR defense program, but also our Aerospace and Defense segment that has a lot of components and subsystems that go into various products.\nOperator: Next, we go to Joe Giordano with TD Cowen.\nJoe Giordano: Just curious on the management changes that you articulated for January 1st. Is there any real like change in the org structure internally just in terms of how the businesses are going to roll up? You have a COO now. Like, just curious if there's any kind of like structural changes in how the business is going to report.\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. I think that's a good question, Joe. Two things. First, we have one subsegment, which is in the instruments businesses. You remember instruments consists of marine, environmental test and measurement. The marine already refers to George Bobb, the test and measurement and environmental reports to me. Those would begin reporting to George in January. Edwin has been running our biggest segment, which is our Digital Imaging segment. He will continue running that for a while. But as time goes on over the next 12 to 18 months, they will begin harmonizing, George learning more about the Digital Imaging businesses and Edwin learning more about the businesses that George is running at the present time. The resilience to all of this is that I'm not going anywhere. We'll continue to work together, the three of us, also, of course, with others like Jason and Steve Blackwood and Melanie, to make sure that all the assignments, changes happen slowly, orderly and don't offset any of our market leading products that we're focused on. So, I see this as a continuum but one in which both Edwin and George take more responsibility and I move to more to worrying about how to allocate capital with Jason, do more M&A and also improve our margins, which is something we have to do continuously.\nJoe Giordano: I appreciate that color there. If I go over to DI margins, I mean, obviously, that's been a focus area for investors and for you guys. It was pretty substantially higher than maybe what people anticipated this quarter. Curious if there was any kind of one-off type benefits going on this quarter that maybe we have to consider reversing out? And then into next year, we have time before we get there, but I think you guys have been at conferences recently talking about maybe 23% is a good target for next year. Is it early target? You're kind of going to be there now. If you think this year is off of 20 bps, you're kind of going to be almost at 23 for this year. So, does that target not just become that much more conservative? How should we think about that?\nRobert Mehrabian: That's a good one. Actually, you're right. The margins have improved. Right now, we're projecting for the full year '23 to be at 22.7%. So, it's very close to the 23% that you mentioned. Moving further up, of course, that's what we're going to strive for. We have to take a little more cost out in DALSA, e2v as we've done in FLIR, and we're doing that right now. And the other part that I think would affect it is that some of the markets that are declined like semiconductor, automation sensors in our vision systems, those are going to come back and then finally, we have some new markets for our Digital Imaging, for example, inspection of lithium-ion batteries. You remember now, most of that manufacturing is beginning to switch back to North America. And we do have some really good systems for quality control. And you can guess lithium-ion battery, a flaw can be catastrophic. So, these new cameras, new markets will offset some of the declines we have now, but I also think that the semi market will come back. So if all of that takes place, as I've just outlined, obviously, our margins should improve.\nJoe Giordano: If I could just sneak in one last one. If I think about your oscilloscope business, I know that's growing very quickly now on delivery of backlog. But if you think about where orders have been all year, and let's say, we don't -- like absent an inflection in near term in orders, is that a business that likely declines just given where your backlog is and what you're delivering this year, if I think into \u201824?\nRobert Mehrabian: No. I think -- we feel very good about our T&M business. First, remember, as you said, part of it is oscilloscope, part of it is digitizers and very fast-growing part has been our protocol analyzers where we've just made the acquisition, Xena acquisition. The book-to-bill in that business is between 0.94, 0.95 at this time. By the way, in protocols, we don't really see declines. What we see is a little push out because new standards are continuously evolving in our protocols are at the forefront of those standards. So, people will be adapting those. But while those have softened a little bit, oscilloscope, because we are also offering new products, are doing fine. I know that market may not look as exciting now that it has known before, but it is for us. It's very exciting.\nOperator: We will go now to Greg Konrad with Jefferies.\nGreg Konrad: Maybe just to level set the guidance for the year in terms of revenue. I mean, you mentioned industrial automation and laboratory instrumentation softening. But, can you just remind us where FX is the biggest headwind given you said that was half of the impact? Just kind of thinking about the segments for the rest of the year.\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. The FX that I mentioned is versus what we were looking at in July, and things have tightened and it's costing us about 1%. And it's mostly focused in our Digital Imaging and Instrumentation businesses. Having said that, overall, if you look at year-over-year, we do get a little tailwind. But it tightened significantly from our July meeting to today. We'll deal with it, like we deal with any market softening here and there. I mean, basically focus on getting products up where there's a good market, cut costs where we don't have the market, improve our margins, and if we can do what we just did, beat and raise.\nGreg Konrad: And then, the operating discipline definitely comes through. Given those two markets that you did say were deteriorating, how does price play into this? Just thinking about maybe what you're able to capture does that kind of change the pricing equation at all thinking about into year-end?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. I think what we have been able to do is increase prices successfully in businesses that are doing well, like on our Aerospace and Defense businesses or certain parts of our environmental. And for example, marine where we have a really strong market at the present time, we've increased prices. That offsets prices that we have not been able to increase in the environmental area. So, it changes across our portfolio up and down. But generally, we are successful in raising prices across the board, we have been this year versus let's say last year. And we think that sustainability that's happening for our businesses will allow us to increase prices but more modestly going forward than we have aspirations for. But if things turn around, we'll do it.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to Andrew Buscaglia with BNP. Go ahead, please.\nAndrew Buscaglia: So maybe -- you guys mentioned, or Robert, you mentioned your book-to-bill is just over 0.9, which is not too inspiring, heading into 2024. But you talked about some optimism in some areas, like Digital Imaging, some of those markets coming back. I'm wondering, can you comment on your expectations heading into the new year? Last quarter, you talked about backlog possibly or defense backlog converting into Q4. And you're sounding more optimistic around new awards as well materializing. So, I'm just wondering, can that book-to-bill change on us heading into the new year, or how are you feeling going into January, February?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. I think, to cut to the chase, we still have over $3 billion of backlog, which is very healthy. There are some short-cycle businesses that there have obviously been short cycles, especially in the environmental area, as an example. 0.9, 0.93 does not bother me, only because we have also a slew of new products that are coming to market. For example, just take going back to FLIR Defense, we just introduced a new nano-drone called the Black Hornet 4, which can go twice as high as the one we have, which is Black Hornet 3, was only 10,000 feet. This can go up to 20,000 feet, last longer, be a lot more -- do a lot of other things. We also have new programs in counter-UAS. And the other thing that is exciting for us that we're just starting to get some traction on is understanding where we can bring our intelligence systems, if you want to call it, artificial intelligence, to bear. We have now about $250 million to $300 million of products that are benefiting from not just being sensors but being systems, cameras that provide intelligent information. So, it doesn't bother me, the slight decrement in backlog. It's primarily because certain parts of the market, like semiconductor is done. But all semiconductor inclusive across Teledyne is less than 10%. So, it doesn't bother me. I think the more important thing is, can we just keep bringing new products and make the acquisitions that we are now able to do because our leverage is down and do what we've always done, acquire, integrate and increase our earnings per share.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Yes. Okay. Well, that dovetails into my next question around M&A. With your leverage now back below 2ish, what are you seeing in the pipeline for next year? And then, maybe if you don't see M&A materialize, what are your thoughts on share repurchase just given where your valuation is?\nRobert Mehrabian: I'll answer the M&A question. Share repurchase is something that we haven't done. We've only purchased shares I'm going to say, 10, 12 years ago about $400 million, when you look at our market cap versus that very small fraction. I think our M&A opportunities are there. We're looking at smaller acquisitions at the present time with one or two what I'll call, midsize, several hundred million dollar acquisitions in the potential pipeline. The one thing we have to be careful about is there's some really outrageous prices that people are paying for some of the acquisitions we've looked at. multiples of sales going 15 times. And that's just not us. Well, we are looking at smaller acquisitions, both here and in Europe and they'll come along just like we've done before, what we call the string of pearls, and we will make those acquisitions. If we don't make any acquisitions on the flip side, by the end of next year, our leverage ratio would be 1, which was actually less than that before the FLIR acquisition. And cash also will help our earnings, but our primary focus is going to be acquisitions.\nOperator: Next, we go to Rob Jamieson with UBS.\nRob Jamieson: Just a couple. Can we run through the segment -- each segment and what you're embedding for organic and margin expectations just for the rest of the year? And then also, just hit on your net leverage comment there. Is it safe to kind of assume that you guys are going to be able to produce above like maybe $1 billion in free cash flow in '24?\nRobert Mehrabian: Let me answer the last question first. We're right in the middle of our planning cycle for our operating plan and made presentations to our Board yesterday, and the answer is yes. Let me now go back to the organic question that you asked for this year. Fundamentally, we're going to have -- organically, we're going to be relatively flat in our overall Digital Imaging business, maybe a little -- a percent down, but that's partly because we're also cleaning up some stuff that are not profitable. On the other hand, we will have organic growth of almost 6% in our Instrumentation businesses, which, as I said, is environmental, test and measurement, and marine. We're going to have similarly, over 6% in our Aerospace and Defense organic growth, and about 8% in our Engineered Systems. So, those are very healthy growths for this environment that we're all experiencing.\nRob Jamieson: And then, I guess, just one specific to test and measurement. You said you had a new protocol product that was coming to market in September. Just wondering what the uptake is and how customers are reacting to that? And is that -- could that be an incremental benefit to that sliver of instrumentation in fourth quarter?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. The new protocol is the PCI Express Gen 7. The life cycle of that is usually a couple of years. I think we'll see some benefit from that next year, probably later next year. But the flip side is the protocol business that we just bought, Xena is fulfilling a gap that we had in our protocol businesses, which was the high-speed network protocols, and they fill that gap very well. So we love our protocol businesses and hope that we can buy more of them as time goes on.\nOperator: Next, we go to Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley.\nKristine Liwag: Congratulations on the leadership changes. Robert, I hope that this change means you get some extra free time.\nRobert Mehrabian: I hope so, too. I have my new leaders shaking their head, across the table from me, but I hope I will. Yes. Thank you, Kristine.\nKristine Liwag: Well, great, and it's been wonderful to follow your career and what you've done for Teledyne. So, maybe with the leadership changes, I mean, sometimes there's also a change in strategic focus. I mean, Teledyne is a much broader and bigger company than it was over 20 years ago. You mentioned earlier that M&A is still a priority over share buybacks. I guess, as we look out the next 5, 10 or even 20 years and maybe that question is a little too broad of a scope for this call, but how do we think about the strategic direction for Teledyne? Like where to from here?\nRobert Mehrabian: Well, first, let me answer the first question. The way we operate in the current Teledyne is a lot of the M&A ideas come from our businesses. Now, we are proactive. At any one time, we have a large funnel of businesses that we're looking at. But that will not change because it comes from Digital Imaging, it comes from Instrumentation and marine and A&D. And these are areas that the two leaders that are taking over are responsible for. So I don't think in the short term, things will change. Also in the short term, at least, I'm still going to be here. And of course, Jason helps make a lot of the capital allocation decisions. But having said that, we will probably focus more on commercial businesses as we go forward. And we will get some defense businesses, but we don't want our defense businesses to grow beyond where they are today. We have a healthy balance of 25% defense, 75% commercial. Almost half or 47% of our commercial businesses are overseas. We're also expanding some defense business in the NATO countries and the Middle East. But having said that, I think my colleagues and I agree that we do not want to change our portfolio from what it is today to something that is not sustainable. If you're singularly focused on one market, when that market suffers, then it takes the whole company down. Our balanced portfolio is our resilience and our ability to tolerate changes. And as you can see, while we have some weakness in certain areas, we have strength in other areas. We have growth in instruments, in A&D, Engineered Systems. And so I don't think that will change. Now I'm talking about three years. If you go beyond that, then I can't predict, because the world is changing so much right now. I mean, it's such a difficult environment in some cases. It will depend on what happens and our strategies will evolve.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We have one more in queue at this time. We're going now to Noah Poponak. Please go ahead.\nNoah Poponak: Congratulations to everybody on the new seats or responsibilities. Robert, I just want to go back to the DI margin. You just printed a number that you previously said you would get to in two years. It sounds like you're saying the majority of the explanation for that is that you performed an incremental cost out. And so, if that's the driver, wouldn't that kind of sustain in the margin from here? And therefore, why would that margin pull back from the level that you just reported?\nRobert Mehrabian: I mentioned the margin for the year of 22.7% in DI, which is 35 basis higher than it was what I quoted in Q2 -- at the end of Q2. What has happened is that the cost out is important because it's not just people, it's the consolidation of our facilities as well. We have not done that. We were all focused on, at first, fixing our export control issues, fixing our tax liabilities. We're still working on tax liabilities somewhat. But what's happening is that the defense business at Digital Imaging, specifically FLIR, are getting better. And machine vision, while it's getting worse at the present time, it sooner or later is going to have to come back. And so, I was a little cautious about for next year when I was asked about the margins, and I stayed with the 22.7%, maybe 22%. But over the long term, there's no reason that these margins in these businesses could not be like margins in our Aerospace and Defense, which we're predicting this year to be 27.6% or our instruments with our 26.1%. There's no reason that margins cannot improve and get there.\nNoah Poponak: Okay. That's helpful context. I understood part of the challenge to be that there's been volatility in defense outlays compared to what's been authorized at the end market level. And so, with regard to your defense business inside of Digital Imaging, you were gearing up for higher defense revenue that then just kind of surprisingly didn't come through. And so, did that come through in the third quarter, or what was the growth rate, I guess, in the defense piece of Digital Imaging in the quarter?\nRobert Mehrabian: We have several large programs that came through in the third quarter. And large -- for us things are below -- above $10 million, $20 million, for example. We got some counter unmanned vehicle systems that we partnered with Kongsberg. That was a nice win in Q3. We've also penetrated some of our nano-drones are now moving into India. We had a nice award from there. Also, our surveillance program, we had to straighten out some of the issues with our gimbals and vibration and products that we inherited. We straightened those out, and we have now a Navy award that's about $35 million. So surveillance grew in Q3. And I think with the many drones and our newer products, we think we\u2019ll do fine. Our unmanned programs we expect to grow in Q4. Overall, what we've been able to do is really take the non-profitable stuff-up, consolidate facilities that shouldn't have been separate to begin with, focus on the things that we can deliver, unmanned systems using our own sensors. Other people have unmanned systems to various conflicts that use our sensors. So we're happy to send them our sensors, but we also can incorporate them in our system. So, we kind of think that the defense business there in DI has had an inflection point and is really turning positive now.\nNoah Poponak: Okay. That's helpful. And then just one last one in DI. What do you now expect the rate of decline to be for the year in the machine vision piece? And do you have enough order book or visibility to have a sense for what that revenue does in '24, or is it too short cycle?\nRobert Mehrabian: I think, overall, we're going to see an increase in revenue in DALSA, e2v part of DI, as much as 6% with some of it coming from acquisitions. In the other part of DI, which would be FLIR, we expect that we may have slight decline, let's say, to 1.839 -- 1.834 let\u2019s say from 1.84 what was then 1.86 last year, which is very minor. And some of that comes from Raymarine, where we -- consumer products that are more discretionary at this time. But overall, I don't see a huge decline in Digital Imaging because DALSA, e2v has grown. And we are weathering the downturn in some of our other commercial products very well. And then we, of course, have some really good upside in things like healthcare, where markets, even in, let's say, in Q3, we had almost 12% increase in revenue in that area. So, it's balanced.\nNoah Poponak: Sorry. Those comments are on total Digital Imaging revenue, you're saying?\nRobert Mehrabian: Total Digital Imaging revenue. Yes.\nNoah Poponak: Okay. I appreciate that. I just -- so it's clear. I was asking on just machine vision within Digital Imaging.\nRobert Mehrabian: Just machine vision?\nNoah Poponak: Yes.\nRobert Mehrabian: Okay. There's different parts of it. There's a machine vision at DALSA, e2v and there's some machine vision in FLIR. I haven't added those two together. If I were to add those two together, I'd say, the full year might be down 2%. But again, could be a little higher, but it doesn't bother me that much, Noah, only because, as I mentioned before, we have new products like in battery inspection, and we're more emphasizing our ability to put some information and intelligence in our devices, cameras, a move up market. So, this market is going to turn. It's not going to stay where it is. Semiconductor is not going to stay down forever. And I think we're well positioned for growth once those turn a little bit.\nNoah Poponak: Yes. That's interesting. It's much different than the peer set. So, yes, it seems well positioned. Okay. All right. Well, thanks again. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you very much, Noah.\nOperator: And we have no additional questions in queue at this time.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, operator. I'll now ask Jason to conclude our conference call.\nJason VanWees: Thanks, Robert. And again, thanks everyone for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to call me. Number is on the earnings release or of course, send me an e-mail. And all the press releases are available on our website as is the replay.

            "content": "Thank you, Jason, and good morning and thank you for joining our earnings call. These are exciting times for Teledyne. We have new leadership coming in, but we also have continuity and resilience in our programs, in our operations and our ability to meet what we say we would do in our earnings. In the third quarter, as example, we achieved record operating margin and earnings per share. GAAP operating margin of 18.8% was a third quarter record. On a non-GAAP basis, the operating margin was 22.8%, which was an all time record for any quarter. Likewise, GAAP earnings per share of $14.15 (sic) [$4.15] was a third quarter record and non-GAAP earnings per share of $5.05 was an all-time record for Teledyne. Compared to last year, GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins increased 119 and 86 basis points, respectively, and both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share increased approximately 11%. Our overall third quarter performance was led by growth in our marine, medical, aerospace and certain defense businesses, coupled with vigilant cost control. There was, however, some deterioration in certain end markets such as industrial automation and laboratory instrumentation. Nevertheless, given our focus on operational excellence, operating margins increased, both sequentially and year-over-year in Digital Imaging and Instrumentation segments, helping generate record earnings. Given continued debt repayment through September, which totaled about $680 million year-to-date, our consolidated leverage ratio declined to just under 2 times. And finally, we're pleased to have added Xena Networks to our test and measurement businesses which also continued to perform very well in a challenging environment. In terms of our outlook, we now see total sales for 2023 growth of about 4% or a little less than the second half versus our July outlook with the fourth quarter sales being roughly $1.45 billion. Approximately half of this change in incremental -- is due to incremental currency translation headwind from July to now, and the balance being further deterioration in industrial automation and laboratory instrumentation markets mentioned earlier. However, given the strong margin and earnings achieved in the third quarter, we're raising our non-GAAP earnings outlook to $19.25 at the midpoint from a prior outlook of $19.10. I will now further comment on the performance of our four segments. Third quarter sales in our Digital Imaging segment were flat compared to last year. Sales of x-ray products, infrared imaging detectors and surveillance system increased year-over-year but were offset by lower sales of unmanned ground systems, and micro-electro-mechanical systems or MEMS. Sales of commercial marine hardware and software were flat, but declined organically. Finally, cameras and sensors for industrial automation declined compared to last year. Like Teledyne as a whole, the Digital Imaging business portfolio is exceptionally well balanced across market segments and geographies. With the help of bolt-on acquisitions and growth in our medical and defense markets, we were able to offset declines in industrial automation and its -- and the small portion of our overall portfolio that is associated with consumer discretionary spending. Despite of the flat revenue, margins performance improved considerably to record levels with the FLIR businesses collectively slightly higher than segment average margins. Turning to our Instrumentation businesses. This segment consists of marine instruments, test and measurement and environmental instruments. Overall, third quarter sales in Instrumentation segment increased 7.4% versus last year. Sales of marine instruments increased 20.5% in the quarter, primarily due to ongoing recovery in offshore energy markets and also greater sales of acoustic imaging systems. Sales of electronic test and measurement systems, which includes oscilloscopes, digitizers and protocol analyzers, collectively increased 2.5%. We continue to see some softness in sales of analyzers for electronic storage and data center application. But, this was more than offset by sales of devices for wireless and video protocols as well as continued strong sales of oscilloscopes. Demand for high-speed networking customers remains very healthy, and we see the Xena acquisition, enhancing our offerings in this market. Sales of environmental instruments decreased slightly compared to last year, with sales of air quality and gas and flame safety analyzers offsetting some decline in drug discovery and laboratory instruments. Overall, Instrumentation segment operating profit increased over 20% in the third quarter with GAAP operating margins increasing 277 basis points to 26% and 253 basis points on a non-GAAP basis to 27%. These were all-time records for this segment. Third quarter sales in our Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment increased 8.1%, driven by growth both in defense electronics and aerospace -- commercial aerospace products. GAAP and non-GAAP operating profit increased 11.5% with margins 81 basis points greater than last year. Finally, in the Engineering Systems segment, third quarter revenue increased 4.1%, but operating profit declined slightly, given an unfavorable product mix but also a tough comparison with the prior year period. So, in conclusion, we are pleased to continue to do what we know best, grow sales and margin in businesses with favorable markets, while cutting costs and protecting margins in those businesses where market trends are more challenging. At the same time, especially now that our leverage continues to decline, we should acquire and integrate complementary businesses. Before turning the call to Sue, I want to thank her for her more than 34 years of service to Teledyne, and I wish her very, very well-earned retirement. I will greatly miss her. And finally, I want to congratulate our other executives on their well-deserved promotions announced yesterday, and I and the entire Board are delighted that the same talented group of executives will continue to serve Teledyne's leadership. Sue? Thank you, Sue. Operator, we'd now like to take questions. If you're ready to proceed with the questions and answers, please go ahead. Thank you, Jim. I would say on the FLIR specific, we're moving up to 0.93, 0.95 at the present time with improvements in the Defense segment. And Defense is going to be over 1 actually for FLIR business. We had an inflection in the Defense businesses there in the second quarter and we have some really good new awards that makes us feel good about that domain. Going to the rest of overall book-to-bill, Jim, I will exclude Engineered Systems because sometimes it would -- big, lumpy orders might increase book-to-bill to 1.4, 1.5 or dropping to 0.6 depending on the quarter. So, if I exclude that, I think we will be over 0.9 at this time. But that is not a big concern at the present because where we have some softness in certain markets, we are gaining traction in markets like energy, defense, healthcare, and that's why our margins are improving. And we're projecting better earnings as we go forward. Yes. Jim, we're already seeing those benefits. First of all, most everything will be done in the March to April time frame. The reductions in force, a majority of them have happened and the rest will happen in the Q4 time frame. The facility closures, transfer of one facility to another, that will happen in early next year. But having said that, coming back to the margins of -- FLIR margins have really improved this quarter, both because of the cost reduction, also because of the mix of businesses that we have and Digital Imaging as a whole, which includes DALSA and e2v. At the end of last quarter, we were looking at perhaps a little margin decrement of 15 basis points. That has not turned around. We expect for the year to be -- margins to be up 20 basis points. So about 35 basis points, 40 basis points improvement over a quarter because of the focus on cost. We have some background. I think, basically, we expect in the long term to have some orders in our defense businesses from that. We have -- we are a supplier, obviously, and we think that the conflict -- unfortunately, the conflict is what it is. But I think I'm not at liberty to disclose, but we have contributed to some of the defense mechanisms that are used by Israel. The other part is that the first thing that will happen is that there'd be a refreshment of the stockpiles in the defense businesses, both because of the conflict in Israel, but also as well as the conflict in Europe. And these are present themselves as obviously long-term opportunities, both the FLIR defense program, but also our Aerospace and Defense segment that has a lot of components and subsystems that go into various products. Yes. I think that's a good question, Joe. Two things. First, we have one subsegment, which is in the instruments businesses. You remember instruments consists of marine, environmental test and measurement. The marine already refers to George Bobb, the test and measurement and environmental reports to me. Those would begin reporting to George in January. Edwin has been running our biggest segment, which is our Digital Imaging segment. He will continue running that for a while. But as time goes on over the next 12 to 18 months, they will begin harmonizing, George learning more about the Digital Imaging businesses and Edwin learning more about the businesses that George is running at the present time. The resilience to all of this is that I'm not going anywhere. We'll continue to work together, the three of us, also, of course, with others like Jason and Steve Blackwood and Melanie, to make sure that all the assignments, changes happen slowly, orderly and don't offset any of our market leading products that we're focused on. So, I see this as a continuum but one in which both Edwin and George take more responsibility and I move to more to worrying about how to allocate capital with Jason, do more M&A and also improve our margins, which is something we have to do continuously. That's a good one. Actually, you're right. The margins have improved. Right now, we're projecting for the full year '23 to be at 22.7%. So, it's very close to the 23% that you mentioned. Moving further up, of course, that's what we're going to strive for. We have to take a little more cost out in DALSA, e2v as we've done in FLIR, and we're doing that right now. And the other part that I think would affect it is that some of the markets that are declined like semiconductor, automation sensors in our vision systems, those are going to come back and then finally, we have some new markets for our Digital Imaging, for example, inspection of lithium-ion batteries. You remember now, most of that manufacturing is beginning to switch back to North America. And we do have some really good systems for quality control. And you can guess lithium-ion battery, a flaw can be catastrophic. So, these new cameras, new markets will offset some of the declines we have now, but I also think that the semi market will come back. So if all of that takes place, as I've just outlined, obviously, our margins should improve. No. I think -- we feel very good about our T&M business. First, remember, as you said, part of it is oscilloscope, part of it is digitizers and very fast-growing part has been our protocol analyzers where we've just made the acquisition, Xena acquisition. The book-to-bill in that business is between 0.94, 0.95 at this time. By the way, in protocols, we don't really see declines. What we see is a little push out because new standards are continuously evolving in our protocols are at the forefront of those standards. So, people will be adapting those. But while those have softened a little bit, oscilloscope, because we are also offering new products, are doing fine. I know that market may not look as exciting now that it has known before, but it is for us. It's very exciting. Yes. The FX that I mentioned is versus what we were looking at in July, and things have tightened and it's costing us about 1%. And it's mostly focused in our Digital Imaging and Instrumentation businesses. Having said that, overall, if you look at year-over-year, we do get a little tailwind. But it tightened significantly from our July meeting to today. We'll deal with it, like we deal with any market softening here and there. I mean, basically focus on getting products up where there's a good market, cut costs where we don't have the market, improve our margins, and if we can do what we just did, beat and raise. Yes. I think what we have been able to do is increase prices successfully in businesses that are doing well, like on our Aerospace and Defense businesses or certain parts of our environmental. And for example, marine where we have a really strong market at the present time, we've increased prices. That offsets prices that we have not been able to increase in the environmental area. So, it changes across our portfolio up and down. But generally, we are successful in raising prices across the board, we have been this year versus let's say last year. And we think that sustainability that's happening for our businesses will allow us to increase prices but more modestly going forward than we have aspirations for. But if things turn around, we'll do it. Yes. I think, to cut to the chase, we still have over $3 billion of backlog, which is very healthy. There are some short-cycle businesses that there have obviously been short cycles, especially in the environmental area, as an example. 0.9, 0.93 does not bother me, only because we have also a slew of new products that are coming to market. For example, just take going back to FLIR Defense, we just introduced a new nano-drone called the Black Hornet 4, which can go twice as high as the one we have, which is Black Hornet 3, was only 10,000 feet. This can go up to 20,000 feet, last longer, be a lot more -- do a lot of other things. We also have new programs in counter-UAS. And the other thing that is exciting for us that we're just starting to get some traction on is understanding where we can bring our intelligence systems, if you want to call it, artificial intelligence, to bear. We have now about $250 million to $300 million of products that are benefiting from not just being sensors but being systems, cameras that provide intelligent information. So, it doesn't bother me, the slight decrement in backlog. It's primarily because certain parts of the market, like semiconductor is done. But all semiconductor inclusive across Teledyne is less than 10%. So, it doesn't bother me. I think the more important thing is, can we just keep bringing new products and make the acquisitions that we are now able to do because our leverage is down and do what we've always done, acquire, integrate and increase our earnings per share. I'll answer the M&A question. Share repurchase is something that we haven't done. We've only purchased shares I'm going to say, 10, 12 years ago about $400 million, when you look at our market cap versus that very small fraction. I think our M&A opportunities are there. We're looking at smaller acquisitions at the present time with one or two what I'll call, midsize, several hundred million dollar acquisitions in the potential pipeline. The one thing we have to be careful about is there's some really outrageous prices that people are paying for some of the acquisitions we've looked at. multiples of sales going 15 times. And that's just not us. Well, we are looking at smaller acquisitions, both here and in Europe and they'll come along just like we've done before, what we call the string of pearls, and we will make those acquisitions. If we don't make any acquisitions on the flip side, by the end of next year, our leverage ratio would be 1, which was actually less than that before the FLIR acquisition. And cash also will help our earnings, but our primary focus is going to be acquisitions. Let me answer the last question first. We're right in the middle of our planning cycle for our operating plan and made presentations to our Board yesterday, and the answer is yes. Let me now go back to the organic question that you asked for this year. Fundamentally, we're going to have -- organically, we're going to be relatively flat in our overall Digital Imaging business, maybe a little -- a percent down, but that's partly because we're also cleaning up some stuff that are not profitable. On the other hand, we will have organic growth of almost 6% in our Instrumentation businesses, which, as I said, is environmental, test and measurement, and marine. We're going to have similarly, over 6% in our Aerospace and Defense organic growth, and about 8% in our Engineered Systems. So, those are very healthy growths for this environment that we're all experiencing. Yes. The new protocol is the PCI Express Gen 7. The life cycle of that is usually a couple of years. I think we'll see some benefit from that next year, probably later next year. But the flip side is the protocol business that we just bought, Xena is fulfilling a gap that we had in our protocol businesses, which was the high-speed network protocols, and they fill that gap very well. So we love our protocol businesses and hope that we can buy more of them as time goes on. I hope so, too. I have my new leaders shaking their head, across the table from me, but I hope I will. Yes. Thank you, Kristine. Well, first, let me answer the first question. The way we operate in the current Teledyne is a lot of the M&A ideas come from our businesses. Now, we are proactive. At any one time, we have a large funnel of businesses that we're looking at. But that will not change because it comes from Digital Imaging, it comes from Instrumentation and marine and A&D. And these are areas that the two leaders that are taking over are responsible for. So I don't think in the short term, things will change. Also in the short term, at least, I'm still going to be here. And of course, Jason helps make a lot of the capital allocation decisions. But having said that, we will probably focus more on commercial businesses as we go forward. And we will get some defense businesses, but we don't want our defense businesses to grow beyond where they are today. We have a healthy balance of 25% defense, 75% commercial. Almost half or 47% of our commercial businesses are overseas. We're also expanding some defense business in the NATO countries and the Middle East. But having said that, I think my colleagues and I agree that we do not want to change our portfolio from what it is today to something that is not sustainable. If you're singularly focused on one market, when that market suffers, then it takes the whole company down. Our balanced portfolio is our resilience and our ability to tolerate changes. And as you can see, while we have some weakness in certain areas, we have strength in other areas. We have growth in instruments, in A&D, Engineered Systems. And so I don't think that will change. Now I'm talking about three years. If you go beyond that, then I can't predict, because the world is changing so much right now. I mean, it's such a difficult environment in some cases. It will depend on what happens and our strategies will evolve. I mentioned the margin for the year of 22.7% in DI, which is 35 basis higher than it was what I quoted in Q2 -- at the end of Q2. What has happened is that the cost out is important because it's not just people, it's the consolidation of our facilities as well. We have not done that. We were all focused on, at first, fixing our export control issues, fixing our tax liabilities. We're still working on tax liabilities somewhat. But what's happening is that the defense business at Digital Imaging, specifically FLIR, are getting better. And machine vision, while it's getting worse at the present time, it sooner or later is going to have to come back. And so, I was a little cautious about for next year when I was asked about the margins, and I stayed with the 22.7%, maybe 22%. But over the long term, there's no reason that these margins in these businesses could not be like margins in our Aerospace and Defense, which we're predicting this year to be 27.6% or our instruments with our 26.1%. There's no reason that margins cannot improve and get there. We have several large programs that came through in the third quarter. And large -- for us things are below -- above $10 million, $20 million, for example. We got some counter unmanned vehicle systems that we partnered with Kongsberg. That was a nice win in Q3. We've also penetrated some of our nano-drones are now moving into India. We had a nice award from there. Also, our surveillance program, we had to straighten out some of the issues with our gimbals and vibration and products that we inherited. We straightened those out, and we have now a Navy award that's about $35 million. So surveillance grew in Q3. And I think with the many drones and our newer products, we think we'll do fine. Our unmanned programs we expect to grow in Q4. Overall, what we've been able to do is really take the non-profitable stuff-up, consolidate facilities that shouldn't have been separate to begin with, focus on the things that we can deliver, unmanned systems using our own sensors. Other people have unmanned systems to various conflicts that use our sensors. So we're happy to send them our sensors, but we also can incorporate them in our system. So, we kind of think that the defense business there in DI has had an inflection point and is really turning positive now. I think, overall, we're going to see an increase in revenue in DALSA, e2v part of DI, as much as 6% with some of it coming from acquisitions. In the other part of DI, which would be FLIR, we expect that we may have slight decline, let's say, to 1.839 -- 1.834 let's say from 1.84 what was then 1.86 last year, which is very minor. And some of that comes from Raymarine, where we -- consumer products that are more discretionary at this time. But overall, I don't see a huge decline in Digital Imaging because DALSA, e2v has grown. And we are weathering the downturn in some of our other commercial products very well. And then we, of course, have some really good upside in things like healthcare, where markets, even in, let's say, in Q3, we had almost 12% increase in revenue in that area. So, it's balanced. Total Digital Imaging revenue. Yes. Just machine vision? Okay. There's different parts of it. There's a machine vision at DALSA, e2v and there's some machine vision in FLIR. I haven't added those two together. If I were to add those two together, I'd say, the full year might be down 2%. But again, could be a little higher, but it doesn't bother me that much, Noah, only because, as I mentioned before, we have new products like in battery inspection, and we're more emphasizing our ability to put some information and intelligence in our devices, cameras, a move up market. So, this market is going to turn. It's not going to stay where it is. Semiconductor is not going to stay down forever. And I think we're well positioned for growth once those turn a little bit. Thank you very much, Noah. Thank you, operator. I'll now ask Jason to conclude our conference call."

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert, and then I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2023 outlook. In the third quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $278.2 million. Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $255.2 million in the third quarter of 2023 compared with $252.2 million in 2022. Capital expenditures were $23 million in the third quarter of 2023 compared with $16.7 million in 2022. Depreciation and amortization expense was $76.9 million for the third quarter of 2023 compared with $80.8 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.74 billion of net debt. That is approximately $3.24 billion of debt less cash of $508.6 million. Our stock-based compensation expense was $8 million in the third quarter of 2023 compared with $6.7 million in 2022. Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2023 will be in the range of $4.07 to $4.21 per share with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $4.95 to $5.05. And for the full year 2023, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is now $15.82 and to $15.96. And on a non-GAAP basis, we are raising our outlook to $19.20 to $19.30. Both the fourth quarter and full year non-GAAP outlook excludes estimated pretax charges for further FLIR integration costs. The 2023 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 22.1%. I will now pass the call back to Robert."

[Operator Instructions] At this time, it's my pleasure to turn the conference over to our host, Jason VanWees. Please go ahead.\nJason VanWees: Thank you, Dom. This is Jason VanWees, Vice Chairman. I'd like to welcome everyone to Teledyne's second quarter 2023 earnings release conference call. We released our earnings earlier this morning before the market opened. Joining me today are Teledyne's Chairman, President and CEO, Robert Mehrabian; Senior Vice President and CFO, Sue Main; and Senior Vice President and General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, Melanie Cibik. Also joining is Edwin Roks, Executive VP. After remarks by Robert and Sue, we will ask for your questions. Of course, though, before we get started, our attorneys have reminded me to tell you that all forward-looking statements made this morning are subject to various assumptions, risks and caveats as noted in our earnings release and our periodic SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially. In order to avoid potential selective disclosures, this call is simultaneously being webcast and a replay, both via webcast and dial-in, will be available for approximately one month. Here is Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Jason and thank you for joining our earnings call. In the second quarter, we achieved all-time record quarterly sales, with overall sales increasing 5.1%. Furthermore, sales as well as GAAP and non-GAAP operating profit and operating margin increased year-over-year in every segment. For the total company, GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins increased 105 and 73 basis points, respectively. Excluding foreign currency headwind, which negatively impacted second quarter sales growth by approximately 40 basis points, growth in local currency would have been 5.5%. GAAP operating margin of 18% was a second quarter record and non-GAAP operating margin was 21.4%. Second quarter GAAP earnings per share were $3.87 and non-GAAP earnings of $4.67 were also second quarter records. And finally, including continued debt repayment through July, which totaled about $620 million year-to-date, our consolidated leverage ratio declined to 2.1x. I'll now comment a bit further on the performance of Teledyne flare and the announced cost reductions and the outlook for the balance of the year. In the 2 years, since we've owned FLIR, we've resolved the most significant legacy tax matters, exited the consent agreement with the Department of State, consolidated leadership in marketing and operations for the FLIR Defense portfolio and corrected some historical product quality issues. As part of this effort, we also took a much more focused view of the Defense business, aggressively pursuing those opportunities where we have truly differentiated technology. I am pleased to report that the order book and backlog of FLIR, specialty FLIR Defense, significantly inflected during the second quarter. For reference, the commercial business across digital imaging, both DALSA to FLIR grew organically in the second quarter. While FLIR Defense sales declined year-over-year, nearly all of this was lower revenue in unmanned ground systems as we achieved the milestone of shipping our 1,000th man transportable robotic system increment to, to the U.S. Army. Overall, orders at all of FLIR were 1.18x sales and 1.5x sales at FLIR Defense. Large orders not only included the recently announced Black Hornet Nano UAV to the U.S. Military but also additional UAVs for customers in Europe as well as counter UAV systems and missile systems utilizing both FLIR imaging, radar and AI-based software systems. Additionally, more surveillance imaging systems for the U.S. and foreign customers. Having stabilized the business, including achieving stronger backlog, it is not time to focus on execution and additional margin improvement. Thus, the charges announced this morning are for the further reduction in the FLIR operating footprint and related headcount. We are exciting the elimination of 3 lease sites, all of those activities will be relocated to other FLIR Defense facilities, most of which are locates. Today, we are reaffirming our prior 2023 full year sales and non-GAAP earnings outlook, including -- excluding the $10 million to $12 million charges that -- covered. Supply chain challenges have continued to improve and we were once again able to exceed our original second quarter sales and earnings outlook by pulling forward some revenue from the third quarter. On revenue specifically, we continue to see total 2023 growth of approximately 5% or sales of approximately $5.73 billion, with the third quarter being roughly $1.4 billion. We continue to see non-GAAP earnings of $19.10 at the midpoint of our guidance, excluding the charges referenced above. I will now further comment on the performance of the 4 business segments. Second quarter sales, in our Digital Imaging segment, increased 2.3% with greater sales of X-ray products, commercial infrared imaging components and solutions and industrial scientific cameras partially offset by lower sales of unmanned ground systems for Defense applications. GAAP segment operating margin increased 51 basis points to 15.7% and adjusted for reduced the intangible asset amortization non-GAAP segment margin was 28 basis points higher at 21.5%. Turning to our Instrumentation segment. Overall, second quarter sales increased 5.1% versus last year. Sales of Marine instruments increased a healthy 10.5% in the quarter, primarily due to ongoing recovery in offshore energy markets, also greater sales of autonomous underwater vehicles. Sales of electronic test and measurement systems, which include oscilloscopes, digitizers and protocol analyzers, collectively increased 4.9%. We encountered some softness in sales of analyzers for electronic storage and data center application but this was more than offset by [indiscernible] for wireless and video protocols as well as continued strong sales of oscilloscopes. Sales of environmental instruments were flat compared to last year with greater sales of air quality, process gas, safety analyzers offset by drug discovery and laboratory instruments. Overall, instrumentation segment operating profit increased 10.6% in the second quarter, with GAAP operating margin increasing 123 basis points to 24.8% and 80 basis points on a non-GAAP basis, excluding reduced intangible asset amortization to 25.9%. In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, second quarter sales increased 10.2%, driven by growth of both Defense Electronics and Commercial Aerospace products. GAAP and non-GAAP segment operating profit increased over 20% with margins approximately 250 basis points greater than last year. In the Engineering Systems segment, second quarter revenue increased 18.5% and operating profit increased 33.7%, representing 112 basis points increase in margin from last year. In conclusion, our short-term, more economically sensitive businesses remained resilient in the second quarter, collectively growing year-over-year, although comparisons for some do become more difficult in the second half. In addition, our longer Cycle Medical, Aerospace, Defense and Marine businesses continued to perform very well. Quarterly operating margin in our Instrumentation segment was an all-time record. Operating margin in our Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment was the second quarter record and just slightly less than the fourth quarter of last year. And now through a combination of sales growth, operating leverage and the more aggressive cost actions mentioned earlier, I fully expect digital imaging margins to grow considerably over time. And now I'm going to turn the call over to Sue.\nSue Main: Thank you, Robert and good morning, everyone. I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and then I will discuss our third quarter and full year 2023 outlook. In the second quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $190.5 million. Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures was $163.2 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared with $176.1 million in 2022. Capital expenditures were $27.3 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared with $20.8 million in 2022. Depreciation and amortization expense was $80 million for the second quarter of 2023 compared with $82.7 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.99 billion of net debt. That is approximately $3.35 billion of debt less cash of $364.2 million. Stock-based compensation expense was $8.4 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared with $6.4 million in 2022. Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the third quarter of 2023 will be in the range of $3.76 to $3.90 per share, with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $4.70 to $4.80. And for the full year 2023, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $15.60 to $15.88. And on a non-GAAP basis, we are maintaining our prior outlook of $19 to $19.20. Both the third quarter and full year non-GAAP outlook excludes estimated pretax charges for further FLIR integration costs, the 2023 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 22.3%. I'll now pass the call back to Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you very much, Sue. We would now like to take your questions. Operator, if you're ready to proceed with the questions and answers, please go ahead.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from the line of Jim Ricchiuti.\nJim Ricchiuti: I wanted to talk a little bit, Robert, if I may, about digital imaging. If we exclude the acquisitions, it looks like your revenues were down year-on-year and sequentially. And some of this may be partly due to what you're seeing at FLIR. But I wonder if you could just expand on what you're seeing in digital imaging just because it's a large category that covers a lot of ground?\nRobert Mehrabian: Well, thank you. I think what you're referring to is in the organic growth or decline year-over-year was a little over 1% decline -- 1.5% to be exact. We see several things: First, there are government programs that we have in digital imaging, especially in FLIR, that declined year-over-year. On the other hand, as I mentioned, we had a very successful first half, especially second quarter, in getting orders for products both here and in Europe. So we feel that, that part of the business is stabilized. On the rest of digital imaging, if you look at health care, which is part of our business there, there's been significant expansion in health care and medical. If you look at commercial aero, any parts of digital imaging that deal with, let's say, satellite communication there has been expansion. I think there is some headwind in the commercial part of digital imaging in the Far East but our exposure there is not that high. And we're making that up with new products in -- that includes some of our artificial intelligence capabilities. So we feel comfortable with our commercial aspect of our Digital Imaging. So in summary, I would say that -- there is a little pressure on parts of our digital imaging in the Far East, especially China but this is offset by other products that we manufacture for Europe and the U.S. So I would say machine vision, which is what I'm referring to, is going to be relatively flat, maybe a little down year-over-year. But the other parts of Digital Imaging are going to be healthy. And we feel pretty good about that. So all in all, it's a big part of our portfolio but it's a pretty varied portfolio ranging from space to medical to machine vision for automated semiconductor inspections, flat panel displays, et cetera. So it's like Teledyne is pretty resilient to various economic conditions.\nJim Ricchiuti: And follow-up question, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about -- just an update on the rate at which you may be burning through some of that higher cost component inventory that you had. And just in general, it sounds like supply chain has gotten better and how you're seeing that part of the business?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. I think you're right. As I mentioned earlier, our supply chain issues have significantly moderated. We're still paying some premiums but perhaps as much as year-to-date, 65% to 70% lower than we did at the first quarter -- second quarter of last year. So that's a positive. But we're still paying some premium and our inventory remained fairly flat between first quarter and second quarter. But as these supply chain issues relax, we're going to reduce our inventory for the remainder of the year. So I feel good about how we've dealt with the supply chain. We really didn't lose a whole lot of revenue because of that.\nJim Ricchiuti: And if I could just slip one more in, apologies but you did talk about some pull-in from Q3. I wonder if you would size that for us.\nRobert Mehrabian: I'm going to say approximately $10 million, not a whole lot. But when we have the opportunity and I hope we will have in the future we're going to try and do that. The flip side of that, Jim, is that a lot of our customers have also ordered a lot of inventory anticipating shortages. So -- resistent about letting us ship all the stock that they have ordered before but we're balancing that because, again, our balanced portfolio help us along in all of those directions.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Joe Giordano, representing TD Cowen.\nJoe Giordano: I want to continue first on DI. I guess I'd say 90-plus percent of the questions I get from investors are about the margins there. So I mean, I think they -- over the last couple of quarters, they probably come in and the outlook has come in a little bit below what you thought. I know there's some elements, high-margin machine vision, probably market declines there. But can you talk about what's been slightly different than you thought on the margin side? And how should we really think about that business kind of into 2024, like what's realistic for like a baseline margin assumption is?\nRobert Mehrabian: Let me start with second quarter margin. Actually, second quarter Digital Imaging margin is up about 28 basis points. That's a 30 basis points year-over-year. And we think for the year, it might -- it will be probably flat, maybe down about 10 or 15 basis points but relatively flat. I think what -- what's going to happen is that the flare margins are going to increase somewhat and the historic or legacy digital imaging, they're going to decline a little bit. Basically, we think year-over-year, it's going to be flat. We've had, as I mentioned before, we've had a slower revenue and lower revenue in Defense in the first half of the year. But as I mentioned earlier, that's turning around now. So I think that's going to help us for the rest of the year. That's about really all I can say about the margins. I think second quarter year-over-year, we saw an improvement of about 28 to 30 basis points. For the whole year, it might be flat or down maybe 15 basis points but not much. And again, the balanced portfolio is really going to help us. The flip side of it is, if you look at our Aerospace and Defense segment, there second quarter margins increased 247 basis points. And for the year, we're projecting 80 basis points expansion. So sometimes, when we look at Defense, yes, we differentiate Defense -- that's in digital imaging, what I've talked about before. And then -- but we have a whole bunch of Defense programs in our Aerospace and Defense portfolio, which are doing really well. So overall, I think we're, okay.\nJoe Giordano: Just one quick clarification. I know the DI margins were up year-on-year but sequentially, they were down on higher revenue. So was there like a mix change going on there? And then I have a quick question on Test & Measurement.\nRobert Mehrabian: I don't know. They were down sequentially what, about 20 basis points. I'm not so concerned about that. There's so many moving parts in there that it just balances itself out. That's not something that worries me. That's all I'll say about that. Go ahead with your other area, please.\nJoe Giordano: Just curious on -- if you have any color on like the order -- the order intake for things like oscilloscopes versus the revenue delivery now? Like I know the revenue is strong, are orders starting to slow there? I'm just curious like what that revenue trend looks like? Like how much backlog do you have? How fast is that kind of coming out? And is it being replenished at the same pace?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. As you know, on the Test and Measurement, we have 2 distinct product lines. One is oscilloscopes, the other is protocols. And both of those are relatively short-term revenue. So big backlog, which doesn't make a whole lot of difference. Our oscilloscopes revenue in Q2 was outstanding, really good. Our protocol revenue was relatively flat and partially, that's because new protocols are coming out in September and we expect that revenue to pick up. If you look at the whole year, we think that we're going to have something like 3.5% to 4% growth in our oscilloscope and protocol products. We think third and fourth quarter are going to be all right. They may not expand as much as the first quarter but year-over-year, we're going to be fine. In terms of just answering your question on backlog, book-to-bill in that Test and Measurement is very close to 1, it's 0.98. So I would say it's 1. So again, it's not something that concerns me right now.\nOperator: Our next question will be from the line of Greg Konrad with Jefferies.\nGreg Konrad: Maybe just one clarification. I mean it seems like you brought down -- you didn't change guidance for the year but brought down digital imaging. You talked about the strength in A&D. Has there been any change to the overall company margin guidance for the year just given it seems like A&D is tracking ahead and instrumentation continues to be maybe slightly above expectations?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. I'd say, if you went back to April guidance versus today, probably margin is going down 10 basis points. Again, nothing significant. For the full year, we expect margin to go up about 26 to 30 basis points year-over-year. So overall, it's a -- that's not something that concerns me because as I've mentioned several times, because of our diversity of our products, for example, Instruments margin will go up 80 basis points year-over-year. Aerospace and Defense, similarly, 80 basis points. Even Engineered Systems will go up about 38 to 40 basis points. So a flat digital imaging doesn't change anything at this time.\nGreg Konrad: And then, I mean, you talked about FLIR Defense and kind of what you're seeing on the order front and A&D performance top line was really strong in the quarter. I mean, what are you seeing across Teledyne as it relates to Defense? And how are you kind of thinking about runway just given orders and some of the '23 budget money coming through?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. As you mentioned, there has been a change in the budget for a long time. The budgets look healthy but money wasn't coming through and it started to come through more recently. Overall, I would say we are fairly comfortable with our Defense businesses, probably across everything, mid-single and single digits growth year-over-year. We are enjoying actually pretty good margins and orders in our legacy Defense businesses. And as I mentioned, our fleece defense businesses are turning around and had a good book-to-bill in Q2. It's not just the U.S. Defense. If you look at Defense also in NATO countries, that expenditures are increasing and we have a significant amount of sales overseas, in both our Defense as well as Defense, including things like traveling wave tubes for missile defense products in places like South Korea. So it's a pretty healthy environment right now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And let's go to the line of Jordan Manosh with BOA [ph].\nUnidentified Analyst: This is [indiscernible] Bank of America. So I just had a quick question on the backlog for Defense. Are you guys seeing any specific constraints that could put the deliveries at risk? And also, too, for those wins, should we expect the majority of them to come through for '23 or extend that into the out years?\nRobert Mehrabian: Some will come to in '23 and some will come through in -- starting in Q4. For example, let me just give you one example or two. We do have some counter drone products that are going to Europe, probably about $25 million, $26 million. Most of that would come in '23. On the other hand, the Black Hornet 3 that we just announced for the U.S. Army is $94 million, only about 10% of it will come this year, the rest will come in future years. So it's a balance. I think we'll get some of it this year and a lot of it in future years.\nOperator: And we'll go to the line of Guy Hardwick with Credit Suisse.\nGuy Hardwick: Robert, I think you said in your prepared remarks that digital imaging margins should grow considerably over time. Could you a little bit flesh that out a little bit for us, what is over time? And could this mean that digital imaging margins exceed the sort of 24% levels I think that delivered in 2021?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. The answer is, yes. And the reason I say that is the margins in our legacy businesses are already around that and even higher than that. And I think FLIR margins will increase as we -- especially as we take the cost out that I just mentioned. And overall margins for Digital Imaging this year, we're projecting to be 22.3%. So to go to '24, 170 basis point expansion. Yes, we can do that.\nGuy Hardwick: I think last quarter, you had pointed out negative mix, lag of price increases, I think, in the Medical business. So was there any other mix effects other than Defense that you talked about in Q2? Is there anything else that we should be aware of, which may have held back margins? Because I think 3 months ago, you did expect sequential improvement and 30 basis points up for the full year?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. I think in the health care business, things are really good for us. We've had significant expansion, both in our X-ray products, that is our panels as well as components that we put out for X-ray systems. And as I said before, there is some slowdown in China. If you look at China as a whole, they have had some contraction even though you don't hear about it, there has been some contraction there. On the other hand, less than 10% of our portfolio is sold to China. So again, our balanced portfolio helps us. The flip side also is that we've gotten some really good higher-margin products development programs that are helping overall Digital Imaging. Shipments have been a little slower but I think bookings are okay. So again, it's not something that worries me, where we don't have, let's say, a commercial imaging system that somebody would buy in China. On the flip side, we have custom products that we're developing, which are very profitable. Actually, more profitable than commercial. I sit here today and I'm just looking at our portfolio and I wouldn't change it with anybody else's considering all the uncertainty around the world. One area may go down a little bit but we'll pick it up somewhere else. And that's the resilience of our earnings year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter.\nGuy Hardwick: Just one last one for me. In Aerospace and Defense Electronics, I think previously, you had mentioned that you benefited from a particularly good mix there. Is that -- presumably, that has continued in Q2 and assume that continues in the second half given your guidance for the margin?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. We think we may have a little lower revenue in the second half. On the other hand, the products that we make in Aerospace go primarily in commercial aircraft. And that market has expanded, as you well know, very close to pre-COVID. Q3, Q4 margins for Aerospace and Defense might be a little lower than Q2 but it will be higher than Q1. So again, I don't see major inflections in that area.\nOperator: We'll go the line of Jim Ricchiuti with a follow-up from Needham.\nJim Ricchiuti: You gave us some book-to-bills and I'm just wondering if you could perhaps provide us the book-to-bill in the different segments. I feel like I've got pieces of it.\nRobert Mehrabian: Sure. Jim, in Instruments, our book-to-bill is about 1.05, so over 1, led by our Marine businesses, which are doing really well, both -- in underwater vehicles as well as oil discovery and production. In the Digital Imaging as a whole, the book-to-bill is about 1.07. In Aerospace and Defense, that's a little more =- and Engineered Systems, those are much more lumpy orders. So quarter-over-quarter book-to-bill may change but it's not affecting the revenue that much because we expect both -- revenue in both segments to grow. Overall, across the company, our book-to-bill is about 1.\nJim Ricchiuti: Okay. And last question for me. Just given the debt pay down, I'm wondering how -- if anything has changed with respect to thinking about acquisitions, including any change in areas that you might be pursuing? And I know you can't be specific but I'm just wondering, just in general, what your appetite is for M&A as you look out over the next several quarters?\nRobert Mehrabian: Well, as I mentioned earlier, Jim, we paid on $620 million this year effective today, let's say. That's taken our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 2.1%. We have about $60 million of debt left that's variable, which we pay 6%, out of the $3 billion that -- $3 billion plus that Sue mentioned, the rest of our debt is on fixed. So other than that $60 million, our interest payments are 2.1% in future years, which is a very healthy place to be because we haven't really touched our line of credit. So we have a lot of capability to acquisitions. Last year, even as we were paying our debt down, last year, we did 3 bolt-on acquisitions and spent about $160 million. We expect to continue that bolt-on acquisitions. On the flip side is that because if we don't do anything else, if we don't make acquisitions, if we don't -- doing anything, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is going to go less than 1 in about a year and 1.5 years. So we're bullish about acquisitions, including larger ones, if we can find them. And of course, we are continuously looking at that. The last question was, what areas. Right now, I would say in the general instrumentation area is what's very attractive. We have done some digital imaging acquisitions. As you know, we made the ETM acquisition. We made acquisition for our acquisition. But I think it'd be nice if we could find some things in our Instrumentation area.\nOperator: And we have no other participants queued up at this time.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, operator. I now ask Jason to conclude our conference call.\nJason VanWees: Thanks, Robert. And thanks, Thomas. To give the replay information to the audience, I would appreciate it.

            "name": "Robert Mehrabian",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason and thank you for joining our earnings call. In the second quarter, we achieved all-time record quarterly sales, with overall sales increasing 5.1%. Furthermore, sales as well as GAAP and non-GAAP operating profit and operating margin increased year-over-year in every segment. For the total company, GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins increased 105 and 73 basis points, respectively. Excluding foreign currency headwind, which negatively impacted second quarter sales growth by approximately 40 basis points, growth in local currency would have been 5.5%. GAAP operating margin of 18% was a second quarter record and non-GAAP operating margin was 21.4%. Second quarter GAAP earnings per share were $3.87 and non-GAAP earnings of $4.67 were also second quarter records. And finally, including continued debt repayment through July, which totaled about $620 million year-to-date, our consolidated leverage ratio declined to 2.1x. I'll now comment a bit further on the performance of Teledyne flare and the announced cost reductions and the outlook for the balance of the year. In the 2 years, since we've owned FLIR, we've resolved the most significant legacy tax matters, exited the consent agreement with the Department of State, consolidated leadership in marketing and operations for the FLIR Defense portfolio and corrected some historical product quality issues. As part of this effort, we also took a much more focused view of the Defense business, aggressively pursuing those opportunities where we have truly differentiated technology. I am pleased to report that the order book and backlog of FLIR, specialty FLIR Defense, significantly inflected during the second quarter. For reference, the commercial business across digital imaging, both DALSA to FLIR grew organically in the second quarter.

Additionally, more surveillance imaging systems for the U.S. and foreign customers. Having stabilized the business, including achieving stronger backlog, it is not time to focus on execution and additional margin improvement. Thus, the charges announced this morning are for the further reduction in the FLIR operating footprint and related headcount. We are exciting the elimination of 3 lease sites, all of those activities will be relocated to other FLIR Defense facilities, most of which are locates. Today, we are reaffirming our prior 2023 full year sales and non-GAAP earnings outlook, including -- excluding the $10 million to $12 million charges that -- covered. Supply chain challenges have continued to improve and we were once again able to exceed our original second quarter sales and earnings outlook by pulling forward some revenue from the third quarter. On revenue specifically, we continue to see total 2023 growth of approximately 5% or sales of approximately $5.73 billion, with the third quarter being roughly $1.4 billion. We continue to see non-GAAP earnings of $19.10 at the midpoint of our guidance, excluding the charges referenced above. I will now further comment on the performance of the 4 business segments. Second quarter sales, in our Digital Imaging segment, increased 2.3% with greater sales of X-ray products, commercial infrared imaging components and solutions and industrial scientific cameras partially offset by lower sales of unmanned ground systems for Defense applications. GAAP segment operating margin increased 51 basis points to 15.7% and adjusted for reduced the intangible asset amortization non-GAAP segment margin was 28 basis points higher at 21.5%. Turning to our Instrumentation segment. Overall, second quarter sales increased 5.1% versus last year. Sales of Marine instruments increased a healthy 10.5% in the quarter, primarily due to ongoing recovery in offshore energy markets, also greater sales of autonomous underwater vehicles. Sales of electronic test and measurement systems, which include oscilloscopes, digitizers and protocol analyzers, collectively increased 4.9%. We encountered some softness in sales of analyzers for electronic storage and data center application but this was more than offset by [indiscernible] for wireless and video protocols as well as continued strong sales of oscilloscopes. Sales of environmental instruments were flat compared to last year with greater sales of air quality, process gas, safety analyzers offset by drug discovery and laboratory instruments. Overall, instrumentation segment operating profit increased 10.6% in the second quarter, with GAAP operating margin increasing 123 basis points to 24.8% and 80 basis points on a non-GAAP basis, excluding reduced intangible asset amortization to 25.9%. In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, second quarter sales increased 10.2%, driven by growth of both Defense Electronics and Commercial Aerospace products. GAAP and non-GAAP segment operating profit increased over 20% with margins approximately 250 basis points greater than last year. In the Engineering Systems segment, second quarter revenue increased 18.5% and operating profit increased 33.7%, representing 112 basis points increase in margin from last year. In conclusion, our short-term, more economically sensitive businesses remained resilient in the second quarter, collectively growing year-over-year, although comparisons for some do become more difficult in the second half. In addition, our longer Cycle Medical, Aerospace, Defense and Marine businesses continued to perform very well. Quarterly operating margin in our Instrumentation segment was an all-time record. Operating margin in our Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment was the second quarter record and just slightly less than the fourth quarter of last year. And now through a combination of sales growth, operating leverage and the more aggressive cost actions mentioned earlier, I fully expect digital imaging margins to grow considerably over time. And now I'm going to turn the call over to Sue. Thank you very much, Sue. We would now like to take your questions. Operator, if you're ready to proceed with the questions and answers, please go ahead. Well, thank you. I think what you're referring to is in the organic growth or decline year-over-year was a little over 1% decline -- 1.5% to be exact. We see several things: First, there are government programs that we have in digital imaging, especially in FLIR, that declined year-over-year.

So in summary, I would say that -- there is a little pressure on parts of our digital imaging in the Far East, especially China but this is offset by other products that we manufacture for Europe and the U.S. So I would say machine vision, which is what I'm referring to, is going to be relatively flat, maybe a little down year-over-year. But the other parts of Digital Imaging are going to be healthy. And we feel pretty good about that. So all in all, it's a big part of our portfolio but it's a pretty varied portfolio ranging from space to medical to machine vision for automated semiconductor inspections, flat panel displays, et cetera. So it's like Teledyne is pretty resilient to various economic conditions. Yes. I think you're right. As I mentioned earlier, our supply chain issues have significantly moderated. We're still paying some premiums but perhaps as much as year-to-date, 65% to 70% lower than we did at the first quarter -- second quarter of last year. So that's a positive. But we're still paying some premium and our inventory remained fairly flat between first quarter and second quarter. But as these supply chain issues relax, we're going to reduce our inventory for the remainder of the year. So I feel good about how we've dealt with the supply chain. We really didn't lose a whole lot of revenue because of that. I'm going to say approximately $10 million, not a whole lot. But when we have the opportunity and I hope we will have in the future we're going to try and do that. The flip side of that, Jim, is that a lot of our customers have also ordered a lot of inventory anticipating shortages. So -- resistent about letting us ship all the stock that they have ordered before but we're balancing that because, again, our balanced portfolio help us along in all of those directions. Let me start with second quarter margin. Actually, second quarter Digital Imaging margin is up about 28 basis points. That's a 30 basis points year-over-year. And we think for the year, it might -- it will be probably flat, maybe down about 10 or 15 basis points but relatively flat. I think what -- what's going to happen is that the flare margins are going to increase somewhat and the historic or legacy digital imaging, they're going to decline a little bit. Basically, we think year-over-year, it's going to be flat. We've had, as I mentioned before, we've had a slower revenue and lower revenue in Defense in the first half of the year. But as I mentioned earlier, that's turning around now. So I think that's going to help us for the rest of the year. That's about really all I can say about the margins. I think second quarter year-over-year, we saw an improvement of about 28 to 30 basis points. For the whole year, it might be flat or down maybe 15 basis points but not much. And again, the balanced portfolio is really going to help us. The flip side of it is, if you look at our Aerospace and Defense segment, there second quarter margins increased 247 basis points. And for the year, we're projecting 80 basis points expansion. So sometimes, when we look at Defense, yes, we differentiate Defense -- that's in digital imaging, what I've talked about before. And then -- but we have a whole bunch of Defense programs in our Aerospace and Defense portfolio, which are doing really well. So overall, I think we're, okay. I don't know. They were down sequentially what, about 20 basis points. I'm not so concerned about that. There's so many moving parts in there that it just balances itself out. That's not something that worries me. That's all I'll say about that. Go ahead with your other area, please. Yes. As you know, on the Test and Measurement, we have 2 distinct product lines. One is oscilloscopes, the other is protocols. And both of those are relatively short-term revenue. So big backlog, which doesn't make a whole lot of difference. Our oscilloscopes revenue in Q2 was outstanding, really good. Our protocol revenue was relatively flat and partially, that's because new protocols are coming out in September and we expect that revenue to pick up. If you look at the whole year, we think that we're going to have something like 3.5% to 4% growth in our oscilloscope and protocol products. We think third and fourth quarter are going to be all right. They may not expand as much as the first quarter but year-over-year, we're going to be fine. In terms of just answering your question on backlog, book-to-bill in that Test and Measurement is very close to 1, it's 0.98. So I would say it's 1. So again, it's not something that concerns me right now. Yes. I'd say, if you went back to April guidance versus today, probably margin is going down 10 basis points. Again, nothing significant. For the full year, we expect margin to go up about 26 to 30 basis points year-over-year. So overall, it's a -- that's not something that concerns me because as I've mentioned several times, because of our diversity of our products, for example, Instruments margin will go up 80 basis points year-over-year. Aerospace and Defense, similarly, 80 basis points. Even Engineered Systems will go up about 38 to 40 basis points. So a flat digital imaging doesn't change anything at this time. Yes. As you mentioned, there has been a change in the budget for a long time. The budgets look healthy but money wasn't coming through and it started to come through more recently. Overall, I would say we are fairly comfortable with our Defense businesses, probably across everything, mid-single and single digits growth year-over-year. We are enjoying actually pretty good margins and orders in our legacy Defense businesses. And as I mentioned, our fleece defense businesses are turning around and had a good book-to-bill in Q2. It's not just the U.S. Defense. If you look at Defense also in NATO countries, that expenditures are increasing and we have a significant amount of sales overseas, in both our Defense as well as Defense, including things like traveling wave tubes for missile defense products in places like South Korea. So it's a pretty healthy environment right now. Some will come to in '23 and some will come through in -- starting in Q4. For example, let me just give you one example or two. We do have some counter drone products that are going to Europe, probably about $25 million, $26 million. Most of that would come in '23. On the other hand, the Black Hornet 3 that we just announced for the U.S. Army is $94 million, only about 10% of it will come this year, the rest will come in future years. So it's a balance. I think we'll get some of it this year and a lot of it in future years. Yes. The answer is, yes. And the reason I say that is the margins in our legacy businesses are already around that and even higher than that. And I think FLIR margins will increase as we -- especially as we take the cost out that I just mentioned. And overall margins for Digital Imaging this year, we're projecting to be 22.3%. So to go to '24, 170 basis point expansion. Yes, we can do that. Yes. I think in the health care business, things are really good for us. We've had significant expansion, both in our X-ray products, that is our panels as well as components that we put out for X-ray systems. And as I said before, there is some slowdown in China. If you look at China as a whole, they have had some contraction even though you don't hear about it, there has been some contraction there. On the other hand, less than 10% of our portfolio is sold to China. So again, our balanced portfolio helps us. The flip side also is that we've gotten some really good higher-margin products development programs that are helping overall Digital Imaging. Shipments have been a little slower but I think bookings are okay. So again, it's not something that worries me, where we don't have, let's say, a commercial imaging system that somebody would buy in China. On the flip side, we have custom products that we're developing, which are very profitable. Actually, more profitable than commercial. I sit here today and I'm just looking at our portfolio and I wouldn't change it with anybody else's considering all the uncertainty around the world. One area may go down a little bit but we'll pick it up somewhere else. And that's the resilience of our earnings year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter. Yes. We think we may have a little lower revenue in the second half. On the other hand, the products that we make in Aerospace go primarily in commercial aircraft. And that market has expanded, as you well know, very close to pre-COVID. Q3, Q4 margins for Aerospace and Defense might be a little lower than Q2 but it will be higher than Q1. So again, I don't see major inflections in that area. Sure. Jim, in Instruments, our book-to-bill is about 1.05, so over 1, led by our Marine businesses, which are doing really well, both -- in underwater vehicles as well as oil discovery and production. In the Digital Imaging as a whole, the book-to-bill is about 1.07. In Aerospace and Defense, that's a little more =- and Engineered Systems, those are much more lumpy orders. So quarter-over-quarter book-to-bill may change but it's not affecting the revenue that much because we expect both -- revenue in both segments to grow. Overall, across the company, our book-to-bill is about 1. Well, as I mentioned earlier, Jim, we paid on $620 million this year effective today, let's say. That's taken our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 2.1%. We have about $60 million of debt left that's variable, which we pay 6%, out of the $3 billion that -- $3 billion plus that Sue mentioned, the rest of our debt is on fixed. So other than that $60 million, our interest payments are 2.1% in future years, which is a very healthy place to be because we haven't really touched our line of credit. So we have a lot of capability to acquisitions. Last year, even as we were paying our debt down, last year, we did 3 bolt-on acquisitions and spent about $160 million. We expect to continue that bolt-on acquisitions. On the flip side is that because if we don't do anything else, if we don't make acquisitions, if we don't -- doing anything, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is going to go less than 1 in about a year and 1.5 years. So we're bullish about acquisitions, including larger ones, if we can find them. And of course, we are continuously looking at that. The last question was, what areas. Right now, I would say in the general instrumentation area is what's very attractive. We have done some digital imaging acquisitions. As you know, we made the ETM acquisition. We made acquisition for our acquisition. But I think it'd be nice if we could find some things in our Instrumentation area. Thank you, operator. I now ask Jason to conclude our conference call."

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and then I will discuss our third quarter and full year 2023 outlook. In the second quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $190.5 million. Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures was $163.2 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared with $176.1 million in 2022. Capital expenditures were $27.3 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared with $20.8 million in 2022. Depreciation and amortization expense was $80 million for the second quarter of 2023 compared with $82.7 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.99 billion of net debt. That is approximately $3.35 billion of debt less cash of $364.2 million. Stock-based compensation expense was $8.4 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared with $6.4 million in 2022. Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the third quarter of 2023 will be in the range of $3.76 to $3.90 per share, with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $4.70 to $4.80. And for the full year 2023, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $15.60 to $15.88. And on a non-GAAP basis, we are maintaining our prior outlook of $19 to $19.20. Both the third quarter and full year non-GAAP outlook excludes estimated pretax charges for further FLIR integration costs, the 2023 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 22.3%. I'll now pass the call back to Robert."

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to our host, Mr. Jason VanWees. Please go ahead, sir.\nJason VanWees: Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. This is Jason VanWees, Vice Chairman. And I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to Teledyne\u2019s first quarter 2023 earnings release conference call. We released our earnings earlier this morning before the market opened. Joining me today are Teledyne\u2019s Chairman, President and CEO, Robert Mehrabian; SVP and CFO, Sue Main; SVP, General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, Melanie Cibik; and also Edwin Roks, Executive VP of Teledyne. After remarks by Robert and Sue, we will ask for your questions. Of course though, before we get started, please be aware that all forward-looking statements made this morning are subject to various assumptions, risks, and caveats as noted in the earnings release and our periodic SEC filings and actual results may differ materially. In order to avoid potential selective disclosures, this call is simultaneously being webcast and a replay both via webcast and dial-in will be available for approximately one month. Here is Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Jason. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our earnings call. We began 2023 with record first quarter sales, operating margin, non-GAAP earnings and free cash flow. Overall, sales increased 4.7%, with revenue and operating profit growing in every segment. Excluding foreign currency headwinds, which negatively impacted first quarter sales growth by approximately 1.4%, growth in local currency would have been 6.1%. Excluding acquisitions, core growth in local currency would have been approximately 4.2%. GAAP operating margin of 17.5% and non-GAAP operating margin of 21.1% were also first quarter record. First quarter GAAP earnings per share were $3.73 and non-GAAP earnings of $4.53 were also first quarter record. Given record first quarter cash flow, our consolidated leverage ratio declined to 2.3 even after completing the ChartWorld acquisition at the beginning of the quarter. We also repaid $300 million of debt which matured on April 3rd on the first day of the second quarter. Turning to our 2023 full year outlook, we are reaffirming our prior sales and non-GAAP earnings per share outlook. As supply chain challenges improved modestly, we were able to exceed our original first quarter sales and earnings outlook by pulling forward some revenue from the second quarter. Consequently, by maintaining the full year guidance, we have also modestly derisked the quarterly sequential revenue and earnings slopes. While our short-cycle businesses are more economically sensitive, they were resilient in the first quarter. We are now a little more cautious. On the other hand, we are more positive in our longer-cycle medical, aerospace, defense and marine businesses. On revenue, specifically we will continue to see total 2023 growth of approximately 5% or sales of approximately $5.73 billion with the second quarter being roughly $1.4 billion. Regarding margins, our earnings outlook now implies approximately 40 basis points of margin improvement for the full year 2023. Currently, we think the Instrumentation segment will be above average contributor to this, while margins in the other segments may increase more modestly. I will now further comment on the performance of our four business segments. Our Digital Imaging segment was founded on our first acquisition in 2006 of Teledyne Scientific, our research laboratories, and Imaging, which provides high-end infrared sensors for space and astronomy. Since then, this segment has grown organically and through acquisitions such as DALSA, e2v, Scientific Cameras, FLIR and most recently ETM and ChartWorld to contribute almost 56% of Teledyne\u2019s revenue today. First quarter sales in this segment increased 4.7% on a constant currency basis with foreign currency translation contributing negative 1.8%. Sales increased year-over-year for industrial and scientific vision systems, as well as for our low-dose high-resolution digital X-ray detectors. But were offset by lower sales of unmanned ground systems for defense applications. Our product families increased or decreased more modestly with higher sales of surveillance, unmanned air systems and especially -- specialty semiconductor devices, offset by some lower sales of certain commercial infrared imaging and marine\u2019s products. GAAP segment operating margin increased 40 basis-points to 15.8% and adjusted for a reduced intangible asset amortization, non-GAAP margin decreased 13 basis points and it was lower at 21.75%. Turning to our Instrumentation segment, it is comprised of marine, test and measurement and environmental instruments, and contributes about 24% to Teledyne\u2019s revenue. Overall, first quarter sales increased 8% versus last years with sales growing in all fields noted above. Sales of marine instruments increased a healthy 14.6% in the quarter, primarily due to strong marine defense sales, especially autonomous underwater vehicles, as well as ongoing recovery in offshore energy markets. Sales of electronic test and measurement systems, which includes oscilloscopes, digitizes and protocol analyzers collectively increased 5.3% year-over-year despite a tough comparison with the first quarter of last year. Some softness in sales of analyzers and electronic storage and high speed networking applications was more than offset by devices for wireless and video protocols, as well as very strong sales of oscilloscopes and related accessories. Sales of environmental instruments increased 3.4% compared with last year, with greater sales of air quality, process gas and safety analyzers, partially offset by drug discovery and laboratory instruments. The other two segments of Teledyne are Aerospace and Defense Electronics and Engineered Systems that together contributes 20% of Teledyne\u2019s revenue. In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, first quarter sales increased 4.2%, driven by growth of both defense and commercial aerospace products. GAAP and non-GAAP segment operating profit increased approximately 9.6%, with margins 132 basis points greater than last year. In the Engineered Systems segment, first quarter revenue increased 9.1% and operating profit increased 6.4%, resulting in a modest 25 basis points decline in margin from last year. Finally, first, because of our unwavering focus on improving on all aspects of Teledyne\u2019s operations, and second, prudent capital allocation, and third, the broad geographic and end markets that we serve from short-cycle to long-cycle commercial to defense, I am optimistic that Teledyne will successfully navigate through today\u2019s uncertain economic times as we have consistently done so in the past. Our record also shows that we have successfully dealt with multiple economic turmoils and during the ensuing recoveries have been able to acquire complementary enterprises for compounded growth. I will now turn the call over to Sue.\nSue Main: Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and then I will discuss our second quarter and full year 2023 outlook. In the first quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $203 million and primarily reflected higher accounts receivable collections compared with the first quarter of 2022. Free cash flow that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures was $178.6 million in the first quarter of 2023, compared with adjusted free cash flow of $58.7 million in 2022. The 2022 adjusted value excluded by $296.4 million payment to the Swedish Tax Authority related to a FLIR pre-acquisition tax reassessment. Capital expenditures were $24.4 million in the first quarter of 2023, compared with $21 million in 2022. Depreciation and amortization expense was $82.1 million for the first quarter of 2023, compared with $86.9 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $3.16 billion of net debt that is approximately $3.82 billion of debt less cash of $665.2 million. Stock-based compensation expense was $7.9 million in the first quarter of 2023, compared with $9 million in 2022. Turning to our outlook, management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the second quarter of 2023 will be in the range of $3.76 per share to $3.88 per share with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $4.56 to $4.66. And for the full year 2023, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $15.80 to $16.05. And on a non-GAAP basis, we are maintaining our prior outlook of $19 to $19.20. The 2023 full year estimated tax rate excluding discrete items is expected to be 23%. I will now pass the call back to Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Sue. We would now like to take your questions. Brad, if you are ready to proceed with the question-and-answers, please go ahead.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We can first go to Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nJim Ricchiuti: Hi. Thank you. Good morning. Robert, I am wondering if you could talk a little bit about the shorter-cycle areas of the Instrumentation business. I think you gave some color about the Digital Imaging short-cycle business, but if you look at Instrumentation, any changes that you are seeing in that shorter-cycle business?\nRobert Mehrabian: Not much. There is a little bit of -- in one of our businesses, like, which is our test and measurement, we make a protocol solutions -- provide protocol solutions to the electronics industry. There we have some new product protocols coming out. So people are little waiting for the new ones and maybe not buying the old loans. Other than that, where the book-to-bill is almost 1, oscilloscopes are doing well and in the T&Ms we feel alright. On the environmental, the only thing that there is a little softness that we are experiencing in the pharmaceutical market, where we supply a whole range of products. There -- but we are making that up by some of our air quality and other products that are doing well in this environment. So, overall, I think, we are doing okay.\nJim Ricchiuti: Got it. Since you were good enough to give us a book-to-bill, which I think was for the entire Instrumentation business. I am wondering if you could provide some book-to-bill color on Digital Imaging and the Aerospace and Defense and maybe the company as a whole? Thank you.\nRobert Mehrabian: Yeah. Jim on the Instrumentation, if you put marine in, which we didn\u2019t talk about. Marine has got a book-to-bill of 1.12. So, it\u2019s very healthy. So because of that, it pulls Instrumentation as a whole above 1 to 1.04. Going to Digital Imaging, book-to-bill is less than 1, not substantially, but less than 1, primarily I think, because of some of the ground-based defense systems that we have which is about a little over 0.9. But having said that, we have some really large orders coming and we have also post-quarter had a large order for our Black Hornet, small air UAVs. When we had right after the quarter, as an example, we had $94 million award for those, and by the way, those are also in high demand in the Ukraine conflict. So, overall, I am encouraged with what\u2019s happening in Digital Imaging. There has been a little lag in the defense part, but that\u2019s coming up as the backlog is filling in and it\u2019s -- we have better orders this quarter, first quarter than we did last year. And then on the AD&E side, I think, book-to-bill is 1.05. Engineered Systems is close to 1, but that\u2019s lumpy. So, I think, we are going to be fine there. Overall for the company, I\u2019d say when you add all those numbers up, it\u2019s slightly less than 1, maybe 0.96, 0.97, but that\u2019s not a great concern at this time. We are just being cautious as we always are, because of the uncertain times that everybody is facing. Other than that, I feel pretty good about our portfolio and its resilience.\nJim Ricchiuti: Got it. And just final question if I may, just in light of that -- the some of the uncertainty that\u2019s out there. I think you have talked about M&A. Should we still think mainly about M&A this year is more tuck-in related and then potentially as we come out of this, there might be some opportunities for larger deals in 2024. Is that better way to think about M&A, again without being specific which I know you can\u2019t be?\nRobert Mehrabian: No. I understand, Jim. I think that\u2019s a good analysis. There might -- we are obviously chasing some, what we call, string of pearls M&As. We -- it\u2019s possible that we might end up with something more mid-size near the end of the year, but definitely with our balance sheet. We have right now -- we have drawn down on our line of credit, which is about 1.15 billion. We have only drawn down $25 million and it\u2019s sitting there. We have paid all of our debt that\u2019s coming due. We don\u2019t have any debt payments until 2024. And we have a lot of capacity for to do larger deals, as opportunity comes, and of course, we are looking at things. But you are right, larger deals take time and it would probably be more like early 2024 or sometime in 2024.\nJim Ricchiuti: Got it. Thanks very much.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thanks, Jim.\nOperator: And next we can go to Greg Konrad with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nGreg Konrad: Good morning.\nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning, Greg.\nGreg Konrad: Maybe just to revisit Digital Imaging, is there any way to kind of decompose the organic growth, just given your short-cycle commentary, when you think about health care, machine vision, space and maybe the legacy FLIR business, just kind of what trends you are seeing and you mentioned being more cautious on short-cycle, like, how are you thinking about Digital Imaging for the year?\nRobert Mehrabian: Well, first, let\u2019s start with Q1. Organic -- and let\u2019s also do what you suggested, which is stay with the first, what we would call our historical Digital Imaging, which is DALSA, e2v and associated companies. There we had a healthy organic growth in Q1 of 6.2%, healthcare grew 9.2% and MEMS grew 8.8%. So, overall, we are very happy with that and some of those like smaller cycle vision systems had a healthy growth rate there. On the FLIR side of the equation, which would be the newer digital imaging, we had both positives or negatives. Overall, we had a contraction of about 4.8%. But that was primarily driven by our unmanned systems and primarily in the unmanned drone vehicle systems. As I said, after the quarter, we have had some very healthy awards in our UAVs, which are unmanned air vehicles. Surveillance declined and was plus 5%. Tomography was down a little bit -- a little under 4%, but uncooled and cooled cores, which are infrared cores, they were up 3%. And industrial vision system was up almost 19% -- over 19%. So it was a mixed bag. The drag down for that business was primarily in the defense and primarily on ground -- on unmanned ground systems. Now we had a little softness in tomography and maritime, which is our marine -- Raymarine businesses. But, overall, I think, we were okay. We just have to fill out the backlog for our unmanned vehicles, ground vehicles and we will be fine.\nGreg Konrad: And this might just be miss-modeling on my part, but I mean margin seemed a little late in Digital Imaging in the quarter. Can you maybe talk about price-mix going forward and how you are expecting margins to trend for the year, given your commentary? I think, you still expect them to be up, just a lesser degree than the total 40 for the company?\nRobert Mehrabian: Well, right now what I\u2019d say is, I expect the margins to be up about 30 basis points for the year, let\u2019s start with the year and this is the overall Digital Imaging margin. So that would be pushed out on one side. I think, in Q2, we will improve sequentially on our margins and we should be fine and we are also going to take some price actions to make sure that we get there. On the overall for the company, we think the margins now would increase 40 basis points for the year and if we can have better price increases going forward, we should improve on that. So when I look at it, I\u2019d say, look in our instruments businesses, we are going to have margin improvement for the year of almost 80 basis points, Digital Imaging about 30 basis points, Aerospace and Defense is so healthy that I will be happy to just keep our 27.1% operating margin. Engineered Systems will probably increase in 50 basis points, and overall, the segment\u2019s 40 basis points and the company about 40 basis points. That -- I hope that helps you.\nGreg Konrad: That was perfect. I will leave it to you. Thank you.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you.\nOperator: And next we have Elizabeth Grenfell with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nElizabeth Grenfell: Hi. Good morning.\nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning, Elizabeth.\nElizabeth Grenfell: Could you give us -- could you give us some color on defense on a consolidated basis for the quarter and then what your expectations are for defense growth on a consolidated basis for the year? Thank you.\nRobert Mehrabian: Yeah. Sure. I think, overall, in Q1, defense was flat year-over-year and we think for the year, it will be probably low-to-mid single-digit growth in our defense businesses. The primary reason, again, I am saying the U.S. Government programs were flat, primarily driven, as I said, but the on ground vehicles -- unmanned ground vehicles. We think for the year we are probably growing in the mid-single-digits in our defense.\nElizabeth Grenfell: Great. Thank you very much.\nRobert Mehrabian: For sure your excellence.\nOperator: And next we will go to Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJoe Giordano: Hey. Good morning, guys.\nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe Giordano: You talked about pulling forward some revenue from 2Q into 1Q. Can you give some detail there as to like where it was and what that means for that business from here?\nRobert Mehrabian: I think, basically, we have pulled in about $10 million and most of that was in Instruments, most of that was in our marine businesses. We shipped more underwater vehicles in Q1 that we had anticipated. We have some really good orders -- we actually have good orders for Q2 also. So that\u2019s -- that was just to ensure that we hit what we expected to. And also, as I said, that was affected by the fact that we are having improvements in our supply chain. We are seeing improvement, significant improvement and I expect that to continue the rest of the year based on what we are seeing and based on what the Chief of our Procurement is doing with various companies. So that\u2019s why we pulled it forward, we felt we could and did.\nJoe Giordano: No. That makes sense. Now when I think about the full year guide, I mean, so you come in, it\u2019s clearly at the high end of your guide here. You are guiding the second quarter high end is basically in line with consensus. You guys tend to be -- you are holding the full year, understanding that the macro is uncertain, like, are you trying to give the impression that the second half is weaker than you thought three months ago or are you kind of like derisking that full year guide, like, how should we think about the -- what the -- between the lines there?\nRobert Mehrabian: Between the lines, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be weaker, except that something terrible happens. It\u2019s -- I feel good about, look, as you know, we are always more conservative. I can go out and say we are going to make a lot more in our earnings per share and we probably could. On the other hand, with the uncertain environment that we are facing, with semiconductors being down, everybody is projecting semiconductors will recover in 2024, not this year, both equipment and supply. We grow -- we -- which obviously we serve those markets. I am being cautious as we always are. But I don\u2019t think the second -- right now I don\u2019t think the second half is going to be weaker. I think it\u2019s going to be actually stronger. If you look at earnings per share, they have to improve in the second half of the year for us to make the $19.10 that we projected or $19.20, if you want to take the high-end.\nJoe Giordano: Yeah. Okay. Two more quick ones from me. You started off the year, free cash flow is pretty high, like what are your expectations for the year now, does that go up, higher than what you thought before? And then just curious on the supply chain improvement and the lack of having to pay as much gray market, like, how much benefit is that -- of that 40 bps, like, how much you are getting from there and where is it getting offset from in other elements of costs? Thank you.\nRobert Mehrabian: Let me start with the free cash flow. We are going to beat last year\u2019s free cash flow by a couple of $100 million, let\u2019s just say, $850 million is our current estimate. I hope we can do better than that and we have just continued deleveraging the company, get ready for -- when all of this is uncertainty is behind us and use our capability and ability to buy things that have not there, perhaps, done as well in this environment. Coming back to the supply chain, we have seen improvement in Q1. Last year, in Q1, we -- our brokerage, we bought about $23 million of goods from brokerage and that does repay 70% premium let\u2019s say. This year first quarter, it\u2019s the same type of thing, cost us about half as much as that and so that\u2019s a savings, obviously. But more importantly, if you look at revenue that\u2019s being affected by the shortages. That is improving, which is much more comforting to me, because it makes our revenue projections a little more predictable, because we don\u2019t have -- we are not missing a lot of revenue, because we don\u2019t have parts. So there is improvement in the supply chain. We are seeing that. There is improvement in the premium that we are paying and also the fact that we are not going to miss as much revenue, because we can ship products, because they are sitting on the shelf, waiting for one or two parts. That\u2019s it.\nJoe Giordano: Thanks very much.\nRobert Mehrabian: For sure.\nOperator: And next we have got Guy Hardwick with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nGuy Hardwick: Hi. Good morning.\nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning, Guy.\nGuy Hardwick: I think the previous -- good morning, all. I think the previous guidance for at Group level was a 50 basis points improvement in the adjusted margin, so you are now guiding to 40s. So what are the kind of the main parts of the change and is it bias towards Digital Imaging?\nRobert Mehrabian: Actually, what we have is a mixture. January, you are perfectly correct. We guided 50 basis points and now we are guiding 40 basis points. We are taking some guidance down in Instrumentation from January to today. We had over 100 basis points, we are closer to 80 basis points. Digital imaging, we are taking down about 10 basis points, all in. Aerospace and Defense, we are actually guiding -- we are guiding flat and we had it going down and so that\u2019s good. And then in Engineered Systems, we have a moderate up, which are smaller business, but we still have a moderate 45 basis points or so up. So, overall, I think, we will be up 40 basis points. Again, we hope to do better than that and the way to do better than that is if we can stick some more price increases in our portfolio, because inflation is moderating. Nevertheless, our wages are going up 4.5% to 5%. Our purchasing of direct and indirect goods is going up with inflation and so we have to catch-up a little more with price increases to make-up for those in order to keep or be able to increase our margins. That\u2019s the kind of uncertain part. How much can we gain from price increases? First quarter, we were okay. We made up what we paid out and we are a little positive actually. So, rest of the year, can we keep that pace of reasonable price increases to make up for inflation in both goods, as well as wages.\nGuy Hardwick: And is the intention to be price/cost neutral or do a little bit better than that and then on the second...\nRobert Mehrabian: I\u2019d like to do better than that. I\u2019d like to do better than that. For sure.\nGuy Hardwick: Okay.\nRobert Mehrabian: Last year\u2026\nGuy Hardwick: All right.\nRobert Mehrabian: \u2026 we were negatively by 60 basis points. This year I hope to be positive.\nGuy Hardwick: And just to follow-up on the broker purchase, I believe that you said that it was $70 million incremental last year. What does your guidance imply in terms of lowering that $70 million in 2023?\nRobert Mehrabian: It\u2019s hard to tell at this point, but if I were to take the first quarter and project it out, I\u2019d say half.\nGuy Hardwick: So potentially $35 million\u2026\nRobert Mehrabian: So it will\u2026\nGuy Hardwick: \u2026 $30 million to $40 million lower.\nRobert Mehrabian: Yeah. $35 million.\nGuy Hardwick: $35 million lower broker purchases.\nRobert Mehrabian: Yeah. Yeah.\nGuy Hardwick: Broker, okay.\nRobert Mehrabian: Approximately.\nGuy Hardwick: Okay.\nRobert Mehrabian: Again, that\u2019s a moving target. So, so far, we have been successful. As the semiconductor industry has gone down, as you can expect, the parts that were in shortage, some of them have become available. Some of them are at the harder parts to get. The FPGAs, et cetera are still harder to get. So it\u2019s a mixture. But things are improving, which makes me feel positive.\nGuy Hardwick: And just one final one for me, is there any sort of mix effect either positive or negative in Digital Imaging in terms of the margin?\nRobert Mehrabian: No. I don\u2019t believe so.\nGuy Hardwick: Okay. Thank you.\nRobert Mehrabian: For sure.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will go now to Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley.\nKristine Liwag: Hey. Good morning, everyone.\nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning, Kristine.\nKristine Liwag: Robert, on the supply chain, just want to follow-up on the premiums paid to brokers for component sourcing. So you have talked about how that\u2019s declined. And is that because traditional sources have reopened and therefore you are now sourcing less parts from these brokers or are you seeing more availability of parts and there\u2019s not as much of a scarcity and therefore their premiums have declined? Can you provide more color on what\u2019s driving the dynamic there?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yeah. The big picture is that we are able to buy more from the OEMs than from brokers. We obviously prefer to buy from OEMs, because the prices are stable or it might be price increases versus last year. But brokers, you -- there you end up paying premiums of 70% to them. So that\u2019s the big picture. And the availability is improving, it\u2019s very interesting just anecdotally, there have been a few brokers that have called us asking us if we want some of their parts. Last year, we were out there begging for parts, and obviously, if that were to happen, I look at that as they have some obsolete or some excess supply and we are buying, but we buy them at a discount to what we paid to the OEMs. So the market is improving. I like that.\nKristine Liwag: Great. And then, Rob, you mentioned that you anticipate that you can pass on whatever inflation costs that you have into pricing. So that should be a net positive for you. But can you talk about the demand environment? What\u2019s been the customer sensitivity to pricing and right now, if you look at the financial markets, we have had two regional bank failures last month and there is more uncertainty today. Is that macro environment affecting your customer\u2019s decision for capital purchases or to have some sort of pricing sensitivity?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. The answer to it is, yes. On the other hand, because we are in such a diverse market, if you look at some of our longer-cycle businesses, as I mentioned, like marine with energy dependent. Some of our defense businesses or others, they are not as price sensitive to what\u2019s happening in the financial market. Some of our shorter-cycle businesses, yes, we have to be careful that we don\u2019t increase prices and lose to the competition, lose market share to the competition. But in some areas, like healthcare, where we make X-ray panels that are very high resolution, very low dosage, there we have pricing power and so it\u2019s a mixture. Overall, when I say uncertainty, about economic uncertainty, I am speaking exactly to what you pointed out, some of the uncertainty in the financial market that\u2019s shipping out into other markets as well.\nKristine Liwag: Great. Thank you for the color. And if I could sneak a last one in, when you look at your overall portfolio, what percent of it would you say, you have more pricing power versus what percent would have more pricing sensitivity?\nRobert Mehrabian: I think about 40% of our portfolio, we have more pricing power and 60% is more sensitive, because the 60% in some ways, it depends on the global macro environment. As you may know, the way our portfolio has evolved, today we sell about 22% to the government, 28% U.S. commercial and 50% commercial and defense outside the U.S. So the macro -- global macro environment is what we are more sensitive to a 40% not so.\nKristine Liwag: Great. Thank you very much.\nRobert Mehrabian: For sure.\nOperator: And currently we have no further questions in queue.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Brad. I appreciate that.

            "content": "Thank you, Jason. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our earnings call. We began 2023 with record first quarter sales, operating margin, non-GAAP earnings and free cash flow. Overall, sales increased 4.7%, with revenue and operating profit growing in every segment. Excluding foreign currency headwinds, which negatively impacted first quarter sales growth by approximately 1.4%, growth in local currency would have been 6.1%. Excluding acquisitions, core growth in local currency would have been approximately 4.2%. GAAP operating margin of 17.5% and non-GAAP operating margin of 21.1% were also first quarter record. First quarter GAAP earnings per share were $3.73 and non-GAAP earnings of $4.53 were also first quarter record. Given record first quarter cash flow, our consolidated leverage ratio declined to 2.3 even after completing the ChartWorld acquisition at the beginning of the quarter. We also repaid $300 million of debt which matured on April 3rd on the first day of the second quarter. Turning to our 2023 full year outlook, we are reaffirming our prior sales and non-GAAP earnings per share outlook. As supply chain challenges improved modestly, we were able to exceed our original first quarter sales and earnings outlook by pulling forward some revenue from the second quarter. Consequently, by maintaining the full year guidance, we have also modestly derisked the quarterly sequential revenue and earnings slopes. While our short-cycle businesses are more economically sensitive, they were resilient in the first quarter. We are now a little more cautious. On the other hand, we are more positive in our longer-cycle medical, aerospace, defense and marine businesses. On revenue, specifically we will continue to see total 2023 growth of approximately 5% or sales of approximately $5.73 billion with the second quarter being roughly $1.4 billion. Regarding margins, our earnings outlook now implies approximately 40 basis points of margin improvement for the full year 2023. Currently, we think the Instrumentation segment will be above average contributor to this, while margins in the other segments may increase more modestly. I will now further comment on the performance of our four business segments. Our Digital Imaging segment was founded on our first acquisition in 2006 of Teledyne Scientific, our research laboratories, and Imaging, which provides high-end infrared sensors for space and astronomy. Since then, this segment has grown organically and through acquisitions such as DALSA, e2v, Scientific Cameras, FLIR and most recently ETM and ChartWorld to contribute almost 56% of Teledyne's revenue today. First quarter sales in this segment increased 4.7% on a constant currency basis with foreign currency translation contributing negative 1.8%. Sales increased year-over-year for industrial and scientific vision systems, as well as for our low-dose high-resolution digital X-ray detectors. But were offset by lower sales of unmanned ground systems for defense applications. Our product families increased or decreased more modestly with higher sales of surveillance, unmanned air systems and especially -- specialty semiconductor devices, offset by some lower sales of certain commercial infrared imaging and marine's products. GAAP segment operating margin increased 40 basis-points to 15.8% and adjusted for a reduced intangible asset amortization, non-GAAP margin decreased 13 basis points and it was lower at 21.75%. Turning to our Instrumentation segment, it is comprised of marine, test and measurement and environmental instruments, and contributes about 24% to Teledyne's revenue. Overall, first quarter sales increased 8% versus last years with sales growing in all fields noted above. Sales of marine instruments increased a healthy 14.6% in the quarter, primarily due to strong marine defense sales, especially autonomous underwater vehicles, as well as ongoing recovery in offshore energy markets. Sales of electronic test and measurement systems, which includes oscilloscopes, digitizes and protocol analyzers collectively increased 5.3% year-over-year despite a tough comparison with the first quarter of last year. Some softness in sales of analyzers and electronic storage and high speed networking applications was more than offset by devices for wireless and video protocols, as well as very strong sales of oscilloscopes and related accessories. Sales of environmental instruments increased 3.4% compared with last year, with greater sales of air quality, process gas and safety analyzers, partially offset by drug discovery and laboratory instruments. The other two segments of Teledyne are Aerospace and Defense Electronics and Engineered Systems that together contributes 20% of Teledyne's revenue. In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, first quarter sales increased 4.2%, driven by growth of both defense and commercial aerospace products. GAAP and non-GAAP segment operating profit increased approximately 9.6%, with margins 132 basis points greater than last year. In the Engineered Systems segment, first quarter revenue increased 9.1% and operating profit increased 6.4%, resulting in a modest 25 basis points decline in margin from last year. Finally, first, because of our unwavering focus on improving on all aspects of Teledyne's operations, and second, prudent capital allocation, and third, the broad geographic and end markets that we serve from short-cycle to long-cycle commercial to defense, I am optimistic that Teledyne will successfully navigate through today's uncertain economic times as we have consistently done so in the past. Our record also shows that we have successfully dealt with multiple economic turmoils and during the ensuing recoveries have been able to acquire complementary enterprises for compounded growth. I will now turn the call over to Sue. Thank you, Sue. We would now like to take your questions. Brad, if you are ready to proceed with the question-and-answers, please go ahead. Not much. There is a little bit of -- in one of our businesses, like, which is our test and measurement, we make a protocol solutions -- provide protocol solutions to the electronics industry. There we have some new product protocols coming out. So people are little waiting for the new ones and maybe not buying the old loans. Other than that, where the book-to-bill is almost 1, oscilloscopes are doing well and in the T&Ms we feel alright. On the environmental, the only thing that there is a little softness that we are experiencing in the pharmaceutical market, where we supply a whole range of products. There -- but we are making that up by some of our air quality and other products that are doing well in this environment. So, overall, I think, we are doing okay. Yeah. Jim on the Instrumentation, if you put marine in, which we didn't talk about. Marine has got a book-to-bill of 1.12. So, it's very healthy. So because of that, it pulls Instrumentation as a whole above 1 to 1.04. Going to Digital Imaging, book-to-bill is less than 1, not substantially, but less than 1, primarily I think, because of some of the ground-based defense systems that we have which is about a little over 0.9. But having said that, we have some really large orders coming and we have also post-quarter had a large order for our Black Hornet, small air UAVs. When we had right after the quarter, as an example, we had $94 million award for those, and by the way, those are also in high demand in the Ukraine conflict. So, overall, I am encouraged with what's happening in Digital Imaging. There has been a little lag in the defense part, but that's coming up as the backlog is filling in and it's -- we have better orders this quarter, first quarter than we did last year. And then on the AD&E side, I think, book-to-bill is 1.05. Engineered Systems is close to 1, but that's lumpy. So, I think, we are going to be fine there. Overall for the company, I'd say when you add all those numbers up, it's slightly less than 1, maybe 0.96, 0.97, but that's not a great concern at this time. We are just being cautious as we always are, because of the uncertain times that everybody is facing. Other than that, I feel pretty good about our portfolio and its resilience. No. I understand, Jim. I think that's a good analysis. There might -- we are obviously chasing some, what we call, string of pearls M&As. We -- it's possible that we might end up with something more mid-size near the end of the year, but definitely with our balance sheet. We have right now -- we have drawn down on our line of credit, which is about 1.15 billion. We have only drawn down $25 million and it's sitting there. We have paid all of our debt that's coming due. We don't have any debt payments until 2024. And we have a lot of capacity for to do larger deals, as opportunity comes, and of course, we are looking at things. But you are right, larger deals take time and it would probably be more like early 2024 or sometime in 2024. Thanks, Jim. Good morning, Greg. Well, first, let's start with Q1. Organic -- and let's also do what you suggested, which is stay with the first, what we would call our historical Digital Imaging, which is DALSA, e2v and associated companies. There we had a healthy organic growth in Q1 of 6.2%, healthcare grew 9.2% and MEMS grew 8.8%. So, overall, we are very happy with that and some of those like smaller cycle vision systems had a healthy growth rate there. On the FLIR side of the equation, which would be the newer digital imaging, we had both positives or negatives. Overall, we had a contraction of about 4.8%. But that was primarily driven by our unmanned systems and primarily in the unmanned drone vehicle systems. As I said, after the quarter, we have had some very healthy awards in our UAVs, which are unmanned air vehicles. Surveillance declined and was plus 5%. Tomography was down a little bit -- a little under 4%, but uncooled and cooled cores, which are infrared cores, they were up 3%. And industrial vision system was up almost 19% -- over 19%. So it was a mixed bag. The drag down for that business was primarily in the defense and primarily on ground -- on unmanned ground systems. Now we had a little softness in tomography and maritime, which is our marine -- Raymarine businesses. But, overall, I think, we were okay. We just have to fill out the backlog for our unmanned vehicles, ground vehicles and we will be fine. Well, right now what I'd say is, I expect the margins to be up about 30 basis points for the year, let's start with the year and this is the overall Digital Imaging margin. So that would be pushed out on one side. I think, in Q2, we will improve sequentially on our margins and we should be fine and we are also going to take some price actions to make sure that we get there. On the overall for the company, we think the margins now would increase 40 basis points for the year and if we can have better price increases going forward, we should improve on that. So when I look at it, I'd say, look in our instruments businesses, we are going to have margin improvement for the year of almost 80 basis points, Digital Imaging about 30 basis points, Aerospace and Defense is so healthy that I will be happy to just keep our 27.1% operating margin. Engineered Systems will probably increase in 50 basis points, and overall, the segment's 40 basis points and the company about 40 basis points. That -- I hope that helps you. Thank you. Good morning, Elizabeth. Yeah. Sure. I think, overall, in Q1, defense was flat year-over-year and we think for the year, it will be probably low-to-mid single-digit growth in our defense businesses. The primary reason, again, I am saying the U.S. Government programs were flat, primarily driven, as I said, but the on ground vehicles -- unmanned ground vehicles. We think for the year we are probably growing in the mid-single-digits in our defense. For sure your excellence. Good morning, Joe. I think, basically, we have pulled in about $10 million and most of that was in Instruments, most of that was in our marine businesses. We shipped more underwater vehicles in Q1 that we had anticipated. We have some really good orders -- we actually have good orders for Q2 also. So that's -- that was just to ensure that we hit what we expected to. And also, as I said, that was affected by the fact that we are having improvements in our supply chain. We are seeing improvement, significant improvement and I expect that to continue the rest of the year based on what we are seeing and based on what the Chief of our Procurement is doing with various companies. So that's why we pulled it forward, we felt we could and did. Between the lines, I don't think it's going to be weaker, except that something terrible happens. It's -- I feel good about, look, as you know, we are always more conservative. I can go out and say we are going to make a lot more in our earnings per share and we probably could. On the other hand, with the uncertain environment that we are facing, with semiconductors being down, everybody is projecting semiconductors will recover in 2024, not this year, both equipment and supply. We grow -- we -- which obviously we serve those markets. I am being cautious as we always are. But I don't think the second -- right now I don't think the second half is going to be weaker. I think it's going to be actually stronger. If you look at earnings per share, they have to improve in the second half of the year for us to make the $19.10 that we projected or $19.20, if you want to take the high-end. Let me start with the free cash flow. We are going to beat last year's free cash flow by a couple of $100 million, let's just say, $850 million is our current estimate. I hope we can do better than that and we have just continued deleveraging the company, get ready for -- when all of this is uncertainty is behind us and use our capability and ability to buy things that have not there, perhaps, done as well in this environment. Coming back to the supply chain, we have seen improvement in Q1. Last year, in Q1, we -- our brokerage, we bought about $23 million of goods from brokerage and that does repay 70% premium let's say. This year first quarter, it's the same type of thing, cost us about half as much as that and so that's a savings, obviously. But more importantly, if you look at revenue that's being affected by the shortages. That is improving, which is much more comforting to me, because it makes our revenue projections a little more predictable, because we don't have -- we are not missing a lot of revenue, because we don't have parts. So there is improvement in the supply chain. We are seeing that. There is improvement in the premium that we are paying and also the fact that we are not going to miss as much revenue, because we can ship products, because they are sitting on the shelf, waiting for one or two parts. That's it. For sure. Good morning, Guy. Actually, what we have is a mixture. January, you are perfectly correct. We guided 50 basis points and now we are guiding 40 basis points. We are taking some guidance down in Instrumentation from January to today. We had over 100 basis points, we are closer to 80 basis points. Digital imaging, we are taking down about 10 basis points, all in. Aerospace and Defense, we are actually guiding -- we are guiding flat and we had it going down and so that's good. And then in Engineered Systems, we have a moderate up, which are smaller business, but we still have a moderate 45 basis points or so up. So, overall, I think, we will be up 40 basis points. Again, we hope to do better than that and the way to do better than that is if we can stick some more price increases in our portfolio, because inflation is moderating. Nevertheless, our wages are going up 4.5% to 5%. Our purchasing of direct and indirect goods is going up with inflation and so we have to catch-up a little more with price increases to make-up for those in order to keep or be able to increase our margins. That's the kind of uncertain part. How much can we gain from price increases? First quarter, we were okay. We made up what we paid out and we are a little positive actually. So, rest of the year, can we keep that pace of reasonable price increases to make up for inflation in both goods, as well as wages. I'd like to do better than that. I'd like to do better than that. For sure. Last year... ... we were negatively by 60 basis points. This year I hope to be positive. It's hard to tell at this point, but if I were to take the first quarter and project it out, I'd say half. So it will... Yeah. $35 million. Yeah. Yeah. Approximately. Again, that's a moving target. So, so far, we have been successful. As the semiconductor industry has gone down, as you can expect, the parts that were in shortage, some of them have become available. Some of them are at the harder parts to get. The FPGAs, et cetera are still harder to get. So it's a mixture. But things are improving, which makes me feel positive. No. I don't believe so. For sure. Good morning, Kristine. Yeah. The big picture is that we are able to buy more from the OEMs than from brokers.

For sure. Thank you, Brad. I appreciate that. I will now ask Jason to conclude our conference call."

            "content": "Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and then I will discuss our second quarter and full year 2023 outlook. In the first quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $203 million and primarily reflected higher accounts receivable collections compared with the first quarter of 2022. Free cash flow that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures was $178.6 million in the first quarter of 2023, compared with adjusted free cash flow of $58.7 million in 2022. The 2022 adjusted value excluded by $296.4 million payment to the Swedish Tax Authority related to a FLIR pre-acquisition tax reassessment. Capital expenditures were $24.4 million in the first quarter of 2023, compared with $21 million in 2022. Depreciation and amortization expense was $82.1 million for the first quarter of 2023, compared with $86.9 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $3.16 billion of net debt that is approximately $3.82 billion of debt less cash of $665.2 million. Stock-based compensation expense was $7.9 million in the first quarter of 2023, compared with $9 million in 2022. Turning to our outlook, management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the second quarter of 2023 will be in the range of $3.76 per share to $3.88 per share with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $4.56 to $4.66. And for the full year 2023, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $15.80 to $16.05. And on a non-GAAP basis, we are maintaining our prior outlook of $19 to $19.20. The 2023 full year estimated tax rate excluding discrete items is expected to be 23%. I will now pass the call back to Robert."

Later, there will be an opportunity for questions-and-answers with instructions given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, your conference call today is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to your first speaker, Jason VanWees. Please go ahead.\nJason VanWees: Thank you. Hello, and good morning, everyone. This is Jason VanWees, Vice Chairman. And I'd like to welcome everyone to Teledyne's third quarter 2024 earnings release conference call. We released our earnings earlier this morning. Joining us today are Teledyne's Executive Chairman, Robert Mehrabian; CEO, Edwin Roks, President and COO; George Bobb, and SVP, CFO, Steve Blackwood, and Melanie Cibik, EVP, Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary. After remarks by Robert, Edwin, George and Steve, who will ask for your questions. But of course, before we get started, our attorneys have remind to me to tell you that all forward-looking statements made this morning are subject to various assumptions, risks and caveats as noted in the earnings release and our periodic SEC filings, and of course, actual results may differ materially. Here's Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Jason, and good morning, and thank you for joining our earnings call. Teledyne achieved all-time record sales in the third quarter with revenues sequentially greater in each segment, allowing us to report overall year-over-year growth as we expected. We continue to see robust demand in our longer cycle defense, space and energy businesses. And at the same time, while year-over-year comparison remains challenging, sales for most of our short cycle commercial businesses have either stabilized or have begun to recover sequentially. Year-to-date, we approximately repurchased about $354 million of our stock. We completed 2 acquisitions for $125 million, repaid $450 million of gross debt. But our quarter end leverage has remained in the 1.7 times given record free cash flow over the last nine months. Orders were greater than sales for the fourth consecutive quarter and we once again ended the period with record backlog. Nevertheless, given the timing of future shipments against this backdrop, and some sales, we were able to accelerate into the third quarter. We continue to remain reasonably confident that quarterly sales will again increase sequentially in the fourth quarter, but only modestly compared with the third quarter. I will now turn the call over to Edwin, our CEO, who will further comment on the performance of our four business segments.\nEdwin Roks: Thank you, Robert. This is Edwin, and I will first report on the Digital Imaging segment, which represents a bit over 50% of Teledyne's portfolio. And like Teledyne, as a whole, this segment is a mix of lower cycle businesses, such as defense, space and health care, combined with shorter cycle markets, including industrial automation, semiconductor inspection and infrared components and cameras for applications ranging from factory condition monitoring to maritime navigation. Third quarter 2024 sales declined less than 1% compared to last year. Sales to industrial and machine vision markets declined year-over-year. However, this was partially offset by increased sales from FLIR. Both is commercial infrared imaging and defense base businesses as well as for Teledyne space-based infrared imaging detectors. Furthermore, for the fifth consecutive quarter, healthy margins the entire FLIR business portfolio helped us protect overall operating margin, even given the significant year-over-year reduction in sales of our typically highest contribution margin product lines. George will now report on the other three segments, which represents the balance of Teledyne.\nGeorge Bobb: Thanks, Edwin. The instrumentation segment consists of our Marine, Environmental and Test & Measurement businesses, which contributed a little under 25% of sales. For the total segment, overall third quarter sales increased 6.3% versus last year. Sales of Marine Instruments increased 24.1% in the quarter, primarily due to both strong offshore energy and subsea defense sales. Sales of Environmental instruments decreased 3.5%, primarily due to greater sales of water quality instruments, offset by lower sales of select laboratory instruments and emission monitoring systems. Sales in electronic custom measurement systems, which include digitizers and protocol analyzers decreased 8.6% year-over-year on a tough quarterly comparison versus 2023. Instrumentation operating margin increased in each product family in the third quarter, with overall operating margin increasing 155 basis points to 27.5% and 152 basis points on a non-GAAP basis to 28.6%. In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, which represents roughly 15% of Teledyne sales, third quarter sales increased 9.2%, driven by growth both commercial aerospace and defense electronics products. Overall segment operating profit increased year-over-year with GAAP segment margin increasing 117 basis points to 28.1% and 116 basis points on a non-GAAP basis to 28.2%. For the Engineered Systems segment, which contributes less than 10% to overall sales, third quarter revenue increased 9.4%. Segment operating profit also grew with segment margin increasing 70 basis points due to higher sales and a greater mix of manufacturing programs. I will now pass the call back to Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, George. I'll conclude with a few comments on strategy and capital allocation. Over the last several quarters, some of our markets have experienced weakness, but we lowered costs to protect margins in these businesses, while growing and increasing margin in those businesses where the environment was more favorable. During this period, we also opportunistically purchased our own stock. While our current $1.25 billion stock repurchase authorization remains active. We're also fortunate that our near-term acquisition pipeline is healthy. While there are always new challenges, I'm optimistic that we have begun to exit some of our more difficult quarterly comparisons and we will continue to grow both organically and through acquisitions. I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Steve.\nStephen Blackwood: Thank you, Robert, and good morning. I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert, and then I will discuss our fourth quarter and full-year 2024 outlook. In the third quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $249.8 million, compared with $278.2 million in 2023. Free cash flow, that is cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $228.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $255.2 million in 2023. Cash flow decreased in the third quarter due to higher income tax payments. Capital expenditures were $21.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared with $23 million in 2023. Depreciation and amortization expense was $76.9 million for both the third quarters of 2024 and 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow were $859.5 million and $804.8 million, respectively. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.24 billion of net debt. That is approximately $2.8 billion of debt less cash of $561 million. Now turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2024 will be in the range of $4.27 to $4.41 per share with non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $5.13 to $5.23. And for the full-year of 2024, we are raising our GAAP earnings per share outlook to $17.28 to $17.42, and we are narrowing our non-GAAP outlook to $19.35 to $19.45, the top end of our prior outlook range. I will now pass the call back to Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you. We would now like to take your questions. Operator, if you're ready to proceed with the question and answers, please go ahead. Did I lose our operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Jim Ricchiuti with Needham, go ahead.\nJim Ricchiuti: Hi, thank you, good morning. Robert, I think you alluded to some acceleration in sales perhaps coming pull-ins in Q4. Was that mainly in the defense area? Or were there some other markets where you saw that?\nRobert Mehrabian: No, I think it was primarily where we have the largest backlog, which would be the Defense businesses, a little bit from energy, but primarily different ratings.\nJim Ricchiuti: Got it. And just with respect to -- it sounds like you had a good quarter from an order standpoint. Can you give us any more color in terms of book-to-bill as it relates to the segments? And maybe how you're thinking about overall revenue growth versus what you maybe were thinking about a few months back?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. Let me start with the book-to-bill. Let me start with the overall first. Book-to-bill at the end of Q3 was about 1.48. Almost all of the businesses had healthy book-to-bill, except for one of our environmental businesses. Let me now go over those. In instruments, book-to-bill was about 1 with Marine, of course, being much higher and T&M coming along to over 1 and environmental below 1. In Digital Imaging, we are experiencing good book-to-bill numbers in what we call historical Teledyne, book-to-bill was 1.08 and FLIR had excellent book-to-bill of 1.17. Aerospace and Defense, 1.04 and Engineered Systems 1.82. Now regarding the revenue, we've decided that with all the uncertainty in the world today, starting with elections and then, of course, the various conflicts in the Middle East and Europe, we've decided that it's prudent to maintain the number -- the revenue number that we had in -- at the end of Q2 that we projected, which is about $5.624 billion or $5.6 billion. And we might do better, but right now, Jim, with all the uncertainty, it's prudent not to be too effervescent.\nJim Ricchiuti: Got it. Makes sense. Just one quick follow-up and I'll turn it over. Just with respect to the test and measurement business, are you seeing now -- it looked like you had some nice sequential growth. Do you feel that the weakness in the scopes business is behind you? Or is this still the critical analogic business strength contributing to this overall better results?\nRobert Mehrabian: In the third quarter, it was primarily the protocol I think we're a little hesitant about projecting the oscilloscope businesses. But usually, what happens at year-end, which would be our people do capital expenditures, and we pick up business in that domain. So we're hopeful that this year would be a repeat of last year with Q4 being higher than Q3.\nJim Ricchiuti: Thanks very much.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Jim.\nOperator: We will next go to the line of Greg Konrad with Jefferies, go ahead.\nGreg Konrad: Good morning.\nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning, Greg.\nGreg Konrad: Is there any way -- or can you parse Digital Imaging for the quarter and maybe what you're seeing across the different businesses? I mean, going into the quarter, we did see a couple of negative pre-announcement from some of your peers on the vision side. Any color on what you're seeing across the different vision end markets either from an order or just trend perspective?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. Let me slice it on the larger picture first, if I may. If you look at our two segments within that digital imaging. You have our historical digital imaging, which is DALSA 2B as well as our scientific imaging here. And then you have FLIR. So if I look at the big picture for Q3, and what we call our traditional historical digital imaging revenue was declined. Organic growth was negative, almost 9.8%, 9.9%. On the other hand, FLIR did exceptionally well. In the defense businesses in FLIR, which is 40% of FLIR, the growth was 8.2% and with all the subdivisions within there growing very healthy. In the FLIR commercial businesses, we were essentially flat, but we have to keep in mind that in the commercial FLIR businesses, we also do have a camera vision system, which is basically an aerial camera, two-dimensional aerial camera, which has much lower sales, just like the rest of our vision camera systems in DALSA 2B. So if we took that negative out FLIR industrial also grew. And overall, FLIR grew 3.2% with that negative coming. We had -- now we also going to DALSA 2B, what we're looking at there is basically a range of businesses some positive and some negative. Let me give you the positives first and the negatives, which we've talked about before. Interestingly enough, our micro-electromechanical systems or MEMS, is experiencing really good growth. Maybe that's the canary in the mine, because they're making a lot of products that are of relevance to the semiconductor industry. Also, as you may recall, we have in Aerospace and Defense business within our historical Digital Imaging. That did very well, grew almost 13%, where we had decreases were primarily in scientific and industrial vision systems and somewhat in healthcare. I think the healthcare is going to recover. And I think in the industrial and scientific vision systems, we believe that at least in the camera domain with bottomed out, and we have a slow recovery there is a portion of that deals with sensors where it make sensors for ourselves and other people, that's going to lag a little more. It may have bottomed out, but we don't see a recovery at this point. So overall, I would say DALSA, 2B, Teledyne Imaging were lagged a little bit with mixed progress in the different businesses FLIR carried the day for the overall Digital Imaging.\nGreg Konrad: And then, I mean, maybe it's a little bit early to talk about 2025, but it seems at least on the long cycle, whether that's defense or on marine, you've experienced positive book-to-bill on ramping sales. If you look out over the next year, can you maybe talk about how much visibility you have on the long-cycle businesses versus how you're thinking about the recovery in short cycle over the next year?\nRobert Mehrabian: The long-cycle businesses, Greg, assuming there is no catastrophes as anything like that can affect our long-cycle businesses. They're healthy. We think it's -- they're going to grow year-over-year. We have some really good program wins, both in our FLIR Defense, as well as in our Teledyne Imaging here in space and other programs. So we think those are going to grow. On the short-cycle businesses, we're just going through the first cut of our plans for next year. I think, I have to say it's a little too early to predict how that's going to work. I'll wait another couple of months and see what happens to the elections here, but more importantly, what kind of capital expenditures people exercise as they get near the end of the quarter, Q4.\nGreg Konrad: And then maybe just sneaking in one last one. I mean, if you think about defense across FLIR and engineered and A&D Electronics, what was defense up in the quarter?\nRobert Mehrabian: Defense U.S. government business was up organically maybe 2.5% plus, but we do have programs overseas that are doing really well. For example, Ukraine. We supply a whole range of products to them, also some to Middle East. And those programs have been very healthy, and we seem to be winning new programs, especially with offers that we have in counter UAV systems as well as our own UAVs, the small Black Hornet, which are doing really well. So we're overall very positive in that domain.\nGreg Konrad: Thank you.\nRobert Mehrabian: For sure.\nOperator: We'll move on to the line of Andrew Buscaglia with BNP, go ahead.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Buscaglia: I wanted to touch on -- Marine has been so strong all year. And you seem to have good visibility in that. I'm just wondering what sustainability of that growth is through next year? How much visibility do you have that you can maintain such a strong segment and then not -- maybe not see a little bit -- we're a little bit worried about challenging comps, but how do you see that playing out?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. Let me -- that's a good question. Marine, has had kind of variation in their book-to-bill with Q1 being very strong at 1.27% and then Q3 being around 1.04%. Here's the story on marine. We acquired about 23 small businesses to form our Marine group. Those range from interconnect for commercial oil exploration and oil production to defense. We have underwater vehicles, a whole range of them from floats to gliders to what we call the [Indiscernible] vehicles that are being used both in this country and in Europe. And then we have military programs that deal with our penetrators for the Virginia class submarine as an example. So the mix is very interesting. It's offshore energy maybe 30%, maybe more, if you put in exploration, it's close to 40%. But then we have science, construction, which are about 27%. And then we have defense, which is as much as 28%. So it's a distributor, it's a kind of mirrors, in some ways, Teledyne as a whole. Our expectations are that, that will remain strong. It is possible, though, that with the current projections, oil prices may decline significantly not as much as they did in 2014 to \u201816, but may decline. And if that happens, some of our production interconnects will go down, but the other businesses that we have there should remain healthy. Some positive about Marine for next year.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. No, that's helpful. And you guys made the comment in your press release about you've been buying back stock, but maybe M&A looks like it's perking up here. Can you comment a little bit more on that? And then specifically on any -- what are the size of these deals you're -- you might be seeing?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. Andrew, that's a very good question. And the reason it's timely, is for the first time, I would say since we acquired FLIR. We've done a couple of acquisitions every year, like this year, we've got a small business for our Marine. We bought Atomic, which is an imaging business for our overall imaging DALSA 2B. But there hasn't been that much activity or opportunity for us to do acquisition. Suddenly in the last month or so, the funnel seems to have opened up. And we are seeing more opportunities, especially outside digital imaging. For example, in our aerospace and defense as well our instruments. So we're kind of positively inclined to look at what we can do, how much power we have to make acquisitions. And frankly, we bought our stock when it was close to 52-weeks low. And we've continued buying it through Q3. But no, I think it's more likely that we will focus more highly on acquisitions, since we have the wherewithal to spend up to, I don't know, $2 billion to $3 billion if we want to. I don't know if we'll do that much, but we certainly are in the market to buy some smaller companies, which would be, let's say, in the $50 million range and maybe some things that are closer to $0.5 billion or more. It won't be anything as large as FLIR at this time, but -- there are many opportunities.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay, very helpful. Thank you.\nRobert Mehrabian: For sure.\nOperator: We'll move on to the line of Joe Giordano from TD Cowen, go ahead.\nJoe Giordano: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning.\nJoe Giordano: Can you just talk us through like what's contemplated in the guide for next quarter? And how you're thinking going forward about what's going on in Boeing?\nRobert Mehrabian: Let me start with Boeing because that's a subject that we kind of study and follow. We -- in our aerospace business, which serves Boeing, as well as other Airbus and a whole bunch of airline customers. We think the strike could risk for us. I'm hoping that it settles, but the risk for us is in the 737 MAX, where we have the data acquisition systems, that could hit us that's assuming the strike goes through the year through the quarter, that could hit us as much as on the upside, maybe $5 million in revenue from Q3 to Q4. But if the strike is settled, depending on timing, it could be less than that, maybe 2 or 3. So it's a little bit of a headwind for us. The other part of your question was for me. I kind of lost the trend of\u2026\nJoe Giordano: Boeing was the first question, I can move. You also mentioned in instrumentation, I think you indicated that there was a piece of that business on the environmental side that was weak with like orders below revenues. Can you give us a little bit more color on what that is and what type of applications or end markets that's facing?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. In the environmental side, we have two sets of businesses. One that deals with drug discovery and water quality et cetera. And that business has been okay. Where we've seen a little weakness is in our air quality monitoring, stack monitoring and basically looking at quality of products. There, we've had a little weakening. But and we depend a little bit on Middle East where they buy our systems, large systems. I think it might be a little weak a few million dollars, but I'm not that concerned about it. Nothing bad is going to happen. It's just -- we think Q4 should be a little better than Q3. So it doesn't concern me right now. An instrument as George said, includes Marine, Test and Measurement as well as environmental.\nJoe Giordano: And just last for me. The margins in DI were good. I think probably better than some excess. Can you give us maybe some color on to what drove that? And how are you thinking about margins to wrap up the year across the portfolio here?\nRobert Mehrabian: I think what you have is FLIR's margins really improved very much. And we're very healthy. And digital imaging as a whole remains relatively flat in margins. I would say maybe went down 30 basis points. If you look at the whole year, '24 versus '23, the same here, of course, as I mentioned, was FLIR. On the FLIR side, Edwin and his people were able to take cost out in our camera, especially in our camera and some health care businesses to compensate for lower revenue. And that helped protect some of the margins in those businesses. Some of our very high-margin businesses are in the camera business. So there's been combination. FLIR, very strong, Digital Imaging, the rest of Digital Imaging, taking the cost out. And I'm hoping that as the recovery comes -- we will not put that cost back in because we've had really good experience with defense. And of course, with Marine in the past, where we took the cost out, didn't put the cost back in very quickly and the margins there have turned out to be very healthy. So overall, I'm positive about digital imaging.\nJoe Giordano: Is there a way if you just kind of scale like how big a drag -- because I know those cameras and sensor businesses are very high margin. So like how much of a drag would you say currently those businesses are on what you're reporting for margins?\nRobert Mehrabian: I would say, overall, those businesses account for maybe $300 million, the ones that we're seeing the drag on -- and I would say it changes, but I'd say maybe $50 million in a drag in those businesses overall. Doesn't sound like a lot, but those are our highest margin businesses. And so when the revenue goes down, then the margin overall declines because of that. But as we've said before, we think the cameras have bottomed out, book-to-bill is better than one. Of course, remember, deal is low compared to last year and sensors will come eventually, but not right away.\nJoe Giordano: Thanks, guys.\nRobert Mehrabian: For sure.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Jordan Lane with Bank of America, go ahead.\nJordan Lane: Hey, good morning. Could you just give us some color around how you're thinking about FLIR's opportunity for new programs like Replicator 2.\nRobert Mehrabian: Let me take this we have a whole bunch of programs for FLIR that are doing really well. Let's start with the small UAVs. The small UAVs, we have the best system in the world. These are UAVs that are about six to seven inches in size. If they were flying in the room we do, you probably wouldn't hear it or notice it, but your picture can grow automatically, you'd get a good video of it up to 25 kilometers away. So that's really good. But on the other side, we also have a content UAV system that's being used in Europe. And another example is we have loitering UAVs that we're introducing, which can carry munitions. The difference between these and other people's munition enabled UAVs is that we can call this back if they reach the target and it's not an opportune time, so we can't recover the system. So overall, I think the whole UAV business for us is very strong. We also have a whole bunch of other programs like we just announced a program win in a suite of sensors that go on -- for chemical, biological, nuclear, we announced that we just won a program for $168 million. So FLIR especially FLIR defense, we're very positive. We have an excellent leader there in and we're very positive about that business.\nJordan Lane: Got it. And then so for Replicator 2 specifically counter UAS systems.\nRobert Mehrabian: We have a system in Europe right now with Casper which is being deployed, and it's successful. That's all I can say about that at this time.\nJordan Lane: Got it. Thank you so much.\nRobert Mehrabian: For sure. Operator [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Guy Hardwick with Freedom Capital Markets, go ahead.\nGuy Hardwick: Hi, good morning.\nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning, Guy.\nGuy Hardwick: Hi, a lot of my questions have been answered, but just sort of big picture. Digital Imaging margins peaked at 24% a few years back. If short cycle does recover at some point next year, what is the potential you think in terms of -- given the kind of what you've said about incremental margins and the higher margin mix of short cycle?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. Right now, if I look at Q3, if I look at Q3, our margins in overall digital imaging are about 22.6%. Last year, this time, they were more like 24.2%. So I would hazard a guess that as a minimum should be as good as last year. And if the short-cycle businesses do come back strongly, there's an opportunity for us to go above 25%, which would be very healthy for us. But I would maintain that with the uncertainty, especially in our longer recovery of our -- we'll go probably more 24% plus, 24.2%, 24.5%. But if the sensors recovered, then the margin would go higher.\nGuy Hardwick: Okay. Thank you. And just as a follow-up. Obviously, you indicated in the statement that you see short cycle has stabilized and maybe improving I assume that's because of booking trends. Can you maybe just give us a bit more color on booking trends in short cycle?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. In the last two to three months, our book-to-bill is above 1, let's say, 1.1. But I have to always keep in mind that when we talk book-to-bill, we're talking about build that's lower than it used to be. So I don't want to overstate that. It's not like book-to-bill at the height of the system. So -- but -- what that tells us is that we have reached the bottom and we recovery. The flip side on sensors themselves, the book-to-bill has not recovered yet. So we're a little -- people are a little more hesitant to spend money on sensors, because then they have the longer haul of developing cameras, whereas it's easier for them to acquire camera. The flip side, I have to say, again, going back to FLIR because FLIR has been so successful is that they have both long cycle and short cycle infrared cameras. In the long cycle, they're fixed cameras in the short cycle that had cameras. And we're very pleased that FLIR Industrial has done really well in that domain. And we expect that they'll continue to do so with new products with artificial intelligence enable cameras that bring decision -- make decisions easier for the customers, we're positive there as we are with the FLIR defense businesses.\nGuy Hardwick: And Robert, is that the point -- what used to be called point gray? Is that what you're referring to?\nRobert Mehrabian: No. Part gray is the one that's more matched to the cameras that we have in DALSA 2B. Actually, while we kind of put it in FLIR, it's more aligned with DALSA 2B from an organization standpoint, it reports to the leader that what I was talking about was the infrared offering is substantial.\nGuy Hardwick: Not visible light. Okay. Thank you, Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you.\nOperator: We have no further questions in queue at this time.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you. Operator, thank you very much. I'll now ask Jason to conclude our conference call, please.\nJason VanWees: Thanks, everyone. And thanks, Robert.

            "content": "Thank you, Robert. This is Edwin, and I will first report on the Digital Imaging segment, which represents a bit over 50% of Teledyne's portfolio. And like Teledyne, as a whole, this segment is a mix of lower cycle businesses, such as defense, space and health care, combined with shorter cycle markets, including industrial automation, semiconductor inspection and infrared components and cameras for applications ranging from factory condition monitoring to maritime navigation. Third quarter 2024 sales declined less than 1% compared to last year. Sales to industrial and machine vision markets declined year-over-year. However, this was partially offset by increased sales from FLIR. Both is commercial infrared imaging and defense base businesses as well as for Teledyne space-based infrared imaging detectors. Furthermore, for the fifth consecutive quarter, healthy margins the entire FLIR business portfolio helped us protect overall operating margin, even given the significant year-over-year reduction in sales of our typically highest contribution margin product lines. George will now report on the other three segments, which represents the balance of Teledyne."

Teledyne achieved all-time record sales in the third quarter with revenues sequentially greater in each segment, allowing us to report overall year-over-year growth as we expected. We continue to see robust demand in our longer cycle defense, space and energy businesses. And at the same time, while year-over-year comparison remains challenging, sales for most of our short cycle commercial businesses have either stabilized or have begun to recover sequentially. Year-to-date, we approximately repurchased about $354 million of our stock. We completed 2 acquisitions for $125 million, repaid $450 million of gross debt. But our quarter end leverage has remained in the 1.7 times given record free cash flow over the last nine months. Orders were greater than sales for the fourth consecutive quarter and we once again ended the period with record backlog. Nevertheless, given the timing of future shipments against this backdrop, and some sales, we were able to accelerate into the third quarter. We continue to remain reasonably confident that quarterly sales will again increase sequentially in the fourth quarter, but only modestly compared with the third quarter. I will now turn the call over to Edwin, our CEO, who will further comment on the performance of our four business segments. Thank you, George. I'll conclude with a few comments on strategy and capital allocation. Over the last several quarters, some of our markets have experienced weakness, but we lowered costs to protect margins in these businesses, while growing and increasing margin in those businesses where the environment was more favorable. During this period, we also opportunistically purchased our own stock. While our current $1.25 billion stock repurchase authorization remains active. We're also fortunate that our near-term acquisition pipeline is healthy. While there are always new challenges, I'm optimistic that we have begun to exit some of our more difficult quarterly comparisons and we will continue to grow both organically and through acquisitions. I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Steve. Thank you. We would now like to take your questions. Operator, if you're ready to proceed with the question and answers, please go ahead. Did I lose our operator? No, I think it was primarily where we have the largest backlog, which would be the Defense businesses, a little bit from energy, but primarily different ratings. Yes. Let me start with the book-to-bill. Let me start with the overall first. Book-to-bill at the end of Q3 was about 1.48. Almost all of the businesses had healthy book-to-bill, except for one of our environmental businesses. Let me now go over those. In instruments, book-to-bill was about 1 with Marine, of course, being much higher and T&M coming along to over 1 and environmental below 1. In Digital Imaging, we are experiencing good book-to-bill numbers in what we call historical Teledyne, book-to-bill was 1.08 and FLIR had excellent book-to-bill of 1.17. Aerospace and Defense, 1.04 and Engineered Systems 1.82. Now regarding the revenue, we've decided that with all the uncertainty in the world today, starting with elections and then, of course, the various conflicts in the Middle East and Europe, we've decided that it's prudent to maintain the number -- the revenue number that we had in -- at the end of Q2 that we projected, which is about $5.624 billion or $5.6 billion. And we might do better, but right now, Jim, with all the uncertainty, it's prudent not to be too effervescent. In the third quarter, it was primarily the protocol I think we're a little hesitant about projecting the oscilloscope businesses. But usually, what happens at year-end, which would be our people do capital expenditures, and we pick up business in that domain. So we're hopeful that this year would be a repeat of last year with Q4 being higher than Q3. Thank you, Jim. Good morning, Greg. Yes. Let me slice it on the larger picture first, if I may. If you look at our two segments within that digital imaging. You have our historical digital imaging, which is DALSA 2B as well as our scientific imaging here. And then you have FLIR. So if I look at the big picture for Q3, and what we call our traditional historical digital imaging revenue was declined. Organic growth was negative, almost 9.8%, 9.9%. On the other hand, FLIR did exceptionally well. In the defense businesses in FLIR, which is 40% of FLIR, the growth was 8.2% and with all the subdivisions within there growing very healthy. In the FLIR commercial businesses, we were essentially flat, but we have to keep in mind that in the commercial FLIR businesses, we also do have a camera vision system, which is basically an aerial camera, two-dimensional aerial camera, which has much lower sales, just like the rest of our vision camera systems in DALSA 2B. So if we took that negative out FLIR industrial also grew. And overall, FLIR grew 3.2% with that negative coming. We had -- now we also going to DALSA 2B, what we're looking at there is basically a range of businesses some positive and some negative. Let me give you the positives first and the negatives, which we've talked about before. Interestingly enough, our micro-electromechanical systems or MEMS, is experiencing really good growth. Maybe that's the canary in the mine, because they're making a lot of products that are of relevance to the semiconductor industry. Also, as you may recall, we have in Aerospace and Defense business within our historical Digital Imaging. That did very well, grew almost 13%, where we had decreases were primarily in scientific and industrial vision systems and somewhat in healthcare. I think the healthcare is going to recover. And I think in the industrial and scientific vision systems, we believe that at least in the camera domain with bottomed out, and we have a slow recovery there is a portion of that deals with sensors where it make sensors for ourselves and other people, that's going to lag a little more. It may have bottomed out, but we don't see a recovery at this point. So overall, I would say DALSA, 2B, Teledyne Imaging were lagged a little bit with mixed progress in the different businesses FLIR carried the day for the overall Digital Imaging. The long-cycle businesses, Greg, assuming there is no catastrophes as anything like that can affect our long-cycle businesses. They're healthy. We think it's -- they're going to grow year-over-year. We have some really good program wins, both in our FLIR Defense, as well as in our Teledyne Imaging here in space and other programs. So we think those are going to grow. On the short-cycle businesses, we're just going through the first cut of our plans for next year. I think, I have to say it's a little too early to predict how that's going to work. I'll wait another couple of months and see what happens to the elections here, but more importantly, what kind of capital expenditures people exercise as they get near the end of the quarter, Q4. Defense U.S. government business was up organically maybe 2.5% plus, but we do have programs overseas that are doing really well. For example, Ukraine. We supply a whole range of products to them, also some to Middle East. And those programs have been very healthy, and we seem to be winning new programs, especially with offers that we have in counter UAV systems as well as our own UAVs, the small Black Hornet, which are doing really well. So we're overall very positive in that domain. For sure. Good morning, Andrew. Yes. Let me -- that's a good question. Marine, has had kind of variation in their book-to-bill with Q1 being very strong at 1.27% and then Q3 being around 1.04%. Here's the story on marine. We acquired about 23 small businesses to form our Marine group. Those range from interconnect for commercial oil exploration and oil production to defense. We have underwater vehicles, a whole range of them from floats to gliders to what we call the [Indiscernible] vehicles that are being used both in this country and in Europe. And then we have military programs that deal with our penetrators for the Virginia class submarine as an example. So the mix is very interesting. It's offshore energy maybe 30%, maybe more, if you put in exploration, it's close to 40%. But then we have science, construction, which are about 27%. And then we have defense, which is as much as 28%. So it's a distributor, it's a kind of mirrors, in some ways, Teledyne as a whole. Our expectations are that, that will remain strong. It is possible, though, that with the current projections, oil prices may decline significantly not as much as they did in 2014 to \u201816, but may decline. And if that happens, some of our production interconnects will go down, but the other businesses that we have there should remain healthy. Some positive about Marine for next year. Yes. Andrew, that's a very good question. And the reason it's timely, is for the first time, I would say since we acquired FLIR. We've done a couple of acquisitions every year, like this year, we've got a small business for our Marine. We bought Atomic, which is an imaging business for our overall imaging DALSA 2B. But there hasn't been that much activity or opportunity for us to do acquisition. Suddenly in the last month or so, the funnel seems to have opened up. And we are seeing more opportunities, especially outside digital imaging. For example, in our aerospace and defense as well our instruments. So we're kind of positively inclined to look at what we can do, how much power we have to make acquisitions. And frankly, we bought our stock when it was close to 52-weeks low. And we've continued buying it through Q3. But no, I think it's more likely that we will focus more highly on acquisitions, since we have the wherewithal to spend up to, I don't know, $2 billion to $3 billion if we want to. I don't know if we'll do that much, but we certainly are in the market to buy some smaller companies, which would be, let's say, in the $50 million range and maybe some things that are closer to $0.5 billion or more. It won't be anything as large as FLIR at this time, but -- there are many opportunities. For sure. Good morning. Let me start with Boeing because that's a subject that we kind of study and follow. We -- in our aerospace business, which serves Boeing, as well as other Airbus and a whole bunch of airline customers. We think the strike could risk for us. I'm hoping that it settles, but the risk for us is in the 737 MAX, where we have the data acquisition systems, that could hit us that's assuming the strike goes through the year through the quarter, that could hit us as much as on the upside, maybe $5 million in revenue from Q3 to Q4. But if the strike is settled, depending on timing, it could be less than that, maybe 2 or 3. So it's a little bit of a headwind for us. The other part of your question was for me. I kind of lost the trend of... Yes. In the environmental side, we have two sets of businesses. One that deals with drug discovery and water quality et cetera. And that business has been okay. Where we've seen a little weakness is in our air quality monitoring, stack monitoring and basically looking at quality of products. There, we've had a little weakening. But and we depend a little bit on Middle East where they buy our systems, large systems. I think it might be a little weak a few million dollars, but I'm not that concerned about it. Nothing bad is going to happen. It's just -- we think Q4 should be a little better than Q3. So it doesn't concern me right now. An instrument as George said, includes Marine, Test and Measurement as well as environmental. I think what you have is FLIR's margins really improved very much. And we're very healthy. And digital imaging as a whole remains relatively flat in margins. I would say maybe went down 30 basis points. If you look at the whole year, '24 versus '23, the same here, of course, as I mentioned, was FLIR. On the FLIR side, Edwin and his people were able to take cost out in our camera, especially in our camera and some health care businesses to compensate for lower revenue. And that helped protect some of the margins in those businesses. Some of our very high-margin businesses are in the camera business. So there's been combination. FLIR, very strong, Digital Imaging, the rest of Digital Imaging, taking the cost out. And I'm hoping that as the recovery comes -- we will not put that cost back in because we've had really good experience with defense. And of course, with Marine in the past, where we took the cost out, didn't put the cost back in very quickly and the margins there have turned out to be very healthy. So overall, I'm positive about digital imaging. I would say, overall, those businesses account for maybe $300 million, the ones that we're seeing the drag on -- and I would say it changes, but I'd say maybe $50 million in a drag in those businesses overall. Doesn't sound like a lot, but those are our highest margin businesses. And so when the revenue goes down, then the margin overall declines because of that. But as we've said before, we think the cameras have bottomed out, book-to-bill is better than one. Of course, remember, deal is low compared to last year and sensors will come eventually, but not right away. For sure. Let me take this we have a whole bunch of programs for FLIR that are doing really well. Let's start with the small UAVs. The small UAVs, we have the best system in the world. These are UAVs that are about six to seven inches in size. If they were flying in the room we do, you probably wouldn't hear it or notice it, but your picture can grow automatically, you'd get a good video of it up to 25 kilometers away. So that's really good. But on the other side, we also have a content UAV system that's being used in Europe. And another example is we have loitering UAVs that we're introducing, which can carry munitions. The difference between these and other people's munition enabled UAVs is that we can call this back if they reach the target and it's not an opportune time, so we can't recover the system. So overall, I think the whole UAV business for us is very strong. We also have a whole bunch of other programs like we just announced a program win in a suite of sensors that go on -- for chemical, biological, nuclear, we announced that we just won a program for $168 million. So FLIR especially FLIR defense, we're very positive. We have an excellent leader there in and we're very positive about that business. We have a system in Europe right now with Casper which is being deployed, and it's successful. That's all I can say about that at this time. For sure. Operator [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Guy Hardwick with Freedom Capital Markets, go ahead. Good morning, Guy. Yes. Right now, if I look at Q3, if I look at Q3, our margins in overall digital imaging are about 22.6%. Last year, this time, they were more like 24.2%. So I would hazard a guess that as a minimum should be as good as last year. And if the short-cycle businesses do come back strongly, there's an opportunity for us to go above 25%, which would be very healthy for us. But I would maintain that with the uncertainty, especially in our longer recovery of our -- we'll go probably more 24% plus, 24.2%, 24.5%. But if the sensors recovered, then the margin would go higher. Yes. In the last two to three months, our book-to-bill is above 1, let's say, 1.1. But I have to always keep in mind that when we talk book-to-bill, we're talking about build that's lower than it used to be. So I don't want to overstate that. It's not like book-to-bill at the height of the system. So -- but -- what that tells us is that we have reached the bottom and we recovery. The flip side on sensors themselves, the book-to-bill has not recovered yet. So we're a little -- people are a little more hesitant to spend money on sensors, because then they have the longer haul of developing cameras, whereas it's easier for them to acquire camera. The flip side, I have to say, again, going back to FLIR because FLIR has been so successful is that they have both long cycle and short cycle infrared cameras. In the long cycle, they're fixed cameras in the short cycle that had cameras. And we're very pleased that FLIR Industrial has done really well in that domain. And we expect that they'll continue to do so with new products with artificial intelligence enable cameras that bring decision -- make decisions easier for the customers, we're positive there as we are with the FLIR defense businesses. No. Part gray is the one that's more matched to the cameras that we have in DALSA 2B. Actually, while we kind of put it in FLIR, it's more aligned with DALSA 2B from an organization standpoint, it reports to the leader that what I was talking about was the infrared offering is substantial. Thank you. Thank you. Operator, thank you very much. I'll now ask Jason to conclude our conference call, please."

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert, and then I will discuss our fourth quarter and full-year 2024 outlook. In the third quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $249.8 million, compared with $278.2 million in 2023. Free cash flow, that is cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $228.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $255.2 million in 2023. Cash flow decreased in the third quarter due to higher income tax payments. Capital expenditures were $21.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared with $23 million in 2023. Depreciation and amortization expense was $76.9 million for both the third quarters of 2024 and 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow were $859.5 million and $804.8 million, respectively. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.24 billion of net debt. That is approximately $2.8 billion of debt less cash of $561 million. Now turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2024 will be in the range of $4.27 to $4.41 per share with non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $5.13 to $5.23. And for the full-year of 2024, we are raising our GAAP earnings per share outlook to $17.28 to $17.42, and we are narrowing our non-GAAP outlook to $19.35 to $19.45, the top end of our prior outlook range. I will now pass the call back to Robert."

For the total segment, overall third quarter sales increased 6.3% versus last year. Sales of Marine Instruments increased 24.1% in the quarter, primarily due to both strong offshore energy and subsea defense sales. Sales of Environmental instruments decreased 3.5%, primarily due to greater sales of water quality instruments, offset by lower sales of select laboratory instruments and emission monitoring systems. Sales in electronic custom measurement systems, which include digitizers and protocol analyzers decreased 8.6% year-over-year on a tough quarterly comparison versus 2023. Instrumentation operating margin increased in each product family in the third quarter, with overall operating margin increasing 155 basis points to 27.5% and 152 basis points on a non-GAAP basis to 28.6%. In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, which represents roughly 15% of Teledyne sales, third quarter sales increased 9.2%, driven by growth both commercial aerospace and defense electronics products. Overall segment operating profit increased year-over-year with GAAP segment margin increasing 117 basis points to 28.1% and 116 basis points on a non-GAAP basis to 28.2%. For the Engineered Systems segment, which contributes less than 10% to overall sales, third quarter revenue increased 9.4%.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to your host, Jason VanWees. Please go ahead, sir.\nJason VanWees: Good morning, everyone. I'm Jason, VanWees, Vice Chairman. I'd like to welcome everyone to Teledyne's second quarter 2024 earnings release conference call. We released our earnings earlier this morning before the market opened. Joining me today are Teledyne's Executive Chairman, Robert Mehrabian; CEO, Edwin Roks; Senior Vice President and CFO, Steve Blackwood; and Melanie Cibik, EVP, General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary. President and COO, George Bobb would have joined us, but after getting stuck in airports late last week in the weekend, George came back with COVID and is being isolated. Anyway, after remarks by Robert, Edwin and Steve, we will ask your questions. However, before we get started, our attorneys have reminded me to tell you that all forward-looking statements made this morning are subject to various discussions with some caveats as noted in the earnings release and our periodic SEC filings. And of course, actual results may differ materially. In order to avoid potential selective disclosures, this call is simultaneously being webcast and a replay, both via webcast and dial-in will be available for about one month. Here is Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Jason, and good morning, and thank you for joining our earnings call. In the second quarter, Teledyne achieved all-time record free cash flow allowing us to deploy approximately $852 million through July on debt repayment, acquisitions and stock repurchases. Non-GAAP operating margin increased from last year and increased in each of our three largest segments. Total sales and earnings increased sequentially and exceeded our most recent expectations, although year-over-year comparisons remain especially difficult in certain commercial markets, such as industrial automation and electronic test and measurement. Nevertheless, strong defense-related sales at Teledyne FLIR and our own legacy space based infrared imaging business partially offset the expected declines in industrial imaging systems. Furthermore, despite the anticipated year-over-year decline in certain instrumentation product lines, total instrumentation sales were a second quarter record due to exceptional performance of our marine instrumentation businesses. Primarily driven by our aerospace and defense businesses, orders were greater than sales for the third consecutive quarter and we ended the period with record backlog. Therefore, we're reasonably confident that quarterly sales will again increase sequentially and with a return to year-over-year sales growth in the second half of 2024. Finally, even with the significant capital deployment in the second quarter, our quarter end leverage remained at 1.7 and we plan to continue stock repurchases in the balance of 2024 as well as pursue acquisitions. I would now turn the call to Edwin who will further comment on the performance of our four segments.\nEdwin Roks: Thank you, Robert. This is Edwin and I will report on the - first report on the digital imaging segment, which represents 54% of Teledyne's portfolio. And like Teledyne as a whole, this segment is a mix of longer cycle businesses such as defense, space and healthcare combined with shorter cycle markets, including industrial automation, semiconductor inspection and infrared components and cameras for applications ranging from factory condition monitoring to maritime navigation. Second quarter 2024 sales declined 6.8% compared with last year. As expected, sales to industrial machine vision markets declined approximately 30% year-over-year. However, this was partially offset by increased sales from FLIR defense and from generalized space-based infrared imaging detectors. Furthermore, for the fourth consecutive quarter, healthy margins across the entire FLIR business portfolio helped us protect overall operating margin even given the significant year-over-year production in sales of our typically highest contribution margin product lines. I will now report on the other three segments, which represent the remaining 46% of Teledyne. The instrumentation segment consists of marine, environmental and test and measurement businesses which contributed a little over 24% of sales. For the total segment, overall second quarter sales increased 1.6% versus last year. Sales of marine instruments increased 60% in the quarter, primarily due to strong offshore energy and subsea defense. Sales of environmental instruments decreased 1.6% with greater sales of drugs discovery and laboratory instruments, offset by lower sales of processed gas, emission monitoring systems and gas flame safety analyzers. Sales of electronics and measurement systems which include oscilloscopes, digitizers and protocol analyzers decreased 50.8% year-over-year on a tough quarterly comparison versus 2023. Overall instrumentation segment operating profit increased in the second quarter with GAAP operating margins increasing on a 36 basis points to 26.1% and 134 basis points on a non-GAAP basis to 27.2%. In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment which represents 14% of Teledyne sales, second quarter sales increased 4.5% driven by the growth of commercial aerospace and defense microwave products. GAAP and non-GAAP segment operating profits increased year-over-year with segment margin increasing approximately 77 basis points. For the engineered system segment which contributes 8% to overall sales, second quarter revenue decreased 8.7% and operating profit was impacted by lower sales and unfavorable program mix. I will now pass the call back to Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Edwin. In conclusion, our second quarter performance was a testament to the strength of our balanced business portfolio. We also continued our proven strategy of increasing margin in those businesses which are growing while reasonably protecting margins in businesses with more challenging markets. Our current full year earnings outlook is identical to the last quarter with some markets such as industrial automation and electronic test and measurement remaining difficult, although year-over-year comparisons are easier in the second half while the outlook for our global defense, energy and aerospace businesses remain strong and is supported by our record backlog. Finally, we continue to review acquisition opportunities, but given the strength of our balance sheet and cash flow, we also plan to continue purchasing our own stock under our current $1.25 billion authorization. I will now turn the call over to Steve.\nStephen Blackwood: Thank you, Robert, and good morning. I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and then I will discuss our third quarter and full year 2024 outlook. In the second quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $318.7 million compared with $190.5 million in 2023. Free cash flow that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures was $301 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared with $163.2 million in 2023. Cash flow increased in the second quarter due to stronger working capital performance. Capital expenditures were $17.7 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared with $27.3 million in 2023. Depreciation and amortization expense was $77.8 million for the second quarter of 2024 compared with $80 million in 2023. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.35 billion of net debt that is approximately $2.8 billion of debt less cash of $443.2 million. Now, turning to our outlook. Management currently believes the GAAP earnings per share in the third quarter of 2024 will be in the range of $4.02 to $4.16 with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $4.90 to $5 and for the full year 2024, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $15.87 to $16.13 and we are affirming our prior non-GAAP outlook of $19.25 to $19.45. I will now pass the call back to Robert.\nRobert Mehrabian: We would like to take your questions. John, if you're ready to proceed with the questions and answers, please go ahead.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from Jim Ricchiuti with Needham and Company. Please go ahead.\nJim Ricchiuti: Hi. Thank you. Good morning. I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the bookings, the book-to-bill. It sounds like the positive book-to-bill was largely driven by the aerospace and defense business, but I wonder if you could just elaborate on what you saw from an order standpoint in the quarter.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Jim. First, you're correct in generally overall, but I think our overall book-to-bill was 1.07. It was -- digital imaging was close to 1, like 0.98. Instrumentation was just over 1 at 1.04. But as you said, aerospace and defense was very strong at 1.41 and engineered systems also strong at 1.25 resulting in a combined book-to-bill of 1.07 for the complete company.\nJim Ricchiuti: Got it. That's helpful, Robert. If we think about the backlog, but the longer cycle backlog and as it converts into the second half to revenue, is that mainly defense converting? I'm wondering what other areas of the longer cycle business might drive growth in the second half? And maybe related, what kind of expectations do you have for the short cycle business in the back half? Thank you.\nRobert Mehrabian: Let me start with the first part. It's defense is obviously as you said very important and is the long cycle business that's doing really well. The second area is energy and that's our marine instruments businesses. They've done exceptionally well for the year and will continue to do so. And then the third area is aerospace. Both aerospace from the computers that we have on commercial aircraft through aerospace and the aerospace from our imaging sensor businesses. Now going back to the commercial shorter cycle businesses, what we're seeing is we think that digital imaging as a whole, total digital imaging should be relatively flat in the second half of the year. That's year-over-year flat, which is good because it declined in the first half of the year. Some of the recovery that we're seeing is early signs that come from our MEMS, microelectronic mechanical systems, which are kind of like the canaries in the mine. We are seeing some uptick in orders there, which is encouraging especially from semiconductor industry. And then we also have some indications that our machine vision systems as example have stabilized and book-to-bill has reached 1 or a little better, which is encouraging. We're hoping that these trends will continue with semiconductor coming back and inspection businesses that we have picking up and some of our high end thermal cameras also doing better than they have. So I think overall, we're positively inclined towards the second half of the year.\nJim Ricchiuti: Got it. That's helpful, Robert. Thank you.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Jim.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia with BNP. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Hi, good morning, guys.\nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Yes. So long that line of questioning. Can you talk a little bit about your test to measurement has been a tough market, a little bit weaker in Q2, but in line I think with what you guys were suggesting. How do you see that playing out? Do you still feel like your expectations for down 10% for the year are valid?\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. About that. Not to be picky, but we have 9.9%, which is very close to your 10%. But that's also tailored to cities there. In our test and measurement as you know, Andrew, we have two businesses. One is the oscilloscope business and the other one is our protocol business, which are basically rules for communication between devices and devices on the cloud. That business, the protocol business is coming back faster and is doing better, a little bit better. It's the oscilloscope business which is lagging. Having said that, we took cost out in that business. And fortunately for us, we took the cost out very early and the margins of instruments have remained pretty well. We anticipate, for example, about almost 94 basis points improvement in our total instrument portfolio even with part of CNM being weak, partially because our marine is very strong and our environmental businesses are doing okay. So I don't know whether that answers your question fully or not.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Yes. No, that's helpful. Maybe sticking with instrumentation. Yes, marine has been really strong. Presumably you have good visibility there. Can you parse out what's driving that exactly and the confidence that, that continues into the second half? How should we think about that for the full year?\nRobert Mehrabian: Two areas. First is the offshore oil production and discovery. We have -- as you know, we have instruments that are deployed in streamers to look down at acoustic signals that bounce from the ocean floor and determine whether there's oil and gas there. That's a strong business and continues to be. The other part is, of course, our connector businesses. They are doing really well. Actually, we're almost at capacity in that business. And then the second part of the marine business is the defense part of the business. As you know, we have defense unmanned vehicles, underwater vehicles. We also provide connectors for submarines. That business is doing really well and our underwater vehicle businesses are doing really well. So it's a combination of offshore oil production and discovery and defense and security.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. Thank you.\nRobert Mehrabian: For sure.\nOperator: Next is Conor Walters with Jefferies. Go ahead, please.\nConor Walters: Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Just to start off, any updates of the free cash flow guidance for the year despite somewhat constrained top line in the first half? Free cash flow is tracking well ahead of your $1 billion target. What do you expect for the year and what are some of the drivers just given such a strong start in the first half?\nRobert Mehrabian: That's a good question, Conor. I don't want to be effervescent about that because in the first two quarters, we've generated $576 million of free cash flow. I think in the second half, we have some bond payments coming due. We have some taxes coming due. So I think it's going to be less. We are hoping that our free cash flow would be above $900 million. That's where we're sitting right now with the front end being heavily loaded. But having said that, we're confident enough in our cash position to continue our purchases of our own stock.\nConor Walters: Okay, got it. That's very clear. And maybe just jumping over into defense a little bit. More. We've seen a lot of technology announcements for Teledyne, some new wins in areas such as loitering munitions. Just given this, how are you thinking about defense going forward? And any divergence within the exposure and A&D electronics and engineered versus where you are in digital imaging?\nRobert Mehrabian: No. I think let's just look at the major programs that announcements that keep coming out. There's a whole slew of them. The most important one, I would say, that's new is our loitering unmanned aerial vehicle, which now is weaponized, what we call Rogue 1 and we already have our first order for over 100 systems for that and it competes very well against the competition, both in terms of precision, but also with the fact that you can send these vehicles to target. And if you decide to bring them back, you can do that easily. That's a distinguishing feature and of course, the other part is the accuracy. The next example as you may know is again staying with vehicles are very small mini drones. We saw the whole bunch of them over the years, what we call Black Hornet streets, which are about 6 inches in size. Black Hornet 4 was introduced this year and we got the first production order for about almost 1,000 systems recently. We expect that, that program will continue and be a very strong contributor to our defense businesses and these orders are from the U.S. government right now. Then we have -- as I mentioned, we have the inserts for the Virginia ore connectors for the Virginia and Colombia class submarines. Those businesses have really good backlogs and are doing well. We also have drones that come out of our Canadian operations, the R70 and R80. We have orders for those and we also have countered UAV systems that are being deployed in Europe. And finally, that's just an example. We have a very lightweight uncooled target recognition system, what we call the FWS family of weapons systems. We have the development order for it and we have the first production order for it. Those two combined over $70 million and expect about $500 million in IDIQ contracts. Those are just examples. I think our defense business especially FLIR defense has picked up the pace very well and we're very excited about that.\nConor Walters: Great. That's super helpful. I'll leave it there.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJoe Giordano: Hi. Good morning. Robert, you said you're seeing some stability in the machine vision business, which is good to hear. I think you mentioned it was down 30 year-on-year. What was that compared to 2Q and what's the expectation for, like, 3Q and 4Q. What was that versus 1Q and what's the expectation in 3Q, 4Q versus the second quarter?\nRobert Mehrabian: Well, I think basically, they were down 30 in Q1 and Q2 as Edwin indicated. I think that's now going to be about 10 and 10 in Q3 and Q4. So for the year would be about 20. So it's going to improve, partially it's improving partially because comps are getting easier to be frank and very straightforward about it. That market began softening last year in Q3, so the comps are going to get easier. But also we're seeing as I indicated before, we're seeing some uptick in certain areas and as you know, semiconductor industry is coming back and coming back strong and our products are used in the inspection systems all over the world.\nJoe Giordano: Just to be clear, like are the dollars for that business in 2Q higher than 1Q and will they be higher in like the second half dollars versus one half dollars?\nRobert Mehrabian: I think our expectations right now are that they'd be relatively flat, maybe a little better in the second half. I don't want to be -- certainly, in Q4, we expect it to be stronger. But right now, we have to be very careful not to drink our own bath water because while things are looking well, good, we have both the vision systems, which are visual systems as well as our infrared systems. So we have -- we're looking at the combo there and I think flat would be a good word with Q4 picking up.\nJoe Giordano: Okay. We're also hearing some people talk about like Boeing finally telling suppliers to cool off a little bit. I know that their production has gone down. But they've been still receiving components from suppliers at the same pace. And are you seeing any of that where they're pushing back a little bit?\nRobert Mehrabian: We're not seeing that as much. There's some rotation going on there in our OEM products. But we're not only supplying OEMs, we're also the aftermarket business there is very important to us and we're doing okay there. I think overall, our aerospace business is pretty healthy.\nJoe Giordano: Good. I'll get back in queue. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Next question is from Guy Hardwick with Freedom Capital Markets. Go ahead, please.\nGuy Hardwick: Hi. Good morning.\nRobert Mehrabian: Good morning, Guy.\nGuy Hardwick: Going back to the free cash flow issue, what's your sense for when you look back on this year, where you would have deployed the free cash flow in terms of acquisition, share repurchases and debt repayments?\nRobert Mehrabian: Well, Guy, we think because our free cash flow was so strong in the first two quarters and you have to also keep in mind our liabilities which is our debt, our debt is set up pretty well. It's fixed. It's -- only we will pay -- have to pay like $150 million in October time frame. Other than that, our payments start in 2026. And if you roll everything that we owe over the years, our interest payments are about 2.35%. Now for the year, we think that we will continue buying our stock, maybe, depends on the stock price, right? We bought back quite a bit in the first half of the year. We expect to continue to do that, but we're also looking at acquisitions at the same time. So we're balancing the two as we go forward right now because of our very serious efforts in 80/20 and ability to generate cash. We think that we're in a really good situation. We just renewed our line of credit for another five years. We haven't touched it. We have about $1.2 billion untouched. So with no debt payments, big ones coming due, our interest rates being 2.35% over the many years, we feel good that we can do whatever we want. Right now, focused on buying back stock and looking at the acquisitions as well.\nGuy Hardwick: Okay. Thank you. And just so as a follow up, would you mind updating us on your margin expectations by segment or has nothing changed since the last quarter?\nRobert Mehrabian: No. I can do it if you wish, I can do it for the full year. We think that for the full year in instruments as an example, it should be up about 90 to 100 basis points. It's pretty healthy for us. It'll go from what was last year at 26.6% to 27.5% plus. In digital imaging, we think that margins for the year may go down a little bit even though I mentioned the headwind that we have there. But if you look at the whole portfolio while margins went down in our DALSA 2B businesses, they went up significantly in our FLIR businesses. So we think they might go down modestly, maybe 30 basis points for the year, maybe 20. Aerospace and defense, I think we're doing really well, maybe over 100 basis points and engineered systems which is our smallest segment, I think margins are going to be going down primarily because of the first half. And overall, we think the segment margins should be about 14, 15 basis points up from last year considering all the headwinds that we have. That's pretty good.\nGuy Hardwick: Okay. Thank you.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from Rob Jamieson with Vertical Research Partners. Go ahead, please.\nRob Jamieson: Hi. Thanks, guys. I guess, just real quick one clarification just with digital imaging. Should we -- in the next two quarters, 3Q, 4Q, is there much differential between the quarters on margin to kind of get to that down 20, 30 basis points?\nRobert Mehrabian: Well, let me see if I can answer that well. I think in the first half if you look at Q1, the margins were about 21.8% overall in digital imaging. You look at Q2, they dropped about 20 basis points to 21.6%. We think in Q3, it will pick up to over 22%, 22.2% maybe and then go as high as 23% in Q4. So we should end the year at 22.2% even with a weak first half. So I think margins are going to keep improving both because of the cost action that Edwin and his people have taken, but also because some of the markets are coming back.\nRob Jamieson: Perfect. That's helpful. I was actually going to ask about that next. And look, I know this is a pretty small part of your business, but I just wanted to ask a little bit more on the oscilloscope within instrumentation and test and measurement. Just one of your competitors this morning cutting their outlook on delayed R&D spend and government and China related spend. Just curious if there's anything in the end markets that you're seeing within test and measurement on the oscilloscope side that's maybe weaker or starting to improve more or is it just all kind of a little bit soft and lagging the protocols business? Any additional color there would be great.\nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. I think you've explained it very well. I think people are hesitant to spend discretionary CapEx. So in the high end oscilloscope where you make really good money is slowed down. We expect the whole business to be down about 10% year-over-year. But having said that, as with many other years, we were probably the first one out of the box early in the year in April to warn. And subsequently, you see everybody else, of course, having to do the same. The advantage that we had in doing that was that knowing that the market was going to soften, we took cost out late in Q4 and early in Q1. And as a consequence, the margins in that business have been exceptionally healthy.\nRob Jamieson: Absolutely. No, thank you for that. I appreciate you all taking my questions.\nRobert Mehrabian: Of course. Thank you.\nOperator: We have one more in queue. [Operator Instructions] We're going now to Jordan Lyonnais from Bank of America. Go ahead, please.\nJordan Lyonnais: Good morning and thanks for taking the question. How should we think about if the U.S. puts more restrictions on to ASML and Tokyo electron, what would that impact be for the digital imaging segment?\nRobert Mehrabian: I don't see that impacting as much. We supply product to their customers. I don't want to mention the name, but this is a large customer and this is a U.S. customer and they use ASML equipment, which uses a critical part that we make in our MEMS factories. We don't expect to see a change in that because we're frankly supplying the customers of ASML and it's not a huge business, maybe $20 million, $25 million business, but very profitable.\nJordan Lyonnais: Got it. Thank you.\nRobert Mehrabian: For sure.\nOperator: At this time, we have no additional callers in queue.\nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you very much, John. I'll now ask Jason to conclude the conference call.\nJason VanWees: Thanks, Robert, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning.

            "name": "Edwin Roks",
            "content": "Thank you, Robert. This is Edwin and I will report on the - first report on the digital imaging segment, which represents 54% of Teledyne's portfolio. And like Teledyne as a whole, this segment is a mix of longer cycle businesses such as defense, space and healthcare combined with shorter cycle markets, including industrial automation, semiconductor inspection and infrared components and cameras for applications ranging from factory condition monitoring to maritime navigation. Second quarter 2024 sales declined 6.8% compared with last year. As expected, sales to industrial machine vision markets declined approximately 30% year-over-year. However, this was partially offset by increased sales from FLIR defense and from generalized space-based infrared imaging detectors. Furthermore, for the fourth consecutive quarter, healthy margins across the entire FLIR business portfolio helped us protect overall operating margin even given the significant year-over-year production in sales of our typically highest contribution margin product lines. I will now report on the other three segments, which represent the remaining 46% of Teledyne. The instrumentation segment consists of marine, environmental and test and measurement businesses which contributed a little over 24% of sales. For the total segment, overall second quarter sales increased 1.6% versus last year. Sales of marine instruments increased 60% in the quarter, primarily due to strong offshore energy and subsea defense. Sales of environmental instruments decreased 1.6% with greater sales of drugs discovery and laboratory instruments, offset by lower sales of processed gas, emission monitoring systems and gas flame safety analyzers. Sales of electronics and measurement systems which include oscilloscopes, digitizers and protocol analyzers decreased 50.8% year-over-year on a tough quarterly comparison versus 2023. Overall instrumentation segment operating profit increased in the second quarter with GAAP operating margins increasing on a 36 basis points to 26.1% and 134 basis points on a non-GAAP basis to 27.2%. In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment which represents 14% of Teledyne sales, second quarter sales increased 4.5% driven by the growth of commercial aerospace and defense microwave products. GAAP and non-GAAP segment operating profits increased year-over-year with segment margin increasing approximately 77 basis points. For the engineered system segment which contributes 8% to overall sales, second quarter revenue decreased 8.7% and operating profit was impacted by lower sales and unfavorable program mix. I will now pass the call back to Robert."

            "name": "Robert Mehrabian",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason, and good morning, and thank you for joining our earnings call. In the second quarter, Teledyne achieved all-time record free cash flow allowing us to deploy approximately $852 million through July on debt repayment, acquisitions and stock repurchases. Non-GAAP operating margin increased from last year and increased in each of our three largest segments. Total sales and earnings increased sequentially and exceeded our most recent expectations, although year-over-year comparisons remain especially difficult in certain commercial markets, such as industrial automation and electronic test and measurement. Nevertheless, strong defense-related sales at Teledyne FLIR and our own legacy space based infrared imaging business partially offset the expected declines in industrial imaging systems. Furthermore, despite the anticipated year-over-year decline in certain instrumentation product lines, total instrumentation sales were a second quarter record due to exceptional performance of our marine instrumentation businesses. Primarily driven by our aerospace and defense businesses, orders were greater than sales for the third consecutive quarter and we ended the period with record backlog. Therefore, we're reasonably confident that quarterly sales will again increase sequentially and with a return to year-over-year sales growth in the second half of 2024. Finally, even with the significant capital deployment in the second quarter, our quarter end leverage remained at 1.7 and we plan to continue stock repurchases in the balance of 2024 as well as pursue acquisitions. I would now turn the call to Edwin who will further comment on the performance of our four segments. Thank you, Edwin. In conclusion, our second quarter performance was a testament to the strength of our balanced business portfolio. We also continued our proven strategy of increasing margin in those businesses which are growing while reasonably protecting margins in businesses with more challenging markets. Our current full year earnings outlook is identical to the last quarter with some markets such as industrial automation and electronic test and measurement remaining difficult, although year-over-year comparisons are easier in the second half while the outlook for our global defense, energy and aerospace businesses remain strong and is supported by our record backlog. Finally, we continue to review acquisition opportunities, but given the strength of our balance sheet and cash flow, we also plan to continue purchasing our own stock under our current $1.25 billion authorization. I will now turn the call over to Steve. We would like to take your questions. John, if you're ready to proceed with the questions and answers, please go ahead. Thank you, Jim. First, you're correct in generally overall, but I think our overall book-to-bill was 1.07. It was -- digital imaging was close to 1, like 0.98. Instrumentation was just over 1 at 1.04. But as you said, aerospace and defense was very strong at 1.41 and engineered systems also strong at 1.25 resulting in a combined book-to-bill of 1.07 for the complete company. Let me start with the first part. It's defense is obviously as you said very important and is the long cycle business that's doing really well. The second area is energy and that's our marine instruments businesses. They've done exceptionally well for the year and will continue to do so. And then the third area is aerospace. Both aerospace from the computers that we have on commercial aircraft through aerospace and the aerospace from our imaging sensor businesses. Now going back to the commercial shorter cycle businesses, what we're seeing is we think that digital imaging as a whole, total digital imaging should be relatively flat in the second half of the year. That's year-over-year flat, which is good because it declined in the first half of the year. Some of the recovery that we're seeing is early signs that come from our MEMS, microelectronic mechanical systems, which are kind of like the canaries in the mine. We are seeing some uptick in orders there, which is encouraging especially from semiconductor industry. And then we also have some indications that our machine vision systems as example have stabilized and book-to-bill has reached 1 or a little better, which is encouraging. We're hoping that these trends will continue with semiconductor coming back and inspection businesses that we have picking up and some of our high end thermal cameras also doing better than they have. So I think overall, we're positively inclined towards the second half of the year. Thank you, Jim. Good morning, Andrew. Yes. About that. Not to be picky, but we have 9.9%, which is very close to your 10%. But that's also tailored to cities there. In our test and measurement as you know, Andrew, we have two businesses. One is the oscilloscope business and the other one is our protocol business, which are basically rules for communication between devices and devices on the cloud. That business, the protocol business is coming back faster and is doing better, a little bit better. It's the oscilloscope business which is lagging. Having said that, we took cost out in that business. And fortunately for us, we took the cost out very early and the margins of instruments have remained pretty well. We anticipate, for example, about almost 94 basis points improvement in our total instrument portfolio even with part of CNM being weak, partially because our marine is very strong and our environmental businesses are doing okay. So I don't know whether that answers your question fully or not. Two areas. First is the offshore oil production and discovery.

I think our defense business especially FLIR defense has picked up the pace very well and we're very excited about that. Thank you. Well, I think basically, they were down 30 in Q1 and Q2 as Edwin indicated. I think that's now going to be about 10 and 10 in Q3 and Q4. So for the year would be about 20. So it's going to improve, partially it's improving partially because comps are getting easier to be frank and very straightforward about it.

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and then I will discuss our third quarter and full year 2024 outlook. In the second quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $318.7 million compared with $190.5 million in 2023. Free cash flow that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures was $301 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared with $163.2 million in 2023. Cash flow increased in the second quarter due to stronger working capital performance. Capital expenditures were $17.7 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared with $27.3 million in 2023. Depreciation and amortization expense was $77.8 million for the second quarter of 2024 compared with $80 million in 2023.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.\n At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to your host, Jason VanWees. Please go ahead, sir. \nJason VanWees: All right. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. This is Jason VanWees, Vice Chairman. I'd like to welcome everyone to Teledyne's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Release Conference Call. We released our earnings earlier this morning before the market opening. Joining me today are Teledyne's Executive Chairman, Robert Mehrabian; CEO, Edwin Roks; President and COO, George Bobb; SVP and CFO, Stephen Blackwood; and Melanie Cibik, EVP General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary.\n After remarks by Robert, Edwin, George, and Steve, will ask for your questions. However, before we get started, turning to ever mind to me to tell you that all forward-looking statements made this morning are subject to various assumptions, risks and caveats as noted in the earnings release and our periodic SEC filings. And of course, actual results may differ materially. In order to avoid potential selective disclosures, this call is simultaneously being webcast and a replay, both via webcast and dial-in, will be available for approximately one month.\n Here is Robert. \nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you, Jason. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our earnings call. Today, we reported record first quarter non-GAAP operating margin, record adjusted earnings per share and record free cash flow. While overall orders remained strong, sales were impacted by deterioration in some of our short cycle imaging and instrumentation market. We have previously assumed no full year sales growth in industrial automation as well as test and measurement market. However, those markets weakened more than planned in the first quarter, and we now forecast full year sales in those product families to decline meaningfully in 2024.\n Nevertheless, we believe such sales declines with the offset by our marine, aviation and certain defense businesses, resulting in full year flat sales compared to 2023. Despite those anticipated sales reductions, in what are among our highest margin businesses, we believe overall operating margin will remain flat in '24 versus '23. Within the Digital Imaging segment, year-over-year sales declined due to significantly lower sales of machine vision sensors and cameras related to industrial automation. However, this was partially offset by organic growth and significant margin improvement at Teledyne FLIR.\n Given our unmanned system businesses, growth and the resiliency of our core infrared imaging business. Similarly, in instrumentation, we were relatively flat where significant reduction in sales of test and measurement, instrumentation were almost entirely offset by Marine Electronics and unmanned underwater system. And despite the overall flat sales, segment margin increased considerably. In our smallest segment, Engineered Systems, which is largely a U.S. government prime contractor, sales were impacted by the very late approval of the U.S. 2024 budget. We also revised estimated progress and cost to complete on certain contracts, resulting in some revenue and profit reversal.\n Finally, given our even stronger balance sheet with quarter end leverage just at 1.7x, combined with record free cash flow, we believe it's an appropriate time for us to add stock repurchases to our capital deployment plan. I will now turn the call over to Edwin and George, who will further comment on the performance of our core business segments. \nEdwin Roks: Thank you, Robert. This is Edwin, and I will report on the Digital Imaging segment, which represents 55% of Teledyne's portfolio. And like Teledyne as a whole, this segment is a mix of local cycle businesses, such as defense, space and healthcare, combined with shorter cycle markets, including industrial automation, semiconductor inspection and infrared components and cameras for applications ranging from factory condition monitoring to maritime navigation.\n First quarter 2024 sales declined 4.1% compared to last year as certain products declined considerably, but were largely offset by those with meaningful increases. For example, sales to industrial machine vision markets declined approximately 30% year-over-year.\n On the other hand, unmanned air systems, unmanned ground systems and integrated counter-drone systems collectively increased nearly plus 30%. Although year-over-year changes were less significant, but included continued growth in our space-based imaging business Brazilian sales in healthcare and [indiscernible] infrared and maritime businesses and declining sales of semiconductor related micro-electrical mechanical systems or MEMS. As Robert mentioned, the FLIR businesses grew organically and for the third consecutive quarter, were positive contributors to overall segment margin. Finally, segment orders were healthy with the first quarter book-to-bill of 1.6x. George will now report on the other 3 segments, which represent the remaining 45% of [indiscernible]. \nGeorge Bobb: Thanks, Edwin. The instrumentation segment consists of our marine, environmental and test and measurement businesses, which contributed a little over 24% of sales. So the total segment, overall first quarter sales decreased 0.9% versus last year. Sales of marine instruments increased 15.3% in the quarter, primarily due to both strong offshore energy and subsea defense sales. Sales of environmental instruments decreased 5.8% with greater sales of processed gas emission monitoring systems. In gas and flame safety analyzers, more than offset by lower sales of drug discovery and laboratory [indiscernible].\n Sales of electronic test and measurement systems, which include oscilloscopes, digitizers and protocol analyzers, decreased 18.2% year-over-year on the toughest quarterly comparison of 2024 versus 2023. Overall, Instrumentation segment operating profit increased in the first quarter. With GAAP operating margin increasing 183 basis points to 26% and 175 basis points on a non-GAAP basis to 27.1%.\n In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, which represents 14% of Teledyne sales, first quarter sales increased 7.2%, driven by growth of commercial aerospace and defense microwave products. GAAP and non-GAAP segment operating profit increased year-over-year with segment margin increasing approximately 80 basis points. For the Engineered Systems segment, which contributes 7% to overall sales, first quarter revenue decreased 10.5% and operating profit was impacted by lower sales and the cost complete estimate revision Robert mentioned earlier.\n I will now pass the call back to Rob. \nRobert Mehrabian: Thanks, George. In conclusion, orders have been strong for two consecutive quarters with the increase almost entirely due to our longer cycle businesses such as defense and energy. However, given the nature of these businesses, converting much of the greater backlog to sales will not begin until the second half of 2024. At the same time, the pace of orders in our short-cycle instrumentation and imaging businesses did have a near-term sales impact in the first quarter and likely will continue to impact total sales in the second quarter of 2024.\n So while our current outlook for full year sales is flat with 2023, we expect second quarter sales to be sequentially flat with the first quarter and then increase in the second half of the year. The current market environment is premonition of the 2014 to 2016 period. That is when total Teledyne sales at earnings were flattish except market dynamics where the opposite of what we are experiencing today. Specifically, growth in certain short-cycle markets were partially offsetting declines in our longer cycle depends on energy businesses.\n Hopefully, at this time, the recovery in the short cycle businesses would be shortage. In any event, during the 2014 through 2016, we executed approximately $400 million of opportunistic share repurchases, completed 10 acquisitions and subsequently experienced significant sales and earnings growth when market normalize.\n Today, we're pleased to renew our stock repurchase authorization and plan to begin repurchasing shares this quarter. At the same time, because of our strong balance sheet, we're continuing to evaluate a number of acquisition opportunities. I will now turn the call over to Steve. \nStephen Blackwood: Robert, and good morning. I'll first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert, and then I will discuss our second quarter and full year 2024 outlook. In the first quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $291 million compared with $203 million in 2023. Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures was $275.1 million in the first quarter 2024 compared with $178.6 million in 2023.\n Cash flow increased in the first quarter due to stronger working capital performance. Capital expenditures were $15.9 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared with $24.4 million in 2023.\n Depreciation and amortization expense was $78 million for the first quarter of 2024 compared with $82.1 million in 2023. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.33 billion of net debt. That is approximately $3.25 billion of debt less cash of $912.4 million.\n Now turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the second quarter of 2024 will be in the range of $3.57 to $3.70 per share, with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $4.40 to $4.50 per share. And for the full year 2024, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $16.02 to $16.27. And on a non-GAAP basis, $19.25 to $19.45 per share. The 2024 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 22.5%.\n I will now pass the call back to Robert. \nRobert Mehrabian: We would now like to take your questions. Operator, if you're ready to proceed with the questions and answers, please go ahead. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]\n Our first question is going to come from Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company. \nJames Ricchiuti: First question, just given the weakness that you're seeing in some of the higher-margin areas of the short-cycle business. I wonder how you're thinking about gross margins over the next couple of quarters. \nRobert Mehrabian: In terms of the gross margin, we're looking at relatively flat gross margins of somewhere around 43%. Yes. \nJames Ricchiuti: All right. Robert, with the shift in and capital allocation. I'm wondering what does this really imply just in terms of the M&A pipeline? Are you still seeing more opportunities for the smaller deals as opposed to the larger M&A. Is that a fair way to characterize the environment right now? \nRobert Mehrabian: Jim, kind of, but let me just start with some numbers that are significant. Our debt-to-EBITDA is at 1.7x now. We have one acquisition in the pipeline. Once we make that, we would spend up over $300 million since we bought FLIR in acquisitions. If we don't do anything else, by the end of the year, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio would be closer to 1.3x where it is at 1.7x today. So we think that it's an appropriate time, first, to look at our stock and repurchase some shares because since we bought FLIR, our shares have increased by almost 700,000 shares because of option exercises and restricted stock awards.\n We like to get that off the table first. But at the same time, we have a lot of capacity for acquisitions. We can spend up to $1.5 billion, $2 billion because we haven't touched our line of credit at all and we have cash on hand. So we are looking at acquisitions. The issue is that smaller acquisitions, we may be able to complete this year, larger acquisitions, even if we find it with all the various regulatory hurdles that you have to go through what happen until next year.\n But the answer is we're going to do both. We're going to do exactly what we did in 2014 to '16. We bought our shares back. We bought 10 companies. And then some of our competitors didn't do as well in that constricted period. We were able to acquire it to be right after that because we had financial where we don't. So I don't know if that answers your question. \nJames Ricchiuti: It helps. I mean, in the past, it was more recently, you've talked about valuations still being a bit on the risk side, do you see -- as you look at the pipeline for some of the larger M&A, have you seen any change in terms of the prices out there that it's going to take to do some of these larger deals? \nRobert Mehrabian: Not yet. On the other hand, I have to tell you, Jim, they haven't done come out with their earnings. And in this market, kind of a bifurcated market, I expect that some of those will come down, and there will be -- just like it did before. Interestingly, enough history does repeat itself. It doesn't repeat itself on the time scale that we always expect, but repeat it. \nOperator: Our next question is going to come from Greg Konrad with Jefferies. \nGreg Konrad: This is a bit of an unusual question, but one I've been getting from investors and in light of the uncharacteristic guidance cut, which there hasn't really been many over the past 20 years. Is Teledyne different today than what has made it so successful thinking back over the past 20 years? Or what's really changed just given some of these uncharacteristic items? Or is this just you think about it as part of the normal cycle? \nRobert Mehrabian: Well, two things. First, in the 25 years or so -- we've only had this occasion in 4 earnings call -- So almost 100 earnings calls and releases. We've experienced this 4x, 4%. So it's not something that happens very frequently. The flip side of it is that the economy and the markets are not quite predictable. Some parts of the economy are doing well. Like our marine businesses are devising the ball out of the park.\n And defense, of course, is doing well with our recent passage, et cetera, we intently expect that to continue. What is unusual is that the prediction of the slowdown in industrial automation took us by surprise. We thought in January that we would be relatively flat for the year in our machine vision businesses. And now we certainly faced with in projecting 20% decline. Now that seems like a lot, but it's only $120 million. What is different today from the past is that Teledyne can absorb those kinds of shock much more easily than it could before.\n In 2015, '16, when oil went from over $100 down to $30, that was a shocker to Teledyne because our revenue was only $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion. And we had increased our marine businesses by almost 1/3 over a very short period of time. So what is different is that the shock absorber in Teledyne is a lot different and can absorb shocks like that. And we did this quarter, everything else being equal. When I look at it, I said, look, we have two hits that we took in long forth. So one of them was this significant decline in industrial automation. And some semiconductor, but semiconductor conductor seems to be recovering slowly.\n So we see signs of that. And I think the machine vision will come back. We took another hit in our Engineered Systems business, which was unexpected. But we had to go in and look at everything and do some estimates and change our estimates to complete. That was a onetime event. So I'm not going to worry about that too much. What I am saying is that, look, yes, we took a hit, and we're taking our revenue down by $220 million part of [indiscernible]. In the old days, at those days, we've taken a $220 million hit, that would have been just devastating. We recovered those kinds of shocks, I think we'll recover this time as well if not better because we have the muscle and the ability and credit to buy companies when necessary buyback our stocks. \nGreg Konrad: And then -- I appreciate that. And maybe just kind of a follow-up to that. I mean, just thinking back to what Teledyne did out of the oil and gas downturn and there was the sequester before that and impacted Defense. I mean if I remember back, I mean you took pretty aggressive actions, and we saw with margins and growth out of those two  downturns. I mean is there similar actions that you're undertaking on the short cycle side, does that offer opportunity maybe to examine the margins where you have an even better kind of trajectory coming out of market recovery? \nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. First, if you look at the FLIR businesses, year-over-year, the margins are up almost 200 basis points year-over-year. And the reason that happened is very simple. We took about $52 million worth of cost out last year, and we're taking additional $10 million to $15 million cost of this year early on. So that is affecting the margin. If you look at the DALSA e2v, which is our traditional businesses, our estimates are that by the end of second quarter, we have taken another $40 million out of that, altogether, we're talking about almost $100 million in cost.\n And we anticipate the DALSA e2v margins were the lowest have been for a long time. They were at 19.5% in Q1. We expect that to recover. And frankly, we expect the overall margins for Digital Imaging to be flat with last year on much lower revenues. So it basically says that -- we have taken the cost of and if need be, we'll take more. But I think right now, we're doing okay. We're just not very aggressive in our hiring. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. \nJoseph Giordano: Maybe I'll start on [indiscernible]  as well. Just curious on the timing of this, right? Because if you look at some of the pure players within vision they had huge declines last year and you guys did okay relative to them last year. And now this year, it seems like we may yet to report largely, but it sounds like they're going to be sequentially improving offload levels starting right now. And it seems like now is when you guys are starting to see declines. So I'm just curious your thoughts on that timing mismatch is because it's pretty short cycle stuff. \nRobert Mehrabian: It is. We know a couple of businesses that took a pretty good hit, but their quarters are kind of a little different and the yields are a little different from ours. They took a pretty big hit and lower their numbers significantly. So now they're coming up from the bottom, slightly better. We didn't take a hit because we didn't have short-cycle declines of the magnitude. So we anticipated it would happen, but it happened fast. And we took the cost off.\n The flip side of it is that in even digital imaging, we have, of course, the short-cycle businesses, but we also have long-cycle business like space and defense. And those markets are doing really well. So I got to be a little careful when we designate what is digital imaging. The -- basically, the average we think in the second half, we will recover because of the space in this business. \nJoseph Giordano: And then just a follow-up on the question earlier about is Teledyne different today. I think what you guys have been known for so long is being very good estimators of your own businesses with high precision. And when you think about all the M&A companies you've done, does that become just inherently more challenging today versus a decade ago just because you have so many more businesses. And is there maybe -- does there need to be a tinkering of the process with how you communicate upwards from the businesses towards management to fine-tune the budgeting process in light of some of these being caught off guard here? \nRobert Mehrabian: Well, I mean you're right in one respect. And I'll kind of paraphrase, but it is that the estimating the short cycle businesses actually always been inherently challenging. The flip side is the part that you mentioned, we have a lot of businesses, et cetera. That part is actually a help to us rather than a hindrance because it opens up the platform from which you can make acquisitions. And that is true and it will remain true. So we will accelerate that. The only we don't want to do is make stupid acquisitions with very high prices that are not going to be accretive. But the acquisitions we will do -- we had a larger platform to do that with.\n And like we just bought something in our Marine business, the [indiscernible] in the U.K. And we have [indiscernible], which is a digital imaging business. In the Netherlands, that we are going -- we're in the process of buying. The only difference between that business and our short cycle business is that they do a lot of custom imaging designs, and they have a significant market in imaging in the defense domain. So I think that this is an opportune time for us. Let's see what happens to the rest of the earnings and costs that come out.\n We didn't lower our numbers significantly. If we're lower, we'd be up now, right? So all we're saying is we're going to be flat with last year. Our margins are going to be the same by the end of the year. Our revenue is going to be about the same with that without making any acquisitions. Have enough muscles to buy our shares. And that's a good place to be with a -- even after those purchases, I think we'll end the year -- let's say, we bought $200 million of our stock. We still end the year below 1.5x debt-to-EBITDA ratio with -- which is below our target of 1.5x to 2.5x. So I think we're doing fine. I'm not worried. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia with BNP. \nAndrew Buscaglia: So I wanted to get a sense of how much this guidance is really derisked. Maybe number one, are you assuming buybacks in the guidance. And then secondly, why should we have confidence given the low visibility that there's not another step down here in some of the shorter-cycle areas? \nRobert Mehrabian: A very good question, Andrew. First, No. The buybacks are not built into the numbers primarily because we buy back, it's really going to affect next year's EPS not this year's. So that's fairly neutral for this year, depending on, of course, how much we bought. So I would put that aside. The second part of the question, we've struggled with that mildly over the last 10 days and with our Board in the last 2 days, trying to decide how conservative we should be or how aggressive we should be. We've ended up being somewhere in between the two.\n We think that we have derisked some of the downside. On the other hand, we haven't derisked it all. Flip side, our defense businesses have relatively good backlog and the overall backlog in the company is 1.06. So the defense space businesses are going to come back in the second half. So they're going to balance that. In a situation like this, you can do one or two things. You can really lower the numbers and just play it very safe. or you can do what is a reasonable judgment of what you see in the market and go forward. We've taken the latter approach. \nAndrew Buscaglia: Yes. Okay. Okay. Just -- I think some investors are also somewhat confused by the small portion of the sales, it seems like a small portion of digital imaging is driving sort of the profound declines. Can you kind of walk through within digital imaging. We know machine vision is weak, but that's probably only low double digits as a percentage of that segment. Can you walk through the other items beyond just machine vision and tell us how much that is as a percentage of that segment sales. So that we could [indiscernible] around what's affecting the overall decline? \nRobert Mehrabian: Sure. First, let's start with the machine vision specifically. Approximately $600 million in 2023. We projecting a decline of about $120 million of debt. So -- the reason it's affecting other things is that the highest margin businesses that we have in digital imaging. And overall, there are -- when you put the two parts together, which is DALSA e2v, [indiscernible] and FLIR, our total revenue there is going to be down about by year-end, about 1.5%. So it's not a big number, right? 1.5% but that's 1.5% with something like over $2.1 billion. So It's meaningful only because the top line $2.1 billion is significant. And it's our highest margin business. By year-end, we're projecting that basically, the declines would be 1.5% overall. With FlIR up and DALSA e2v down because of that. I don't know if that answers your question. The numbers when you look at them look large, but in retrospect, it's not huge, it's 1.5% of the total. \nAndrew Buscaglia: Yes. Okay. And beyond machine vision or what other areas or short cycle that are out of favor? \nRobert Mehrabian: Well, the only other one that I would say is out of favor. I wouldn't call it out of favor. I would say it's decline. It's test and measurement. Test and measurement is the oscilloscopes and protocol solutions that we have. Last year, we had $340 million of revenue there. We expect right now that in January, we thought it remained flat. Now we expecting it to go down about 10%. So that's $30 million in revenue.\n The good part of that is that its margins are remaining very healthy and at the very high end of all of our margins, and we can take that decline in revenue without having a big hit anywhere out because Marine is making up those sales decline. The last area, which is a little different is the engineered system.\n In 2023, we had $440 million in revenue. Right now, we're projecting about a 10% decline or about $35 million to $40 million decline. If there is a good part to it is that, that's only 7% of our portfolio, and it's our lowest margin business at 10% or less. So that's why while the surprise here is that yes, we do have declines. What we're saying we are going to keep our revenue the same as last year. And our operating margins are going to be the same as last year in an environment that's a little more constricted for our digital imaging short cycle business. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] \n Next, we will go to Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. \nUnknown Analyst: This is Gaby on for Kristine. So I was just wondering if you can provide some -- a little bit of color if you've been seeing improvements in the supply chain and your expectations for the supply chain going forward and how that's going to impact throughout the year? \nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you very much. Great question. The supply chain improved in 2023 significantly versus 2022. It has improved further this year. Just to give you exact number, we -- when we buy from brokers, we pay higher percentages of price. Last year in the first quarter, we bought about $10 billion for electronic buyers broker. This year, first quarter, we only bought a little over $2 million. So I think there's been significant improvement.\n Having said that, there are couple of suppliers that make very sophisticated board or device -- semiconductor devices that are still lagging and it's more of a delay problem rather that a price problem. So I think the supply chain is okay. We're experiencing some delays of some sophisticated part. Other than that, I think that's behind. \nOperator: Our next question is going to come from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. \nNoah Poponak: Robert, you have the second quarter revenue to be about flat from the first the year-over-year rate of decline would need to accelerate. Is that right? Is that what you're anticipating? \nRobert Mehrabian: Right now, we're anticipating that it will be flat only because -- the answer is yes, only because we don't think our -- where we have really good backlog, it's got to kick in until the third quarter. The decline about, 4.5% from last year year-over-year in second quarter, yes. \nNoah Poponak: Okay. Yes. And then I guess that would imply kind of mid-single-digit organic revenue growth year-over-year in the back half. I was going to ask -- you just alluded to it, but I was going to ask how much of that is kind of purely visibility from longer cycle things in the backlog versus what's the assumption embedded in that on the short cycle side? \nRobert Mehrabian: I think primarily, it's what we have in the long cycle, the majority of that recovery is in what we have in our back maybe 3.5% to 4% improvement in revenue in the second half. There is a little bit of positivity in some of our short type of businesses only because our larger customers or platforms on which we serve like semiconductors. The data shows that it's better than it was last year and improving its up. So we have a little of that in mind. That -- so I think that's there but we're not counting on industrial automation, other things to improve significantly because frankly, we have no visibility. \nNoah Poponak: Okay. What are the pieces of the Engineered Systems margin in the quarter? Is there -- I assume there's some kind of cumulative catch-up adjustment mark-to-market write-down in that? \nRobert Mehrabian: Yes. What happens in that business is that, as you well know, we're obligated to do [indiscernible] accounting. As you estimate your cost and completion timing. When went back and looked pretty hard, we saw that some of the costs were higher than we had anticipated.\n So we adjusted those. I think that took kick out of our sales. But when you do cost to cost, what you take the sales down, let's say, several million dollars, you have to take the profit down the same amount. So that's what took the hit. But I think we know exactly what happens. We'll fix it, we are fixing it, and we should get beyond that as we move forward. \nNoah Poponak: Do you know the size of in front of you guys there on how much of a markdown you took in the quarter? \nRobert Mehrabian: Well, we took in Q1, we took about a $7 million EBIT hit, which was basically $0.10 to $0.11. So if that happened, we would have made our earnings. \nNoah Poponak: Okay. \nRobert Mehrabian: Despite the downturn in a short cycle imaging. We'll fix that. \nNoah Poponak: Got it. That's helpful. That's helpful. Last one, I guess, given how much you've now delevered balance sheet, net debt-to-EBITDA post FLIR integration. You're still going to have pretty healthy free cash flow despite tweaks you're making here today. If you're coming out with a share repurchase, I guess the number you're talking about is kind of small relative to your forward annual free cash flow generation, how much balance sheet firepower you have if you were to take leverage a little higher, a little bit of like if you're going to layup, layup type of thing. \n I guess I'm surprised that you -- maybe part of it is you formulated all of this before the moving stock today. Is there a scenario where you reevaluate something more aggressive in 2024? Do you need to keep room for the M&A pipeline? How would you respond to that? \nRobert Mehrabian: Well, two ways. First, we'll put out the case about our authorization. And if you look at that, we have authorization to go from what we said was $200 million to $250 million to $300 million. We can go up to $1.25 billion in buybacks.\n It's -- as you know, Noah, that depends on the stock price and how the market reacts. But at the lower stock price, that we -- I'm just looking at this morning, I was looking at this morning, that would be a significant number of shares. We can do that if we choose. We still have enough powder to make acquisitions. Frankly, that part of our portfolio doesn't bother me.\n If you look at final data point you may want to know is we have only $150 million of fixed debt that we have to pay in the second half of 2024 in October, $150 million. We just paid for $50 million. The next payment doesn't have come due until 2026. And then if you look forward the next 3 or 4 payments, our average borrowing cost, and those are all fixed. Our average borrowing cost is more like 2.35%. So that's about as an idea that the as you want to have. And as we generate cash, we can buy the shares and we can make acquisitions. And we haven't even touched our line of credit yet. So from that perspective, I feel pretty comfortable. \nOperator: And at this time, there are no additional questions in queue. \nRobert Mehrabian: Thank you very much. We would like now to conclude the conference operator, I will now ask Jason to do so. \nJason VanWees: Thank you, John, and thanks, everyone, for joining the earnings call this morning.

            "content": "Thank you, Robert. This is Edwin, and I will report on the Digital Imaging segment, which represents 55% of Teledyne's portfolio. And like Teledyne as a whole, this segment is a mix of local cycle businesses, such as defense, space and healthcare, combined with shorter cycle markets, including industrial automation, semiconductor inspection and infrared components and cameras for applications ranging from factory condition monitoring to maritime navigation.\n First quarter 2024 sales declined 4.1% compared to last year as certain products declined considerably, but were largely offset by those with meaningful increases. For example, sales to industrial machine vision markets declined approximately 30% year-over-year.\n On the other hand, unmanned air systems, unmanned ground systems and integrated counter-drone systems collectively increased nearly plus 30%. Although year-over-year changes were less significant, but included continued growth in our space-based imaging business Brazilian sales in healthcare and [indiscernible] infrared and maritime businesses and declining sales of semiconductor related micro-electrical mechanical systems or MEMS. As Robert mentioned, the FLIR businesses grew organically and for the third consecutive quarter, were positive contributors to overall segment margin. Finally, segment orders were healthy with the first quarter book-to-bill of 1.6x. George will now report on the other 3 segments, which represent the remaining 45% of [indiscernible]."

            "name": "Robert Mehrabian",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our earnings call. Today, we reported record first quarter non-GAAP operating margin, record adjusted earnings per share and record free cash flow. While overall orders remained strong, sales were impacted by deterioration in some of our short cycle imaging and instrumentation market. We have previously assumed no full year sales growth in industrial automation as well as test and measurement market. However, those markets weakened more than planned in the first quarter, and we now forecast full year sales in those product families to decline meaningfully in 2024.\n Nevertheless, we believe such sales declines with the offset by our marine, aviation and certain defense businesses, resulting in full year flat sales compared to 2023. Despite those anticipated sales reductions, in what are among our highest margin businesses, we believe overall operating margin will remain flat in '24 versus '23. Within the Digital Imaging segment, year-over-year sales declined due to significantly lower sales of machine vision sensors and cameras related to industrial automation. However, this was partially offset by organic growth and significant margin improvement at Teledyne FLIR.\n Given our unmanned system businesses, growth and the resiliency of our core infrared imaging business. Similarly, in instrumentation, we were relatively flat where significant reduction in sales of test and measurement, instrumentation were almost entirely offset by Marine Electronics and unmanned underwater system. And despite the overall flat sales, segment margin increased considerably. In our smallest segment, Engineered Systems, which is largely a U.S. government prime contractor, sales were impacted by the very late approval of the U.S. 2024 budget. We also revised estimated progress and cost to complete on certain contracts, resulting in some revenue and profit reversal.\n Finally, given our even stronger balance sheet with quarter end leverage just at 1.7x, combined with record free cash flow, we believe it's an appropriate time for us to add stock repurchases to our capital deployment plan. I will now turn the call over to Edwin and George, who will further comment on the performance of our core business segments. Thanks, George. In conclusion, orders have been strong for two consecutive quarters with the increase almost entirely due to our longer cycle businesses such as defense and energy. However, given the nature of these businesses, converting much of the greater backlog to sales will not begin until the second half of 2024. At the same time, the pace of orders in our short-cycle instrumentation and imaging businesses did have a near-term sales impact in the first quarter and likely will continue to impact total sales in the second quarter of 2024.\n So while our current outlook for full year sales is flat with 2023, we expect second quarter sales to be sequentially flat with the first quarter and then increase in the second half of the year. The current market environment is premonition of the 2014 to 2016 period. That is when total Teledyne sales at earnings were flattish except market dynamics where the opposite of what we are experiencing today. Specifically, growth in certain short-cycle markets were partially offsetting declines in our longer cycle depends on energy businesses.\n Hopefully, at this time, the recovery in the short cycle businesses would be shortage. In any event, during the 2014 through 2016, we executed approximately $400 million of opportunistic share repurchases, completed 10 acquisitions and subsequently experienced significant sales and earnings growth when market normalize.\n Today, we're pleased to renew our stock repurchase authorization and plan to begin repurchasing shares this quarter. At the same time, because of our strong balance sheet, we're continuing to evaluate a number of acquisition opportunities. I will now turn the call over to Steve. We would now like to take your questions. Operator, if you're ready to proceed with the questions and answers, please go ahead. In terms of the gross margin, we're looking at relatively flat gross margins of somewhere around 43%. Yes. Jim, kind of, but let me just start with some numbers that are significant. Our debt-to-EBITDA is at 1.7x now. We have one acquisition in the pipeline. Once we make that, we would spend up over $300 million since we bought FLIR in acquisitions. If we don't do anything else, by the end of the year, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio would be closer to 1.3x where it is at 1.7x today. So we think that it's an appropriate time, first, to look at our stock and repurchase some shares because since we bought FLIR, our shares have increased by almost 700,000 shares because of option exercises and restricted stock awards.\n We like to get that off the table first. But at the same time, we have a lot of capacity for acquisitions. We can spend up to $1.5 billion, $2 billion because we haven't touched our line of credit at all and we have cash on hand. So we are looking at acquisitions. The issue is that smaller acquisitions, we may be able to complete this year, larger acquisitions, even if we find it with all the various regulatory hurdles that you have to go through what happen until next year.\n But the answer is we're going to do both. We're going to do exactly what we did in 2014 to '16. We bought our shares back. We bought 10 companies. And then some of our competitors didn't do as well in that constricted period. We were able to acquire it to be right after that because we had financial where we don't. So I don't know if that answers your question. Not yet. On the other hand, I have to tell you, Jim, they haven't done come out with their earnings. And in this market, kind of a bifurcated market, I expect that some of those will come down, and there will be -- just like it did before. Interestingly, enough history does repeat itself. It doesn't repeat itself on the time scale that we always expect, but repeat it. Well, two things. First, in the 25 years or so -- we've only had this occasion in 4 earnings call -- So almost 100 earnings calls and releases. We've experienced this 4x, 4%. So it's not something that happens very frequently. The flip side of it is that the economy and the markets are not quite predictable. Some parts of the economy are doing well. Like our marine businesses are devising the ball out of the park.\n And defense, of course, is doing well with our recent passage, et cetera, we intently expect that to continue. What is unusual is that the prediction of the slowdown in industrial automation took us by surprise. We thought in January that we would be relatively flat for the year in our machine vision businesses. And now we certainly faced with in projecting 20% decline. Now that seems like a lot, but it's only $120 million. What is different today from the past is that Teledyne can absorb those kinds of shock much more easily than it could before.\n In 2015, '16, when oil went from over $100 down to $30, that was a shocker to Teledyne because our revenue was only $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion. And we had increased our marine businesses by almost 1/3 over a very short period of time. So what is different is that the shock absorber in Teledyne is a lot different and can absorb shocks like that. And we did this quarter, everything else being equal. When I look at it, I said, look, we have two hits that we took in long forth. So one of them was this significant decline in industrial automation. And some semiconductor, but semiconductor conductor seems to be recovering slowly.\n So we see signs of that. And I think the machine vision will come back. We took another hit in our Engineered Systems business, which was unexpected. But we had to go in and look at everything and do some estimates and change our estimates to complete. That was a onetime event. So I'm not going to worry about that too much. What I am saying is that, look, yes, we took a hit, and we're taking our revenue down by $220 million part of [indiscernible]. In the old days, at those days, we've taken a $220 million hit, that would have been just devastating. We recovered those kinds of shocks, I think we'll recover this time as well if not better because we have the muscle and the ability and credit to buy companies when necessary buyback our stocks. Yes. First, if you look at the FLIR businesses, year-over-year, the margins are up almost 200 basis points year-over-year. And the reason that happened is very simple. We took about $52 million worth of cost out last year, and we're taking additional $10 million to $15 million cost of this year early on. So that is affecting the margin. If you look at the DALSA e2v, which is our traditional businesses, our estimates are that by the end of second quarter, we have taken another $40 million out of that, altogether, we're talking about almost $100 million in cost.\n And we anticipate the DALSA e2v margins were the lowest have been for a long time. They were at 19.5% in Q1. We expect that to recover. And frankly, we expect the overall margins for Digital Imaging to be flat with last year on much lower revenues. So it basically says that -- we have taken the cost of and if need be, we'll take more. But I think right now, we're doing okay. We're just not very aggressive in our hiring. It is. We know a couple of businesses that took a pretty good hit, but their quarters are kind of a little different and the yields are a little different from ours. They took a pretty big hit and lower their numbers significantly. So now they're coming up from the bottom, slightly better. We didn't take a hit because we didn't have short-cycle declines of the magnitude. So we anticipated it would happen, but it happened fast. And we took the cost off.\n The flip side of it is that in even digital imaging, we have, of course, the short-cycle businesses, but we also have long-cycle business like space and defense. And those markets are doing really well. So I got to be a little careful when we designate what is digital imaging. The -- basically, the average we think in the second half, we will recover because of the space in this business. Well, I mean you're right in one respect. And I'll kind of paraphrase, but it is that the estimating the short cycle businesses actually always been inherently challenging. The flip side is the part that you mentioned, we have a lot of businesses, et cetera. That part is actually a help to us rather than a hindrance because it opens up the platform from which you can make acquisitions. And that is true and it will remain true. So we will accelerate that. The only we don't want to do is make stupid acquisitions with very high prices that are not going to be accretive. But the acquisitions we will do -- we had a larger platform to do that with.\n And like we just bought something in our Marine business, the [indiscernible] in the U.K. And we have [indiscernible], which is a digital imaging business. In the Netherlands, that we are going -- we're in the process of buying. The only difference between that business and our short cycle business is that they do a lot of custom imaging designs, and they have a significant market in imaging in the defense domain. So I think that this is an opportune time for us. Let's see what happens to the rest of the earnings and costs that come out.\n We didn't lower our numbers significantly. If we're lower, we'd be up now, right? So all we're saying is we're going to be flat with last year. Our margins are going to be the same by the end of the year. Our revenue is going to be about the same with that without making any acquisitions. Have enough muscles to buy our shares. And that's a good place to be with a -- even after those purchases, I think we'll end the year -- let's say, we bought $200 million of our stock. We still end the year below 1.5x debt-to-EBITDA ratio with -- which is below our target of 1.5x to 2.5x. So I think we're doing fine. I'm not worried. A very good question, Andrew. First, No. The buybacks are not built into the numbers primarily because we buy back, it's really going to affect next year's EPS not this year's. So that's fairly neutral for this year, depending on, of course, how much we bought. So I would put that aside. The second part of the question, we've struggled with that mildly over the last 10 days and with our Board in the last 2 days, trying to decide how conservative we should be or how aggressive we should be. We've ended up being somewhere in between the two.\n We think that we have derisked some of the downside. On the other hand, we haven't derisked it all. Flip side, our defense businesses have relatively good backlog and the overall backlog in the company is 1.06. So the defense space businesses are going to come back in the second half. So they're going to balance that. In a situation like this, you can do one or two things. You can really lower the numbers and just play it very safe. or you can do what is a reasonable judgment of what you see in the market and go forward. We've taken the latter approach. Sure. First, let's start with the machine vision specifically. Approximately $600 million in 2023. We projecting a decline of about $120 million of debt. So -- the reason it's affecting other things is that the highest margin businesses that we have in digital imaging. And overall, there are -- when you put the two parts together, which is DALSA e2v, [indiscernible] and FLIR, our total revenue there is going to be down about by year-end, about 1.5%. So it's not a big number, right? 1.5% but that's 1.5% with something like over $2.1 billion. So It's meaningful only because the top line $2.1 billion is significant. And it's our highest margin business. By year-end, we're projecting that basically, the declines would be 1.5% overall. With FlIR up and DALSA e2v down because of that. I don't know if that answers your question. The numbers when you look at them look large, but in retrospect, it's not huge, it's 1.5% of the total. Well, the only other one that I would say is out of favor. I wouldn't call it out of favor. I would say it's decline. It's test and measurement. Test and measurement is the oscilloscopes and protocol solutions that we have. Last year, we had $340 million of revenue there. We expect right now that in January, we thought it remained flat. Now we expecting it to go down about 10%. So that's $30 million in revenue.\n The good part of that is that its margins are remaining very healthy and at the very high end of all of our margins, and we can take that decline in revenue without having a big hit anywhere out because Marine is making up those sales decline. The last area, which is a little different is the engineered system.\n In 2023, we had $440 million in revenue. Right now, we're projecting about a 10% decline or about $35 million to $40 million decline. If there is a good part to it is that, that's only 7% of our portfolio, and it's our lowest margin business at 10% or less. So that's why while the surprise here is that yes, we do have declines. What we're saying we are going to keep our revenue the same as last year. And our operating margins are going to be the same as last year in an environment that's a little more constricted for our digital imaging short cycle business. Thank you very much. Great question. The supply chain improved in 2023 significantly versus 2022. It has improved further this year. Just to give you exact number, we -- when we buy from brokers, we pay higher percentages of price. Last year in the first quarter, we bought about $10 billion for electronic buyers broker. This year, first quarter, we only bought a little over $2 million. So I think there's been significant improvement.\n Having said that, there are couple of suppliers that make very sophisticated board or device -- semiconductor devices that are still lagging and it's more of a delay problem rather that a price problem. So I think the supply chain is okay. We're experiencing some delays of some sophisticated part. Other than that, I think that's behind. Right now, we're anticipating that it will be flat only because -- the answer is yes, only because we don't think our -- where we have really good backlog, it's got to kick in until the third quarter. The decline about, 4.5% from last year year-over-year in second quarter, yes. I think primarily, it's what we have in the long cycle, the majority of that recovery is in what we have in our back maybe 3.5% to 4% improvement in revenue in the second half. There is a little bit of positivity in some of our short type of businesses only because our larger customers or platforms on which we serve like semiconductors. The data shows that it's better than it was last year and improving its up. So we have a little of that in mind. That -- so I think that's there but we're not counting on industrial automation, other things to improve significantly because frankly, we have no visibility. Yes. What happens in that business is that, as you well know, we're obligated to do [indiscernible] accounting. As you estimate your cost and completion timing. When went back and looked pretty hard, we saw that some of the costs were higher than we had anticipated.\n So we adjusted those. I think that took kick out of our sales. But when you do cost to cost, what you take the sales down, let's say, several million dollars, you have to take the profit down the same amount. So that's what took the hit. But I think we know exactly what happens. We'll fix it, we are fixing it, and we should get beyond that as we move forward. Well, we took in Q1, we took about a $7 million EBIT hit, which was basically $0.10 to $0.11. So if that happened, we would have made our earnings. Despite the downturn in a short cycle imaging. We'll fix that. Well, two ways. First, we'll put out the case about our authorization. And if you look at that, we have authorization to go from what we said was $200 million to $250 million to $300 million. We can go up to $1.25 billion in buybacks.\n It's -- as you know, Noah, that depends on the stock price and how the market reacts. But at the lower stock price, that we -- I'm just looking at this morning, I was looking at this morning, that would be a significant number of shares. We can do that if we choose. We still have enough powder to make acquisitions. Frankly, that part of our portfolio doesn't bother me.\n If you look at final data point you may want to know is we have only $150 million of fixed debt that we have to pay in the second half of 2024 in October, $150 million. We just paid for $50 million. The next payment doesn't have come due until 2026. And then if you look forward the next 3 or 4 payments, our average borrowing cost, and those are all fixed. Our average borrowing cost is more like 2.35%. So that's about as an idea that the as you want to have. And as we generate cash, we can buy the shares and we can make acquisitions. And we haven't even touched our line of credit yet. So from that perspective, I feel pretty comfortable. Thank you very much. We would like now to conclude the conference operator, I will now ask Jason to do so."

            "content": "Robert, and good morning. I'll first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert, and then I will discuss our second quarter and full year 2024 outlook. In the first quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $291 million compared with $203 million in 2023. Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures was $275.1 million in the first quarter 2024 compared with $178.6 million in 2023.\n Cash flow increased in the first quarter due to stronger working capital performance. Capital expenditures were $15.9 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared with $24.4 million in 2023.\n Depreciation and amortization expense was $78 million for the first quarter of 2024 compared with $82.1 million in 2023. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.33 billion of net debt. That is approximately $3.25 billion of debt less cash of $912.4 million.\n Now turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the second quarter of 2024 will be in the range of $3.57 to $3.70 per share, with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $4.40 to $4.50 per share. And for the full year 2024, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $16.02 to $16.27. And on a non-GAAP basis, $19.25 to $19.45 per share. The 2024 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 22.5%.\n I will now pass the call back to Robert."

So the total segment, overall first quarter sales decreased 0.9% versus last year. Sales of marine instruments increased 15.3% in the quarter, primarily due to both strong offshore energy and subsea defense sales. Sales of environmental instruments decreased 5.8% with greater sales of processed gas emission monitoring systems. In gas and flame safety analyzers, more than offset by lower sales of drug discovery and laboratory [indiscernible].\n Sales of electronic test and measurement systems, which include oscilloscopes, digitizers and protocol analyzers, decreased 18.2% year-over-year on the toughest quarterly comparison of 2024 versus 2023. Overall, Instrumentation segment operating profit increased in the first quarter.

GAAP and non-GAAP segment operating profit increased year-over-year with segment margin increasing approximately 80 basis points. For the Engineered Systems segment, which contributes 7% to overall sales, first quarter revenue decreased 10.5% and operating profit was impacted by lower sales and the cost complete estimate revision Robert mentioned earlier.\n I will now pass the call back to Rob."
