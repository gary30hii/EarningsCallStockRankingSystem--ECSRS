I'll give you a perspective on how the virus is playing out and on the trends that we see today and going forward. And I'll speak about our physical and financial progress. Then Aldo will give you a more detailed review of the financials. To start with, I'll just say we are encouraged by the quarter it was strong. But we believe we can reach even higher. This year was -- a lot of unusual events, but when you look through it all Snap-On saw a headwinds but we met those challenges absorb the shock, develop the combinations to the environment, move forward on a clear recovery. And we believe we exited the year stronger than ever. We did have disparities from group-to-group and within each group, but our overall sales and profitability improved both sequentially, and year-over-year for the second straight quarter, achieving new heights despite the virus. Through the year, the Snap-On team continue to make progress accommodating to the threat pursuing our essential commercial opportunities safely. And moving along upward trajectory is consistent with our general projections on how the days of the virus would unfold. Geographically, the impact of the COVID continues to be varied for us. Asia Pacific remains virus challenge; Southeast Asia and India are still in deep turbulence. And while the U.S. and Europe actually seem to be further ahead and accommodation, and are moving on to what we call psychological recovery. For the business segments, we saw the essential nature of our markets rising through the turbulence along our runways for growth. Demand for vehicle repair technicians, to our franchisee network directly selling-off the vans, it was robust. Again this quarter, it was robust. Volume of repair shop owners and managers continued to gain and activity and critical industries advanced despite certain sectors like education, oil and gas, U.S. Aviation not returning to growth yet, but you would kind of affect that. Going forward, we are convinced that we're well positioned on a strong base. But we know we have much more work to do. The environment throughout the world is still impacted by the virus and many of our businesses have not yet fully recovered against the great weathering. But having recognized these headwinds however, we're also convinced that there will be abundant opportunities as the skies clear and society pivots toward suburban locations and to more individual trends transportation. This is great news for the vehicle repair industry, I got to tell you. And because of that, we're keeping focus on Snap-On value creation, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, our RCI. We've been unrelenting and advancing our advantage in products that solve the most critical tasks and brands that serve as the outward sign and our brands that serve as the outward sign of the pride and dignity working men and women take in their profession and in our people are deeply committed and very capable. Snap-On team is a great asset. And we've maintained it through these days of the virus. We've advanced each of these strengths in the turbulence, and it's enabled Snap-On to achieve new heights, and the numbers show it. That's the overview now the results. Fourth quarter, as reported sales of $1,074.4 million were up 12.5% from 2019, including $9.6 million of favorable foreign currency translations, and $7.5 million of acquisition related sales. Organic sales will rose 10.6% volume gains in the van channel and OEM dealerships and diagnostics and repair information in our European handles business all demonstrating the abundant opportunities on our runways and our increased ability to take advantage of those opportunities. From an earnings perspective, operating net income from the quarter of $216.2 million including $2.8 million direct costs associated with the virus, $1 million of restructuring charges for actions outside the United States. And a $1.5 million hit from unfavorable currency was up 26.1%. And the OpCo operating margin it was 20.1%, 220 basis points overcoming 30 basis points of unfavorable currency 30 basis points of COVID cost impact and 10 basis points restructuring. For financial services operating income of $68.5 million increased 10.1% from 2019, all while keeping 60-day delinquencies flat the last year in the midst of the pandemic stress test. And that results combined with OpCo for consolidated operating margin of 24.4% 190 basis points point improvement. The overall quarterly EPS was $3.82, including a $0.02 charge for restructuring and that result compared to $3.08 last year, an increase of 24% I did say new height. Now for full year, sales were $3,593 million a 3.8% organic decline principally on the first and second quarter shock of the virus before the sequential gains of a combination to hold. OpCo OI is $631.9 million including $12.5 million of restructuring charges $11.9 million of direct costs associated with COVID-19 and $13.1 million of unfavorable currency compared to $716.4 million in 2019, which benefited from $11.6 million legal settlement and a patent related litigation matter. OpCo OI margin including a 30 basis point impact associated with restructuring, 30 points of direct pandemic expenses, 30 points of unfavorable currency with 17.6% and compare with 19.2% in 2019, which incorporated 30 basis points of non-recurring benefits of the legal service. That's a mouthful, right. But what it says is that despite the great disruption our full year OI margin was down only 40 basis points apples-to-apples, demonstrating the special Snap-On resilience that has enabled us to pay dividends every quarter since 1939 without a single reduction. For the year financial services registered OI of $248.6 million versus the $245.9 million in 2019. Overall EPS for the period of $11.44 was down 7.8% from the $12.41 reported last year 2019 adjusting for the restructuring and the current year and the one-time legal benefit in the prior year 2020 EPS as adjusted reached $11.52, down 5.1%. So now let's go on to the individual operating groups. In C&I volume in the quarter fourth quarter of $364.4 million including $7.5 million from acquisitions, and $6.5 million a favorable foreign currency was up 3.3% as reported. The activity was essentially flat organically, but represented a continuing sequential C&I rise all the way back to the early shot. Notably, in these numbers, the C&I year-over-year sales were marked by a strong double-digit rise in our European base hand tool business going broadly across Western Europe against the twin challenges of COVID and the Brexit disruption. They're also offsetting decreases in sales to our customers in critical industries in Asia Pacific. But both these operations join the overall growth group and registering substantial quarter-to-quarter sequential improvement. They're still down, but they're clearly recovering. From an earnings perspective, C&I, operating income of $56.2 million increased $11.2 million, including $1.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, and a $1 million of COVID related costs, with sales up 3.3% as reported flat organically, OI grew 24.9% a nice operating improvement. And the OI margin for the group was 50.4% up 260 basis points in the last year overcoming 70 basis points of unfavorable currency and 30 points of direct COVID cost, the benefits of RCI and margin gains in the critical energy industries made all the difference. Speaking to the critical industries, we did see selective gains international aviation and heavy duty registered double-digit improvements. But as you might expect, and I referenced before education, oil and gas and U.S. Aviation continue to be down. And then in the quarter our military sales will also impacted by the wind-down at one of our major fitting programs. But we do remain confident in and committed to expanding in the critical industries and we see growing opportunities moving forward and a principal path to that possibility is customer connection in innovation, creating powerful new products. You heard about our European hand tool business. It shows significant resiliency in the quarter. And it was aided by a good dose of innovation products like our recent expansion of our FIFO custom fitting system, extending our direct-to-user possibilities. Our new fitting goal product line allows buyers to quickly develop semi-bespoke kits in foam tool control consists of more than 200 pre-configured different tool sets designed around a 26 inch wide block a roll cast available in three standard foam configurations one-thirds store two-thirds store and a full door. Customers can choose the particular box drop configuration and the tool array needed right from our block a roll website reaching end users without distributor interaction, and for a wider range of specialization and sometimes it is specialization is required, our sales reps can help develop just the right unit using the full breadth of the block hole system. We've had great success with our new fitting goal. It's an important extension of our hand tool presence in Europe. And in the quarter it helped boost SNA Europe to achieve the double-digit growth in a very challenging environment. I think everybody would agree. C&I demonstrating further accommodation with continued sequential gains serving the essential each of the businesses generating a positive trajectory and exiting the quarter stronger than when they entered and product offered a big piece of that progress. Now onto the Tools Group. As reported sales up 20.2% to $494.9 million, including $2.2 million a favorable foreign currency and an $81 million or 19.6% organic increase the second straight quarter of strong game with the U.S. and international business is both growing at double-digits. And the Tools Group operating earnings $93.6 million, including $1.2 million of virus related costs, that 93.6 included $1.2 million virus related costs, and that $93.6 million compared to last year's $54.3 million and over 70% improvement. Actually, the Tools Group was recovered to positive territory for the full year. Sales were up 2% organically with OI rising almost 9% and OI margins up 110 basis points. The continue operating gains of the Tools Group are further affirmation of our view of the COVID-19 trajectory and the resilience of the vehicle repair business. And on the strength of our direct face-to-face van model, it turns out that deepened direct connection with the customers is a differentiator even in a pandemic. And in the quarter and throughout the year the Tools Group confirmed the market leading position of our van network. We believe the franchisees are growing stronger. That's clear in the franchisee health metrics we monitor each period, they continue to trend favorably and that was acknowledged by a number of respected publications, Snap-On as a franchise of choice. One was the franchise business review where we were again recognized and the magazine's latest rankings for franchisee satisfaction as a top 50 franchise marking the 14th consecutive year that Snap-On received that award. Now this type of recognition reflects the fundamental strength of our franchisees and our VAN business in general and would not have been achieved without a continuous stream of innovative new product developed through our strong customer connections. Throughout the storm, we've added every day to our already considerable insight and experience in the changing vehicle environment and because of that we're able to bring forward innovation great products like our newly released eight inch talent grip plank jaw pliers. We call it the HJ 47 ACF with a unique design for significant versatility in both removing and tightening fasteners. First, our unique plank jaw, specially designed, smooth and unsaturated meeting area allows the user to grip a hex shape only on the flat surface, positioning the load away from the corners. That's similar to our flank drive systems on sockets, 30% more torch applied to the fastener while still minimizing damages, eliminating rounded edges. Second, when the fasteners have already been heavily rounded and are tough to grip. Our talent grip diamond serrated jaws jointed located as the pliers tip generate unparalleled clamping force it's up to a 57% increase in turning power. With the Snap-On talent, technicians can remove even the most damaged and rounded hex fasteners and for the icing on the versatility cake, the new pliers also feature a patented three position slip joint designed for easy changes to the grip position, the HD 47 ACF, manufacturing right here and I'm going to walk you to the plant in the U.S. and it's been very well received putting it on a clear path to becoming another one of our hit products $1 million selling products just in one quarter. We also worked hard during the COVID to maintain and further strengthen our brand, celebrating our 100 year continuing our presence in racing and serve, most importantly I think servicing our customers every-day reinforcing that what they do really is essential and that the display the Snap-On brand confirms that it's sold. Sometimes the Tools Groups also been working to Span franchisee selling capacity. And that effect continued with focus to the pandemic and the days of the early shot access to the shops and to the technicians vary widely and the Tools Group more to engage social media in bridging the gap. This turned into a powerful tool for pre-briefing customers on products and promotions, reserving the actual face-to-face interaction for closing the deal, providing significant franchisee opportunity for selling more products and reaching new customers. The tools we've also made strides and redeploying the time saved from restricted travel, everybody stay-at-home work today streamlining the VAN sales process to RCI and developing more concise customer presentation. So important in pitching products of ever rising complexity, social media engagement, RCI, selling and more effective trading. It made the difference, raising franchisee selling capacity to match the strength and capacity of our new product and the results back it up. Well, that's the Tools Group. Moving through a V shaped recovery, recording two straight quarters of double-digit expansion, continuing a stream of new products building the brand raising selling capacity and strengthening for the future. Now let's speak of RS&I. The RS&I Group continuing the combination and extending its positive trend sales at $361.1 million in the fourth quarter up 7.8%, 7% organically excluding $2.4 million of favorable foreign currency a steep recovery from the depths of the pandemic. The rise was due to double-digit gains and OEM dealerships as auto manufacturers began to release new models and launched more essential programs. A high single-digit gain in the sales of our of our powerful diagnostics and repair information products independent repair shop owners and managers and then offsetting low single-digit decline in sales of undercar equipment or garage owners haven't developed sufficient confidence to invest to get it invest broadly and upgrading or expanding their facilities. RS&I operating earnings of $90 million improved $2.8 million as the mix of lower margin OEM project sales diluted the volume improvement and as the group recorded a $1 million in charges for small European focused restriction. On a diagnostics and information based operations have recorded continuous growth for some time, the sales to independent repair shop owners and managers they've had continuous growth for some time, and innovative new products are the key to that success. And the fourth quarter was no exception. We just began shipping our new 20.4 software update for our diagnostics platforms in North America full coverage for the 2020 vehicles. Additional reprogramming facility, increased functional test capabilities, and an expansion of our unique advanced driver assistance or ADAS content, so critical these days for engaging vehicle automation. This software represents another move forward in our already powerful already market leading intelligent diagnostics and repair information product lines. And that's been well received. 1,000s of technicians all across the U.S. and Canada will be upgrading to this very capable new edition before the next update is released in May. And then we'll start again. RS&I is building a powerful position in the vehicle repairs and vehicle repair software that meets the changing mobility environment. And the 20.4 is another step in that direction. We're confident in the strength of RS&I, and we keep driving to Spanish physician repair shop owners and managers making work easier with great new products even in the days of the virus. And that's our fourth quarter, absorbing the shock, driving accommodation, moving on to psychological recovery, keeping our people safe while we serve the essential all of that is working. Building Snap-On's advantage and the results show us sequential gains from the third quarter and significant growth from last year. Sales up 12.5%, 10.6% organically OI margin 20.1%, 220 basis points higher financial services continuing to deliver navigating the virus with strength and without disruptions and EPS up $3.82 up 24% all achieved, while maintaining and expanding our advantages and product brands and people ending the year stronger ready for more opportunities to come. It was an encouraging quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?\nAldo Pagliari: Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. The fourth quarter of 2020 was strong with respect to Snap-On\u2019s financial performance. Sales development was robust both year-over-year and sequentially. Gross profit and operating earnings margins expanded, and cash flow generation was again healthy net sales of $1,074.4 million in the quarter compared to $955.2 million last year, reflecting a 10.6% organic sales gain $9.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation and $7.5 billion of acquisition related sales. The organic increase principally reflected double-digit growth across the Snap-On tool segment, and high single-digit gains with repair shop owners and managers in the repair systems and information segment. We've began identified direct costs associated with COVID-19, which totaled $2.8 million this quarter. These costs include direct labor and under absorption associated with temporary factory closures, wages for quarantines associates event cancellation fees, as well as other costs to accommodate the current enhanced health and safety environment. Also in the quarter, we recorded $1 million of restructuring cost actions for Europe. Consolidated gross margin of 48% compared to 47.2% last year, the 80 basis point improvement primarily reflects the higher sales volume and benefits and the company's RCI initiatives partially offset by 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects and 10 basis points of direct costs associated with COVID-19. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 27.9% improved 140 basis points from 29.3% last year, primarily reflecting the impact of the higher sales, which more than offset the 30 basis points related to restructuring and direct costs associated with COVID-19. Operating earnings before financial services of $216.2 million, including $2.8 million of direct costs associated with COVID-19, $1 million of restructuring costs and $1.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $171.4 million in 2019, reflecting a 26.1% year-over-year improvement. As a percentage of net sales operating margin before financial services of 20.1%, including 30 basis points of direct cost associated to the COVID-19 pandemic, and 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects improve 220 basis points from 17.9% last year. As you may know, Snap-On operates on a fiscal calendar, which results in an additional week to our fiscal full year and fourth quarter every six years. As a result, our 2020 fiscal year contains 53 weeks of operating results with the extra week relative to the prior year occurring in the fourth quarter. While the impact of this additional week was not material to Snap-On\u2019s consolidated fourth quarter total revenues or net earnings, our financial services segment did earn an additional week of interest income on its financing portfolio. At the consolidated level, the net earnings benefit from the additional week of financial services interest income was largely offset by a corresponding additional week of fixed expenses, primarily personnel related costs and interest expense. With that said, financial services revenue of $93.4 million in the quarter of 2020 compared to $83.9 million last year, primarily reflecting the extra week of interest income and the growth in the financial services portfolio. Financial services operating earnings of $68.5 million increase $6.3 million for 2019 levels, principally due to the higher revenue but partially offset by increased variable compensation and other costs. Consolidated operating earnings of $284.7 million including $2.8 million of direct COVID related costs $1 million of restructuring costs and $1.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $233.6 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 24.4% compared to 22.5% in 2019. Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 21.8% compared to 22.3% last year. Finally, net earnings of $208.9 million or $3.82 per diluted share, including a $0.02 charge for restructuring increased $38.3 million or $0.74 per share from 2019 levels representing a 24% increase in diluted earnings per share. Now let's turn to our segment results, starting with the C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $364.4 million increased 3.3% from $352.9 million last year reflecting $7.5 million of acquisition related sales and $6.5 million of favorable foreign currency translation partially offset by a seven-tenths of 1% organic sales declining. While organic sales were essentially flat as compared to last year, they did improve sequentially in a more meaningful manner than what we see in our typical seasonal patterns, with organic sales of 14.6% from the third quarter of 2020. As compared to last year, the organic sales declined primarily reflects a mid single-digit decrease in our Asia Pacific operations, and a low single-digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries, offset by double-digit gains in the segments European based hand tools business. Within Asia similar to last quarter, sales to customers in India and Southeast Asia continue to be impacted by the effects of the pandemic. Across critical industries, while year-over-year sales declined in natural resources including oil and gas, U.S. Aviation and Technical Education. Sales into these markets have improved from third quarter comparisons. This quarter\u2019s year-over-year gains were reflected across international aviation heavy duty and non-military government related activity. Sales to the U.S. military were lower as compared to the prior year as the fourth quarter of 2019 included sales for a major project that is winding down. Sales increases in our European based hand tool business were heaven across the region, particularly in France and the United Kingdom, as well as in our Scandinavian and export markets. Gross Margin of 37.8% improved 230 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to increased sales and higher gross margin businesses and declines in lower gross margin sales to the military, as well as from benefits of RCI initiatives. These increases were partially offset by 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects and 20 basis points of direct COVID-19 costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales 22.4% from 30 basis points as compared to last year. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $56.2 million, including $1.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and $1 million of direct COVID-19 costs compared to $45 million last year. The operating margin of 15.4% compared to 12.8% a year ago. Turning down to Slide 8, sales in the Snap-On Tools Group of $494.9 million increased 20.2% from $411.7 million in 2019 reflecting a 19.6% organic sales gain and $2.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase reflects double-digit gains in both our U.S. and international operations. This reflects a 9.5% organic sequential gain over a strong third quarter 2020 sales performance. Gross margin of 42.9% in the quarter improved 270 basis points, primarily due to the higher sales volumes and benefits from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 24% improved from 27% last year, primarily due to the impact of higher sales volumes and savings from cost containment actions, which more than offset $1 million or 30 basis points of COVID-19 related costs. Operating earnings for the Snap-On Tools Group of $93.6 million compared to $54.3 million last year. The operating margin of 18.9% compared to 13.2% a year ago, an increase of 570 basis points. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9, sales of $361.1 million compared to $335 million a year ago reflecting a 7% organic sales gain and $2.4 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase includes a double-digit gain sales to OEM dealerships, particularly in sales related to OEM facilitation programs and a high single-digit increase in the sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. These increases were partially offset by a low single-digit decline in sales of undercar equipment. Sequentially RS&I organic sales improved by 13.2%. Gross Margin of 46.1%, including 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, declined 160 basis points from last year primarily due to the impact have higher sales and lower gross margin businesses including facilitation program related sales to OEM dealerships. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 21.2%, including 30 basis points of cost from restructuring improved 50 basis points from 21.7% last year, largely reflecting the mix of business activity in the quarter. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $90 million, compared to $87.2 million last year, the operating margins at 24.9%, including the effects of 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects and 10 basis points of direct costs associated with COVID-19 compared to 26% a year ago. Now turning to Slide 10, revenue from financial services of $93.4 million compared to $83.9 million last year. This includes the additional days of accrued interest associated with a 53rd week in our 2020 fiscal calendar. Financial services operating earnings of $68.5 million, compared to $62.2 million in 2019. Financial services expenses of $24.9 million increased $3.2 million from last year's levels, primarily due to higher variable compensation and other costs partially offset by a year-over-year decrease in provisions for credit losses. Compared to the fourth quarter last year, provisions for credit losses were lower by $700,000, while net charge-offs and bad debts were lower by $1.3 million. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1.1% and 1% in the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2019, respectively. In the fourth quarter, the average yield and finance receivables is 17.7% in 2020 compared to 17.5% in 2019. The respective average yield on contract receivables was 8.5% and 9.2%. The lower yield on contract receivables in 2020 includes the impact of lower interest business operations support loans for our franchisees. These loans were offered during the second quarter to help accommodate franchisee operations and dealing with the COVID-19 environment. As of the end of the quarter, approximately $13 million of these business operating support loans remain outstanding. Total loan originations of $272.4 million in the quarter increased $10 million or 3.8% from 2019 levels, reflecting a 4.5% increase in originations of finance receivables, while originations of contract receivables were essentially flat. Moving to Slide 11. Our year-end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our U.S. operation. In the fourth quarter, our worldwide gross financial services portfolio increased $20.8 million, the 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.8% for the United States, extended credit is unchanged from last year and reflects the seasonal increase we typically experienced in the fourth quarter. As relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12 months net losses of $45.6 million represented 2.62% of outstandings at quarter end, down 8 basis points sequentially and down 29 basis points as compared to the same period last year. Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $317.6 million in the quarter increased $120.9 million from comparable 2019 levels, primarily reflecting the higher net earnings and net changes in operating assets and liabilities including a $53.5 million decrease in working investment, primarily driven by inventory reductions in the period. Net cash used by investing activities of $73.6 million included $35.4 million for the acquisition of auto grid, capital expenditures of $26.5 million and net additions to finance receivables of $15.9 million. Free cash flow during the quarter of $275.2 million was 129% in relation to net earnings. Net cash used by financing activities of $111.6 million, including cash dividends of $66.8 million and the repurchase of 460,000 shares of common stock for $78.7 million under our existing share repurchase program. Full year 2020 share repurchases totaled 1.109 shares for $174.3 million. As of year-end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $275.7 million of common stock under existing authorizations. Turning to Slide 13, trade and other accounts receivable decreased $53.9 million from 2019 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 64 days compared to 67 days of 2019 year-end. Inventories decreased $13.9 million from 29 year-end including a $40.1 million inventory reduction, partially offset by increases from $23.2 million of currency translation and $3 million from acquisitions. On a trailing 12 month basis inventory turns of 2.4 compared to 2.6 in year-end 2019, and 2.4 at the end of the third quarter 2020. Year-end cash position of $923.4 million compared to $184.5 million a year in 2019. Our net debt to capital ratio of 12.1% compared to 22.1% at year-end 2019. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million in available credit facilities. As of year-end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2021. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. We currently anticipate the absence of any changes to U.S. Tax Legislation that our full year 2021 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 23% to 24%. I'll turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick.\nNick Pinchuk: Thanks, Aldo. Snap-On fourth quarter, we're encouraged by where we've been and by where we're going. You see, we believe that we exit 2020 stronger more capable and more advantaged than when we entered the year. The virus came, we absorb the shock. We accommodated the turbulence and we forged a V shaped recovery as we anticipated in the depths of the difficulty. We believe the year is vivid testimony to Snap-On resilience into our ability in turning change and challenge to our advantage. And the fourth quarter performance says it's so. Sales up 12.5% as reported 10.6% organically OI margin 20.1% or 220 basis points against 30 basis points of unfavorable currency 10 basis points of restructuring charges and 30 basis points of direct COVID costs, strong improve. C&I sale, clear sequential gains OI margin of 15.4% rising 260 points, RSI sales up 7% organically, OI of 24.9% down, but still in heavy territory. Financial services revenue and profits all up portfolio solid in the storm. And finally, the Tools Group, sales are up 19.6% organically profits up 72.4% OI margin of 18.9% rising 570 basis points good numbers. But more importantly, underscoring our belief that the franchisee selling capacity has expanded and is positioned for more gains. And all of that it all came together to offer an EPS in the quarter of $3.82 up 24% from 2019 new heights in the great turbulence of 2020. And these heights were achieved while still nurturing our product, our brand, our people preserving and amplifying our natural advantages. We do believe we will leave the year at full and expanded strength and ready to reach higher and farther amid the abundant opportunities a 2021 and the years beyond. Before I turn the call over the operator. I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. We celebrate your contributions as you perform your central task, and we're confident your effort in preserving our society will be remembered for years to come. For your success in altering the encouraging results of our fourth quarter, you have my congratulations. And for your steadfast commitment to our present and for your unwavering belief in our future. You have my thanks. Now turn the call over to the operator. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Scott Stember with C.L. King.\nScott Stember: Good morning guys and congratulations on a very strong quarter.\nNick Pinchuk: Thank you.\nAldo Pagliari: Thank you.\nScott Stember: Particularly when you look at the Tools Group and if you look at the year-over- year number, I think you said, organically up 2% looks like you've essentially offset what you lost during the COVID period. But can you just frame out, how much of that was catch-up, and how much of that, is there a new incremental layer of growth? You talked about, people not traveling and being around and easy, I guess, some positive things coming, just your views on the Tools Group?\nNick Pinchuk: I think the story of the Tools Group is they took the COVID. And if you look at the endpoints, they're unaffected, what I mean, if you look at the endpoints are pretty good. And I think part of it is, sure they got shocked, and they had to accommodate, but they came back. And that's really the story of the corporation. But if you want to talk about recovery, I think, certainly in the third quarter, we had some recovery, we're coming out of those deep days of the virus in the end of the first quarter and second quarter. Fourth quarter, it's harder to judge that. We think the expanding capacity and the impact of the new products coming out of the SFC drove things. Now, you can step back and look at one other thing is that, if you attempted to think about that, realize that sales of the VAN kind of matched of, and sales of the van were up, significantly more than the sales to the VAN in the year. So I would say things are kind of chugging along, we can talk about what's up and down and so on. We think the Tools Group is in good shape. We think its product is where it is. And that's why I spent time on the discussion talking about expanding the capabilities of our franchisees because we said that there are two boundaries to the Tools Group, it's time and space. And we think we broke them through some of the time.\nScott Stember: Got it. So just again, you said that it was up significantly more than the selling, just to make sure I heard that correctly.\nNick Pinchuk: Yes, significant more than Tools Group. If you look at the full year, of the VAN was more than to the VAN, and in the better, it changes from month-to-month, but generally kept pace even in the best course, best periods.\nScott Stember: Yes, and again, your view longer term hasn't changed mid single-digit growth for this segment. Just to clarify that?\nNick Pinchuk: That haven't changed, I think we get, let's take one step at a time and get back to where we want to be. We said we're 46% growth and will grow as a corporation, the Tools Group at the bottom of that. It\u2019s a great profitable business. We think it's positioned for growth. We'll just take that one quarter at a time, but we're feeling good.\nScott Stember: Got it. And then last question, within tools. Did you talk about how big ticket did versus hand tools? Let me just clarify that a little more.\nNick Pinchuk: Hand tools was stronger, which is one of the great things we're innovating in hand tools. This is an interesting that in a complex environment like this hand tools and we've seen it forever hand tools are a great business. But the big ticket items continue to go it's particularly diagnostics, this particular quarter were nice and strong. But it's also a tool -- and Tools Group is up. But in any kind of environment coming out of the difficulty, like we saw in the financial recession, people take a little time to fully get into psychological recovery, and they're willing to pay for, or invest in longer payback is. So you're seeing that coming along.\nScott Stember: Got it. That's all I have. Thank you.\nNick Pinchuk: Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Luke Junk with Baird.\nLuke Junk: Thanks, and good morning, guys. First question, Nick. Just wondering if you could follow up on sales of the VAN versus your sales in the fourth quarter specifically, should we assume that outlines, that you just provided relative to the full year and sort of the general shape of that as we went through the year overall?\nNick Pinchuk: No. So, I don't want to get into that. I don't want to start another reporting number for myself. But the sales of the van were up strong double-digits.\nLuke Junk: Fair enough.\nNick Pinchuk: Yes, okay. And that that followed month-by-month. So we're not seeing any sale off necessarily. We like the momentum.\nLuke Junk: Okay, I'll leave that one there. Second question that I wanted to ask is if you could expand on the comments that he made on the software side, Nick, in terms of the ADAS content that you rolled out I just want to understand -- what that capability is.\nNick Pinchuk: Okay I will you that, I tell you. One of the things, I talked about the sales of that information and diagnostic store repair shop owners or managers and independent shops, and one of the cornerstones of that lately is in Mitchell 1 is the ADAS software, which allows people to deal with difficulties of programming and understanding what's wrong with when you have a bridge in the advanced driver systems and as cars go to more autonomous this is even going to bigger. And so that Mitchell 1 has been one of the solid ones. If you go back and look at it, that segment has that portion has been pretty solid throughout the COVID. And that's one of the things driving it is the demand for these products. If automakers were going to go to highly automated cars, I kiss them tomorrow, because our business gets even better because precision is needed. And that's evidence of it.\nLuke Junk: And then last question for Aldo, if I could. Just wondering if you could comment on higher steel pricing that we're seeing right now and your ability to offset that both operationally and through pricing actions, given the strength that you're seeing the Tools Group, especially right now?\nAldo Pagliari: Well, certainly we always do believe when there's invisible and -- visible inflation, I should say that we have the pricing power to deal with it. That said, yes, there's increases in the steel horizon, it takes a few months for them to come into the company, because obviously you buy in order some inventories in the past months, and you have them in line to arrive. So there's a trailing effect that's there. But historically, if you look back, Luke, we've had these types of gyrations in steel from time-to-time, and we deal with it, we do have pricing power, then again, I remind everyone Snap-On is very vertically integrated. So in a way, the good news factor is steel is not as much a percent of the final end product, as some people might imagine. So I think that actually does work to our benefit to some degree.\nLuke Junk: Great, thank you for the color. I'll leave it there.\nNick Pinchuk: Right, good.\nOperator: We will take our next question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.\nDavid MacGregor: Yes. Good morning, everyone. Nick, congratulations on the good numbers, strong quarter.\nNick Pinchuk: Thank you.\nDavid MacGregor: Help me understand, why the spread between tools segment organic growth and the origination numbers is again this quarter in the mid-teens. And you called that diagnostics, being strong, I think you may have even said double-digits. So I'm really struggling to understand that, but\u2026\nNick Pinchuk: I didn't actually say double-digit just to be clear. I don't think we could read. Sometimes I say things I don't remember. But certainly I don't think I said at that time. Look what here is the thing, you like to ask that question. Of course, that originations are divorced in time from what we sell to the VANS. And so what we're talking about is selling to the VANS. And so you have that divorce. But like I said, our hand tools are stronger in this quarter than others because people haven't been investing in big ticket items as much. But the big ticket items are still up diagnostics was strong. And diagnostic is kind of a mix, it doesn't all go to EC, they increasingly because as the franchisees get more well heeled, they often use them on revolving accounts, sort of put them on their 15 week deal or they may stretch it a little bit. They don't go to EC. So we get a mix of those things. So if you're trying to figure out where origination is going to go, you have time displacement. And you have the split of EC between RA I mean, but diagnostics between RA and EC, and then you have tool storage on top of that. So it would be fair to say though, that, as I said before the overall big ticket items wasn't as robust as the overall tool sales.\nDavid MacGregor: Sure. I mean, you call that sell through off the truck in the fourth quarter up double, I think there you did say up double-digits, and it was a strong and\u2026\nNick Pinchuk: I did. Yes, I did. Yes, I did.\nDavid MacGregor: And the strong cadence through the quarter. I mean, on the surface, when you see that greater disparity between organic growth and tools in the originations number, it would look like there was an inventory build on the trucks.\nNick Pinchuk: No, I don't think so. We don't think that look, here's the thing. I think I'm saying this, I think if it lines up perfectly, the sales off the truck and to the truck kind of line up, all right. In fact, maybe for the full year, the sales off the truck are higher. So there's an inventory shrink, I guess, in macro. And secondly, what I'm saying is sales to the truck are more weighted to smaller ticket items, because people invest in the shorter paybacks in these times. But that doesn't mean that the big ticket Mullingar diagnostics was strong. We like diagnostics, but I'm not giving a total number.\nDavid MacGregor: Right. And then what was the impact of the extra week on organic growth in the tool segment?\nNick Pinchuk: Yes, it's kind of immaterial, really, because, the extra week is between New Year's and Christmas. And you got holidays and you got people relaxing and those periods so it doesn't really make much difference. It might be I think, actually, we in OpCo anyway, we lose money in that week. So at the expenses, and we don't have much sales.\nDavid MacGregor: So a typical week would be about $40 million in revenues. Would it be half of that?\nNick Pinchuk: No less.\nDavid MacGregor: Less than half of that, okay.\nNick Pinchuk: This happens, whatever, this happens every year the same way. We don't have that week, but that week is the same every year.\nDavid MacGregor: Okay, last question for me. I guess on the cost savings at the SG&A line specifically, within the tool segment expenses were down about 300 basis points. So nice to see that pretty good number. By contrast in the C&I segment, your expenses were down about 30 bips and then RS&I down about 50. So I guess the question is, what are we able to cut back on and tools that may not have presented the same opportunity in the other two segments? And how much of that I don't know, could cost 250 basis points of discrepancy comes back with normalized conditions in \u201821?\nNick Pinchuk: I don't know. Look, I think one of the reasons is, of course, the Tools Group is much more heavily direct. And so because we're selling direct through our franchise, we're selling with our franchisees, we're out there travel and services, I mean, the normal years, and so we're out, we're kind of forward placed in tools more than others, so we like to be in the other places. So you would expect that to be a more target rich situation, especially in a situation with travels restricted in. And as far as going backward, I don't know, I think if your any operating business, you're feathered back these operations, you want to go out reach people when the sky is clear. Your guess is as good as mine. When the sky is clear, and you're going to work, they're going to be feathered in. I don't know if it will I doubt if it will all come back. But some of it will come back. I can't give you any guidance on it, though, really? Because we -- we're going to play it period-by-period.\nDavid MacGregor: Okay, thanks. I'll get out of the way and turn it over to others. Thanks, Nick.\nNick Pinchuk: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Curtis Nagle with Bank of America.\nCurtis Nagle: Thanks very much. So, I know you guys don't give guidance in terms of any of the operating numbers, but maybe just a little insight, I guess, if you could, in terms of kind of how you're planning out or budgeting the year for the Tools Group, I guess vis-\u00e0-vis things like miles driven what I think should be a recovering environment for things like collision and other auto work? I wasn't sort of framing I guess if you see 2021?\nNick Pinchuk: Yes, look miles driven. Everybody makes a big deal about miles driven. But we never see motion, miles driven short-term. I don't think it plays out what we've learned is, since we've had over the last few years put a bigger in collision, it plays out in the collision business. So you're very right. I mean, collision is down significantly as an industry year-over-year. And we see that and you're seeing it that in our equipment, numbers that isn't in the Tools Group numbers so much. You might see some garages, the odd, the garages we visit, but isn't a big factor in that situation. Miles driven, I think it's not so much the short-term, but we think longer term, it's going to start going up and that going to be more cars, because people are going to go to individual vehicles, who wants to get on a subway, how many people want to live in a 47 -- work in a 40 storey building in the future? Maybe you guys I don't know. But I think there's going to be a motion a reversal of that we saw that in China. So we see car ownership and miles driven in a long way of getting better. And that drives our business what that means for us in 2021, unclear, but we think its opportunity. Now we think it's opportunity in the longer term, we're going to play out quarter-by-quarter, what I will tell you is we feel good about the momentum we've had going through the year, closing out the year. We feel good about that. We feel good about how our products are being received. We feel good about the efficacy of our software in the complex business. We feel good about the idea that our VAN drivers have more time so that's what I would say.\nCurtis Nagle: Okay, fair enough. And then maybe just a quick follow up. I guess any notable changes in terms of the underlying health on the tech population, technician population in terms of income, which I think is still pretty good?\nNick Pinchuk: Actually income is up. But wages, I'll say that, I'll say the wages are up trailing 12 months and year-over-year in November, we will be less logistic. So, you view that from which you will but it\u2019s up a couple 3%. So the wages are up nicely, so the technicians aren't suffering and they think, I've talked to several franchisees yesterday, and they all think positive about their customer base. So that's pretty good. And we had our kickoffs and I zoomed in to the watch parties in Pennsylvania, in Florida and Iowa and in New York, and they were all positive about their customers. So I think the technicians are being affected. In fact, maybe they're doing better.\nCurtis Nagle: And you said, this is kind of, slow moving, maybe slow turning things. But in terms of the ongoing shortages in terms of tax any improvement there with employment?\nNick Pinchuk: Here is what I'll tell you, is that we're involved in that. We think that's an opportunity for us. And of course, we're working on that and for in listing people in career and technical education. And what we do is we establish Snap-On education sector is down, but we think it's been a boon for us, because we've been investing in education, and our number of certified centers, the education centers that offer Snap-On certification programs increased 33% in 2020 from 133 to 177. So we think we're in good shape in that situation. So I think technicians are going to come I think people are working on it. I'm particularly kind of optimistic about the President because his wife, Dr. Joe Biden is in technical education. So I think it'll get a good focus.\nCurtis Nagle: All right, sounds good. Good luck on the quarter and thank you very much.\nNick Pinchuk: Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Bret Jordan with Jefferies.\nBret Jordan: Good morning, guys.\nNick Pinchuk: Good morning.\nBret Jordan: I am going to sort of trying to reconcile the tools growth with originations, are you seeing that maybe mechanics are using other sources of credit? Given their lack of spending on vacations or restaurants other entertainment?\nNick Pinchuk: I don't know, maybe you'll never know, I don't think we're seeing that. I haven't heard that anyway. \nBret Jordan: You're not seeing a cash buyer pick up, I guess.\nNick Pinchuk: What does happen though, is as our franchisees get more flush they tend to reach up. Franchisees are healthier. And they tend to reach up into the lower end of the what we would call bigger ticket items, particularly in a diagnostic segment. So the big hitter, one of our baby boomers is the Apollo D9 and it's kind of for the everyman technician in the middle of the range. And that's the thing that really did well in the quarter. And that one can be financed by a technician, by a franchisee. So maybe we're seeing some of that, and that one we introduced, I think at the SFC, it gets rolling out we gave demonstration units. It's outselling its predecessor by about 25% in terms of activations and so it's looking pretty good. So maybe that heading this, but I just want to caution that it's hard to reconcile in the end period, originations with what sales we have to the van that's another factor. There are a bunch of factors that are dislocating in that way. Over time, it should be directionally.\nBret Jordan: Okay. And then I guess a question on share gains obviously, some really strong quarters back-to-back in tool the full year just got to go up a couple percent. But do you feel that there's any shift in market share in your favor right now or is the market overall particularly strong?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, I think, look, I think vehicle I think our markets are overall strong, they're critical repair in particular being they're critical. They're critical. And they're essential and particular vehicle repair that underpins our critical mobility in the nation. But, and I don't really like to talk about market share, but what I'll tell you is, my franchisees are telling us that I said in my speech, that we are benefiting from being there through thick and thin. We were there every day in almost every day in the pandemic, anytime anybody would meet us, our guys were out there safely. And that has accrued to us. So for that turns into market share, I guess you can interpret it how you will.\nBret Jordan: Okay, great. Thank you.\nAldo Pagliari: Sure, thanks Bret.\nOperator: And we will take our final question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.\nChristopher Glynn: Thanks. Kind of a narrow question, but maybe illustrative of how you operate. Nick you mentioned, growth in international aviation, even double-digit pretty adds-on with the context of that margin. So is that kind of a startup initiative or is it up a decent base just looking for a little bit more?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, look our international business is not fully equal to the U.S. business in aviation critical industries, but it's a reasonable comparison. This isn't like $300,000 and we doubled it to 600. That's not it. So generally that business I think, broad aviation is enough to bring aviation in total sort of up. So I mean, it's a good business. All I can say is go figure. Where we're getting. I guess it's a credit to the quality of our tools, the importance. Now remember, one of the things we've done in industrial that has got us, I think, got great popularity is we're leaning more and more on this customized kits. I talked about it, that\u2019s in Europe, and we were banging those customers. It was gangbusters on a customized kits for the last several quarters and we are expanding capacity in that. In fact, that's one of the investments next year we're looking at to expand our capacity and customize kits and international aviation is part of it.\nChristopher Glynn: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Now I would like to turn the call back to Sara Verbsky for any additional or closing remarks.\nSara Verbsky: Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-On. Good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Nick Pinchuk",
            "content": "Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. Today, I'll start with the highlights of our fourth quarter. I'll give you a perspective on how the virus is playing out and on the trends that we see today and going forward. And I'll speak about our physical and financial progress. Then Aldo will give you a more detailed review of the financials. To start with, I'll just say we are encouraged by the quarter it was strong. But we believe we can reach even higher. This year was -- a lot of unusual events, but when you look through it all Snap-On saw a headwinds but we met those challenges absorb the shock, develop the combinations to the environment, move forward on a clear recovery. And we believe we exited the year stronger than ever. We did have disparities from group-to-group and within each group, but our overall sales and profitability improved both sequentially, and year-over-year for the second straight quarter, achieving new heights despite the virus. Through the year, the Snap-On team continue to make progress accommodating to the threat pursuing our essential commercial opportunities safely. And moving along upward trajectory is consistent with our general projections on how the days of the virus would unfold. Geographically, the impact of the COVID continues to be varied for us. Asia Pacific remains virus challenge; Southeast Asia and India are still in deep turbulence. And while the U.S. and Europe actually seem to be further ahead and accommodation, and are moving on to what we call psychological recovery. For the business segments, we saw the essential nature of our markets rising through the turbulence along our runways for growth. Demand for vehicle repair technicians, to our franchisee network directly selling-off the vans, it was robust. Again this quarter, it was robust. Volume of repair shop owners and managers continued to gain and activity and critical industries advanced despite certain sectors like education, oil and gas, U.S. Aviation not returning to growth yet, but you would kind of affect that. Going forward, we are convinced that we're well positioned on a strong base. But we know we have much more work to do. The environment throughout the world is still impacted by the virus and many of our businesses have not yet fully recovered against the great weathering. But having recognized these headwinds however, we're also convinced that there will be abundant opportunities as the skies clear and society pivots toward suburban locations and to more individual trends transportation. This is great news for the vehicle repair industry, I got to tell you. And because of that, we're keeping focus on Snap-On value creation, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, our RCI. We've been unrelenting and advancing our advantage in products that solve the most critical tasks and brands that serve as the outward sign and our brands that serve as the outward sign of the pride and dignity working men and women take in their profession and in our people are deeply committed and very capable. Snap-On team is a great asset. And we've maintained it through these days of the virus. We've advanced each of these strengths in the turbulence, and it's enabled Snap-On to achieve new heights, and the numbers show it. That's the overview now the results. Fourth quarter, as reported sales of $1,074.4 million were up 12.5% from 2019, including $9.6 million of favorable foreign currency translations, and $7.5 million of acquisition related sales. Organic sales will rose 10.6% volume gains in the van channel and OEM dealerships and diagnostics and repair information in our European handles business all demonstrating the abundant opportunities on our runways and our increased ability to take advantage of those opportunities. From an earnings perspective, operating net income from the quarter of $216.2 million including $2.8 million direct costs associated with the virus, $1 million of restructuring charges for actions outside the United States. And a $1.5 million hit from unfavorable currency was up 26.1%. And the OpCo operating margin it was 20.1%, 220 basis points overcoming 30 basis points of unfavorable currency 30 basis points of COVID cost impact and 10 basis points restructuring. For financial services operating income of $68.5 million increased 10.1% from 2019, all while keeping 60-day delinquencies flat the last year in the midst of the pandemic stress test. And that results combined with OpCo for consolidated operating margin of 24.4% 190 basis points point improvement. The overall quarterly EPS was $3.82, including a $0.02 charge for restructuring and that result compared to $3.08 last year, an increase of 24% I did say new height. Now for full year, sales were $3,593 million a 3.8% organic decline principally on the first and second quarter shock of the virus before the sequential gains of a combination to hold. OpCo OI is $631.9 million including $12.5 million of restructuring charges $11.9 million of direct costs associated with COVID-19 and $13.1 million of unfavorable currency compared to $716.4 million in 2019, which benefited from $11.6 million legal settlement and a patent related litigation matter. OpCo OI margin including a 30 basis point impact associated with restructuring, 30 points of direct pandemic expenses, 30 points of unfavorable currency with 17.6% and compare with 19.2% in 2019, which incorporated 30 basis points of non-recurring benefits of the legal service. That's a mouthful, right. But what it says is that despite the great disruption our full year OI margin was down only 40 basis points apples-to-apples, demonstrating the special Snap-On resilience that has enabled us to pay dividends every quarter since 1939 without a single reduction. For the year financial services registered OI of $248.6 million versus the $245.9 million in 2019. Overall EPS for the period of $11.44 was down 7.8% from the $12.41 reported last year 2019 adjusting for the restructuring and the current year and the one-time legal benefit in the prior year 2020 EPS as adjusted reached $11.52, down 5.1%. So now let's go on to the individual operating groups. In C&I volume in the quarter fourth quarter of $364.4 million including $7.5 million from acquisitions, and $6.5 million a favorable foreign currency was up 3.3% as reported. The activity was essentially flat organically, but represented a continuing sequential C&I rise all the way back to the early shot. Notably, in these numbers, the C&I year-over-year sales were marked by a strong double-digit rise in our European base hand tool business going broadly across Western Europe against the twin challenges of COVID and the Brexit disruption. They're also offsetting decreases in sales to our customers in critical industries in Asia Pacific. But both these operations join the overall growth group and registering substantial quarter-to-quarter sequential improvement. They're still down, but they're clearly recovering. From an earnings perspective, C&I, operating income of $56.2 million increased $11.2 million, including $1.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, and a $1 million of COVID related costs, with sales up 3.3% as reported flat organically, OI grew 24.9% a nice operating improvement. And the OI margin for the group was 50.4% up 260 basis points in the last year overcoming 70 basis points of unfavorable currency and 30 points of direct COVID cost, the benefits of RCI and margin gains in the critical energy industries made all the difference. Speaking to the critical industries, we did see selective gains international aviation and heavy duty registered double-digit improvements. But as you might expect, and I referenced before education, oil and gas and U.S. Aviation continue to be down. And then in the quarter our military sales will also impacted by the wind-down at one of our major fitting programs. But we do remain confident in and committed to expanding in the critical industries and we see growing opportunities moving forward and a principal path to that possibility is customer connection in innovation, creating powerful new products. You heard about our European hand tool business. It shows significant resiliency in the quarter. And it was aided by a good dose of innovation products like our recent expansion of our FIFO custom fitting system, extending our direct-to-user possibilities. Our new fitting goal product line allows buyers to quickly develop semi-bespoke kits in foam tool control consists of more than 200 pre-configured different tool sets designed around a 26 inch wide block a roll cast available in three standard foam configurations one-thirds store two-thirds store and a full door. Customers can choose the particular box drop configuration and the tool array needed right from our block a roll website reaching end users without distributor interaction, and for a wider range of specialization and sometimes it is specialization is required, our sales reps can help develop just the right unit using the full breadth of the block hole system. We've had great success with our new fitting goal. It's an important extension of our hand tool presence in Europe. And in the quarter it helped boost SNA Europe to achieve the double-digit growth in a very challenging environment. I think everybody would agree. C&I demonstrating further accommodation with continued sequential gains serving the essential each of the businesses generating a positive trajectory and exiting the quarter stronger than when they entered and product offered a big piece of that progress. Now onto the Tools Group. As reported sales up 20.2% to $494.9 million, including $2.2 million a favorable foreign currency and an $81 million or 19.6% organic increase the second straight quarter of strong game with the U.S. and international business is both growing at double-digits. And the Tools Group operating earnings $93.6 million, including $1.2 million of virus related costs, that 93.6 included $1.2 million virus related costs, and that $93.6 million compared to last year's $54.3 million and over 70% improvement. Actually, the Tools Group was recovered to positive territory for the full year. Sales were up 2% organically with OI rising almost 9% and OI margins up 110 basis points. The continue operating gains of the Tools Group are further affirmation of our view of the COVID-19 trajectory and the resilience of the vehicle repair business. And on the strength of our direct face-to-face van model, it turns out that deepened direct connection with the customers is a differentiator even in a pandemic. And in the quarter and throughout the year the Tools Group confirmed the market leading position of our van network. We believe the franchisees are growing stronger. That's clear in the franchisee health metrics we monitor each period, they continue to trend favorably and that was acknowledged by a number of respected publications, Snap-On as a franchise of choice. One was the franchise business review where we were again recognized and the magazine's latest rankings for franchisee satisfaction as a top 50 franchise marking the 14th consecutive year that Snap-On received that award. Now this type of recognition reflects the fundamental strength of our franchisees and our VAN business in general and would not have been achieved without a continuous stream of innovative new product developed through our strong customer connections. Throughout the storm, we've added every day to our already considerable insight and experience in the changing vehicle environment and because of that we're able to bring forward innovation great products like our newly released eight inch talent grip plank jaw pliers. We call it the HJ 47 ACF with a unique design for significant versatility in both removing and tightening fasteners. First, our unique plank jaw, specially designed, smooth and unsaturated meeting area allows the user to grip a hex shape only on the flat surface, positioning the load away from the corners. That's similar to our flank drive systems on sockets, 30% more torch applied to the fastener while still minimizing damages, eliminating rounded edges. Second, when the fasteners have already been heavily rounded and are tough to grip. Our talent grip diamond serrated jaws jointed located as the pliers tip generate unparalleled clamping force it's up to a 57% increase in turning power. With the Snap-On talent, technicians can remove even the most damaged and rounded hex fasteners and for the icing on the versatility cake, the new pliers also feature a patented three position slip joint designed for easy changes to the grip position, the HD 47 ACF, manufacturing right here and I'm going to walk you to the plant in the U.S. and it's been very well received putting it on a clear path to becoming another one of our hit products $1 million selling products just in one quarter. We also worked hard during the COVID to maintain and further strengthen our brand, celebrating our 100 year continuing our presence in racing and serve, most importantly I think servicing our customers every-day reinforcing that what they do really is essential and that the display the Snap-On brand confirms that it's sold. Sometimes the Tools Groups also been working to Span franchisee selling capacity. And that effect continued with focus to the pandemic and the days of the early shot access to the shops and to the technicians vary widely and the Tools Group more to engage social media in bridging the gap. This turned into a powerful tool for pre-briefing customers on products and promotions, reserving the actual face-to-face interaction for closing the deal, providing significant franchisee opportunity for selling more products and reaching new customers. The tools we've also made strides and redeploying the time saved from restricted travel, everybody stay-at-home work today streamlining the VAN sales process to RCI and developing more concise customer presentation. So important in pitching products of ever rising complexity, social media engagement, RCI, selling and more effective trading. It made the difference, raising franchisee selling capacity to match the strength and capacity of our new product and the results back it up. Well, that's the Tools Group. Moving through a V shaped recovery, recording two straight quarters of double-digit expansion, continuing a stream of new products building the brand raising selling capacity and strengthening for the future. Now let's speak of RS&I. The RS&I Group continuing the combination and extending its positive trend sales at $361.1 million in the fourth quarter up 7.8%, 7% organically excluding $2.4 million of favorable foreign currency a steep recovery from the depths of the pandemic. The rise was due to double-digit gains and OEM dealerships as auto manufacturers began to release new models and launched more essential programs. A high single-digit gain in the sales of our of our powerful diagnostics and repair information products independent repair shop owners and managers and then offsetting low single-digit decline in sales of undercar equipment or garage owners haven't developed sufficient confidence to invest to get it invest broadly and upgrading or expanding their facilities. RS&I operating earnings of $90 million improved $2.8 million as the mix of lower margin OEM project sales diluted the volume improvement and as the group recorded a $1 million in charges for small European focused restriction. On a diagnostics and information based operations have recorded continuous growth for some time, the sales to independent repair shop owners and managers they've had continuous growth for some time, and innovative new products are the key to that success. And the fourth quarter was no exception. We just began shipping our new 20.4 software update for our diagnostics platforms in North America full coverage for the 2020 vehicles. Additional reprogramming facility, increased functional test capabilities, and an expansion of our unique advanced driver assistance or ADAS content, so critical these days for engaging vehicle automation. This software represents another move forward in our already powerful already market leading intelligent diagnostics and repair information product lines. And that's been well received. 1,000s of technicians all across the U.S. and Canada will be upgrading to this very capable new edition before the next update is released in May. And then we'll start again. RS&I is building a powerful position in the vehicle repairs and vehicle repair software that meets the changing mobility environment. And the 20.4 is another step in that direction. We're confident in the strength of RS&I, and we keep driving to Spanish physician repair shop owners and managers making work easier with great new products even in the days of the virus. And that's our fourth quarter, absorbing the shock, driving accommodation, moving on to psychological recovery, keeping our people safe while we serve the essential all of that is working. Building Snap-On's advantage and the results show us sequential gains from the third quarter and significant growth from last year. Sales up 12.5%, 10.6% organically OI margin 20.1%, 220 basis points higher financial services continuing to deliver navigating the virus with strength and without disruptions and EPS up $3.82 up 24% all achieved, while maintaining and expanding our advantages and product brands and people ending the year stronger ready for more opportunities to come. It was an encouraging quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Thanks, Aldo. Snap-On fourth quarter, we're encouraged by where we've been and by where we're going. You see, we believe that we exit 2020 stronger more capable and more advantaged than when we entered the year. The virus came, we absorb the shock. We accommodated the turbulence and we forged a V shaped recovery as we anticipated in the depths of the difficulty. We believe the year is vivid testimony to Snap-On resilience into our ability in turning change and challenge to our advantage. And the fourth quarter performance says it's so. Sales up 12.5% as reported 10.6% organically OI margin 20.1% or 220 basis points against 30 basis points of unfavorable currency 10 basis points of restructuring charges and 30 basis points of direct COVID costs, strong improve. C&I sale, clear sequential gains OI margin of 15.4% rising 260 points, RSI sales up 7% organically, OI of 24.9% down, but still in heavy territory. Financial services revenue and profits all up portfolio solid in the storm. And finally, the Tools Group, sales are up 19.6% organically profits up 72.4% OI margin of 18.9% rising 570 basis points good numbers. But more importantly, underscoring our belief that the franchisee selling capacity has expanded and is positioned for more gains. And all of that it all came together to offer an EPS in the quarter of $3.82 up 24% from 2019 new heights in the great turbulence of 2020. And these heights were achieved while still nurturing our product, our brand, our people preserving and amplifying our natural advantages. We do believe we will leave the year at full and expanded strength and ready to reach higher and farther amid the abundant opportunities a 2021 and the years beyond. Before I turn the call over the operator. I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. We celebrate your contributions as you perform your central task, and we're confident your effort in preserving our society will be remembered for years to come. For your success in altering the encouraging results of our fourth quarter, you have my congratulations. And for your steadfast commitment to our present and for your unwavering belief in our future. You have my thanks. Now turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Thank you. I think the story of the Tools Group is they took the COVID. And if you look at the endpoints, they're unaffected, what I mean, if you look at the endpoints are pretty good. And I think part of it is, sure they got shocked, and they had to accommodate, but they came back. And that's really the story of the corporation. But if you want to talk about recovery, I think, certainly in the third quarter, we had some recovery, we're coming out of those deep days of the virus in the end of the first quarter and second quarter. Fourth quarter, it's harder to judge that. We think the expanding capacity and the impact of the new products coming out of the SFC drove things. Now, you can step back and look at one other thing is that, if you attempted to think about that, realize that sales of the VAN kind of matched of, and sales of the van were up, significantly more than the sales to the VAN in the year. So I would say things are kind of chugging along, we can talk about what's up and down and so on. We think the Tools Group is in good shape. We think its product is where it is. And that's why I spent time on the discussion talking about expanding the capabilities of our franchisees because we said that there are two boundaries to the Tools Group, it's time and space. And we think we broke them through some of the time. Yes, significant more than Tools Group. If you look at the full year, of the VAN was more than to the VAN, and in the better, it changes from month-to-month, but generally kept pace even in the best course, best periods. That haven't changed, I think we get, let's take one step at a time and get back to where we want to be. We said we're 46% growth and will grow as a corporation, the Tools Group at the bottom of that. It's a great profitable business. We think it's positioned for growth. We'll just take that one quarter at a time, but we're feeling good. Hand tools was stronger, which is one of the great things we're innovating in hand tools. This is an interesting that in a complex environment like this hand tools and we've seen it forever hand tools are a great business. But the big ticket items continue to go it's particularly diagnostics, this particular quarter were nice and strong. But it's also a tool -- and Tools Group is up. But in any kind of environment coming out of the difficulty, like we saw in the financial recession, people take a little time to fully get into psychological recovery, and they're willing to pay for, or invest in longer payback is. So you're seeing that coming along. Thank you. No. So, I don't want to get into that. I don't want to start another reporting number for myself. But the sales of the van were up strong double-digits. Yes, okay. And that that followed month-by-month. So we're not seeing any sale off necessarily. We like the momentum. Okay I will you that, I tell you. One of the things, I talked about the sales of that information and diagnostic store repair shop owners or managers and independent shops, and one of the cornerstones of that lately is in Mitchell 1 is the ADAS software, which allows people to deal with difficulties of programming and understanding what's wrong with when you have a bridge in the advanced driver systems and as cars go to more autonomous this is even going to bigger. And so that Mitchell 1 has been one of the solid ones. If you go back and look at it, that segment has that portion has been pretty solid throughout the COVID. And that's one of the things driving it is the demand for these products. If automakers were going to go to highly automated cars, I kiss them tomorrow, because our business gets even better because precision is needed. And that's evidence of it. Right, good. Thank you. I didn't actually say double-digit just to be clear. I don't think we could read. Sometimes I say things I don't remember. But certainly I don't think I said at that time. Look what here is the thing, you like to ask that question. Of course, that originations are divorced in time from what we sell to the VANS. And so what we're talking about is selling to the VANS. And so you have that divorce. But like I said, our hand tools are stronger in this quarter than others because people haven't been investing in big ticket items as much. But the big ticket items are still up diagnostics was strong. And diagnostic is kind of a mix, it doesn't all go to EC, they increasingly because as the franchisees get more well heeled, they often use them on revolving accounts, sort of put them on their 15 week deal or they may stretch it a little bit. They don't go to EC. So we get a mix of those things. So if you're trying to figure out where origination is going to go, you have time displacement. And you have the split of EC between RA I mean, but diagnostics between RA and EC, and then you have tool storage on top of that. So it would be fair to say though, that, as I said before the overall big ticket items wasn't as robust as the overall tool sales. I did. Yes, I did. Yes, I did. No, I don't think so. We don't think that look, here's the thing. I think I'm saying this, I think if it lines up perfectly, the sales off the truck and to the truck kind of line up, all right. In fact, maybe for the full year, the sales off the truck are higher. So there's an inventory shrink, I guess, in macro. And secondly, what I'm saying is sales to the truck are more weighted to smaller ticket items, because people invest in the shorter paybacks in these times. But that doesn't mean that the big ticket Mullingar diagnostics was strong. We like diagnostics, but I'm not giving a total number. Yes, it's kind of immaterial, really, because, the extra week is between New Year's and Christmas. And you got holidays and you got people relaxing and those periods so it doesn't really make much difference. It might be I think, actually, we in OpCo anyway, we lose money in that week. So at the expenses, and we don't have much sales. No less. This happens, whatever, this happens every year the same way. We don't have that week, but that week is the same every year. I don't know. Look, I think one of the reasons is, of course, the Tools Group is much more heavily direct. And so because we're selling direct through our franchise, we're selling with our franchisees, we're out there travel and services, I mean, the normal years, and so we're out, we're kind of forward placed in tools more than others, so we like to be in the other places. So you would expect that to be a more target rich situation, especially in a situation with travels restricted in. And as far as going backward, I don't know, I think if your any operating business, you're feathered back these operations, you want to go out reach people when the sky is clear. Your guess is as good as mine. When the sky is clear, and you're going to work, they're going to be feathered in. I don't know if it will I doubt if it will all come back. But some of it will come back. I can't give you any guidance on it, though, really? Because we -- we're going to play it period-by-period. Okay, thanks. Yes, look miles driven. Everybody makes a big deal about miles driven. But we never see motion, miles driven short-term. I don't think it plays out what we've learned is, since we've had over the last few years put a bigger in collision, it plays out in the collision business. So you're very right. I mean, collision is down significantly as an industry year-over-year. And we see that and you're seeing it that in our equipment, numbers that isn't in the Tools Group numbers so much. You might see some garages, the odd, the garages we visit, but isn't a big factor in that situation. Miles driven, I think it's not so much the short-term, but we think longer term, it's going to start going up and that going to be more cars, because people are going to go to individual vehicles, who wants to get on a subway, how many people want to live in a 47 -- work in a 40 storey building in the future? Maybe you guys I don't know. But I think there's going to be a motion a reversal of that we saw that in China. So we see car ownership and miles driven in a long way of getting better. And that drives our business what that means for us in 2021, unclear, but we think its opportunity. Now we think it's opportunity in the longer term, we're going to play out quarter-by-quarter, what I will tell you is we feel good about the momentum we've had going through the year, closing out the year. We feel good about that. We feel good about how our products are being received. We feel good about the efficacy of our software in the complex business. We feel good about the idea that our VAN drivers have more time so that's what I would say. Actually income is up. But wages, I'll say that, I'll say the wages are up trailing 12 months and year-over-year in November, we will be less logistic. So, you view that from which you will but it's up a couple 3%. So the wages are up nicely, so the technicians aren't suffering and they think, I've talked to several franchisees yesterday, and they all think positive about their customer base. So that's pretty good. And we had our kickoffs and I zoomed in to the watch parties in Pennsylvania, in Florida and Iowa and in New York, and they were all positive about their customers. So I think the technicians are being affected. In fact, maybe they're doing better. Here is what I'll tell you, is that we're involved in that. We think that's an opportunity for us. And of course, we're working on that and for in listing people in career and technical education. And what we do is we establish Snap-On education sector is down, but we think it's been a boon for us, because we've been investing in education, and our number of certified centers, the education centers that offer Snap-On certification programs increased 33% in 2020 from 133 to 177. So we think we're in good shape in that situation. So I think technicians are going to come I think people are working on it. I'm particularly kind of optimistic about the President because his wife, Dr. Joe Biden is in technical education. So I think it'll get a good focus. Thank you. Good morning. I don't know, maybe you'll never know, I don't think we're seeing that. I haven't heard that anyway. What does happen though, is as our franchisees get more flush they tend to reach up. Franchisees are healthier. And they tend to reach up into the lower end of the what we would call bigger ticket items, particularly in a diagnostic segment. So the big hitter, one of our baby boomers is the Apollo D9 and it's kind of for the everyman technician in the middle of the range. And that's the thing that really did well in the quarter. And that one can be financed by a technician, by a franchisee. So maybe we're seeing some of that, and that one we introduced, I think at the SFC, it gets rolling out we gave demonstration units. It's outselling its predecessor by about 25% in terms of activations and so it's looking pretty good. So maybe that heading this, but I just want to caution that it's hard to reconcile in the end period, originations with what sales we have to the van that's another factor. There are a bunch of factors that are dislocating in that way. Over time, it should be directionally. Well, I think, look, I think vehicle I think our markets are overall strong, they're critical repair in particular being they're critical. They're critical. And they're essential and particular vehicle repair that underpins our critical mobility in the nation. But, and I don't really like to talk about market share, but what I'll tell you is, my franchisees are telling us that I said in my speech, that we are benefiting from being there through thick and thin. We were there every day in almost every day in the pandemic, anytime anybody would meet us, our guys were out there safely. And that has accrued to us. So for that turns into market share, I guess you can interpret it how you will. Well, look our international business is not fully equal to the U.S. business in aviation critical industries, but it's a reasonable comparison. This isn't like $300,000 and we doubled it to 600. That's not it. So generally that business I think, broad aviation is enough to bring aviation in total sort of up. So I mean, it's a good business. All I can say is go figure. Where we're getting. I guess it's a credit to the quality of our tools, the importance. Now remember, one of the things we've done in industrial that has got us, I think, got great popularity is we're leaning more and more on this customized kits. I talked about it, that's in Europe, and we were banging those customers. It was gangbusters on a customized kits for the last several quarters and we are expanding capacity in that. In fact, that's one of the investments next year we're looking at to expand our capacity and customize kits and international aviation is part of it."

            "content": "Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. The fourth quarter of 2020 was strong with respect to Snap-On's financial performance. Sales development was robust both year-over-year and sequentially. Gross profit and operating earnings margins expanded, and cash flow generation was again healthy net sales of $1,074.4 million in the quarter compared to $955.2 million last year, reflecting a 10.6% organic sales gain $9.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation and $7.5 billion of acquisition related sales. The organic increase principally reflected double-digit growth across the Snap-On tool segment, and high single-digit gains with repair shop owners and managers in the repair systems and information segment. We've began identified direct costs associated with COVID-19, which totaled $2.8 million this quarter. These costs include direct labor and under absorption associated with temporary factory closures, wages for quarantines associates event cancellation fees, as well as other costs to accommodate the current enhanced health and safety environment. Also in the quarter, we recorded $1 million of restructuring cost actions for Europe. Consolidated gross margin of 48% compared to 47.2% last year, the 80 basis point improvement primarily reflects the higher sales volume and benefits and the company's RCI initiatives partially offset by 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects and 10 basis points of direct costs associated with COVID-19. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 27.9% improved 140 basis points from 29.3% last year, primarily reflecting the impact of the higher sales, which more than offset the 30 basis points related to restructuring and direct costs associated with COVID-19. Operating earnings before financial services of $216.2 million, including $2.8 million of direct costs associated with COVID-19, $1 million of restructuring costs and $1.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $171.4 million in 2019, reflecting a 26.1% year-over-year improvement. As a percentage of net sales operating margin before financial services of 20.1%, including 30 basis points of direct cost associated to the COVID-19 pandemic, and 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects improve 220 basis points from 17.9% last year. As you may know, Snap-On operates on a fiscal calendar, which results in an additional week to our fiscal full year and fourth quarter every six years. As a result, our 2020 fiscal year contains 53 weeks of operating results with the extra week relative to the prior year occurring in the fourth quarter. While the impact of this additional week was not material to Snap-On's consolidated fourth quarter total revenues or net earnings, our financial services segment did earn an additional week of interest income on its financing portfolio. At the consolidated level, the net earnings benefit from the additional week of financial services interest income was largely offset by a corresponding additional week of fixed expenses, primarily personnel related costs and interest expense. With that said, financial services revenue of $93.4 million in the quarter of 2020 compared to $83.9 million last year, primarily reflecting the extra week of interest income and the growth in the financial services portfolio. Financial services operating earnings of $68.5 million increase $6.3 million for 2019 levels, principally due to the higher revenue but partially offset by increased variable compensation and other costs. Consolidated operating earnings of $284.7 million including $2.8 million of direct COVID related costs $1 million of restructuring costs and $1.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $233.6 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 24.4% compared to 22.5% in 2019. Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 21.8% compared to 22.3% last year. Finally, net earnings of $208.9 million or $3.82 per diluted share, including a $0.02 charge for restructuring increased $38.3 million or $0.74 per share from 2019 levels representing a 24% increase in diluted earnings per share. Now let's turn to our segment results, starting with the C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $364.4 million increased 3.3% from $352.9 million last year reflecting $7.5 million of acquisition related sales and $6.5 million of favorable foreign currency translation partially offset by a seven-tenths of 1% organic sales declining. While organic sales were essentially flat as compared to last year, they did improve sequentially in a more meaningful manner than what we see in our typical seasonal patterns, with organic sales of 14.6% from the third quarter of 2020. As compared to last year, the organic sales declined primarily reflects a mid single-digit decrease in our Asia Pacific operations, and a low single-digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries, offset by double-digit gains in the segments European based hand tools business. Within Asia similar to last quarter, sales to customers in India and Southeast Asia continue to be impacted by the effects of the pandemic. Across critical industries, while year-over-year sales declined in natural resources including oil and gas, U.S. Aviation and Technical Education. Sales into these markets have improved from third quarter comparisons. This quarter's year-over-year gains were reflected across international aviation heavy duty and non-military government related activity. Sales to the U.S. military were lower as compared to the prior year as the fourth quarter of 2019 included sales for a major project that is winding down. Sales increases in our European based hand tool business were heaven across the region, particularly in France and the United Kingdom, as well as in our Scandinavian and export markets. Gross Margin of 37.8% improved 230 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to increased sales and higher gross margin businesses and declines in lower gross margin sales to the military, as well as from benefits of RCI initiatives. These increases were partially offset by 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects and 20 basis points of direct COVID-19 costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales 22.4% from 30 basis points as compared to last year. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $56.2 million, including $1.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and $1 million of direct COVID-19 costs compared to $45 million last year. The operating margin of 15.4% compared to 12.8% a year ago. Turning down to Slide 8, sales in the Snap-On Tools Group of $494.9 million increased 20.2% from $411.7 million in 2019 reflecting a 19.6% organic sales gain and $2.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase reflects double-digit gains in both our U.S. and international operations. This reflects a 9.5% organic sequential gain over a strong third quarter 2020 sales performance. Gross margin of 42.9% in the quarter improved 270 basis points, primarily due to the higher sales volumes and benefits from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 24% improved from 27% last year, primarily due to the impact of higher sales volumes and savings from cost containment actions, which more than offset $1 million or 30 basis points of COVID-19 related costs. Operating earnings for the Snap-On Tools Group of $93.6 million compared to $54.3 million last year. The operating margin of 18.9% compared to 13.2% a year ago, an increase of 570 basis points. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9, sales of $361.1 million compared to $335 million a year ago reflecting a 7% organic sales gain and $2.4 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase includes a double-digit gain sales to OEM dealerships, particularly in sales related to OEM facilitation programs and a high single-digit increase in the sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. These increases were partially offset by a low single-digit decline in sales of undercar equipment. Sequentially RS&I organic sales improved by 13.2%. Gross Margin of 46.1%, including 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, declined 160 basis points from last year primarily due to the impact have higher sales and lower gross margin businesses including facilitation program related sales to OEM dealerships. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 21.2%, including 30 basis points of cost from restructuring improved 50 basis points from 21.7% last year, largely reflecting the mix of business activity in the quarter. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $90 million, compared to $87.2 million last year, the operating margins at 24.9%, including the effects of 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects and 10 basis points of direct costs associated with COVID-19 compared to 26% a year ago. Now turning to Slide 10, revenue from financial services of $93.4 million compared to $83.9 million last year. This includes the additional days of accrued interest associated with a 53rd week in our 2020 fiscal calendar. Financial services operating earnings of $68.5 million, compared to $62.2 million in 2019. Financial services expenses of $24.9 million increased $3.2 million from last year's levels, primarily due to higher variable compensation and other costs partially offset by a year-over-year decrease in provisions for credit losses. Compared to the fourth quarter last year, provisions for credit losses were lower by $700,000, while net charge-offs and bad debts were lower by $1.3 million. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1.1% and 1% in the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2019, respectively. In the fourth quarter, the average yield and finance receivables is 17.7% in 2020 compared to 17.5% in 2019. The respective average yield on contract receivables was 8.5% and 9.2%. The lower yield on contract receivables in 2020 includes the impact of lower interest business operations support loans for our franchisees. These loans were offered during the second quarter to help accommodate franchisee operations and dealing with the COVID-19 environment. As of the end of the quarter, approximately $13 million of these business operating support loans remain outstanding. Total loan originations of $272.4 million in the quarter increased $10 million or 3.8% from 2019 levels, reflecting a 4.5% increase in originations of finance receivables, while originations of contract receivables were essentially flat. Moving to Slide 11. Our year-end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our U.S. operation. In the fourth quarter, our worldwide gross financial services portfolio increased $20.8 million, the 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.8% for the United States, extended credit is unchanged from last year and reflects the seasonal increase we typically experienced in the fourth quarter. As relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12 months net losses of $45.6 million represented 2.62% of outstandings at quarter end, down 8 basis points sequentially and down 29 basis points as compared to the same period last year. Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $317.6 million in the quarter increased $120.9 million from comparable 2019 levels, primarily reflecting the higher net earnings and net changes in operating assets and liabilities including a $53.5 million decrease in working investment, primarily driven by inventory reductions in the period. Net cash used by investing activities of $73.6 million included $35.4 million for the acquisition of auto grid, capital expenditures of $26.5 million and net additions to finance receivables of $15.9 million. Free cash flow during the quarter of $275.2 million was 129% in relation to net earnings. Net cash used by financing activities of $111.6 million, including cash dividends of $66.8 million and the repurchase of 460,000 shares of common stock for $78.7 million under our existing share repurchase program. Full year 2020 share repurchases totaled 1.109 shares for $174.3 million. As of year-end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $275.7 million of common stock under existing authorizations. Turning to Slide 13, trade and other accounts receivable decreased $53.9 million from 2019 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 64 days compared to 67 days of 2019 year-end. Inventories decreased $13.9 million from 29 year-end including a $40.1 million inventory reduction, partially offset by increases from $23.2 million of currency translation and $3 million from acquisitions. On a trailing 12 month basis inventory turns of 2.4 compared to 2.6 in year-end 2019, and 2.4 at the end of the third quarter 2020. Year-end cash position of $923.4 million compared to $184.5 million a year in 2019. Our net debt to capital ratio of 12.1% compared to 22.1% at year-end 2019. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million in available credit facilities. As of year-end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2021. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. We currently anticipate the absence of any changes to U.S. Tax Legislation that our full year 2021 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 23% to 24%. I'll turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick. Thank you. Well, certainly we always do believe when there's invisible and -- visible inflation, I should say that we have the pricing power to deal with it. That said, yes, there's increases in the steel horizon, it takes a few months for them to come into the company, because obviously you buy in order some inventories in the past months, and you have them in line to arrive. So there's a trailing effect that's there. But historically, if you look back, Luke, we've had these types of gyrations in steel from time-to-time, and we deal with it, we do have pricing power, then again, I remind everyone Snap-On is very vertically integrated. So in a way, the good news factor is steel is not as much a percent of the final end product, as some people might imagine. So I think that actually does work to our benefit to some degree. Sure, thanks Bret."

With that said, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick.\nNick Pinchuk: Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. Today, I'll start with the highlights of our third quarter. I'll give you a perspective on how the virus environment is playing out and on the trends that we see today and going forward. And I'll speak on our physical and financial progress. And Aldo will provide a more detailed review of the financials. We see the third quarter as another encouraging period, the metrics clearly confirm Snap-on\u2019s resilience, showing the ability to continue its trajectory of positive results, moving from the initial shock of the virus and the associated interruption of activity to a combination, developing safe and effective ways to support the essential nature of our business and in some segments its starting to look toward psychological recovery where customers begin regaining competence in the future, and resume of full buying participation. The quarters results back that all up, demonstrating significant elements of advancements, sales and profitability improved sequentially across our operations despite the virus, the Snap-on team continued to make progress by increasing our ability to accommodate to the threat and pursue our essential commercial opportunity safely, moving along upward trajectories consistent with our general perspective on how the days of the virus are unfolding. Geographically, the impacts of the COVID continues to be varied across our operating landscapes. Asia Pacific remains virus challenged. Southeast Asia and India are still in deep turbulence. And at the same time, Europe showed some signs of recovery. For business segments, certain areas education, oil and gas, aviation experienced greater and more prolonged difficulties, you might expect that. In fact, the speed at which our customers are accommodating to the environment does vary by segment, but leading the way upward, our vehicle repair technicians, supporting the essential mobility of our society and our direct selling vans, our franchisees providing extraordinary face to face value, both are taking full advantage of the opportunities and the numbers show it. And as we go forward, we see considerable additional opportunities as society pivots towards suburban locations into more individual transportation. I'll tell you it's music to the ears of the vehicle repair operation. We believe we do have abundant opportunities on the road ahead. And because of that, we're keeping our focus on Snap-On value creation, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, and Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI. And in this area, that emphasis -- is this era, that emphasis is particularly important in customer connection innovation. We're following that focus to create a continuing stream of great new products, positioning our operation to -- operations, to monetize the accommodation and the psychological recovery that outlines the path to the future. And then the third quarter Snap-On value creation, customer connection innovations, role growth in the face of the uncertainty and lead to significant additions to our long line of product and innovation awards.  Snap-On was prominently represented with three motor magazine top tool awards. And we were further honored with five professional tool and equipment news or peak 10 innovation awards, but most significant of all, we are also recognized with 18 P10 people's choice awards, where the technicians, the actual users make the selections, 18 is a big number. It ties our record. That was set just a few years ago. You see an essential driver, our growth with, or without the pandemic is innovative product that makes work easier. It's always been our strength and the awards hard won our testimony that exceptional Snap-On products just keep coming, matching the growing complexity of the tasks and maintaining our forward progress, even in turbulence. That's the overview. Now for the results. Third quarter as reported sales of 941.6 million, we're up 39.8 million or 4.4% from 2019, including a 34.6 million or a 3.8% organic increase 4.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation and 1 million of acquisition related sales. From an earnings perspective, OpCo OI for the quarter of 185.7 million, including 1.5 million in direct costs associated with the virus and a $4.5 million hit from unfavorable currency compared to 167.7 million last year. The OpCo operating margin was 19.7%, up 110 basis points. For financial services operating income of 65.6 million increase from 2019, 61 million all while the 60 day delinquencies improve year over year, over year and that results combined with OpCo for a consolidated operating margin of 24.5%, 130 basis point improvement. Overall EPS was $3.28 and that compared to $2.96 last year, an increase a 10.8% in a somewhat challenged environment. Those are the overall numbers. Now the groups, in CNI volume in the third quarter of 308.4 million, including 2.2 million of favorable foreign currency was down 8% as reported 8.6% organically. Reflecting the decreases in we're talking, decrease in sales to our customers, a critical industries. I named a few and in Asia Pacific. Now our European based hand tool business was essentially plaque to last year. A positive result, given the twin headwinds of COVID-19 and the economic turbulence that now inhabits that region. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income of $43.1 million decrease $5.2 million, including $1.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and eight-tenths of COVID related expenses. Now C&I sales were down 8.6%. OI was down, 10.8%, a reasonable ratio, highlighting that RCI and cost containment went a long way in offsetting the impact of lower volume at C&I. In addition, the group did show significant sequential progress. The decline in sales and OI both narrowed considerably compared to the second quarter, reaffirming the positive upward trend that started after April. Regarding critical industries, military and international aviation, again, continue to register growth, while activity in education, oil and gas and U.S. aviation were particularly impacted. You might expect that, given the state of those particular industries. But we do remain confident in and committed to extending in the critical industries. And we see growing opportunities moving forward. And the principal path to that possibility is customer connection and innovation, combining to create powerful new products. Our European hand tools business showed resilience in the quarter, yes. And it was aided by a good dose of innovation, products like our all-new line of Bahco ERGO and insulated cutting and holding pliers. We redefined the steel mill and refined our heat treat process, developing a new metallurgy that strikes the perfect balance between strength and reliability. With those special material advantages, the edges were redesigned and improved, progressive blades that cut both soft cables at the tip and hardwires close to the joint, tremendous versability -- versatility. The new players have longer jaws and are aligned with more precision, better access and more accurate work. The insulation meets the IEC 60900 international standard for working with live systems up to 1,500 volts DC, substantial protection, safety in the -- in vehicle repair or in industrial environment. Strength, reliability, flexibility, accessibility and safety, the ERGO plier is a powerful addition to the Bahco lineup of insulated tools, now numbering 250 strong, all focused on electrical work. The new pliers were launched just this quarter, and I'll tell you, the recession was quite enthusiastic. We also continue to introduce attractive new entries in our lineup of 14.4 volt, the compact cordless power tools. This quarter, two strong additions, effective in the repair shop around the production line. The new CGRS861 or the CGRR861 incline and right angle grinder, high torque, longer run time, extended motor life, all in a compact, lightweight and easy to maneuver body. The new units both feature a dual -- they both feature a dual collet system, accommodating both eighth-inch and quarter-inch bits, allowing for a wide range of accessories and a feature that when combined with our built in spindle lock, makes for very quick changeover. That's a popular time saver. The new tools also include variable speed control, a key to handling a wide variety of servicing jobs. We launched in August. The technicians clearly have noticed and the grinders are already two of our million-dollar hit products. C&I demonstrating encouraging sequential progress, serving the essential. Each of the business is generating ongoing improvement and exiting the quarter stronger than when they entered and product investment authored a big piece of that progress. Now on to the Tools Group. As reported, sales up 16.8% to $449.8 million, including $1.8 million of favorable foreign currency and at $62.8 million or a 16% -- 16.2% organic increase, same-store sales, with the U.S. and international businesses all growing at double digits. The operating earnings, $87.1 million, including $400,000 of virus related cost and $2.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency that compared to $53 million last year. The Tools Group operating success was a clear confirmation on our view of the COVID-19 trajectory on the resilience of the vehicle repair business and on the strength of our direct face-to-face band model. As we entered the quarter, we saw our franchisees seeking increasingly effective ways to accommodate pandemic. For doing this, pursuing the support of the essential and we've helped in that effort with time saving aids, including further automation in the customer collection process, remote diagnostic software renewals and multi-franchisee data bundling. New technology aids aimed at making it easier to operate in the virus environment and saving scarce franchisee time under any conditions. Also, as I'm sure many of you are aware, the third quarter is when we hold our annual Snap-On Franchisee Conference, the SFC. No surprise. This year was different than any held before. The in-person gathering was canceled, and our 100th anniversary celebration plan for that meeting was postponed to 2021. Instead of the usual event, we came together over the weekend ordinarily reserved for the SFC yet a virtual conference, live from the Forge. More than 3,800 van drivers participated at a distance, representing nearly 98% of the North American network, flowing what was I think a rousing Friday night kickoff. We have presentations on significant offerings training on unique product advantages and seminars on effective selling techniques, after that Friday show, 180 individual videos featuring products and programs and training were posted on demand. And through the course of the weekend, franchisees wrapped up over 43,000 views of the content. The live from the Forge action was concluded on Sunday afternoon, and I'll tell you, it was a clear success. Continuing the SFC tradition, highlighting new product, strengthening our franchise capabilities with great training and reinforcing our brand with a positive message and a lot of fun. It was abundantly evident at live from the Forge that new product is a big driver for franchisee excitement. We do have considerable confidence in the power of our product line, and there are real reasons for that belief. You heard about the product awards. Well, beyond that, as our franchisees saw, there's a continuing stream of other great new offerings, candidates for next year's recognition, attention getters that make repair work easier and really help the technicians meet the challenges of increasing vehicle complexity at the model years roll by. Just one example. Unveiled at the conference was our New Steel Titan Roll Cab with a new color combination, eye catching, dark titanium paint brushed in blue trim, special details in bright blue, the Snap-On nameplate, the S-ranch logo located on the cap face, and a special S-ranch imprint on each interior liner. The Titan is visually striking, I can tell you, but it's also work enabling, three extra wide drawers for easy access to most commonly used tools, the speed door, improved organization for a variety of small items like drill bit and a power drawer for power tool charging using an exclusive power Snap-On, exclusive power strip design with five offset AC outlets and 2 USB ports. Vehicle repair is moving towards psychological recovery, gaining confidence, starting to invest in longer payback items, and a steel tighten is just the ticket. It's a product excitement even in the pandemic, and it was since then, the customers love it. Also introduced in this quarter was the new 8 piece, power steering and alternator polymaster set a handle, helping technicians to more easily remove and install presson pullies and most GM, Ford and Chrysler engines. The unique reversible dual design that this handle has includes multiple adapters, allowing for quick model changeovers and increased productivity, pretty important in the garage. The master set is a necessity for smooth installation and removal of power steering pump, alternator and vacuum pump pullies in a large range of vehicles. It's manufacturing in our Elkmont, Alabama plant, right here in the U.S.A. I was just there last week, and I could tell you, it's a great team. It's no wonder the initial response that master set was very positive. It made our list of hit million dollar products in just the first month. Well, that's the Tools Group, accommodating the pandemic, taking advantage of the psychological recovery, furthering innovation and strengthening for the future. Now let's speak of RS&I. The RS&I group also posted significant sequential improvement from the second quarter, narrowing the shortfall to 1.6%. You may recall that in the second quarter, the sales were down 29.8%. That's a big move. Volume in this period was \u2013 volume in this period and in the third quarter was 317.5 million, including 800,000 of favorable foreign currency and $1 million from recent acquisitions. The slightly lower activity reflected continued growth in the sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shops and flat capital spending on undercar equipment, all balanced by improved but still decreased activity in vehicle OEM projects. RS&I operating earnings of $80.1 million, decreased $3.2 million, reflecting the lower volume. OI margin was 25.2%, down 60 basis points, including a 10-point hit from currency. So while the overall group was somewhat impacted, diagnostics and information-based operations continue to grow. And once again, new products led the way. Among the new offerings launched in the quarter was our latest intelligence diagnostic unit, the Apollo D9, ergonomically designed, the new handheld -- it's a new handheld and it features ultrafast, 2-second start-up time, a larger 9-inch touch screen and a number of preloaded training videos installed directly on the tool for instant use. The platform is powered by our intelligent diagnostics software, over 1 billion repair records and over 100 billion unique diagnostic events, all organized to help technicians fix cars much faster. Now we've been talking about shortening the selling cycle for our complex diagnostics and increasing the sales capacity of our franchisees. Well, live from the Forge features a detailed seminar on operating and selling the new Apollo and to make that distance trading extra powerful. Each franchisee was provided with a new demo unit to follow right along light, hand on with the program. And in addition to the special training, unit could also be used immediately the next week to demonstrate the new Apollo's compelling advantages right in the field seems to be working. Although it was introduced at the end of the quarter, our on the street feedback says our new handheld will go a long way to advance our strategic trust into intelligent diagnostics. We're confident in the strength of RS&I. And we keep driving to expand its position with repair shop owners and managers, making work easier with great new products even in the days of the virus. Well, that our third quarter, absorbing a shock following the accommodation, moving on to psychological recovery, keeping our people safe while we serve the essential, continuing to improve sequentially on a positive trend, a successful SFC at a distance, confirming the power of our direct selling van model, results above last year. Sales up 4.4%, OI margin, 19.7%, 110 basis points higher. Financial services navigating the virus era with strike and an EPS of $3.28. All achieved while maintaining and investing in our strengths of products, brands and people. It was an encouraging quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?\nAldo Pagliari: Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on slide 6. Net sales of $941.6 million in the quarter compared to $901.8 million last year, reflecting a 3.8% organic sales gain, $4.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation and $1 million of acquisition related sales. The organic increase reflected sequential improvements in year-over-year performance in all three operating segments, led by the Tools Group segment with a double-digit sales gain in the third quarter as compared to last year. While sales in the Commercial & Industrial and Repair Systems & Information segments were lower than the third quarter of 2019, they did increase significantly from 2020 second quarter levels. During the quarter, the COVID-19 pandemic remained the headwind in certain geographies and within certain industries. But overall, the momentum experienced in the month of June continued into the full third quarter for all of our businesses. Similar to last year, we identified last quarter, we identified $1.5 million of direct costs associated with COVID-19. These costs include direct labor, under absorption associated with temporary factory closures, wages for quarantine associates and event cancellation fees as well as other costs to accommodate the current enhanced health and safety environment. Consolidated gross margin of 49.9% compared to 49.7% last year. The 20 basis point improvement primarily reflects the higher sales volumes and benefits from RCI initiatives, partially offset by 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. The operating expense margin of 30.2%, improved 90 basis points from 31.1% last year, largely reflecting the impact of higher sales and savings from cost containment actions and accommodating the impact that COVID-19 has had on the overall business environment. Operating earnings report financial services of $185.7 million, including $1.5 million of direct costs associated with COVID-19 and $4.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $167.7 million in 2019, reflecting a 10.7% year-over-year improvement. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 19.7%, including 20 basis points of direct costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic and 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, improved 110 basis points from 18.6% last year. Financial Services revenue of $85.8 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared to $84.1 million last year. While operating earnings of $65.6 million compared to $61 million in 2019, principally reflecting growth in the Financial Services portfolio as well as lower provisions for credit losses. Consolidated operating earnings of $251.3 million, including $1.5 million of direct COVID-related costs and $4.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $228.7 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 24.5% compared to 23.2% in 2019. Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 23.4% compared to 23.5% last year. Finally, net earnings of $179.7 million or $3.28 per diluted share, increased $15.1 million or $0.32 per share from 2019 levels, representing a 10.8% increase in diluted earnings per share. Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $308.4 million compared to $335.3 million last year, reflecting an 8.6% organic sales decline and $2.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic decrease primarily reflects a low-teen decline in both sales to customers in critical industries and in our Asia Pacific operations. While sales of the segment's European-based hand tools business were essentially flat. Across the critical industries, gains in international aviation and sales to the U.S. military were more than offset by declines in natural resources, including oil and gas, as well as continued lower technical education sales. Within Asia, sales to customers in India and Southeast Asia continue to lag behind some recovery experienced in other areas of the region. Gross margin of 37.3%, declined 60 basis points year-over-year, mostly due to the impact of lower volume and 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. These decreases were partially offset by material cost savings and benefits from the company's RCI initiatives. The operating expense margin of 23.3% improved 20 basis points as compared to last year. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $23.1 million, including $1.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $48.3 million last year. The operating margin of 14% compared to 14.4% a year-ago. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $449.8 million compared to $385.2 million in 2019, reflecting a 16.2% organic sales gain, and a $1.8 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase reflects a mid-teen gain in our U.S. franchise operations and approximately a 20% increase in the segment's international operations. Gross margin of 45.5% in the quarter improved 210 basis points, primarily due to the higher sales volumes and benefits from RCI initiatives, partially offset by 70 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. The operating expense margin of 26.1% improved from 29.6% last year, primarily due to the impact of higher sales volumes and savings from cost containment actions, including lower travel and meeting related expenses. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $87.1 million, including $2.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $53 million last year. The operating margin of 19.4%, compared to 13.8% a year ago. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on slide 9. Sales of $317.5 million compared to $322.7 million a year ago, reflecting a 2.2% organic sales decline, as well as $800,000 of favorable foreign currency translation and $1 million of acquisition related sales. The organic decrease includes a high single-digit decline in sales to OEM dealerships, partially offset by a low single digit increase in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and mangers. Gross margin of 47.3%, including 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, declined 40 basis points from last year. The operating expense margin of 22.1% increased 20 basis points from 21.9% last year. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $80.1 million compared to $83.3 million last year, the operating margin of 25.2%, compared to 25.8% a year ago, including the effects of 20 basis points of unfavorable currency and 10 basis points of direct costs associated with COVID-19. Now, turning to slide 10. Revenue from Financial Services of $85.8 million compared to $84.1 million last year. Financial Services operating earnings of $65.6 million compared to $61 million in 2019. Financial Services expenses of $20.2 million decreased $2.9 million from last year's levels, primarily due to lower provisions for credit losses, reflecting a year-over-year decline in net charge offs. As a percentage of the average portfolio, Financial Service expenses were nine-tenths of 1% and 1.1% in the third quarter of 2020 and 2019 respectively. In the third quarter, the average yield and finance receivables of 17.8% in 2020, compared to 17.7% in 2019. Respective average yield on contract receivables was 8.4% and 9.2%. The lower yield on contract receivables in 2020 includes the impact of lower interest business operation support loans for our franchisees. These loans were offered during the second quarter to help accommodate franchisee operations and dealing with the COVID-19 environment. As of the end of the third quarter, approximately $16 million of these business operating support loans remain outstanding. Total loan originations of $252.8 million in the third quarter of 2020, compared to $253.5 million last year. Originations of both finance receivables and contract receivables were essentially flat the last year's levels. Moving to slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our U.S. operation. Our worldwide gross financial services portfolio increased $25 million in the third quarter. Collections of finance receivables in the quarter of $185.2 million, compared to collections of $181.6 million during the third quarter of 2019. As we mentioned last quarter, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we did provide short term payment relief or forbearance, to some of our franchisees qualifying customers. As at the end of September, those accounts having forbearance terms, we're back to more typical levels and were below 1% of the finance receivable portfolio, as compared to about 2.5% as of the end of the second quarter. Trailing 12-month net losses on extending credit or finance receivables of $46.7 million represented 2.7% of outstandings at quarter end, down 23 basis points sequentially. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.5% for U.S. extended credit, compared to 1.7% last year. On a sequential basis, the rate is up 50 basis points, mostly reflecting the typical seasonal increase of 20 to 30 basis points we experienced between the second and third quarters, as well as the 20 or 30 basis point benefits to this rate reflected in the second quarter of 2020 that was associated with the deferred payment programs that were offered through June. Now, turning to slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $224 million in the quarter increased $92.9 million from comparable 2019 levels, primarily reflecting the higher net earnings and net changes in operating assets and liabilities, including a $57 million decrease in working capital, largely driven by lower year-over-year changes in inventories. Net cash used by investing activities of $18.8 million included net additions to finance receivables of $11.7 million and capital expenditures of $10.1 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $105.1 million included cash dividends of $58.8 million and the repurchase of 300,000 shares of common stock for $45.1 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of the end of September, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $294.5 million of common stock under existing authorizations. Turning to slide 13, trade and other accounts receivables decreased $75.7 million from 2019 year end; days sales outstanding of 64 days compared to 67 days of 2019 year end; inventories increased $4 million in 2019 year end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.4, although slightly improved as compared to 2.3 times at the end of the second quarter compared to 2.6 at year end 2019. Our quarter end cash position of $787.5 million compared to $184.5 million at year end 2019. Our net debt to capital ratio of 15.5% compared to 22.1% at year-end 2019. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million in available credit facilities. As of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?\nNick Pinchuk: Thanks Aldo. We are encouraged by the quarter. Our operations, all the groups, C&I, RS&I, and Tools improving sequentially, shocked to accommodations of psychological recovery, tracing a clear and continuing upward trend. A significant rise in the Tools Group up 16.2% organically same-store sales, confirming the opportunities in vehicle repair and showing the power of our manned network. Financial service is performing well in the turbulence, demonstrating clearly the robust nature of its processes and its portfolio, and the positive overall results. Sales up 4.4%, 3.8% organically, OI margin 19.7% strong, representing a rise of 110 basis points. EPS $3.28, up 10.8% from last year, significant gains against the turbulence. All achieved, while consciously continuing to fortify our strength and advantage in product, a range of new offerings, in brand, a successful SSC despite the distance, and in people. We're keeping our team intact. You see, we are confident in our belief that we have ongoing upward momentum in the near-term, and we recognize that we've expanded opportunity in changing technologies and with the greater use of personal vehicles in the long-term. And we're maintaining our advantages through the virus, so that Snap-On will be at full strength, taking advantage of these abundant opportunities, driving continuous progress through this period of challenge, and well beyond. Now, I\u2019ll speak directly to our franchisees and associates, I know many of you are listening, this was an encouraging quarter. And we do have a bright future. And I know none of it would be possible without your energy, your capability and your dedication. For your essential efforts in supporting our society, you have my admiration. For your extraordinary achievement and driving us forward, you have my congratulations. And for your continuing commitment to our team, you have my thanks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.\nChristopher Glynn: Good morning. Congratulations on a strong quarter.\nNick Pinchuk: Thanks, Chris.\nChristopher Glynn: Just curious at Tools Group, how to contextualize the growth, which really had no foreshadow or precedent the last few years, other than maybe why is there to look at 2Q to 3Q combined year-over-year growth, or in terms of\u2026\nNick Pinchuk: Look, I think the thing is I think we said when we went into the first quarter. In the first quarter, we said we got hammered in March, but things were looking pretty good before that. so I think we had made investments in products and processes that were helping us mind the franchisees capability more effectively, and we started to see that toward the end of the fourth quarter last year and the first quarter. And then, KT Bar [ph], the doer on the virus and so things go down. But we started to see people recover, that's why we say shock accommodation. They started to accommodate, and we said, June was coming back tracing an upward trend. So when you look at the third quarter, I think you think of it in, okay, there is some makeup I assume when things are going down so badly, particularly in April. There's some catch up there, but here's the thing that makes sense to us when you look at the sales off the van, the sales off the van have been strong for a long time. They were better in the second quarter than our sales. And in the third quarter, they were every bit as strong deep into -- clear weak, well into double digits every month. And then when you look back at it after the third quarter. The sales off the van are up year-over-year by a clear amount. And so they're play it by clear amount, so I think that's the data point. It seems to me we're going back to like that upward trend now what happens going forward, hard to say. I guess that's the $64,000 question. What I like what I see on this kind of situation, Tool Group seems to be hitting on all cylinders, wildcard could be Europe, and in the quarter one of the cool things about the quarter was the UK, it turned around quite well. I don't know if you caught the international operations up double digits, and that hadn't been a situation. And so there's a lot of ups and downs there and that could be an uncertainty going forward over those geographies and so on, but I'll tell you what, there's a lot of momentum and a lot of good reason \u2013 we see a lot of good reasons for this and the franchisees becoming more effective in the way we knew how to get over this because of the, you know, this wasn't our first rodeo associated with the downward trend. And we knew how to get our franchisees through it, and we got them through it and it paid off. So I think, I think you kind of look at it, okay, you know, 16.2% organically, it's a big number, but we really mined the profits. And -- and I think if you think about off the van, it shows that there's an appetite out there and vehicle repair is back. It's approaching, it's approaching psychologic, what we call in our context and our construct, psychological recovery and the vans are taking advantage of it.  What we like about this is, we've gone to something arithmetic. It shows the resiliency of vehicle repair in turbulence and the positivity and the strength of the face to face bad model. When we enable it with these technologies, we've been helping them.\nQ \u2013 Christopher Glynn: Thanks. And just to follow up, I was curious what degree you guys contemplate a Upshift in the payout ratio, given that organic reinvestment and bolt-ons and share purchaser, you know, very much covered in your kind of pay as you go rates there. I think, you know, some field is a strong case for 50% to 60% payout ratio, curious your thoughts around that?\nA \u2013 Nick Pinchuk: Well, Chris, you probably know that we have in recent history, usually revisit the dividend rate in the fourth quarter, that's coming up upon us. And like every meeting we have with the Board of Directors we'll have that discussion and we'll try to take a step forward in what we think is affordable. Realizing that Snap-On approaches that treat the dividend increase, kind of like a perpetuity. Again, that's been our historic pattern and I'll kind of leave it at that.\nAldo Pagliari: Yeah. I mean, our governing policy and dividends is perpetuity. We think it's a cornerstone and in a hallmark of the resilience and power of our model. So we believe in that strongly.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Luke Junk with Baird.\nQ \u2013 Luke Junk: Everyone. Thanks for taking the question. So two questions on the ToolsGroup first wondering if you could comment on growth rates from a product line standpoint, it seems like diagnostic sales are likely up moderately based on your RS&I commentary and two storage, I guess if we just look at originations feels really stable, should be read that handle sales were the big driver of the strength, or is there something else that should be taking into account?\nA \u2013 Nick Pinchuk: Sort of yes with qualifications to those questions, I guess, I don't know. Look here, first of all, looking at it. Look, I just say this as a disclaimer upfront. Looking at the, the quarterly byproduct numbers, doesn't really tell you that much because it's heavily dependent on what introduced, what are the products and programs that break on the mind on the -- on with the franchisees and then onto the technicians in the quarter that really heavily influences it. So one quarter, can't give you any real information on this, but it can, it's better than a pop an eye start sharp stick when you look at these things sometimes. So look, here's the thing, big ticket items. We're up in the quarter. Our sales for the franchisees were up in the quarter they were up, okay you know, a tool storage had a nice quarter actually. And I bought the, there is a timing difference between originations and sales, our sales to the vans. Remember what you're seeing from us is we sell to the vans and then they got probably first of all, okay, they got to probably first of all, okay, they got to get there, you know they get there and then the guys get them up and they find a buyer and then they get credit so on. So there can be \u2013 there can be some sort of disconnection between the timing. But generally, I'd say, that's right. If they were up in the hand tools we're very strong in the quarter, very strong. And they lead the way, but power tools were nicely up too. So I mean, there are a number of different products that were up. The hand tools of course, and a lot depends on what you feature and what the new products are, which is why I talked about the master set, because hand tools was a star in the quarter, but it wasn't to the exclusion say, like total storage and the others.\nLuke Junk: Okay. That\u2019s\u2026\nNick Pinchuk: The other think I think you would \u2013 one other things I think you would conclude out of this, I think is that when you see originations in effect, what do they got 0.3% or something like that, or you know, something maybe a little bit bigger in the U.S., and you see me say that tool storage is up to the franchisees and the big ticket is up for franchisees, you would say that, it's not the model of the product, it\u2019s that the fact that being flat, even flat we're up a little bit year-over-year means that they're going to psychological recovery. In other words, the garages and the franchise, then the technicians and the franchisees themselves are starting to believe in the future and have confidence to invest in longer payback items. This is kind of a watershed of van's in terms of the state of mind throughout the industry. One of the one of the setbacks and if you think about it, boy, you just step back and you look at the news about the auto industry in general, but also you kind of look around, you know, vehicle repair is pretty robust, actually in wages were up for technicians in August, according to \u2013 the rollings roll up and so I think that's a positive. And when I go out, when I went to the factory in Alabama, you know, in Elkmont, Alabama, I also went to franchisees, I just talked to several franchises across the country and they're all talking about robust garages. When I went to a garage recently out around here, you couldn't get in the parking lot, there were too many cars. So I think this is going pretty well.\nLuke Junk: Okay. And then second questions is just the clarification. Wondering what the statuses of the deferred payment sales plan programs that you told us about back in April? Was there any impact from those plans in the quarter from a sales standpoint in the Tools Group. And then from a credit standpoint, although you'd mentioned the sort of 20 to 30 basis point influence sequentially in the U.S. extending credit delinquency rates. Should we assume that that fully washes out in the third quarter effectively versus the noise if you want to call it in 2Q?\nNick Pinchuk: In Q3, there was no sales part of its derived from the deferred programs because there were no deferred programs. No, I say that our Elite franchisees, people that we strike in the Platinum program called Elite, always have the privilege of being able to offer a 60 day deferred programs as a normal course of business. So I won\u2019t call that just normal activity. So there is nothing unique in Q2, in Q3 that benefited the sales line. When it comes to impact on delinquency rates and collections and charge-offs, we factor all of that in based on our history which is considerable, because again, while we don't have in depth COVID-19 experience as is our first experience at that, we do have a lot of experience with catastrophic events which are usually more local. And we do provide in our provisioning for what would be the anticipated losses when you have people that take advantage of deferred programs versus non-deferred programs. So having said all that, I guess, I don't want to use the word \u2018it washes out\u2019 but it's already kind of reflected in our results. And going forward, whether we offer more differed programs will remains to be seen. We look at the opportunities and if they're created. We'll think about it, see if it creates a reason to buy now.\nNick Pinchuk: What's interesting from our perspective is, if it weren\u2019t for the COVID, everybody wouldn't be on the edge of their seat with this. I recognize that everybody wants to see if there's going to be problems with the credit company and collections and delinquencies and so on, because of the COVID. But in reality, the deferral is just an everyday thing for us. We do it from time to time. It happens on a regular -- not regular, not periodic basis, but it happens quite often. We just mix it up so we give, say, our customers a reason to buy now, and a franchisee a reason to change up a sales pitch to have something to talk about to these customers.\nLuke Junk: Good. Appreciate the color on both those questions and I'll leave it there. Thanks guys.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Bret Jordan with Jefferies.\nBret Jordan: Hey. Good morning, guys.\nNick Pinchuk: Good morning. How are you doing?\nBret Jordan: Good. Hey, when you think about the impact of, I guess -- the mix, it sounded like the hand tools were very strong. Do you think stimulus played a role? I mean, obviously, the garages are seeing business as people are putting their personal cars back on the road, have you used...\nNick Pinchuk: I think, I don't know. Look, I think, my gift is, first of all, our guys are employed mostly. You can look at the thing, things dipped. I think the number of hours went down 5% or something like that in April. And then it's snapped right back and generally what we see, what I'm hearing from my franchisees and I've talked to a lot of them, the garages are pretty much employed. So I don't think unemployment is a big deal. I mean, the unemployment deal or the PPI. You could have argued that that whatever people got in the beginning like $1,200 or something, that might have helped. I'm reading that people put that in a bank, I don't know. But I think it would have been over in the second quarter. We kind of thought that might have helped us in the second quarter. That was one of the questions for us, when we saw the tools group go up and hit the 3%, or I guess it was 2.4% in United States and that kind of thing. We thought maybe that might have been helping us. But I -- my sense of it is, it was probably either banked or spent before it. I don't think it was driving the third quarter. I don't think. And I don't think those \u2013 I don\u2019t think our guys are sitting on the edge of the seat, waiting for Congress to approve another one. Now if they do\u2026\nBret Jordan: So the mix of cash versus credit buyer, I mean, it sort of seems like you had a very strong tools number but not as much growth on the credit books. So was there a real shift here to cash purchase in the third quarter.\nNick Pinchuk: Well, there was a shift towards -- there was a shift toward the smaller -- not shift, but in the quarter we had nice hand tools and they tend to be RA, not long term credit. Remember, when you say credit, when you're talking about credit, everything sold off to buyers on credit.\nBret Jordan: Right.\nNick Pinchuk: Everything. Right? And so, okay, you're only talking about whether it's 12 to 15 week credit or -- three year or four year credit, really, so everything\u2019s sold on credit. So I don't think, if you say -- if you put that in a pot and say everything was sold, so I don't see people paying cash so much. I haven't heard people pay in cash. And our RA book is up some, because hand tools were strong. Anytime hand tools are strong, you see that happen, and the longer term credit tends to be a little bit less. But actually we thought longer term credit, given the environment was pretty robust in the quarter. Now, as I said, I think it's a sign of things getting better in the in the general view of the repair shop. Now, if somehow a miracle happens and the people in Washington get together and they decide to send everybody $1,200, I think that would be might be cherry on the top, I don't know. I don't think we got much in the third quarter though. I really don't.\nBret Jordan: Did you talk about the cadence of the third quarter? I mean, obviously the timing, you didn't have the franchise event, so maybe people were spending more money early or--\nNick Pinchuk: Yes, all right. I mean the cadence in the -- Bret, the cadence in the third quarter isn't as clear as the second quarter because we're coming off some -- April is god awful. So, I mean the thing is you're coming off of that and you kind of roll up but generally, if you look at -- I mean if you want to talk to Tools Group, if you look at the sales off the van which is not really subject to much SFC impact. It was -- each month was into the double-digit range clearly. So, I think the cadence was pretty solid off the van. You get up and down depending on where the SFC is, I think here. Sometimes like for example, when you have a live SFC, people tend to keep their powder dry because they want to get there and spend they it's almost like a Disney World. We were -- it's almost like a fun experience when they get there, and they run around and they buy all this stuff. And so this was a little more measured because it was added this and so not quite as exciting and so they spent a little earlier than they would have and I think up. So, that's a fair view. But if you look at the stuff off the van, it seems to be solid.\nBret Jordan: Thank you. Thank you.\nNick Pinchuk: Sure.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Curtis Nagle with Bank of America.\nCurtis Nagle: Good morning. Thanks very much.\nNick Pinchuk: Curt, how are you doing?\nCurtis Nagle: Great. Nick, Aldo, how are you guys doing?\nNick Pinchuk: We're doing okay.\nCurtis Nagle: Terrific, terrific. Glad to hear. So, maybe just first one on inventory. I think -- looks like there was a nice work down. Could you talk to you a little bit about which segments you saw I guess the largest declines or I guess the biggest movement year-over-year--?\nNick Pinchuk: I think we didn't see much of a downtick in the Tools Group inventory, but that you have to look at it through the lens of seasonality. Tools Group inventory always rises in the third quarter in anticipation of the sales and in anticipation of having to make good the order burst that comes out of an SFC. So, fundamentally inventory flat in the quarter meant that the Tools Groups seasonally look pretty good really compared to what we -- what you might expect if that had been a normal year. The other groups I think came down. I think our overall inventory was down a reasonable amount, so that's -- I think it was -- as you might expect in this kind of era.\nAldo Pagliari: Yeah. The inventory in constant dollars, Curt, was down about $28 million, $29 million. As Nick mentioned, Tools Group relatively flat in terms of their inventory move and the other -- were shared kind of equally between the commercial and industry groups and I both had contributions to lower inventory which is expected because their sales were not as robust as last year.\nNick Pinchuk: But I wanted -- what I wanted to emphasize in a call though. Hey, one of the things that -- I tell you what both were sequentially improved. I mean C&I was down what 25%, 19.7% I think. It's about 20% in the quarter -- second quarter is 8.6%. That's a nice improvement and then the one that really came from behind was RS&I, we thought, I think -- I'll share with you, we thought RS&I, the garages themselves based on the atmosphere in the OEM would have been harder to come back, would take a longer to come back. But they moved from -- they were down like, I said in my script, 29.8% last quarter and they knock I think 2.2% organically and one down, 1.6% as reported, so pretty big move. So I think what you're seeing in those businesses, even though they aren't -- they don't have the starry numbers as the Tools Group has, because their industries are still going through accommodation and aren't even approaching psychological recovery, they\u2019re showing some pretty good movement.\nCurtis Nagle: Understood, great. And then maybe just a quick clarification in terms of, I guess a sequential trend in sale out on the vans, the Tools Group in 2Q to 3Q, did it improve or how did that trend I just didn't quite\u2026\nNick Pinchuk: Yeah, it improved. Sure it improved, it improved. But it was -- I would say this, it was -- in Q2, it was running ahead on the sales to demand I think. Sales that was kind of -- if you want to think of it this way Curtis, you can think of it this way and I would think that Q2 inventory was being pushed out a little bit. The inventories were going down because the sales off the van were a little bit more robust, not great. But they were more robust than -- and they started to spike up in June, which is why we started to talk about the Tools Group in June, we could see that, in fact, we said that on a call I think. And then in the third quarter, more or less equal, the van, the sales off van were about equal to the, you know, for government work were about equal to the sales off the van. That's how it happens. So I think just the sales to the van kind of caught up. Doesn't look like they're building inventory though in the third quarter, it just looks like they kind of stay stable.\nCurtis Nagle: Okay, very good. Thanks very much and good luck with the rest of the quarter.\nNick Pinchuk: Next.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.\nGary Prestopino: Hey, good morning everyone.\nNick Pinchuk: Good morning Gary. Most of my questions have been answered but just one in terms of -- you had a little bit of a tailwind from FX on the sales side, what kind of impact did that have on the adjusted EPS for the quarter, Aldo?\nAldo Pagliari: We actually had negative $0.06 of EPS driven by currency because while the sales line benefited, there was currency transaction losses, principally driven by sales of U.S. manufactured product in Canada and the United Kingdom, but also the commercial industrial group. It has to do with flows between euro based customers versus Swedish based sources of supply. That's what drove the transaction.\nNick Pinchuk: What happens Gary is that the transaction where it's translations tend to be current, transactions tends to look back because you set the cost of product when it gets shipped and it doesn't get sold sometimes later, and that's what drives that difference, so in effect transaction kind of trails to situation.\nGary Prestopino: Okay. So you\u2019d expect less negative impact certainly in work?\nNick Pinchuk: Right. You get bigger sales, good news and lower profit, bad news.\nGary Prestopino: Okay, great. And then just early on in the quarter here, particularly we're hearing a resurgence of this COVID and I think the UK has put in some more stringent lockdowns. Can you maybe talk about, what you're seeing early stage in Q4 with various regions of the world.\nNick Pinchuk: We don't really give guidance. But look, I can tell you my broad view is that boy, you know, if you look at the United States, I don't know. I think vehicle repair particularly won't get shocked again. You know, they're not -- in fact everywhere won't get shocked again. Whatever happens, I think our people will accommodate better than they did in the April and March area. So I think that's kind of a broader view. I think, look, I think the United States kind of continues to March, you know, nobody knows what's going to happen exactly. But I think our -- the accommodation continues in the United States in all our areas. Europe's got twin problems with economics and so on. So it's hard to see across all those geographies, what's going to happen there. Again though, I don't think they get shocked again.  So I think, you know, they manage it, but it could be slowed down or it could be accelerated. Asia Pacific, I think China of course is okay. Japan should be okay. I think, I don't know what the heck's happening in India and Southeast Asia, but they seem to be completely flat on their back in terms of their ability to deal with this situation. So, so we'll see how those -- that's how I see it playing out. And I think, you know, we see upward trend, like we said, last time. I think, I believe in the shock accommodation, psychological model, but the value of that slope upward will change depending on how conditions occur. I do think they'll report a fight against the really bad news and that's really, I'm not telling you anything we could have just as good a quarter or a better quarter next time. \nQ \u2013 Gary Prestopino: Okay. Thanks. Appreciate it.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Scott Stember with C.L. King.\nQ \u2013 Scott Stember: Good morning guys.\nNick Pinchuk: Scott, how you doing?\nQ \u2013 Scott Stember: Good. Most of my questions have been answered also, but just going back to the U.K. in the tools group, I know that obviously things have been tough there for the past year, year and a half and got worse in the second quarter, but that was a pretty eye-popping improvement that we saw in tools in the U.K.. Could you just talk, is it -- was there anything else going on there? Was there new products introduced, and just trying to get a sense of the sustainability of the recovery?\nNick Pinchuk: There's a couple of things. I look, I think we believe U.K. came a long way and in fact their acceleration upward had already begun in June. It just, it just wasn't the level of us, but you could, if you go back, they were deeper in April and if you looked at the slope of the curve upwards in June, you said wait, something's going on there. And I think part of it was, is that okay, you have people suffering through the shock and they were really shocked. And you had the economics on top of it. In my own personal opinion were three things. One is they started to accommodate. Two; the virus kind of got people's minds off of Brexit, they didn't pay attention, you know, so much. So it wasn't weighing on people in terms of economics or coming out of the -- at least getting a little better than the virus they started to figure out. And three, we made changes to our network to try to make it, try to get training the new product there is every bit as robust as here. It just follows a little bit later. So we're introducing some of the diagnostics that had already been introduced here and wasn't there and other new products. So there is consistency in the new product. It wasn't different than the U.S. but I mean, we kept pounding the new product in there. I think, I think those are the three factors. Now it was up, as you say was up quite nicely. We'll see how it plays out. I don't think it will get shocked again though. \nQ \u2013 Scott Stember: Got it. Thank you.\nNick Pinchuk: Sure.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our last question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.\nDavid MacGregor: Yeah, good morning, everyone. Nick, congratulation \u2013 yeah, congratulations on a good quarter. I guess the question is been asked earlier about some of the spending patterns and technicians that came off that 90 day deferrals, I just wonder if we could go back to that start off with here and just the guys that qualified for that program and benefited from that program as they came off that program what kind of spending patterns did you see from them or were they pretty much removed from the market and the strength that you've achieved this quarter is off the balance of the \u2013 of the base?\nAldo Pagliari: David I think people keep spending. We don't isolate on whether you have just an easy loan. Remember they have two-thirds of business activity are with the franchisee on a revolving account type basis. And they remain generally active. I'm sure you get all kinds of examples. Some people might not buy for a while, although people keep buying each and every week. You get all kinds of patterns, but the fact is there was a deferred program and I'll take really radically changes the flow of activity, because again, we've had programs like this more regarding Q2, certainly given the unusual nature of it, but a pretty consistent. The thing you have to always remember, people ask Nick earlier on the call about stimulus. Remember everybody who has a job and I think we said, most of our customer base still hasn\u2019t come has more discretionary money in their pocket simply because a lot of other venues to spend your money are not available whether it would be going to dinner, the movies or a sports game, so that people have more money beyond just stimulus checks coming into mail and technicians like the right tools that he's been demonstrated over the tunnel of time.\nDavid MacGregor: One would think, though, that if somebody's coming off a 90 day furlough because they were strapped for credit that they might not be very aggressive buyers.\nAldo Pagliari: Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute. That's an assumption that's untrue.\nDavid MacGregor: Is it?\nAldo Pagliari: They're not \u2013 they're not strapped for credit. Look here's the thing. We didn't \u2013 we didn't just give 90 day credit to the people who were strapped for credit. We offered 90 day credit as a reason to buy now. It's like a car loan. So the point is, I think the point is, is those people know who you are? You're going to buy a still tight, David? Okay, I can get a 90 day deferral or not? I might take it, right. You might take it. Its all the money that you have. You might take it.\nDavid MacGregor: All right. Thank you for that clarification. I appreciate that. I wanted to just explore as well the divergence between kind of the growth that you've achieved in C&I and RS&I versus what you're seeing in the Tools Group. And I appreciate directionally both C&I and RS&I are moving positively versus what you printed in the second quarter. But still high single-digit declines in C&I, high single-digit declines in OEM dealership business and RS&I. It seems a little in contrast to up mid-teens in the Tools Group. And so I guess, your thoughts on that divergence? And then secondly, do we see those other businesses catch up here in the fourth quarter? Should you have that much\u2026\nNick Pinchuk: I think this. I think we have the potential to catch up. I think \u2013 I'll tell you what, I think you can write this on a black letter law on your shorts about this. In general, in general what we see is when you have anything like this in terms of a macro, what we see is the smaller businesses, if they have \u2013 if they continue in the business, which vehicle repair has been continuing in the business, they don't think so \u2013 they're like making money, they're spending the kind of rolling. I do think the bigger the business, the more it tends to look at what's going to happen in the future? I'm not sure. They get a little bit more reticent there. They have a little bit more, I guess, forward outlook that troubles them in the day that weighs on their decision-making a day. I think this has happened through my entire time here, we've seen this as macroeconomic expectations go up and down. So, if you look at C&I, you see certain other segments particularly troubled, particularly troubled. Other segments like military and the international aviation up and you see a little bit of heavy truck a little bit better. And so you can see that. But eventually, we see them recovering. That's the difference. It's actually the industry, the environment and also the fact that the garages are smaller and therefore, closer to that cash action and the actual action, and therefore, more confident as they see it continuing. I think this is just psychological. And then if you go to RS&I, I think you're looking at a two-pronged effort. You have the independence, which tend to get a little better, but you also have the dealers who were pretty shook up at the beginning. They were rolling -- they were coming in to the virus as you probably know. With probably a negative view, hey, the SAAR is going to be down for next year, is it look good. Maybe we're going to -- so the thing is they sort of entered this with kind of a downward look, maybe even extra inventory. So, then they got through, then they start to come up. But I think those guys get a little bit more reticent and going forward in terms of investing. Remember, our C&I and RS&I tend to be more capital-based type actions, right? They're good business, but they're more capital, and you would see them being more, I guess, washes. I think they come out of it, though. I think we're loving the RS&I look this quarter, really.\nDavid MacGregor: So, let me just ask you as well because we're top of the hour here and we'd like to wrap this up, I'm sure. But it seems like software sales may have been a stronger contributor this quarter as well. You talked about the Apollo D9, but there were some other introductions as well.\nNick Pinchuk: Yes. They were -- look, software is about a third of RS&I, the Mitchell 1 Software business, which is repair shop information and running the repair shops in both cars and trucks...\nDavid MacGregor: Within the Tools Group.\nNick Pinchuk: You're talking about the Tools Group?\nDavid MacGregor: Yes.\nNick Pinchuk: I'm talking about RS&I. I thought -- you talk about Tools Group.\nDavid MacGregor: I'm talking about the Tools Group here.\nNick Pinchuk: Sorry, sorry. And the Tools Group, the software business was pretty good. But I wouldn't say I wouldn't it was an extraordinary contributor, an outsized contributor. It didn't stand out really in any way to us so much in this quarter. It was okay, but not -- you wouldn't have called it a variance driver.\nDavid MacGregor: Right. And then last question for me. If the franchisees are taking big ticket again, it sounds like your storage business good. It sounds like diagnostics was okay. We should see some pretty good originations numbers in the fourth quarter, shouldn't we? So what would be--?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, okay. Assuming itself, right--\nDavid MacGregor: Right.\nNick Pinchuk: Right, right.\nDavid MacGregor: You\u2019re kind of enjoying this, I guess, is. If--\nNick Pinchuk: It seems okay. Yes, that's a reasonable assumption.\nDavid MacGregor: Right. So if we see -- \nAldo Pagliari: Again David, they always have a choice to make it. If you remember that Snap-On does benefit by having what I would say is the industry's leading residual values. So, when they take trade-ins, particularly in diagnostics becomes a factor, that's where the penetration rate on diagnostics for one reason is lower. There's a good chance that the finance can be handled through the RA account. If you take in, as an example, of $2,000 trading unit on a $3,000 item, you don't have to necessarily finance those. So, that's why you get a little bit of a different blend. And I think in this low interest rate environment, some franchisees feel they have the wherewithal to stretch a bit or borrow locally if they don't borrow from Snap-On Credit. And I think they have some versatility given the low interest rate environment. So that's why you don't necessarily have the same predictability as to what falls on to the easy program. Again, remember, the franchisee decides that. Snap-On doesn't decide that.\nDavid MacGregor: No, no. But I would think at this point, franchisee would consider I got 100% risk on the RA versus 25% risk on EC and I probably better put\nNick Pinchuk: That's not necessarily true.\nAldo Pagliari: Yeah. But David, but take a step back, you can look over the long tunnel of time, our default rates and the franchisees see this. Remember, our franchisees are pretty long in there too. They have, on average, 14 years of experience. They see that the defaults while never guaranteed are pretty predictable to some extent, and through good and bad times kind of steady. So they don't rush to outboard at least, again, always on the fringes you get a little bit of everything. But they don't rush the panic and say, well, let's give us the Snap-On credit because they only have 25% exposure versus 100%. Of course, there's some that might consider that. But the great population does not.\nNick Pinchuk: Yeah. David, the franchisees have an internal calculus that says, I want to have a certain amount of short-term RA and a certain amount of longer term stuff. They try to maintain it in that way, so to the extent they have a, what I would call a border line event in a sale, that might push them one way or another. I believe that to be pretty true. And so the thing is, yes, it's 100%, but it's shorter term. They think the guy can pay it, they like it, they'll get it, they\u2019ll get him liquidated and onto something else.\nAldo Pagliari: Well, that people use a metric, David, RA flips, which we don't look at it that way, but some people say, oh, RA flips if they're up, that must be bad things are coming, RA flips are actually down from the storage levels. No, again, we don't meet a lot into that, but okay. It doesn't seem like the franchisees are trying to offload credit readiness in any dramatic.\nNick Pinchuk: As I mentioned, the franchise even seem flush. I mean they're kind of pretty low in terms of on hold. So I think as a network, I think the franchisees are probably in a better place than they've been in a long time.\nDavid MacGregor: Well, thanks for taking the questions. Congrats on the results and good luck this quarter.\nNick Pinchuk: All right. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Ms. Verbsky, at this time, I'll turn the conference back to you for any additional remarks.\nSara Verbsky: Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-On and good day.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Nick Pinchuk",
            "content": "Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. Today, I'll start with the highlights of our third quarter. I'll give you a perspective on how the virus environment is playing out and on the trends that we see today and going forward. And I'll speak on our physical and financial progress. And Aldo will provide a more detailed review of the financials. We see the third quarter as another encouraging period, the metrics clearly confirm Snap-on's resilience, showing the ability to continue its trajectory of positive results, moving from the initial shock of the virus and the associated interruption of activity to a combination, developing safe and effective ways to support the essential nature of our business and in some segments its starting to look toward psychological recovery where customers begin regaining competence in the future, and resume of full buying participation. The quarters results back that all up, demonstrating significant elements of advancements, sales and profitability improved sequentially across our operations despite the virus, the Snap-on team continued to make progress by increasing our ability to accommodate to the threat and pursue our essential commercial opportunity safely, moving along upward trajectories consistent with our general perspective on how the days of the virus are unfolding. Geographically, the impacts of the COVID continues to be varied across our operating landscapes. Asia Pacific remains virus challenged. Southeast Asia and India are still in deep turbulence. And at the same time, Europe showed some signs of recovery. For business segments, certain areas education, oil and gas, aviation experienced greater and more prolonged difficulties, you might expect that. In fact, the speed at which our customers are accommodating to the environment does vary by segment, but leading the way upward, our vehicle repair technicians, supporting the essential mobility of our society and our direct selling vans, our franchisees providing extraordinary face to face value, both are taking full advantage of the opportunities and the numbers show it. And as we go forward, we see considerable additional opportunities as society pivots towards suburban locations into more individual transportation. I'll tell you it's music to the ears of the vehicle repair operation. We believe we do have abundant opportunities on the road ahead. And because of that, we're keeping our focus on Snap-On value creation, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, and Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI. And in this area, that emphasis -- is this era, that emphasis is particularly important in customer connection innovation. We're following that focus to create a continuing stream of great new products, positioning our operation to -- operations, to monetize the accommodation and the psychological recovery that outlines the path to the future. And then the third quarter Snap-On value creation, customer connection innovations, role growth in the face of the uncertainty and lead to significant additions to our long line of product and innovation awards.  Snap-On was prominently represented with three motor magazine top tool awards. And we were further honored with five professional tool and equipment news or peak 10 innovation awards, but most significant of all, we are also recognized with 18 P10 people's choice awards, where the technicians, the actual users make the selections, 18 is a big number. It ties our record. That was set just a few years ago. You see an essential driver, our growth with, or without the pandemic is innovative product that makes work easier. It's always been our strength and the awards hard won our testimony that exceptional Snap-On products just keep coming, matching the growing complexity of the tasks and maintaining our forward progress, even in turbulence. That's the overview. Now for the results. Third quarter as reported sales of 941.6 million, we're up 39.8 million or 4.4% from 2019, including a 34.6 million or a 3.8% organic increase 4.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation and 1 million of acquisition related sales. From an earnings perspective, OpCo OI for the quarter of 185.7 million, including 1.5 million in direct costs associated with the virus and a $4.5 million hit from unfavorable currency compared to 167.7 million last year. The OpCo operating margin was 19.7%, up 110 basis points. For financial services operating income of 65.6 million increase from 2019, 61 million all while the 60 day delinquencies improve year over year, over year and that results combined with OpCo for a consolidated operating margin of 24.5%, 130 basis point improvement. Overall EPS was $3.28 and that compared to $2.96 last year, an increase a 10.8% in a somewhat challenged environment. Those are the overall numbers. Now the groups, in CNI volume in the third quarter of 308.4 million, including 2.2 million of favorable foreign currency was down 8% as reported 8.6% organically. Reflecting the decreases in we're talking, decrease in sales to our customers, a critical industries. I named a few and in Asia Pacific. Now our European based hand tool business was essentially plaque to last year. A positive result, given the twin headwinds of COVID-19 and the economic turbulence that now inhabits that region. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income of $43.1 million decrease $5.2 million, including $1.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and eight-tenths of COVID related expenses. Now C&I sales were down 8.6%. OI was down, 10.8%, a reasonable ratio, highlighting that RCI and cost containment went a long way in offsetting the impact of lower volume at C&I. In addition, the group did show significant sequential progress. The decline in sales and OI both narrowed considerably compared to the second quarter, reaffirming the positive upward trend that started after April. Regarding critical industries, military and international aviation, again, continue to register growth, while activity in education, oil and gas and U.S. aviation were particularly impacted. You might expect that, given the state of those particular industries. But we do remain confident in and committed to extending in the critical industries. And we see growing opportunities moving forward. And the principal path to that possibility is customer connection and innovation, combining to create powerful new products. Our European hand tools business showed resilience in the quarter, yes. And it was aided by a good dose of innovation, products like our all-new line of Bahco ERGO and insulated cutting and holding pliers. We redefined the steel mill and refined our heat treat process, developing a new metallurgy that strikes the perfect balance between strength and reliability. With those special material advantages, the edges were redesigned and improved, progressive blades that cut both soft cables at the tip and hardwires close to the joint, tremendous versability -- versatility. The new players have longer jaws and are aligned with more precision, better access and more accurate work. The insulation meets the IEC 60900 international standard for working with live systems up to 1,500 volts DC, substantial protection, safety in the -- in vehicle repair or in industrial environment. Strength, reliability, flexibility, accessibility and safety, the ERGO plier is a powerful addition to the Bahco lineup of insulated tools, now numbering 250 strong, all focused on electrical work. The new pliers were launched just this quarter, and I'll tell you, the recession was quite enthusiastic. We also continue to introduce attractive new entries in our lineup of 14.4 volt, the compact cordless power tools. This quarter, two strong additions, effective in the repair shop around the production line. The new CGRS861 or the CGRR861 incline and right angle grinder, high torque, longer run time, extended motor life, all in a compact, lightweight and easy to maneuver body. The new units both feature a dual -- they both feature a dual collet system, accommodating both eighth-inch and quarter-inch bits, allowing for a wide range of accessories and a feature that when combined with our built in spindle lock, makes for very quick changeover. That's a popular time saver. The new tools also include variable speed control, a key to handling a wide variety of servicing jobs. We launched in August. The technicians clearly have noticed and the grinders are already two of our million-dollar hit products. C&I demonstrating encouraging sequential progress, serving the essential. Each of the business is generating ongoing improvement and exiting the quarter stronger than when they entered and product investment authored a big piece of that progress. Now on to the Tools Group. As reported, sales up 16.8% to $449.8 million, including $1.8 million of favorable foreign currency and at $62.8 million or a 16% -- 16.2% organic increase, same-store sales, with the U.S. and international businesses all growing at double digits. The operating earnings, $87.1 million, including $400,000 of virus related cost and $2.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency that compared to $53 million last year. The Tools Group operating success was a clear confirmation on our view of the COVID-19 trajectory on the resilience of the vehicle repair business and on the strength of our direct face-to-face band model. As we entered the quarter, we saw our franchisees seeking increasingly effective ways to accommodate pandemic. For doing this, pursuing the support of the essential and we've helped in that effort with time saving aids, including further automation in the customer collection process, remote diagnostic software renewals and multi-franchisee data bundling. New technology aids aimed at making it easier to operate in the virus environment and saving scarce franchisee time under any conditions. Also, as I'm sure many of you are aware, the third quarter is when we hold our annual Snap-On Franchisee Conference, the SFC. No surprise. This year was different than any held before. The in-person gathering was canceled, and our 100th anniversary celebration plan for that meeting was postponed to 2021. Instead of the usual event, we came together over the weekend ordinarily reserved for the SFC yet a virtual conference, live from the Forge. More than 3,800 van drivers participated at a distance, representing nearly 98% of the North American network, flowing what was I think a rousing Friday night kickoff. We have presentations on significant offerings training on unique product advantages and seminars on effective selling techniques, after that Friday show, 180 individual videos featuring products and programs and training were posted on demand. And through the course of the weekend, franchisees wrapped up over 43,000 views of the content. The live from the Forge action was concluded on Sunday afternoon, and I'll tell you, it was a clear success. Continuing the SFC tradition, highlighting new product, strengthening our franchise capabilities with great training and reinforcing our brand with a positive message and a lot of fun. It was abundantly evident at live from the Forge that new product is a big driver for franchisee excitement. We do have considerable confidence in the power of our product line, and there are real reasons for that belief. You heard about the product awards. Well, beyond that, as our franchisees saw, there's a continuing stream of other great new offerings, candidates for next year's recognition, attention getters that make repair work easier and really help the technicians meet the challenges of increasing vehicle complexity at the model years roll by. Just one example. Unveiled at the conference was our New Steel Titan Roll Cab with a new color combination, eye catching, dark titanium paint brushed in blue trim, special details in bright blue, the Snap-On nameplate, the S-ranch logo located on the cap face, and a special S-ranch imprint on each interior liner. The Titan is visually striking, I can tell you, but it's also work enabling, three extra wide drawers for easy access to most commonly used tools, the speed door, improved organization for a variety of small items like drill bit and a power drawer for power tool charging using an exclusive power Snap-On, exclusive power strip design with five offset AC outlets and 2 USB ports. Vehicle repair is moving towards psychological recovery, gaining confidence, starting to invest in longer payback items, and a steel tighten is just the ticket. It's a product excitement even in the pandemic, and it was since then, the customers love it. Also introduced in this quarter was the new 8 piece, power steering and alternator polymaster set a handle, helping technicians to more easily remove and install presson pullies and most GM, Ford and Chrysler engines. The unique reversible dual design that this handle has includes multiple adapters, allowing for quick model changeovers and increased productivity, pretty important in the garage. The master set is a necessity for smooth installation and removal of power steering pump, alternator and vacuum pump pullies in a large range of vehicles. It's manufacturing in our Elkmont, Alabama plant, right here in the U.S.A. I was just there last week, and I could tell you, it's a great team. It's no wonder the initial response that master set was very positive. It made our list of hit million dollar products in just the first month. Well, that's the Tools Group, accommodating the pandemic, taking advantage of the psychological recovery, furthering innovation and strengthening for the future. Now let's speak of RS&I. The RS&I group also posted significant sequential improvement from the second quarter, narrowing the shortfall to 1.6%. You may recall that in the second quarter, the sales were down 29.8%. That's a big move. Volume in this period was \u2013 volume in this period and in the third quarter was 317.5 million, including 800,000 of favorable foreign currency and $1 million from recent acquisitions. The slightly lower activity reflected continued growth in the sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shops and flat capital spending on undercar equipment, all balanced by improved but still decreased activity in vehicle OEM projects. RS&I operating earnings of $80.1 million, decreased $3.2 million, reflecting the lower volume. OI margin was 25.2%, down 60 basis points, including a 10-point hit from currency. So while the overall group was somewhat impacted, diagnostics and information-based operations continue to grow. And once again, new products led the way. Among the new offerings launched in the quarter was our latest intelligence diagnostic unit, the Apollo D9, ergonomically designed, the new handheld -- it's a new handheld and it features ultrafast, 2-second start-up time, a larger 9-inch touch screen and a number of preloaded training videos installed directly on the tool for instant use. The platform is powered by our intelligent diagnostics software, over 1 billion repair records and over 100 billion unique diagnostic events, all organized to help technicians fix cars much faster. Now we've been talking about shortening the selling cycle for our complex diagnostics and increasing the sales capacity of our franchisees. Well, live from the Forge features a detailed seminar on operating and selling the new Apollo and to make that distance trading extra powerful. Each franchisee was provided with a new demo unit to follow right along light, hand on with the program. And in addition to the special training, unit could also be used immediately the next week to demonstrate the new Apollo's compelling advantages right in the field seems to be working. Although it was introduced at the end of the quarter, our on the street feedback says our new handheld will go a long way to advance our strategic trust into intelligent diagnostics. We're confident in the strength of RS&I. And we keep driving to expand its position with repair shop owners and managers, making work easier with great new products even in the days of the virus. Well, that our third quarter, absorbing a shock following the accommodation, moving on to psychological recovery, keeping our people safe while we serve the essential, continuing to improve sequentially on a positive trend, a successful SFC at a distance, confirming the power of our direct selling van model, results above last year. Sales up 4.4%, OI margin, 19.7%, 110 basis points higher. Financial services navigating the virus era with strike and an EPS of $3.28. All achieved while maintaining and investing in our strengths of products, brands and people. It was an encouraging quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Thanks Aldo. We are encouraged by the quarter. Our operations, all the groups, C&I, RS&I, and Tools improving sequentially, shocked to accommodations of psychological recovery, tracing a clear and continuing upward trend. A significant rise in the Tools Group up 16.2% organically same-store sales, confirming the opportunities in vehicle repair and showing the power of our manned network. Financial service is performing well in the turbulence, demonstrating clearly the robust nature of its processes and its portfolio, and the positive overall results. Sales up 4.4%, 3.8% organically, OI margin 19.7% strong, representing a rise of 110 basis points. EPS $3.28, up 10.8% from last year, significant gains against the turbulence. All achieved, while consciously continuing to fortify our strength and advantage in product, a range of new offerings, in brand, a successful SSC despite the distance, and in people. We're keeping our team intact. You see, we are confident in our belief that we have ongoing upward momentum in the near-term, and we recognize that we've expanded opportunity in changing technologies and with the greater use of personal vehicles in the long-term. And we're maintaining our advantages through the virus, so that Snap-On will be at full strength, taking advantage of these abundant opportunities, driving continuous progress through this period of challenge, and well beyond. Now, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates, I know many of you are listening, this was an encouraging quarter. And we do have a bright future. And I know none of it would be possible without your energy, your capability and your dedication. For your essential efforts in supporting our society, you have my admiration. For your extraordinary achievement and driving us forward, you have my congratulations. And for your continuing commitment to our team, you have my thanks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Thanks, Chris. Look, I think the thing is I think we said when we went into the first quarter. In the first quarter, we said we got hammered in March, but things were looking pretty good before that. so I think we had made investments in products and processes that were helping us mind the franchisees capability more effectively, and we started to see that toward the end of the fourth quarter last year and the first quarter. And then, KT Bar [ph], the doer on the virus and so things go down. But we started to see people recover, that's why we say shock accommodation. They started to accommodate, and we said, June was coming back tracing an upward trend. So when you look at the third quarter, I think you think of it in, okay, there is some makeup I assume when things are going down so badly, particularly in April. There's some catch up there, but here's the thing that makes sense to us when you look at the sales off the van, the sales off the van have been strong for a long time. They were better in the second quarter than our sales. And in the third quarter, they were every bit as strong deep into -- clear weak, well into double digits every month. And then when you look back at it after the third quarter. The sales off the van are up year-over-year by a clear amount. And so they're play it by clear amount, so I think that's the data point. It seems to me we're going back to like that upward trend now what happens going forward, hard to say. I guess that's the $64,000 question. What I like what I see on this kind of situation, Tool Group seems to be hitting on all cylinders, wildcard could be Europe, and in the quarter one of the cool things about the quarter was the UK, it turned around quite well. I don't know if you caught the international operations up double digits, and that hadn't been a situation. And so there's a lot of ups and downs there and that could be an uncertainty going forward over those geographies and so on, but I'll tell you what, there's a lot of momentum and a lot of good reason \u2013 we see a lot of good reasons for this and the franchisees becoming more effective in the way we knew how to get over this because of the, you know, this wasn't our first rodeo associated with the downward trend. And we knew how to get our franchisees through it, and we got them through it and it paid off. So I think, I think you kind of look at it, okay, you know, 16.2% organically, it's a big number, but we really mined the profits. And -- and I think if you think about off the van, it shows that there's an appetite out there and vehicle repair is back. It's approaching, it's approaching psychologic, what we call in our context and our construct, psychological recovery and the vans are taking advantage of it.  What we like about this is, we've gone to something arithmetic. It shows the resiliency of vehicle repair in turbulence and the positivity and the strength of the face to face bad model. When we enable it with these technologies, we've been helping them.\nQ \u2013 Christopher Glynn: Thanks. And just to follow up, I was curious what degree you guys contemplate a Upshift in the payout ratio, given that organic reinvestment and bolt-ons and share purchaser, you know, very much covered in your kind of pay as you go rates there. I think, you know, some field is a strong case for 50% to 60% payout ratio, curious your thoughts around that?\nA \u2013 Nick Pinchuk: Well, Chris, you probably know that we have in recent history, usually revisit the dividend rate in the fourth quarter, that's coming up upon us. And like every meeting we have with the Board of Directors we'll have that discussion and we'll try to take a step forward in what we think is affordable. Realizing that Snap-On approaches that treat the dividend increase, kind of like a perpetuity. Again, that's been our historic pattern and I'll kind of leave it at that. The other think I think you would \u2013 one other things I think you would conclude out of this, I think is that when you see originations in effect, what do they got 0.3% or something like that, or you know, something maybe a little bit bigger in the U.S., and you see me say that tool storage is up to the franchisees and the big ticket is up for franchisees, you would say that, it's not the model of the product, it's that the fact that being flat, even flat we're up a little bit year-over-year means that they're going to psychological recovery. In other words, the garages and the franchise, then the technicians and the franchisees themselves are starting to believe in the future and have confidence to invest in longer payback items. This is kind of a watershed of van's in terms of the state of mind throughout the industry. One of the one of the setbacks and if you think about it, boy, you just step back and you look at the news about the auto industry in general, but also you kind of look around, you know, vehicle repair is pretty robust, actually in wages were up for technicians in August, according to \u2013 the rollings roll up and so I think that's a positive. And when I go out, when I went to the factory in Alabama, you know, in Elkmont, Alabama, I also went to franchisees, I just talked to several franchises across the country and they're all talking about robust garages. When I went to a garage recently out around here, you couldn't get in the parking lot, there were too many cars. So I think this is going pretty well. In Q3, there was no sales part of its derived from the deferred programs because there were no deferred programs. No, I say that our Elite franchisees, people that we strike in the Platinum program called Elite, always have the privilege of being able to offer a 60 day deferred programs as a normal course of business. So I won't call that just normal activity. So there is nothing unique in Q2, in Q3 that benefited the sales line. When it comes to impact on delinquency rates and collections and charge-offs, we factor all of that in based on our history which is considerable, because again, while we don't have in depth COVID-19 experience as is our first experience at that, we do have a lot of experience with catastrophic events which are usually more local. And we do provide in our provisioning for what would be the anticipated losses when you have people that take advantage of deferred programs versus non-deferred programs. So having said all that, I guess, I don't want to use the word \u2018it washes out' but it's already kind of reflected in our results. And going forward, whether we offer more differed programs will remains to be seen. We look at the opportunities and if they're created. We'll think about it, see if it creates a reason to buy now. What's interesting from our perspective is, if it weren't for the COVID, everybody wouldn't be on the edge of their seat with this. I recognize that everybody wants to see if there's going to be problems with the credit company and collections and delinquencies and so on, because of the COVID. But in reality, the deferral is just an everyday thing for us. We do it from time to time. It happens on a regular -- not regular, not periodic basis, but it happens quite often. We just mix it up so we give, say, our customers a reason to buy now, and a franchisee a reason to change up a sales pitch to have something to talk about to these customers. Good morning. How are you doing? I think, I don't know. Look, I think, my gift is, first of all, our guys are employed mostly. You can look at the thing, things dipped. I think the number of hours went down 5% or something like that in April. And then it's snapped right back and generally what we see, what I'm hearing from my franchisees and I've talked to a lot of them, the garages are pretty much employed. So I don't think unemployment is a big deal. I mean, the unemployment deal or the PPI. You could have argued that that whatever people got in the beginning like $1,200 or something, that might have helped. I'm reading that people put that in a bank, I don't know. But I think it would have been over in the second quarter. We kind of thought that might have helped us in the second quarter. That was one of the questions for us, when we saw the tools group go up and hit the 3%, or I guess it was 2.4% in United States and that kind of thing. We thought maybe that might have been helping us. But I -- my sense of it is, it was probably either banked or spent before it. I don't think it was driving the third quarter. I don't think. And I don't think those \u2013 I don't think our guys are sitting on the edge of the seat, waiting for Congress to approve another one. Now if they do... Well, there was a shift towards -- there was a shift toward the smaller -- not shift, but in the quarter we had nice hand tools and they tend to be RA, not long term credit. Remember, when you say credit, when you're talking about credit, everything sold off to buyers on credit. Everything. Right? And so, okay, you're only talking about whether it's 12 to 15 week credit or -- three year or four year credit, really, so everything's sold on credit. So I don't think, if you say -- if you put that in a pot and say everything was sold, so I don't see people paying cash so much. I haven't heard people pay in cash. And our RA book is up some, because hand tools were strong. Anytime hand tools are strong, you see that happen, and the longer term credit tends to be a little bit less. But actually we thought longer term credit, given the environment was pretty robust in the quarter. Now, as I said, I think it's a sign of things getting better in the in the general view of the repair shop. Now, if somehow a miracle happens and the people in Washington get together and they decide to send everybody $1,200, I think that would be might be cherry on the top, I don't know. I don't think we got much in the third quarter though. I really don't. Yes, all right. I mean the cadence in the -- Bret, the cadence in the third quarter isn't as clear as the second quarter because we're coming off some -- April is god awful. So, I mean the thing is you're coming off of that and you kind of roll up but generally, if you look at -- I mean if you want to talk to Tools Group, if you look at the sales off the van which is not really subject to much SFC impact. It was -- each month was into the double-digit range clearly. So, I think the cadence was pretty solid off the van. You get up and down depending on where the SFC is, I think here. Sometimes like for example, when you have a live SFC, people tend to keep their powder dry because they want to get there and spend they it's almost like a Disney World. We were -- it's almost like a fun experience when they get there, and they run around and they buy all this stuff. And so this was a little more measured because it was added this and so not quite as exciting and so they spent a little earlier than they would have and I think up. So, that's a fair view. But if you look at the stuff off the van, it seems to be solid. Sure. Curt, how are you doing? We're doing okay. I think we didn't see much of a downtick in the Tools Group inventory, but that you have to look at it through the lens of seasonality. Tools Group inventory always rises in the third quarter in anticipation of the sales and in anticipation of having to make good the order burst that comes out of an SFC. So, fundamentally inventory flat in the quarter meant that the Tools Groups seasonally look pretty good really compared to what we -- what you might expect if that had been a normal year. The other groups I think came down. I think our overall inventory was down a reasonable amount, so that's -- I think it was -- as you might expect in this kind of era. But I wanted -- what I wanted to emphasize in a call though. Hey, one of the things that -- I tell you what both were sequentially improved. I mean C&I was down what 25%, 19.7% I think. It's about 20% in the quarter -- second quarter is 8.6%. That's a nice improvement and then the one that really came from behind was RS&I, we thought, I think -- I'll share with you, we thought RS&I, the garages themselves based on the atmosphere in the OEM would have been harder to come back, would take a longer to come back. But they moved from -- they were down like, I said in my script, 29.8% last quarter and they knock I think 2.2% organically and one down, 1.6% as reported, so pretty big move. So I think what you're seeing in those businesses, even though they aren't -- they don't have the starry numbers as the Tools Group has, because their industries are still going through accommodation and aren't even approaching psychological recovery, they're showing some pretty good movement. Yeah, it improved. Sure it improved, it improved. But it was -- I would say this, it was -- in Q2, it was running ahead on the sales to demand I think. Sales that was kind of -- if you want to think of it this way Curtis, you can think of it this way and I would think that Q2 inventory was being pushed out a little bit. The inventories were going down because the sales off the van were a little bit more robust, not great. But they were more robust than -- and they started to spike up in June, which is why we started to talk about the Tools Group in June, we could see that, in fact, we said that on a call I think. And then in the third quarter, more or less equal, the van, the sales off van were about equal to the, you know, for government work were about equal to the sales off the van. That's how it happens. So I think just the sales to the van kind of caught up. Doesn't look like they're building inventory though in the third quarter, it just looks like they kind of stay stable. Next. Good morning Gary. Most of my questions have been answered but just one in terms of -- you had a little bit of a tailwind from FX on the sales side, what kind of impact did that have on the adjusted EPS for the quarter, Aldo? What happens Gary is that the transaction where it's translations tend to be current, transactions tends to look back because you set the cost of product when it gets shipped and it doesn't get sold sometimes later, and that's what drives that difference, so in effect transaction kind of trails to situation. Right. You get bigger sales, good news and lower profit, bad news. We don't really give guidance. But look, I can tell you my broad view is that boy, you know, if you look at the United States, I don't know. I think vehicle repair particularly won't get shocked again. You know, they're not -- in fact everywhere won't get shocked again. Whatever happens, I think our people will accommodate better than they did in the April and March area. So I think that's kind of a broader view. I think, look, I think the United States kind of continues to March, you know, nobody knows what's going to happen exactly. But I think our -- the accommodation continues in the United States in all our areas. Europe's got twin problems with economics and so on. So it's hard to see across all those geographies, what's going to happen there. Again though, I don't think they get shocked again.  So I think, you know, they manage it, but it could be slowed down or it could be accelerated. Asia Pacific, I think China of course is okay. Japan should be okay. I think, I don't know what the heck's happening in India and Southeast Asia, but they seem to be completely flat on their back in terms of their ability to deal with this situation. So, so we'll see how those -- that's how I see it playing out. And I think, you know, we see upward trend, like we said, last time. I think, I believe in the shock accommodation, psychological model, but the value of that slope upward will change depending on how conditions occur. I do think they'll report a fight against the really bad news and that's really, I'm not telling you anything we could have just as good a quarter or a better quarter next time. \nQ \u2013 Gary Prestopino: Okay. Thanks. Appreciate it. Scott, how you doing?\nQ \u2013 Scott Stember: Good. Most of my questions have been answered also, but just going back to the U.K. in the tools group, I know that obviously things have been tough there for the past year, year and a half and got worse in the second quarter, but that was a pretty eye-popping improvement that we saw in tools in the U.K.. Could you just talk, is it -- was there anything else going on there? Was there new products introduced, and just trying to get a sense of the sustainability of the recovery? There's a couple of things. I look, I think we believe U.K. came a long way and in fact their acceleration upward had already begun in June. It just, it just wasn't the level of us, but you could, if you go back, they were deeper in April and if you looked at the slope of the curve upwards in June, you said wait, something's going on there. And I think part of it was, is that okay, you have people suffering through the shock and they were really shocked. And you had the economics on top of it. In my own personal opinion were three things. One is they started to accommodate. Two; the virus kind of got people's minds off of Brexit, they didn't pay attention, you know, so much. So it wasn't weighing on people in terms of economics or coming out of the -- at least getting a little better than the virus they started to figure out. And three, we made changes to our network to try to make it, try to get training the new product there is every bit as robust as here. It just follows a little bit later. So we're introducing some of the diagnostics that had already been introduced here and wasn't there and other new products. So there is consistency in the new product. It wasn't different than the U.S. but I mean, we kept pounding the new product in there. I think, I think those are the three factors. Now it was up, as you say was up quite nicely. We'll see how it plays out. I don't think it will get shocked again though. \nQ \u2013 Scott Stember: Got it. Thank you. Sure. I think this. I think we have the potential to catch up. I think \u2013 I'll tell you what, I think you can write this on a black letter law on your shorts about this. In general, in general what we see is when you have anything like this in terms of a macro, what we see is the smaller businesses, if they have \u2013 if they continue in the business, which vehicle repair has been continuing in the business, they don't think so \u2013 they're like making money, they're spending the kind of rolling. I do think the bigger the business, the more it tends to look at what's going to happen in the future? I'm not sure. They get a little bit more reticent there. They have a little bit more, I guess, forward outlook that troubles them in the day that weighs on their decision-making a day. I think this has happened through my entire time here, we've seen this as macroeconomic expectations go up and down. So, if you look at C&I, you see certain other segments particularly troubled, particularly troubled. Other segments like military and the international aviation up and you see a little bit of heavy truck a little bit better. And so you can see that. But eventually, we see them recovering. That's the difference. It's actually the industry, the environment and also the fact that the garages are smaller and therefore, closer to that cash action and the actual action, and therefore, more confident as they see it continuing. I think this is just psychological. And then if you go to RS&I, I think you're looking at a two-pronged effort. You have the independence, which tend to get a little better, but you also have the dealers who were pretty shook up at the beginning. They were rolling -- they were coming in to the virus as you probably know. With probably a negative view, hey, the SAAR is going to be down for next year, is it look good. Maybe we're going to -- so the thing is they sort of entered this with kind of a downward look, maybe even extra inventory. So, then they got through, then they start to come up. But I think those guys get a little bit more reticent and going forward in terms of investing. Remember, our C&I and RS&I tend to be more capital-based type actions, right? They're good business, but they're more capital, and you would see them being more, I guess, washes. I think they come out of it, though. I think we're loving the RS&I look this quarter, really. Yes. They were -- look, software is about a third of RS&I, the Mitchell 1 Software business, which is repair shop information and running the repair shops in both cars and trucks... You're talking about the Tools Group? I'm talking about RS&I. I thought -- you talk about Tools Group. Sorry, sorry. And the Tools Group, the software business was pretty good. But I wouldn't say I wouldn't it was an extraordinary contributor, an outsized contributor. It didn't stand out really in any way to us so much in this quarter. It was okay, but not -- you wouldn't have called it a variance driver. Well, okay. Assuming itself, right-- Right, right. It seems okay. Yes, that's a reasonable assumption. That's not necessarily true. Yeah. David, the franchisees have an internal calculus that says, I want to have a certain amount of short-term RA and a certain amount of longer term stuff. They try to maintain it in that way, so to the extent they have a, what I would call a border line event in a sale, that might push them one way or another. I believe that to be pretty true. And so the thing is, yes, it's 100%, but it's shorter term. They think the guy can pay it, they like it, they'll get it, they'll get him liquidated and onto something else. As I mentioned, the franchise even seem flush. I mean they're kind of pretty low in terms of on hold. So I think as a network, I think the franchisees are probably in a better place than they've been in a long time. All right. Thanks."

            "content": "Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on slide 6. Net sales of $941.6 million in the quarter compared to $901.8 million last year, reflecting a 3.8% organic sales gain, $4.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation and $1 million of acquisition related sales. The organic increase reflected sequential improvements in year-over-year performance in all three operating segments, led by the Tools Group segment with a double-digit sales gain in the third quarter as compared to last year. While sales in the Commercial & Industrial and Repair Systems & Information segments were lower than the third quarter of 2019, they did increase significantly from 2020 second quarter levels. During the quarter, the COVID-19 pandemic remained the headwind in certain geographies and within certain industries. But overall, the momentum experienced in the month of June continued into the full third quarter for all of our businesses. Similar to last year, we identified last quarter, we identified $1.5 million of direct costs associated with COVID-19. These costs include direct labor, under absorption associated with temporary factory closures, wages for quarantine associates and event cancellation fees as well as other costs to accommodate the current enhanced health and safety environment. Consolidated gross margin of 49.9% compared to 49.7% last year. The 20 basis point improvement primarily reflects the higher sales volumes and benefits from RCI initiatives, partially offset by 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. The operating expense margin of 30.2%, improved 90 basis points from 31.1% last year, largely reflecting the impact of higher sales and savings from cost containment actions and accommodating the impact that COVID-19 has had on the overall business environment. Operating earnings report financial services of $185.7 million, including $1.5 million of direct costs associated with COVID-19 and $4.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $167.7 million in 2019, reflecting a 10.7% year-over-year improvement. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 19.7%, including 20 basis points of direct costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic and 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, improved 110 basis points from 18.6% last year. Financial Services revenue of $85.8 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared to $84.1 million last year. While operating earnings of $65.6 million compared to $61 million in 2019, principally reflecting growth in the Financial Services portfolio as well as lower provisions for credit losses. Consolidated operating earnings of $251.3 million, including $1.5 million of direct COVID-related costs and $4.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $228.7 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 24.5% compared to 23.2% in 2019. Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 23.4% compared to 23.5% last year. Finally, net earnings of $179.7 million or $3.28 per diluted share, increased $15.1 million or $0.32 per share from 2019 levels, representing a 10.8% increase in diluted earnings per share. Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $308.4 million compared to $335.3 million last year, reflecting an 8.6% organic sales decline and $2.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic decrease primarily reflects a low-teen decline in both sales to customers in critical industries and in our Asia Pacific operations. While sales of the segment's European-based hand tools business were essentially flat. Across the critical industries, gains in international aviation and sales to the U.S. military were more than offset by declines in natural resources, including oil and gas, as well as continued lower technical education sales. Within Asia, sales to customers in India and Southeast Asia continue to lag behind some recovery experienced in other areas of the region. Gross margin of 37.3%, declined 60 basis points year-over-year, mostly due to the impact of lower volume and 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. These decreases were partially offset by material cost savings and benefits from the company's RCI initiatives. The operating expense margin of 23.3% improved 20 basis points as compared to last year. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $23.1 million, including $1.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $48.3 million last year. The operating margin of 14% compared to 14.4% a year-ago. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $449.8 million compared to $385.2 million in 2019, reflecting a 16.2% organic sales gain, and a $1.8 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase reflects a mid-teen gain in our U.S. franchise operations and approximately a 20% increase in the segment's international operations. Gross margin of 45.5% in the quarter improved 210 basis points, primarily due to the higher sales volumes and benefits from RCI initiatives, partially offset by 70 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. The operating expense margin of 26.1% improved from 29.6% last year, primarily due to the impact of higher sales volumes and savings from cost containment actions, including lower travel and meeting related expenses. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $87.1 million, including $2.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $53 million last year. The operating margin of 19.4%, compared to 13.8% a year ago. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on slide 9. Sales of $317.5 million compared to $322.7 million a year ago, reflecting a 2.2% organic sales decline, as well as $800,000 of favorable foreign currency translation and $1 million of acquisition related sales. The organic decrease includes a high single-digit decline in sales to OEM dealerships, partially offset by a low single digit increase in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and mangers. Gross margin of 47.3%, including 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, declined 40 basis points from last year. The operating expense margin of 22.1% increased 20 basis points from 21.9% last year. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $80.1 million compared to $83.3 million last year, the operating margin of 25.2%, compared to 25.8% a year ago, including the effects of 20 basis points of unfavorable currency and 10 basis points of direct costs associated with COVID-19. Now, turning to slide 10. Revenue from Financial Services of $85.8 million compared to $84.1 million last year. Financial Services operating earnings of $65.6 million compared to $61 million in 2019. Financial Services expenses of $20.2 million decreased $2.9 million from last year's levels, primarily due to lower provisions for credit losses, reflecting a year-over-year decline in net charge offs. As a percentage of the average portfolio, Financial Service expenses were nine-tenths of 1% and 1.1% in the third quarter of 2020 and 2019 respectively. In the third quarter, the average yield and finance receivables of 17.8% in 2020, compared to 17.7% in 2019. Respective average yield on contract receivables was 8.4% and 9.2%. The lower yield on contract receivables in 2020 includes the impact of lower interest business operation support loans for our franchisees. These loans were offered during the second quarter to help accommodate franchisee operations and dealing with the COVID-19 environment. As of the end of the third quarter, approximately $16 million of these business operating support loans remain outstanding. Total loan originations of $252.8 million in the third quarter of 2020, compared to $253.5 million last year. Originations of both finance receivables and contract receivables were essentially flat the last year's levels. Moving to slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our U.S. operation. Our worldwide gross financial services portfolio increased $25 million in the third quarter. Collections of finance receivables in the quarter of $185.2 million, compared to collections of $181.6 million during the third quarter of 2019. As we mentioned last quarter, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we did provide short term payment relief or forbearance, to some of our franchisees qualifying customers. As at the end of September, those accounts having forbearance terms, we're back to more typical levels and were below 1% of the finance receivable portfolio, as compared to about 2.5% as of the end of the second quarter. Trailing 12-month net losses on extending credit or finance receivables of $46.7 million represented 2.7% of outstandings at quarter end, down 23 basis points sequentially. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.5% for U.S. extended credit, compared to 1.7% last year. On a sequential basis, the rate is up 50 basis points, mostly reflecting the typical seasonal increase of 20 to 30 basis points we experienced between the second and third quarters, as well as the 20 or 30 basis point benefits to this rate reflected in the second quarter of 2020 that was associated with the deferred payment programs that were offered through June. Now, turning to slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $224 million in the quarter increased $92.9 million from comparable 2019 levels, primarily reflecting the higher net earnings and net changes in operating assets and liabilities, including a $57 million decrease in working capital, largely driven by lower year-over-year changes in inventories. Net cash used by investing activities of $18.8 million included net additions to finance receivables of $11.7 million and capital expenditures of $10.1 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $105.1 million included cash dividends of $58.8 million and the repurchase of 300,000 shares of common stock for $45.1 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of the end of September, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $294.5 million of common stock under existing authorizations. Turning to slide 13, trade and other accounts receivables decreased $75.7 million from 2019 year end; days sales outstanding of 64 days compared to 67 days of 2019 year end; inventories increased $4 million in 2019 year end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.4, although slightly improved as compared to 2.3 times at the end of the second quarter compared to 2.6 at year end 2019. Our quarter end cash position of $787.5 million compared to $184.5 million at year end 2019. Our net debt to capital ratio of 15.5% compared to 22.1% at year-end 2019. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million in available credit facilities. As of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Yeah. I mean, our governing policy and dividends is perpetuity. We think it's a cornerstone and in a hallmark of the resilience and power of our model. So we believe in that strongly. Yeah. The inventory in constant dollars, Curt, was down about $28 million, $29 million. As Nick mentioned, Tools Group relatively flat in terms of their inventory move and the other -- were shared kind of equally between the commercial and industry groups and I both had contributions to lower inventory which is expected because their sales were not as robust as last year. We actually had negative $0.06 of EPS driven by currency because while the sales line benefited, there was currency transaction losses, principally driven by sales of U.S. manufactured product in Canada and the United Kingdom, but also the commercial industrial group. It has to do with flows between euro based customers versus Swedish based sources of supply. That's what drove the transaction. David I think people keep spending. We don't isolate on whether you have just an easy loan. Remember they have two-thirds of business activity are with the franchisee on a revolving account type basis. And they remain generally active. I'm sure you get all kinds of examples. Some people might not buy for a while, although people keep buying each and every week. You get all kinds of patterns, but the fact is there was a deferred program and I'll take really radically changes the flow of activity, because again, we've had programs like this more regarding Q2, certainly given the unusual nature of it, but a pretty consistent. The thing you have to always remember, people ask Nick earlier on the call about stimulus. Remember everybody who has a job and I think we said, most of our customer base still hasn't come has more discretionary money in their pocket simply because a lot of other venues to spend your money are not available whether it would be going to dinner, the movies or a sports game, so that people have more money beyond just stimulus checks coming into mail and technicians like the right tools that he's been demonstrated over the tunnel of time. Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute. That's an assumption that's untrue. They're not \u2013 they're not strapped for credit. Look here's the thing. We didn't \u2013 we didn't just give 90 day credit to the people who were strapped for credit. We offered 90 day credit as a reason to buy now. It's like a car loan. So the point is, I think the point is, is those people know who you are? You're going to buy a still tight, David? Okay, I can get a 90 day deferral or not? I might take it, right. You might take it. Its all the money that you have. You might take it. Again David, they always have a choice to make it. If you remember that Snap-On does benefit by having what I would say is the industry's leading residual values. So, when they take trade-ins, particularly in diagnostics becomes a factor, that's where the penetration rate on diagnostics for one reason is lower. There's a good chance that the finance can be handled through the RA account. If you take in, as an example, of $2,000 trading unit on a $3,000 item, you don't have to necessarily finance those. So, that's why you get a little bit of a different blend. And I think in this low interest rate environment, some franchisees feel they have the wherewithal to stretch a bit or borrow locally if they don't borrow from Snap-On Credit. And I think they have some versatility given the low interest rate environment. So that's why you don't necessarily have the same predictability as to what falls on to the easy program. Again, remember, the franchisee decides that. Snap-On doesn't decide that. Yeah. But David, but take a step back, you can look over the long tunnel of time, our default rates and the franchisees see this. Remember, our franchisees are pretty long in there too. They have, on average, 14 years of experience. They see that the defaults while never guaranteed are pretty predictable to some extent, and through good and bad times kind of steady. So they don't rush to outboard at least, again, always on the fringes you get a little bit of everything. But they don't rush the panic and say, well, let's give us the Snap-On credit because they only have 25% exposure versus 100%. Of course, there's some that might consider that. But the great population does not. Well, that people use a metric, David, RA flips, which we don't look at it that way, but some people say, oh, RA flips if they're up, that must be bad things are coming, RA flips are actually down from the storage levels. No, again, we don't meet a lot into that, but okay. It doesn't seem like the franchisees are trying to offload credit readiness in any dramatic."

And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sara Verbsky, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nSara Verbsky: Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review Snap-on's Second Quarter Results which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today, Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions. As usual, we've provided slides to supplement our discussion. These slides can be accessed under the Downloads tab in our webcast viewer as well as on our website, snapon.com, under the Investors section. These slides will be archived on our website along with the transcript of today's call. Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs or otherwise state management's or the company's outlook plans or projections are forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings. Finally, this presentation includes non-GAAP measures of financial performance, which are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for their GAAP counterparts. Additional information, including a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures, is included in our earnings release and in our conference, call slides on pages 14 through 16. Both can be found on our website. With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?\nNick Pinchuk: Thanks, Sara. Before we get going, I want to thank the members of the Snap-on team. It's clear in this turbulence that they are among the special contributors who keep society intact when our days are dark. And in that essential challenge, we're prioritizing the health, safety and well-being of our associates, franchisees, customers and communities. Working from home, and when that's not possible, and there's a number of those instances, distancing using personal protective equipment, cleaning, deep and often staggering shifts and brakes, paying quick attention to symptoms and pursuing contact tracing. We worked hard to stay safe. But throughout this time, we're also invested in - investing in a continuing stream of essential new products. We've also invested in a continuing stream of essential new products, reinforced our brand and strive to maintain our team. The people of Snap-on are a great advantage. We're working hard to preserve them in the turbulence, and we'll continue to do so. For our franchisees we're active in helping, reaching out on a regular basis to understand their needs and those of their customers. When the virus passes, we know there'll be even more opportunities. We want our associates and our franchisees at full strength to capitalize on the possibilities. We now project that the virus plays out in three phases: First, the initial shock. A substantial interruption of activity at both the franchisee and the customer level. This was evident in late March and in April; second, a combination period. As operations and individuals develop more and more ways to safely pursue their opportunities against the COVID-19 environment. In fact, we appear to be seeing that effect through May, June and onward. And of course, we've actively participated in that process, broadcasting best practices, working hard to accelerate the comeback. Finally, the third phase, psychological recovery. Following a return to normal, customers will need to regain confidence in the future before they resume full buying participation. And in that recovery, we see great opportunities. As driving is restored becomes even more popular, even more essential. This overall construct represents what we consider to be the general shape of the way forward. It does represent a continuing upward trend, but the slope of the ascension isn't clear. And of course, the psychological recovery phase will be greatly influenced by the ongoing evolution of the virus. Nobody knows the future for sure, but we are encouraged by what we've seen so far. Looking back, April was the nacre. But as the quarter progressed, we showed continual recovery. Our businesses did learn to better accommodate the pandemic. Both sales and profitability improved sequentially in May and in June. Although the virus is still with us, it appears that the situation may be evolving just as we projected. As we said at the end of April, the impact of COVID-19 varies across our operating landscape. Asia remains virus challenged. Japan, South Korea and China do appear to have weather the worst, but Southeast Asia and India are still in deep turbulence. And in Europe, the overall economic weakness present before the pandemic in combination with the virus has made for the deepest distress of all. Beyond geographic differences, we're also seeing that our face-to-face businesses, the mobile vans and the direct sales forces are faring somewhat better compared with other models. Snap-on's traditional strength, personal selling appears to be an effective foundation for limiting the difficulty. In that way, we believe we have the resilience and resources to weather this challenge as Snap-on has so many times in the past. Actually, over the years, we've seen this movie before natural disaster, Superstorm Sandy, Hurricane, Harvey and Katrina and the Great Recession of 2009 and each time we learned to accommodate and emerge stronger and we've taken the lessons of those disruptions that apply them with positive effect to this time of the virus. I love to say this. Snap-on has paid a dividend every quarter since 1939 and it's never reduced it and this quarter was no different. That record stands as evidence of our ongoing resistance to challenge. And beyond just maintaining, we believe our continuing investment in new products and our franchisees and in our team in the midst of the storm will once again make us stronger as the environment recovers. We do believe in the opportunities going forward and because of that, we're keeping our focus on Snap-on value creation, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement. That emphasis is particularly evident in customer connection and innovation. We're continuing with a stream of new products. We believe the green shoots of accommodation and psychological recovery will grow and we're going to be ready. Well, that's the overview. Now let's turn to the results. Second quarter, as reported sales were $724.3 million, down 23.9%, including $14.4 million or a 120-basis-point impact from unfavorable foreign currency and an organic sales declined 22.9%. From an earnings perspective, OpCo OI for the quarter of $91.1 million, including $5.8 million of direct costs associated with the virus, $4 million of restructuring, principally focused on Europe and $3.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $189.9 million in 2019. Optical operating margin was 12.6% and the as-adjusted level, excluding restructuring charges, was 13.1%. For financial services, operating income of $57.6 million was down from last year's 60.6%. Overall, EPS on an as-reported basis was $1.85 compared to compared to $3.22 last year. Excluding the restructuring charges the as-adjusted EPS was $1.91. Well, those are the overall numbers. Now let's turn to the groups. In C&I, volume in the second quarter of $261.9 million including $6.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency, was down versus last year's $335 million, primarily on double-digit declines in all of the segment's operations, reflecting the effect of COVID-19 operations, and the ongoing economic weakness in Europe. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income of $22.9 million decreased $26 million, including $3 million of virus related of costs, $2 million of restructuring and $1.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects. There was a clear point of light in C&I. Our direct sales to customers in the critical industries, though still down was less effective than other areas across the group. Military and international aviation continue to register growth. And heavy truck, as you might expect was down, but was reasonably resilient while other segments such as oil and gas and education, no surprise. There were no students. Both those industries were significantly impacted by the pandemic and experienced substantial contraction. But we do remain confident in and committed to extending in the critical industries, and we do see growing opportunity there moving forward. Speaking in the future, let's talk about creating new products. Just this quarter, we introduced another one of our great 14.4 volt units. The new CTS 825 quarter inch Hex Hex Cordless screw driver. Our brushless powertrain makes for higher torque, more run time, longer motor life. The driver as a nine-position clutch giving text just a proper amount of torque for the job, all packaged with a dual range gearbox and a built-in break that prevent this power tool from throwing fasteners that's a significant safety feature. The new screw gun also features ergonomically designed cush grip handle for great tech comfort and twin lights, twin LED lights to clearly illuminate the work area. After only a couple of months, it's already essential where work is critical. It was launched in April, a tough month. But it's already one of our hit million dollar products, a significant success. C&I, navigating the turbulence of customer connection and innovation serving the essentials, now on to the Tools Group. Sales were $323.3 million in the quarter, reflecting a $79.2 million organic decline and $3.3 million of unfavorable foreign unfavorable foreign unfavorable foreign currency. The operating earnings were $38.4 million, including $1.9 million of virus-related costs, $1.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency and $600,000 of restructuring charges compared to $71.3 million recorded in 2019. The Tools Group was a clear demonstration both of the COVID trajectory across our business and of the strength and resilience of our direct face-to-face model. As the virus rose in late March and April, the network was shocked individually and collectively. The impact varied by region, but all geographies were affected. April was the deepest. However, moving from that point, our franchisees in collaboration with the Snap-on team file increasingly effective ways to accommodate the pandemic and pursue their support of the essential. And each subsequent month, the vans have shown significant gains. In fact, the Tools Group sales in June were down just 3.1%, up nicely after a tough start to the quarter. The ongoing accommodation, you hear from the field that the direct interface with our customers is dramatically highlighting the bun that Snap-on has always had with working men and women through thick and thin. And many franchisees report that the relationship forged to new and the pandemic have never been stronger. There's nothing like working together in difficulty, and we believe this bodes really well for our market position and for capturing future opportunities. So despite the virus, we're still quite positive about our business, and as a view clearly reflected outside Snap. And in fact, once again, this year, we're being recognized in the top 50 of entrepreneurs Magazine's annual best of the best franchisee -- franchises. The entrepreneur ranking rates 500 companies on cost, size, growth, franchise support, brand power, financial strength and organizational stability. And we again scored highest in the Tool Distribution category. That's a distinction we've held for quite some time. As we move forward, our associates and franchisees are clearly becoming more effective against the win, it\u2019s a continuing process born out of the Snap-on team working and developing action plans, sharing best practices for safe selling, supporting with tailored promotions and launching targeted promotions. This is a process that's been successful in hurricanes, recessions and the threats of 9/11, and it's working again. And of course, the effort includes also a healthy array of innovative new products to solve the critical. Everybody knows we have great ratchets. And guided by uninterrupted customer connection, we've been expanding that powerful line-up. Almost every quarter, and we did it again when we introduced the XFR704 12-point Flank Drive Double Flex Ratcheting Box Wrench Set. Now that's a mouthful. But this unit has a lot to offer. It combines 180-degree flexible head with our narrow width and low-height design, allowing work in the tightest of spaces. Our patented ratcheting gear utilizes Dual 80 technology, minimizing swing arc and making jobs in restricted areas even easier. And our unique Yoke/tang configuration provides the strongest and most durable flex head anywhere. The new four-piece set is built in our Elizabethton, Tennessee plant right here in USA. I was just there again, and I can testify. The Snap-on people in that plant are a special team turning out great product, and even in the current environment that technicians have noticed, driving the Flex to 704 on its way to be another $1 million product. Well, that's the Tools Group, accommodating the pandemic, furthering innovation and strengthening for the future. Now let's speak of RS&I. The RS&I group finished the quarter with $245 million in sales, including $4.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency, $2.3 million from recent acquisitions and that level compared to $348.9 million recorded last year. The lower volumes reflected a decline of over 30% and the activity associated with vehicle OEM projects and in the capital like spending relating to our undercar equipment operations, both areas that were deeply attenuated with the uncertainty. Sales of diagnostics and repair information products, independent shops were also negatively impacted, but to a lesser degree, garages continue to subscribe. And invest in meeting new repair challenges, people's need fixing even in a pandemic. RS&I operating earnings of $50.6 million decreased $38 million, including $1.4 million of European focused restructuring, $800,000 of unfavorable foreign currency and $700,000 of direct COVID costs. So while the overall group was impacted, information-based operations were not as effective and new products were a driver in that. Once again, we generated repair excitement with innovations like the latest enhancements to our Mitchell One prodemand repair information system, which in response to the needs of large national account customers now includes a range of vehicle lift points in its quick reference menu. The new pro menu links directly to vivid vehicle illustrations, which identify designated listing points as well as listing all the important manufacturer recommended safety procedures. You see technicians are in a hurry, sometimes fail to follow the correct lift procedures. Injuries and vehicle damage can follow. But those who have our pro demand system can now find the critical lift information only one click away from the home screen. It's a significant convenience and a clear safety enhancement. Also in the quarter, we launched our e-Technician 2.0 designed specifically for heavy-duty trucks. It's the most comprehensive and powerful diagnostic software in the market. It provides the data and the support required to stay competitive in today's trucking industries. Heavy-duty diagnosis were never this good. The e-technician 2.0 combines extensive coverage from everything from commercial vehicles to write-down to light and medium heavy-duty trucks, diagnostic capability for an expanded array of engines, transmissions, brakes, body and chassis systems and more. The new 2.0 also adds a cloud-based, fleet-wide vehicle history, giving users access to every diagnostic session for every vehicle in their fleet, regardless of location. Snap-on continues to show the way in truck repair and e-technician 2.0 is another step along that path. We're confident in the strength of our RS&I group. And we keep driving to expand its position with repair shop owners and managers, making work easier with great new products even in the days of the virus. Well, that's the second quarter, the Snap-on second quarter. Shack, moving to accommodation into what we believe will be psychological recovery, keeping our teams safe as we pursue the essential, applying the lessons of our experience, helping our customers, our franchisees and our team, whether the difficult days. And build the capability, whether those days and build the capability to operate in the virus environment, driving month-by-month improvement, engaging the power of our direct selling capabilities, being confident in our future opportunities now amplified by the virus, pursuing Snap-on value creation, all to not only weather the turbulence, but to emerge stronger and ready to take full advantage when the days are clear. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo for a detailed discussion of the financials.\nAldo Pagliari: Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on slide six. Net sales of $724.3 million in the quarter compared to $951.3 million last year, reflecting a 22.9% organic sales decline, $14.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation and $2.3 million of acquisition-related sales. The organic sales decrease primarily reflected the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with sales declines in all three operating segments. In the quarter, while there was some variability from location to location, the declines in Europe were more pronounced. As anticipated, with government measures in place throughout the world, sales in the month of April were heavily impacted and were down significantly on a year-over-year basis. As locations began to reopen and as our operations and those of our franchisees adjusted to the virus environment, which included accommodations for various government-imposed restrictions, we began to see sequential improvements in activity as we move through May and June. Similar to last quarter, we accrued for restructuring costs associated with certain of our European-based operations. During the second quarter, we recorded $4 million of such cost which were reflected in each of our operating segments. Additionally in the quarter, we've identified $5.8 million of direct costs associated with COVID 19. These costs include direct labor and under-absorption associated with temporary factory closures, wages for quarantine associates, event cancellation fees as well as other costs to accommodate the current enhanced health and safety environment. Consolidated gross margin of 47.1% compared to 49.8% last year. The 270 basis point decrease primarily reflects the impact of the lower volumes, including costs to maintain manufacturing capacity and worker skill sets, 40 basis points of direct cost associated with COVID-19 and 30 basis points of restructuring costs. The decreases were partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives. The operating expense margin of 34.5% increased 470 basis points from 29.8% last year. This increase primarily reflects the impact of lower sales as well as 40 basis points of direct COVID-19 related costs and 20 basis points from restructuring actions. These items were partially offset by savings from cost containment actions in response to the lower volume. Operating earnings before financial services of $91.1 million, including $5.8 million of direct costs associated with COVID-19, $4 million of restructuring costs and $3.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $189.9 million in 2019. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 12.6% compared to 20% last year. Excluding the restructuring charges, operating earnings before financial services of $95.1 million or 13.1% of sales, decreased 49.9% from 2019 levels. Financial services revenue of $84.6 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared to $84.1 million last year, while operating earnings of $57. 6 million compared to $60.6 million in 2019, primarily reflecting a $3 million increase in provisions for credit losses. Consolidated operating earnings of $148.7 million, including $5.8 million of direct COVID related costs, $4 million of restructuring charges and $4.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $250.5 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 18.4% compares to 24.2% last year. On an adjusted basis, excluding restructuring, operating earnings of $152.7 million or 18.9% of revenues decreased 39% from 2019 levels. Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 24.1%, including a 20 basis point increase from the restructuring charges compared to 23.6% for the second quarter of last year. Finally, net earnings of $101.2 million or $1.85 per share, including a $0.06 charge for restructuring compared to $180.4 million or $3.22 per share a year ago. Excluding the restructuring charges, net earnings as adjusted were $104.5 million or $1.91 per share. Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I group on slide seven. Sales of $261.9 million compared to $335 million last year, reflecting a 20.22% organic sales decline and a $6.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic decrease includes mid-teen declines in both sales to customers in critical industries and in the power tools operation. Across the critical industries, gains in sales to various government-related agencies were more than offset by declines in natural resources, including oil and gas, as well as the lower technical education sales with the latter being impacted by school and campus closures. Gross margin of 34.4% decreased 420 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of decreased sales, including lower utilization of manufacturing capacity, as well as 80 basis points from $2 million of restructuring charges, 70 basis points of direct costs associated with COVID-19 and 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. These decreases were partially offset by material cost savings and benefits from the company's RCI initiatives. The operating expense margin of 25.7% increased 170 basis points from 24% last year, primarily due to the lower sales and 50 basis points of direct COVID-19 related costs. These items were partially offset by savings from cost containment efforts. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $22.9 million, including $3 million of direct COVID-19 related cost, $2 million of restructuring charges and $1.9 million of unfavorable foreign currencies effects compared to $48.9 million last year. The operating margin of 8.7%, including the 80 basis point charge for restructuring compared to 14.6% a year ago. Turning now to slide eight. Sales in the Snap-on Tools group of $323.3 million compared to $405.8 million in 2019, reflecting a 19.7% organic sales decline and $3.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales decrease reflects a mid-teen decline in our US franchise operations and a nearly 40% decline in the segment's international operations. As Nick mentioned, sales in our direct customer-facing businesses like the Snap-on Tools had the most dramatic year-over-year decreases in April, with notable sequential improvements in activity in May and June. Gross margin of 41.7% declined 340 basis points, primarily due to the impact of lower sales volumes, including cost to maintain manufacturing capacity as well as 30 basis points of direct costs associated with COVID-19, and there were 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. The operating expense margin of 29.8% increased from 27.5% last year, primarily due to the impact of the lower sales, 30 basis points of direct COVID-19 related costs and 20 basis points from $600,000 of restructuring charges. These costs were partially offset by savings from cost containment actions. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools group of $38.4 million, including $1.9 million of direct COVID-19 related costs, $1.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and $600,000 of restructuring charges compared to $71.3 million last year. The operating margin of 11.9% compared to 17.6% a year ago. Turning to the RS&I group shown on slide nine. Sales of $245 million compared to $348.9 million a year ago, reflecting a 29.5% organic sales decline and $4.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by $2.3 million of acquisition-related sales. The organic sales decline includes a mid-teens decrease in sales of diagnostic and information products to independent repair shop owners and managers as well as declines of over 30% in both sales of undercar equipment and sales to OEM dealerships. The lower sales of undercar equipment includes significantly lower sales of collision repair products, while lower sales to OEM dealerships largely reflect decreases in OEM facilitation projects. Gross margin of 47.4% improved 110 basis points from 46.3% last year primarily due to the impact of reduced sales and lower gross margin businesses and savings from RCI activities. The operating expense margin of 26.7% increased from 20.9% last year, primarily due to the lower sales and 50 basis points from $1.4 million of restructuring charges partially offset by savings from RCI and other cost containment actions. Operating earnings for the RS& I group of $50.6 million, including $1.4 million of restructuring charges, $700,000 of direct COVID-19 related costs and $800,000 of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $88.6 million last year. The operating margin of 20.7% compared to 25.4% a year ago. Now turning to slide 10. Revenue from financial services of $84.6 million compared to $84.1 million last year. Financial services operating earnings of $57.6 million compared to $60.6 million in 2019. Financial services expenses of $27 million increased $3.5 million from last year's levels, primarily due to $3 million of higher provisions for credit losses as compared to 2019. The second quarter of 2019 included lower provisions as a result of non-recurring favorable loss experience at that time. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1.3% and 1.1% in the second quarters of 2020 and 2019 respectively. The average yield on finance receivables was 17.6% in the second quarters of both 2020 and 2019. The respective average yield on contract receivables was 8.2% and 9.1%. The lower yield on contract receivables in the second quarter of 2020 primarily reflects the impact of approximately $20 million of lower interest business operation support loans for our franchisees. These loans were offered during the second quarter to help accommodate franchisee operations and dealing with the COVID-19 environment. Total loan originations of $255.8 million decreased $7.6 million or 2. 9% and included an 8.5% decrease in originations of finance receivables. This decline in finance receivables was partially offset by a 26.1% increase in originations of contract receivables resulting from the business operations support loans offered to franchisees mentioned earlier. Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our U.S. operation. Our worldwide gross financial services portfolio increased $54.3 million in the second quarter. Collections of finance receivables in the quarter of $166.8 million compared to collections of $191.6 million during the second quarter of 2019. This year's quarter reflected the greater use of deferred payment plan sales programs and short-term payment relief or forbearance to some of our franchisees qualifying customers. Similar to the trends elsewhere in our business, we saw the greatest number of requests for payment relief on extended credit or finance receivables in April. This lessened in May, and as of the end of June, forbearance was granted for approximately 2.5% of the portfolio. Historically, those accounts having forbearance terms are below 1% of the finance receivable portfolio. Trailing 12-month net losses on extended credit or finance receivables of $50.4 million represented 2.93% of outstandings at quarter end, down six basis points sequentially. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1% for U.S. extended credit is down 40 basis points from a year ago. This improvement primarily reflects the aforementioned programs, which took place during the quarter as well as the effective credit and collection practices executed by Snap-on and our franchisees throughout this period. Total charge-offs within the quarter totaled $15.1 million as compared to $14.9 million during the second quarter of 2019. Now, turning to slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $253.6 million in the quarter increased $108.1 million from comparable 2019 levels, primarily reflecting net changes in operating assets and liabilities, including $61.5 million in lower tax payments, $75.7 million in decreases in working investment, partially offset by lower net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $45.6 million included net additions to finance receivables of $35 million and capital expenditures of $11.8 million. In the quarter, our total free cash flow or cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures in the net change in finance receivables was $206.8 million. This reflected an improvement of $118.3 million from last year and represented 195% of net earnings. Net cash provided by financing activities of $289.5 million included the proceeds from the April sale of $500 million of 30-year senior notes, partially offset by $148.1 million of repayments of notes payable and other short-term borrowings and cash dividends of $58.7 million. While there were no repurchases of common stock under our existing share repurchase programs during the quarter. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $334.4 million of common stock under existing authorizations. Turning to slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivables decreased $131.1 million from 2019 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 59 days compared to 67 days at 2019 year-end. This reflected a reduction in days outstanding across all of our operating segments. Inventories increased $23.6 million from 2019 year-end, primarily to support the critical industries. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.3 compared to 2.6 at year-end 2019. Our quarter end cash position of $686.2 million compared to $184.5 million at year-end 2019. Our net debt to capital ratio of 17.9% compared to 22.1% at year-end 2019. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million in available credit facilities. As of quarter end, there were no outstanding amounts under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Despite the uncertainty in the current environment, we believe we have sufficient available cash and access to both committed and uncommitted credit facilities to cover expected funding needs in both the near-term and a long-term basis. That concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few updated outlook items. Given the improving trends experienced in the second quarter in the near-term, we believe there will be continued sequential improvements reflecting increasing levels of accommodations to the virus-related environment. However, we cannot provide assurance on the rate of progress due to the uncertain and evolving nature and duration of the pandemic. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in a range of $75 million to $85 million as compared to our prior estimate of $70 million to $80 million. Additionally, we continue to anticipate that our full year 2020 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 23% to 25%. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?\nNick Pinchuk: Thanks, Aldo. The Snap-on second quarter, sales were down. Of course, we don't like it. But - the OpCo margin was 12.6%, 13.1% as adjusted, approaching the mid-teen level that we long-held as an aspirational target. EPS of $1.91 as adjusted, also down but still higher than any quarter before the end of 2014. The numbers are decreased, but we believe they demonstrated significant resilience and perhaps the greatest withering of our time. You see we have seen this movie before. That -- and that experience helped guide us through the depth of the shock and on to the continuing positive trajectory of accommodation. April is dark. But the rise from that point was of evident across the corporation from operation to operation. The tools group demonstrating the value of our direct model with sales in June reaching within 3.1% of last year's level. The future is not known. What we believe our learning and accommodation assures that we won't get shocked again and any future impact will be attenuated. And looking at the way the virus has affected everyday life, we believe abundant opportunities emerging for Snap - are emerging for Snap-on in the recovery. It appears that vehicles are going to be even more important. You can see already in China and in the U.S. Northeast, and that's music to our ears. And we are preparing launching new products, enhancing our brand, reinforcing our franchise network and maintaining the capabilities of our team. Now all of this represents a cost in the turbulence, but it ensures that we'll be fully enabled and stronger when the opportunities arise. And we believe what we're doing in these days of the virus will position Snap-on for continuing growth, increasing profitability and ongoing prosperity for years to come. Before I turn the call over to the operator, I once again -- I'll once again speak to our Franchisees & Associates. It has never been clearer that all of you are extraordinary people, playing a very special role in our world. For your ongoing success in surviving the shock and accommodating the turbulence, you have my congratulations for your significant contributions in maintaining our society, you have my admiration. And for your unfailing belief in the future of our enterprise, you have my thanks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?\nOperator: Certainly. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Scott Stember with C.L. King.\nScott Stember: Good morning and thanks for taking my questions.\nNick Pinchuk: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Stember: Nick, you gave a lot of good color on what's happening at recovery within the businesses. It seems like the Tools Group is probably experiencing the greatest recovery. Maybe talk about RS&I and C&I, how the cadence of sales recovery and how we could expect the quarter coming up.\nNick Pinchuk: Sure. Well, look, of course, we don't give guidance, but I'll tell you that's generally, of course, - what I say is never true everywhere in Snap-on, of course. But generally, we're seeing a combination across the vast majority of our operations, April, May, June, there was a progression of improvement through those periods. So don't get me wrong, the fact that I called out the Tools group, because they had done particularly well. There was a combination across every one of those groups. So, that's particularly in industrial, where - I called out the direct selling. They had some nice progression through that period in their direct selling activity. If you step back to -- and I think you would say across C&I, in general, you're seeing that. In RS&I, the sales were down, what were they down? Like 29.8% as reported, 29.5% or 29.4% as adjusted. But generally, you see a couple of pieces. One, the vehicle OEM projects are quite lumpy, and we see that in this period, and it's very hard to project that future and the equipment business, which generally is selling - after all selling to kind of a bifurcated situation they're selling to small businesses, which need psychological recovery to have the confidence to invest in the capital-light projects, which are our equipment. Now, the other piece of what I've just talked about is, there's a big dollop associated with the OEM and really that comes psychological view of the dealerships. Do they think the fact that maybe they're going to sell new cars - less new cars this year means they should pull in their horns, or as in other times, should they start investing, because they had need to depend more and more on used car and repair and parts flow? If it's the latter, there should be an uptick in those businesses.\nScott Stember: Got it. And moving over to the financial services side, your originations were really not down all that much. But I guess that was explained by loans to the franchisees. Maybe just talk about the health of the franchisees and what you're seeing at the repair shop level.\nNick Pinchuk: Yeah. Look, I was just out with some franchisees last week, and they seem pretty strong. I mean, and I talked to a lot of them on the phone these days since I can't travel as much as I used to around the country. And they seem all quite positive. I would say that the originations - one of the things I will tell you that I think speaks volumes is we talked about the recovery, the accommodation of the Tools Group as shown in the 3.1%. Well, I'll tell you that in the quarters through this period, the sales off the van could be viewed as our work better than our sales to the bands. So fundamentally, what you see a little bit in that origination situation is some of our franchisees selling out of their inventory, big-ticket items, particularly tool storage, which they tend to happen in and inventory to try to accommodate the taste of the technicians. And therefore, you see that, but we see it as a great thing. Because fundamentally, the sales off the van are outpacing. The sales of the Tools Group showed a combination.\nScott Stember: So that being said, the sale in June, if you were down only modestly sell in, are you saying you were off the van in June?\nNick Pinchuk: I didn't say anything. I said it was better than the 3.1. That's what I said. I said it was better than the -- I think -- and I said significantly better. But that's what I'm willing to say in this situation. It clearly is what leads to the originations.\nScott Stember: Got it. Good enough. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: And now we'll take a question from Gary Prestopino of Barrington Research.\nGary Prestopino: Hey, Good morning everyone.\nNick Pinchuk: Hi, Gary.\nGary Prestopino: A couple of questions here, Nick. First of all, you -- well, first of all, are all your markets now open, especially on the van side, I mean, are you able to sell in the Northeast some of these areas\u2026\nNick Pinchuk: Oh, yes. Everything is open. It was -- there's a lot less variation now in terms of opening. When the virus hits, the shock hit, there was variations between regions. So the Northeast, you have a lot of people with attenuated activity, not as much say Southwest, as we\u2019re talking about the swap between, not as much, but still attenuation. Now they've kind of come together. Canada, I don't know if I talked on the call, but Canada was like the basket case for a while. People were really shocked and U.K. was shocked and all of those businesses have -- all of those areas have started to come together. There is some arithmetic difference between them, but not enough to shake a stick at, I think, in this situation. So the guys are coming back. Now that's happened through the quarter at varying levels, part of the accommodation process.\nGary Prestopino: Okay. And then you keep mentioning or you mentioned opportunities for your company, given this COVID-19 situation. I mean, are those opportunities really stemming from the fact that cars are getting older and that also thought process or the thematic thought process is that more individuals are going to want to own cars rather than taking public transportation. Are there other areas where you're looking on to capitalize that you didn't really talk about?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, I think those are the two big things, I'm talking about. But I think as -- I think a couple of things. I think -- I would say three things. One, of course, cars are getting older. They've gotten older every year. And the fact that it's a lower SAAR this year, probably cars will accelerate in terms of getting older, we think. And so that's one thing and that does keep driving. Cars keep changing and so the virus is kind of frozen people in. And so we expect to see a few slot of new technologies closed now, and then that drives our situation. Secondly, I think you and I don't want to get on the L to go down in Chicago. I don't think people are going to want to jump on a subway so much anymore and -- or at least depend on that. And so what we see in China, and we start to see that in the Northeast has increased driving, because people don't want to depend on collective transportation, because they know that things can go wrong in the situation. On top of which, if you read commercial real estate and cities are going down and I think residential real estate, I think people are moving out for the suburbs, and that means more driving. And finally, we think that this kind of pause gives more time for new technologies like advanced driver assistance systems, which change a lot of things and play right into our more complicated product and maybe even more electric vehicles, which changes the car park and helps us sell more tools. We have a kit that we've especially made, 53 tools just for electric vehicles. So when they roll out, we'll be ready to roll with them.\nGary Prestopino: Okay. And then my last question, if you want to answer this. I'm just trying to get an idea. I mean, you said that sequentially, there was an improvement in sales throughout the quarter. Are you still seeing \u2013 did you still see a sequential improvement at the early part of Q3. I realize the seasonality there.\nNick Pinchuk: We don't give guidance. And look, Q3 is a squarely quarter. However, so therefore, you've got vacations in Europe. You got the SFC, you got a lot of things floating through there. However, I did say, May, June onwards, that's about what I'm willing to say.\nGary Prestopino: Okay. That\u2019s fine. Thank you.\nNick Pinchuk: Sure.\nOperator: And next, we have Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer.\nChristopher Glynn: Nick, just to press on your willingness tolerance there a little bit more. Was the May-June onward dynamic for RS&I and C&I material or negligible?\nNick Pinchuk: Material. I mean it's \u2013 but look, I don't want to get overheated on these kinds of things. Everybody \u2013 I said already that nobody knows how the future is going to go. But what I did say is we are stronger against this kind of disruption by virtue of the accommodation, and we don't believe we will get shocked again. So if the world rises, maybe we bow it a little bit more. I \u2013 we expect \u2013 we're saying we saw that onward motion, And I think implicit, and accommodation is we get better and better at dealing with the environment. The shape of the curve is unclear. And I've already said the third quarter is. But we \u2013 like I said also, I like what I see.\nChristopher Glynn: Okay. And then you've had some restructuring. You may have some temporary cost actions going away. Is there a way to think about sequential leverage on whatever uptick we choose to model?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, we have had restructuring because it was in \u2013 it's mostly focused on Europe. I think six-tenth of this times $4 million is kind of in North America and the two, or not necessarily. It's kind of European focused, we'd say, mostly in general. We'd say that because while we saw \u2013 we've been watching Europe evolved for a while and seeing the weakness of the economics. So we've been prepared for this and raising through RCI or capacity. So we can deal with higher volumes with less in Europe. That's why we have this restructuring. I would say this only. There's a lot, I think, implicit, and we saying we are investing in products, enhancing our brand and maintaining our team. That means we're holding the people because we actually believe that our people are capable. And I don't know about other people, but we think these people are hard to duplicate. So we're holding on to them for dear life.\nChristopher Glynn: Okay. And last one for me. On SFC, I'm wondering if it's \u2013 some of the charge-offs were relatively light in the quarter, considering all that's going on. You talked about some consolidations. Are there any implications for the back half, did some of the mechanical calc of provisioning kind of get deferred in this dynamic? Or is it kind of a more continuity?\nNick Pinchuk: Look\u2026\nChristopher Glynn: Yes, just wanted to know about the financial performance to...\nNick Pinchuk: I'll just say this, Chris. I feel better now than I did in the prior call in April. I feel better now. And I'll let Aldo comment.\nAldo Pagliari: Yes. Chris, I'd just say that just to refresh everyone's memory, Q2 typically does see seasonal improvement as you progress from Q1. It's a period of time when people get their tax refunds, and obviously, we probably got a little bit of a bump up with stimulus checks coming in. But a reminder, not everybody got their tax refund yet because if you didn't submit your tax return electronically, you're still probably have it being reviewed the IRS. So there might be some tailwind that still occurs in Q3 from tax refunds. Having said that, the deferred payment programs forbearance they help a bit with the calculation, so if you look at the progress from Q1 to Q2, normally, we expect a 10 to 20 basis point sequential improvement. This time, we saw 70 and year-over-year, it was better by 40. I'd say, if you look year-over-year, there's probably 20, 30 basis points associated with the fact that you have deferred programs. So by definition customers on deferral couldn't be delinquent. So that will go away a bit. So I think you'll get more traditional levels. But geez, it looks a lot like a natural disaster from our history in the rearview mirror so far. So we'll see how the remainder plays out. It's still a pretty volatile environment. But like I said, we're pleased with the charge-offs in the quarter.\nChristopher Glynn: Thanks.\nOperator: And now we'll go to David MacGregor of Longbow Research.\nDavid MacGregor: Yes, good morning everybody.\nNick Pinchuk: Hi, David.\nDavid MacGregor: Good morning. I wondered just for the sake of clarity rather than trying to fumble through a bunch of numbers, but just for the sake of clarity, can you just say what the originations would have been excluding the loans to the franchisees?\nAldo Pagliari: Well, the contract receivables were up 26% in the quarter. So that's clearly broken out, if at contract receivables. So as Nick has mentioned, EEC was down 8.5%, David.\nDavid MacGregor: Right. All right. Maybe I'll take that up with the off line. I just want to make sure we're getting to an accurate number here. And then can you quantify the extent of the return from\u2026\nAldo Pagliari: To make it easy, the loans to the franchisees has nothing to do with EC. It has nothing to do with EC at all. So the EC originations\u2026\nDavid MacGregor: I understand that. I I'll take it up with the off line, if that's okay. Returns, I wonder if you could quantify the extent of the returns in the quarter and the extent, I know they're treated as a contra revenue account. So the extent to which they were a headwind for Tools Group organic growth?\nAldo Pagliari: I don't think there was anything notable in the quarter in that regard. I mean, I - from our perspective, it was just a regular quarter in terms of the returns, which we tend to look at. So I mean, I think that our guys didn't necessarily flush a lot back into the system more than they do in any regular quarter, there's some back and forth. But that didn't affect things in this situation.\nNick Pinchuk: Our franchisees, we think, are in pretty good shape.\nDavid MacGregor: Well, I guess that was my next question is just, I mean...\nAldo Pagliari: No, I think the thing is some people might think franchisees are on hold or things like that, but that's not -- it's not really -- actually, there's a record for this all-time loan.\nDavid MacGregor: And could you clarify that for me, the record, what's the\u2026\nAldo Pagliari: Yes, it was the number of franchisees that are not paying, that are direct, they get to be on hold. For the record there...\nDavid MacGregor: In that combination\u2026\nNick Pinchuk: Parents came way down at the end of the quarter.\nDavid MacGregor: Okay. And then, I guess, overall, I wanted to ask about franchisee creditworthiness because this whole slowdown in mid-April came right after the regional kickoffs when you guys would have had a really high level of inventory, which makes it a little surprising to hear that you didn't see any kind of inflection in returns. But that being the case, how do you feel about credit worthiness overall right now?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, I \u2013 we think \u2013 actually, we think they're in pretty good shape. I mean, the sales off the van are, I think when you look at them from a year-over-year point of view and you look at them for this situation, they describe what I talked about in terms of shock accommodation. And as I said, they are pacing ahead of the Tools Group. So that's a pretty positive from a quantitative point of view. From a qualitative point of view when you talk to a broad group of them, you get \u2013 you kind of get some very positive feedback in terms of, of course, I'm the CEO. So maybe I do get feedback. But you hear experiences and when I'm in the garages, the garages seem to be working. Yeah, technicians dipped in the shock, but they came sort of pretty back, pretty quickly and the garages are humming, every garage I was at, the parking lot from garage was marked.\nDavid MacGregor: Do you think there's going to be any need for any route consolidation?\nNick Pinchuk: No, I don't think so. But you look at everything, David, but I don't think so. I don\u2019t think so.\nDavid MacGregor: Last question for me is just on the operating expenses. You had a little bit of a pullback here, a reaction. So I guess, congratulations on that. But I'm guessing a large measure of that may have been associated with the volume reductions. So I guess the question is, if we end up with W-shape recovery rather than the V shape that you seem to be assuming, what's the opportunity to take more out of the SG&A and the operating expense line going forward?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, look, I think first of all \u2013 first of all, I don't know what you call travel volume-related or not. I mean, I'm not sure it's so volume related, but you can travel and a lot of different things. And in other words, you have some reductions in this interim while you keep \u2013 while you do things, for example, you're not renting a hall or putting on a meal when you bring, you're not people together on a zoom situation. Now it's maybe not as effective, but the thing is you do work on that. So it's not all volume related. And I think I\u2019ve already said though, that we\u2019re determined to maintain our franchisees, maintain our brand, invest in new product and keep our team intact and I would suggest that we see that going forward because we believe we have great opportunities going forward. So my principal view \u2013 my principle approach to this is \u2013 our principal approach is to weather the storm, and I think we're doing that pretty good, given the levels of where we are and you look at the cash flows, I mean, the absolute numbers of the returns and then come out stronger because we're pretty sure we're going to have big opportunities. So if it's not an upward slope -- if it's not an upward slope, if it dips down some, we won't get shocked again. We'll get over it. It will come out stronger.\nDavid MacGregor: Just one last quick one, if I could. You mentioned that record low credit holds for franchisees. Is that due to an increase in franchisee attrition?\nNick Pinchuk: No, no.\nOperator: And we'll go on to our next question\u2026\nNick Pinchuk: We talk of percentage\u2026\nOperator: And next question will come from Bret Jordan of Jefferies.\nBret Jordan: Hey. Good morning, guys.\nNick Pinchuk: Hi, Bret.\nAldo Pagliari: Good morning.\nBret Jordan: A question on inventory, I guess. You commented that turns were down to 2.3 times to support critical industries. And I guess the longer-term trend has gone from north of 4% to north of 2%. Is there something structurally different in the working capital model? Or what you're committing to for the critical industry customers as far as holding inventory? And I guess, can you give us sort of an idea what kind of product profile this is that's building in the inventory?\nAldo Pagliari: Yes, Bret. Aldo. Certainly, we are continuously adding products that cater to the critical industry. There is unique requirements. Sometimes they're lower volumes, so it doesn't have the same level of addition as when a new product introduced to the Tools Group. But if you want to be a serious player in oil and gas and natural resources and aviation, there are certainly unique products that do not sell into the mechanic space that you have to have there. So we've been doing that as well. In addition, there's a lot of projects that we call kitting activity and that array in kitting activity, as an example, you might have 100 different items in the kit. As you stage it as you prepare for it, it requires higher levels of inventory as you prep and wait for other incoming items because not everything comes from a Snap-on facility. Oftentimes, the military or an aviation customer might like certain things that do not come from Snap-on, and they want that kitted in a rate with a tool storage cabinet that we might prepare for them, and we have a variety of different products that do that. And therefore, accommodating those requests forced us to expand both floor space and inventory when it comes to these things and we like that business.\nBret Jordan: Okay. Is there sort of a target turns number, I guess, ex-COVID, where the sales obviously evaporated, but is there a ballpark we should be shooting for as far as that number?\nAldo Pagliari: We think it could be better. We don't have an exact target that I'm going to delineate here today, but we think it could be better. I mean, obviously, the current situation puts a depressant on turnover tactics. But we've been getting a pretty good return on our inventory and in a low interest rate environment, we're more than willing to make investments in inventory, if we truly believe it will generate incremental sales.\nNick Pinchuk: We don't see inventory necessarily as an independent variable, but we like to see a return on it. If we get a return on it, we're happy.\nBret Jordan: Okay. And then one question, I guess, the franchise event that usually is held in August, I assume, is probably not as a live. Are you going to do anything sort of virtually? Or would there any be sales promotion to offset what would have been the get together?\nNick Pinchuk: Yes, we have an event. We're going to call live from the forge -- from the our IdeaForge here in Kenosha. And so we're going to go through a virtual event, trying to create the selling opportunity the ability to see new products and different -- in different forms like franchisees would get when they journey to places like Florida and went through the football field, so we'll have that. And so we won't have it in August, we'll have it coming up. We will happen in August, probably at the same time. But it's kind of geared at giving the franchisees a similar opportunity from a new product point of view. From a product ordering point of view, unfortunately, we won't be able to get as much of the training or the, I guess, the cultural bonding that occurs at the other franchisees. But we're going to have event that replaces it.\nBret Jordan: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nNick Pinchuk: Okay.\nOperator: And now we'll go to Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners.\nIvan Feinseth: All right. Thank you for taking my questions. How are you guys doing?\nNick Pinchuk: Safe.\nIvan Feinseth: The average age of the vehicles on the road have now touched to a record high of almost 12 years. Do you track that to see -- I mean, when vehicles age? Are you selling more tools or when new car sales are increasing, which would be down the average age?\nNick Pinchuk: We don't have a direct relationship to new car sales. It's the aging of the vehicles, and it's the changing of the vehicles that drives our requirements. We can be indirectly affected by a downturn. And what are they going to sell? $12 million this year, $11.5 million, which is a downturn. And the psychological impact on dealerships and the OEMs themselves can ripple through some of that project business or some of the willingness of the dealerships to embark on capital projects. But it isn't a direct relationship, where aging of the vehicles and the new technologies in the vehicles, our direct relationships, requiring technicians to deal with either more volume or newer types of systems where they have to have different tools.\nIvan Feinseth: And then one of the amazing things in the pandemic is that the CEO from Polaris said earlier in the week that they are experiencing unprecedented demand for off-road vehicles and motorcycles. I mean this has, shockingly, I guess, created -- sales are on fire for all kinds of like wave runners and ATVs and side-by-side and even motorcycles, and even though Harley had a tough quarter, I think they're going to turn and they'll see strength as well. How do you or franchisees penetrate the mechanics in that area? Also, in a number of those places, they have a shortage of mechanics.\nNick Pinchuk: Sure. I think there's been a shortage of mechanics in a lot of places for a long time. I think the deal is that they're graduating 77,000 a year from technical schools, and they need $105,000 a year by retirement. So there has been a shortage, and so we have to -- it's been for some time. So you try to get that. Our people are in \u2013 our franchisees are in some of those places. But these are the advantages we think we \u2013 the opportunities we think we have. We say there's 1.3 million technicians in the United States and we only call on 850,000 of them. And some of those are the places like the off-road vehicles, where we may not get to. And so we have an opportunity. We think coming out of this, we've got tremendous opportunities, particularly if you're saying that people turn to, instead of going to -- instead of maybe taking more collective transportation, turn to RVs and other things. We think this is good for us, and the fact that we're confident.\nIvan Feinseth: RV sales are on fire, ATV sales are on fire, everybody -- all kinds of personal transportation. Used car sales have been on fire. New car sales, the factories were shut down for a while because of the pandemic, but I'm sure that, that will pick up. So yes, I think people who are going to move away from cities, if they work at home then they don't have to be near cities, they can be anywhere, and then I think that will drive the need for personal transportation, cars, boats, ATVS, recreational type of stuff. So is there going to be a focus on developing specific tools for those types of vehicles? And then one last question, you have\u2026\nNick Pinchuk: That's right.\nIvan Feinseth: 53 specific tools for EVs. Can you give us some idea of what specific EV tool would be?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, a lot of them would be -- a great category would be, we call them insulating tools. You poke yourself -- you poke around underneath an electric car, you level up fry yourself. So we have -- these are tools, which specifically create insulation between the point of contact and the user. And so we have an array of those, which we think will be very efficacious in this situation. And so I think they're going to be used. And then we have other tools as well that deal with the specific mechanism under an electric vehicle car -- an electric vehicle. But we think -- you point out, you just point there's all these opportunities for us. Change is our friend, and we think change is coming in this situation.\nIvan Feinseth: I love it. Thanks again. Stay well.\nNick Pinchuk: Good to hear from you.\nIvan Feinseth: Good to talk with you. You too.\nNick Pinchuk: Take care.\nOperator: And now that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn things back to Sara Verbsky for any additional or closing comments.\nSara Verbsky: Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day.\nOperator: And with that, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's call. We'd like to thank you again for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Nick Pinchuk",
            "content": "Thanks, Sara. Before we get going, I want to thank the members of the Snap-on team. It's clear in this turbulence that they are among the special contributors who keep society intact when our days are dark. And in that essential challenge, we're prioritizing the health, safety and well-being of our associates, franchisees, customers and communities. Working from home, and when that's not possible, and there's a number of those instances, distancing using personal protective equipment, cleaning, deep and often staggering shifts and brakes, paying quick attention to symptoms and pursuing contact tracing. We worked hard to stay safe. But throughout this time, we're also invested in - investing in a continuing stream of essential new products. We've also invested in a continuing stream of essential new products, reinforced our brand and strive to maintain our team. The people of Snap-on are a great advantage. We're working hard to preserve them in the turbulence, and we'll continue to do so. For our franchisees we're active in helping, reaching out on a regular basis to understand their needs and those of their customers. When the virus passes, we know there'll be even more opportunities. We want our associates and our franchisees at full strength to capitalize on the possibilities. We now project that the virus plays out in three phases: First, the initial shock. A substantial interruption of activity at both the franchisee and the customer level. This was evident in late March and in April; second, a combination period. As operations and individuals develop more and more ways to safely pursue their opportunities against the COVID-19 environment. In fact, we appear to be seeing that effect through May, June and onward. And of course, we've actively participated in that process, broadcasting best practices, working hard to accelerate the comeback. Finally, the third phase, psychological recovery. Following a return to normal, customers will need to regain confidence in the future before they resume full buying participation. And in that recovery, we see great opportunities. As driving is restored becomes even more popular, even more essential. This overall construct represents what we consider to be the general shape of the way forward. It does represent a continuing upward trend, but the slope of the ascension isn't clear. And of course, the psychological recovery phase will be greatly influenced by the ongoing evolution of the virus. Nobody knows the future for sure, but we are encouraged by what we've seen so far. Looking back, April was the nacre. But as the quarter progressed, we showed continual recovery. Our businesses did learn to better accommodate the pandemic. Both sales and profitability improved sequentially in May and in June. Although the virus is still with us, it appears that the situation may be evolving just as we projected. As we said at the end of April, the impact of COVID-19 varies across our operating landscape. Asia remains virus challenged. Japan, South Korea and China do appear to have weather the worst, but Southeast Asia and India are still in deep turbulence. And in Europe, the overall economic weakness present before the pandemic in combination with the virus has made for the deepest distress of all. Beyond geographic differences, we're also seeing that our face-to-face businesses, the mobile vans and the direct sales forces are faring somewhat better compared with other models. Snap-on's traditional strength, personal selling appears to be an effective foundation for limiting the difficulty. In that way, we believe we have the resilience and resources to weather this challenge as Snap-on has so many times in the past. Actually, over the years, we've seen this movie before natural disaster, Superstorm Sandy, Hurricane, Harvey and Katrina and the Great Recession of 2009 and each time we learned to accommodate and emerge stronger and we've taken the lessons of those disruptions that apply them with positive effect to this time of the virus. I love to say this. Snap-on has paid a dividend every quarter since 1939 and it's never reduced it and this quarter was no different. That record stands as evidence of our ongoing resistance to challenge. And beyond just maintaining, we believe our continuing investment in new products and our franchisees and in our team in the midst of the storm will once again make us stronger as the environment recovers. We do believe in the opportunities going forward and because of that, we're keeping our focus on Snap-on value creation, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement. That emphasis is particularly evident in customer connection and innovation. We're continuing with a stream of new products. We believe the green shoots of accommodation and psychological recovery will grow and we're going to be ready. Well, that's the overview. Now let's turn to the results. Second quarter, as reported sales were $724.3 million, down 23.9%, including $14.4 million or a 120-basis-point impact from unfavorable foreign currency and an organic sales declined 22.9%. From an earnings perspective, OpCo OI for the quarter of $91.1 million, including $5.8 million of direct costs associated with the virus, $4 million of restructuring, principally focused on Europe and $3.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $189.9 million in 2019. Optical operating margin was 12.6% and the as-adjusted level, excluding restructuring charges, was 13.1%. For financial services, operating income of $57.6 million was down from last year's 60.6%. Overall, EPS on an as-reported basis was $1.85 compared to compared to $3.22 last year. Excluding the restructuring charges the as-adjusted EPS was $1.91. Well, those are the overall numbers. Now let's turn to the groups. In C&I, volume in the second quarter of $261.9 million including $6.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency, was down versus last year's $335 million, primarily on double-digit declines in all of the segment's operations, reflecting the effect of COVID-19 operations, and the ongoing economic weakness in Europe. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income of $22.9 million decreased $26 million, including $3 million of virus related of costs, $2 million of restructuring and $1.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects. There was a clear point of light in C&I. Our direct sales to customers in the critical industries, though still down was less effective than other areas across the group. Military and international aviation continue to register growth. And heavy truck, as you might expect was down, but was reasonably resilient while other segments such as oil and gas and education, no surprise. There were no students. Both those industries were significantly impacted by the pandemic and experienced substantial contraction. But we do remain confident in and committed to extending in the critical industries, and we do see growing opportunity there moving forward. Speaking in the future, let's talk about creating new products. Just this quarter, we introduced another one of our great 14.4 volt units. The new CTS 825 quarter inch Hex Hex Cordless screw driver. Our brushless powertrain makes for higher torque, more run time, longer motor life. The driver as a nine-position clutch giving text just a proper amount of torque for the job, all packaged with a dual range gearbox and a built-in break that prevent this power tool from throwing fasteners that's a significant safety feature. The new screw gun also features ergonomically designed cush grip handle for great tech comfort and twin lights, twin LED lights to clearly illuminate the work area. After only a couple of months, it's already essential where work is critical. It was launched in April, a tough month. But it's already one of our hit million dollar products, a significant success. C&I, navigating the turbulence of customer connection and innovation serving the essentials, now on to the Tools Group. Sales were $323.3 million in the quarter, reflecting a $79.2 million organic decline and $3.3 million of unfavorable foreign unfavorable foreign unfavorable foreign currency. The operating earnings were $38.4 million, including $1.9 million of virus-related costs, $1.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency and $600,000 of restructuring charges compared to $71.3 million recorded in 2019. The Tools Group was a clear demonstration both of the COVID trajectory across our business and of the strength and resilience of our direct face-to-face model. As the virus rose in late March and April, the network was shocked individually and collectively. The impact varied by region, but all geographies were affected. April was the deepest. However, moving from that point, our franchisees in collaboration with the Snap-on team file increasingly effective ways to accommodate the pandemic and pursue their support of the essential. And each subsequent month, the vans have shown significant gains. In fact, the Tools Group sales in June were down just 3.1%, up nicely after a tough start to the quarter. The ongoing accommodation, you hear from the field that the direct interface with our customers is dramatically highlighting the bun that Snap-on has always had with working men and women through thick and thin. And many franchisees report that the relationship forged to new and the pandemic have never been stronger. There's nothing like working together in difficulty, and we believe this bodes really well for our market position and for capturing future opportunities. So despite the virus, we're still quite positive about our business, and as a view clearly reflected outside Snap. And in fact, once again, this year, we're being recognized in the top 50 of entrepreneurs Magazine's annual best of the best franchisee -- franchises. The entrepreneur ranking rates 500 companies on cost, size, growth, franchise support, brand power, financial strength and organizational stability. And we again scored highest in the Tool Distribution category. That's a distinction we've held for quite some time. As we move forward, our associates and franchisees are clearly becoming more effective against the win, it's a continuing process born out of the Snap-on team working and developing action plans, sharing best practices for safe selling, supporting with tailored promotions and launching targeted promotions. This is a process that's been successful in hurricanes, recessions and the threats of 9/11, and it's working again. And of course, the effort includes also a healthy array of innovative new products to solve the critical. Everybody knows we have great ratchets. And guided by uninterrupted customer connection, we've been expanding that powerful line-up. Almost every quarter, and we did it again when we introduced the XFR704 12-point Flank Drive Double Flex Ratcheting Box Wrench Set. Now that's a mouthful. But this unit has a lot to offer. It combines 180-degree flexible head with our narrow width and low-height design, allowing work in the tightest of spaces. Our patented ratcheting gear utilizes Dual 80 technology, minimizing swing arc and making jobs in restricted areas even easier. And our unique Yoke/tang configuration provides the strongest and most durable flex head anywhere. The new four-piece set is built in our Elizabethton, Tennessee plant right here in USA. I was just there again, and I can testify. The Snap-on people in that plant are a special team turning out great product, and even in the current environment that technicians have noticed, driving the Flex to 704 on its way to be another $1 million product. Well, that's the Tools Group, accommodating the pandemic, furthering innovation and strengthening for the future. Now let's speak of RS&I. The RS&I group finished the quarter with $245 million in sales, including $4.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency, $2.3 million from recent acquisitions and that level compared to $348.9 million recorded last year. The lower volumes reflected a decline of over 30% and the activity associated with vehicle OEM projects and in the capital like spending relating to our undercar equipment operations, both areas that were deeply attenuated with the uncertainty. Sales of diagnostics and repair information products, independent shops were also negatively impacted, but to a lesser degree, garages continue to subscribe. And invest in meeting new repair challenges, people's need fixing even in a pandemic. RS&I operating earnings of $50.6 million decreased $38 million, including $1.4 million of European focused restructuring, $800,000 of unfavorable foreign currency and $700,000 of direct COVID costs. So while the overall group was impacted, information-based operations were not as effective and new products were a driver in that. Once again, we generated repair excitement with innovations like the latest enhancements to our Mitchell One prodemand repair information system, which in response to the needs of large national account customers now includes a range of vehicle lift points in its quick reference menu. The new pro menu links directly to vivid vehicle illustrations, which identify designated listing points as well as listing all the important manufacturer recommended safety procedures. You see technicians are in a hurry, sometimes fail to follow the correct lift procedures. Injuries and vehicle damage can follow. But those who have our pro demand system can now find the critical lift information only one click away from the home screen. It's a significant convenience and a clear safety enhancement. Also in the quarter, we launched our e-Technician 2.0 designed specifically for heavy-duty trucks. It's the most comprehensive and powerful diagnostic software in the market. It provides the data and the support required to stay competitive in today's trucking industries. Heavy-duty diagnosis were never this good. The e-technician 2.0 combines extensive coverage from everything from commercial vehicles to write-down to light and medium heavy-duty trucks, diagnostic capability for an expanded array of engines, transmissions, brakes, body and chassis systems and more. The new 2.0 also adds a cloud-based, fleet-wide vehicle history, giving users access to every diagnostic session for every vehicle in their fleet, regardless of location. Snap-on continues to show the way in truck repair and e-technician 2.0 is another step along that path. We're confident in the strength of our RS&I group. And we keep driving to expand its position with repair shop owners and managers, making work easier with great new products even in the days of the virus. Well, that's the second quarter, the Snap-on second quarter. Shack, moving to accommodation into what we believe will be psychological recovery, keeping our teams safe as we pursue the essential, applying the lessons of our experience, helping our customers, our franchisees and our team, whether the difficult days. And build the capability, whether those days and build the capability to operate in the virus environment, driving month-by-month improvement, engaging the power of our direct selling capabilities, being confident in our future opportunities now amplified by the virus, pursuing Snap-on value creation, all to not only weather the turbulence, but to emerge stronger and ready to take full advantage when the days are clear. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo for a detailed discussion of the financials. Thanks, Aldo. The Snap-on second quarter, sales were down. Of course, we don't like it. But - the OpCo margin was 12.6%, 13.1% as adjusted, approaching the mid-teen level that we long-held as an aspirational target. EPS of $1.91 as adjusted, also down but still higher than any quarter before the end of 2014. The numbers are decreased, but we believe they demonstrated significant resilience and perhaps the greatest withering of our time. You see we have seen this movie before. That -- and that experience helped guide us through the depth of the shock and on to the continuing positive trajectory of accommodation. April is dark. But the rise from that point was of evident across the corporation from operation to operation. The tools group demonstrating the value of our direct model with sales in June reaching within 3.1% of last year's level. The future is not known. What we believe our learning and accommodation assures that we won't get shocked again and any future impact will be attenuated. And looking at the way the virus has affected everyday life, we believe abundant opportunities emerging for Snap - are emerging for Snap-on in the recovery. It appears that vehicles are going to be even more important. You can see already in China and in the U.S. Northeast, and that's music to our ears. And we are preparing launching new products, enhancing our brand, reinforcing our franchise network and maintaining the capabilities of our team. Now all of this represents a cost in the turbulence, but it ensures that we'll be fully enabled and stronger when the opportunities arise. And we believe what we're doing in these days of the virus will position Snap-on for continuing growth, increasing profitability and ongoing prosperity for years to come. Before I turn the call over to the operator, I once again -- I'll once again speak to our Franchisees & Associates. It has never been clearer that all of you are extraordinary people, playing a very special role in our world. For your ongoing success in surviving the shock and accommodating the turbulence, you have my congratulations for your significant contributions in maintaining our society, you have my admiration. And for your unfailing belief in the future of our enterprise, you have my thanks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Good morning, Scott. Sure. Well, look, of course, we don't give guidance, but I'll tell you that's generally, of course, - what I say is never true everywhere in Snap-on, of course. But generally, we're seeing a combination across the vast majority of our operations, April, May, June, there was a progression of improvement through those periods. So don't get me wrong, the fact that I called out the Tools group, because they had done particularly well. There was a combination across every one of those groups. So, that's particularly in industrial, where - I called out the direct selling. They had some nice progression through that period in their direct selling activity. If you step back to -- and I think you would say across C&I, in general, you're seeing that. In RS&I, the sales were down, what were they down? Like 29.8% as reported, 29.5% or 29.4% as adjusted. But generally, you see a couple of pieces. One, the vehicle OEM projects are quite lumpy, and we see that in this period, and it's very hard to project that future and the equipment business, which generally is selling - after all selling to kind of a bifurcated situation they're selling to small businesses, which need psychological recovery to have the confidence to invest in the capital-light projects, which are our equipment. Now, the other piece of what I've just talked about is, there's a big dollop associated with the OEM and really that comes psychological view of the dealerships. Do they think the fact that maybe they're going to sell new cars - less new cars this year means they should pull in their horns, or as in other times, should they start investing, because they had need to depend more and more on used car and repair and parts flow? If it's the latter, there should be an uptick in those businesses. Yeah. Look, I was just out with some franchisees last week, and they seem pretty strong. I mean, and I talked to a lot of them on the phone these days since I can't travel as much as I used to around the country. And they seem all quite positive. I would say that the originations - one of the things I will tell you that I think speaks volumes is we talked about the recovery, the accommodation of the Tools Group as shown in the 3.1%. Well, I'll tell you that in the quarters through this period, the sales off the van could be viewed as our work better than our sales to the bands. So fundamentally, what you see a little bit in that origination situation is some of our franchisees selling out of their inventory, big-ticket items, particularly tool storage, which they tend to happen in and inventory to try to accommodate the taste of the technicians. And therefore, you see that, but we see it as a great thing. Because fundamentally, the sales off the van are outpacing. The sales of the Tools Group showed a combination. I didn't say anything. I said it was better than the 3.1. That's what I said. I said it was better than the -- I think -- and I said significantly better. But that's what I'm willing to say in this situation. It clearly is what leads to the originations. Hi, Gary. Oh, yes. Everything is open. It was -- there's a lot less variation now in terms of opening. When the virus hits, the shock hit, there was variations between regions. So the Northeast, you have a lot of people with attenuated activity, not as much say Southwest, as we're talking about the swap between, not as much, but still attenuation. Now they've kind of come together. Canada, I don't know if I talked on the call, but Canada was like the basket case for a while. People were really shocked and U.K. was shocked and all of those businesses have -- all of those areas have started to come together. There is some arithmetic difference between them, but not enough to shake a stick at, I think, in this situation. So the guys are coming back. Now that's happened through the quarter at varying levels, part of the accommodation process. Well, I think those are the two big things, I'm talking about. But I think as -- I think a couple of things. I think -- I would say three things. One, of course, cars are getting older. They've gotten older every year. And the fact that it's a lower SAAR this year, probably cars will accelerate in terms of getting older, we think. And so that's one thing and that does keep driving. Cars keep changing and so the virus is kind of frozen people in. And so we expect to see a few slot of new technologies closed now, and then that drives our situation. Secondly, I think you and I don't want to get on the L to go down in Chicago. I don't think people are going to want to jump on a subway so much anymore and -- or at least depend on that. And so what we see in China, and we start to see that in the Northeast has increased driving, because people don't want to depend on collective transportation, because they know that things can go wrong in the situation. On top of which, if you read commercial real estate and cities are going down and I think residential real estate, I think people are moving out for the suburbs, and that means more driving. And finally, we think that this kind of pause gives more time for new technologies like advanced driver assistance systems, which change a lot of things and play right into our more complicated product and maybe even more electric vehicles, which changes the car park and helps us sell more tools. We have a kit that we've especially made, 53 tools just for electric vehicles. So when they roll out, we'll be ready to roll with them. We don't give guidance. And look, Q3 is a squarely quarter. However, so therefore, you've got vacations in Europe. You got the SFC, you got a lot of things floating through there. However, I did say, May, June onwards, that's about what I'm willing to say. Sure. Material. I mean it's \u2013 but look, I don't want to get overheated on these kinds of things. Everybody \u2013 I said already that nobody knows how the future is going to go. But what I did say is we are stronger against this kind of disruption by virtue of the accommodation, and we don't believe we will get shocked again. So if the world rises, maybe we bow it a little bit more. I \u2013 we expect \u2013 we're saying we saw that onward motion, And I think implicit, and accommodation is we get better and better at dealing with the environment. The shape of the curve is unclear. And I've already said the third quarter is. But we \u2013 like I said also, I like what I see. Well, we have had restructuring because it was in \u2013 it's mostly focused on Europe. I think six-tenth of this times $4 million is kind of in North America and the two, or not necessarily. It's kind of European focused, we'd say, mostly in general. We'd say that because while we saw \u2013 we've been watching Europe evolved for a while and seeing the weakness of the economics. So we've been prepared for this and raising through RCI or capacity. So we can deal with higher volumes with less in Europe. That's why we have this restructuring. I would say this only. There's a lot, I think, implicit, and we saying we are investing in products, enhancing our brand and maintaining our team. That means we're holding the people because we actually believe that our people are capable. And I don't know about other people, but we think these people are hard to duplicate. So we're holding on to them for dear life. Look... I'll just say this, Chris. I feel better now than I did in the prior call in April. I feel better now. And I'll let Aldo comment. Hi, David. Our franchisees, we think, are in pretty good shape. Parents came way down at the end of the quarter. Well, I \u2013 we think \u2013 actually, we think they're in pretty good shape. I mean, the sales off the van are, I think when you look at them from a year-over-year point of view and you look at them for this situation, they describe what I talked about in terms of shock accommodation. And as I said, they are pacing ahead of the Tools Group. So that's a pretty positive from a quantitative point of view. From a qualitative point of view when you talk to a broad group of them, you get \u2013 you kind of get some very positive feedback in terms of, of course, I'm the CEO. So maybe I do get feedback. But you hear experiences and when I'm in the garages, the garages seem to be working. Yeah, technicians dipped in the shock, but they came sort of pretty back, pretty quickly and the garages are humming, every garage I was at, the parking lot from garage was marked. No, I don't think so. But you look at everything, David, but I don't think so. I don't think so. Well, look, I think first of all \u2013 first of all, I don't know what you call travel volume-related or not. I mean, I'm not sure it's so volume related, but you can travel and a lot of different things. And in other words, you have some reductions in this interim while you keep \u2013 while you do things, for example, you're not renting a hall or putting on a meal when you bring, you're not people together on a zoom situation. Now it's maybe not as effective, but the thing is you do work on that. So it's not all volume related. And I think I've already said though, that we're determined to maintain our franchisees, maintain our brand, invest in new product and keep our team intact and I would suggest that we see that going forward because we believe we have great opportunities going forward. So my principal view \u2013 my principle approach to this is \u2013 our principal approach is to weather the storm, and I think we're doing that pretty good, given the levels of where we are and you look at the cash flows, I mean, the absolute numbers of the returns and then come out stronger because we're pretty sure we're going to have big opportunities. So if it's not an upward slope -- if it's not an upward slope, if it dips down some, we won't get shocked again. We'll get over it. It will come out stronger. No, no. We talk of percentage... Hi, Bret. We don't see inventory necessarily as an independent variable, but we like to see a return on it. If we get a return on it, we're happy. Yes, we have an event. We're going to call live from the forge -- from the our IdeaForge here in Kenosha. And so we're going to go through a virtual event, trying to create the selling opportunity the ability to see new products and different -- in different forms like franchisees would get when they journey to places like Florida and went through the football field, so we'll have that. And so we won't have it in August, we'll have it coming up. We will happen in August, probably at the same time. But it's kind of geared at giving the franchisees a similar opportunity from a new product point of view. From a product ordering point of view, unfortunately, we won't be able to get as much of the training or the, I guess, the cultural bonding that occurs at the other franchisees. But we're going to have event that replaces it. Okay. Safe. We don't have a direct relationship to new car sales. It's the aging of the vehicles, and it's the changing of the vehicles that drives our requirements. We can be indirectly affected by a downturn. And what are they going to sell? $12 million this year, $11.5 million, which is a downturn. And the psychological impact on dealerships and the OEMs themselves can ripple through some of that project business or some of the willingness of the dealerships to embark on capital projects. But it isn't a direct relationship, where aging of the vehicles and the new technologies in the vehicles, our direct relationships, requiring technicians to deal with either more volume or newer types of systems where they have to have different tools. Sure. I think there's been a shortage of mechanics in a lot of places for a long time. I think the deal is that they're graduating 77,000 a year from technical schools, and they need $105,000 a year by retirement. So there has been a shortage, and so we have to -- it's been for some time. So you try to get that. Our people are in \u2013 our franchisees are in some of those places. But these are the advantages we think we \u2013 the opportunities we think we have. We say there's 1.3 million technicians in the United States and we only call on 850,000 of them. And some of those are the places like the off-road vehicles, where we may not get to. And so we have an opportunity. We think coming out of this, we've got tremendous opportunities, particularly if you're saying that people turn to, instead of going to -- instead of maybe taking more collective transportation, turn to RVs and other things. We think this is good for us, and the fact that we're confident. That's right. Well, a lot of them would be -- a great category would be, we call them insulating tools. You poke yourself -- you poke around underneath an electric car, you level up fry yourself. So we have -- these are tools, which specifically create insulation between the point of contact and the user. And so we have an array of those, which we think will be very efficacious in this situation. And so I think they're going to be used. And then we have other tools as well that deal with the specific mechanism under an electric vehicle car -- an electric vehicle. But we think -- you point out, you just point there's all these opportunities for us. Change is our friend, and we think change is coming in this situation. Good to hear from you. Take care."

            "content": "Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on slide six. Net sales of $724.3 million in the quarter compared to $951.3 million last year, reflecting a 22.9% organic sales decline, $14.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation and $2.3 million of acquisition-related sales. The organic sales decrease primarily reflected the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with sales declines in all three operating segments. In the quarter, while there was some variability from location to location, the declines in Europe were more pronounced. As anticipated, with government measures in place throughout the world, sales in the month of April were heavily impacted and were down significantly on a year-over-year basis. As locations began to reopen and as our operations and those of our franchisees adjusted to the virus environment, which included accommodations for various government-imposed restrictions, we began to see sequential improvements in activity as we move through May and June. Similar to last quarter, we accrued for restructuring costs associated with certain of our European-based operations. During the second quarter, we recorded $4 million of such cost which were reflected in each of our operating segments. Additionally in the quarter, we've identified $5.8 million of direct costs associated with COVID 19. These costs include direct labor and under-absorption associated with temporary factory closures, wages for quarantine associates, event cancellation fees as well as other costs to accommodate the current enhanced health and safety environment. Consolidated gross margin of 47.1% compared to 49.8% last year. The 270 basis point decrease primarily reflects the impact of the lower volumes, including costs to maintain manufacturing capacity and worker skill sets, 40 basis points of direct cost associated with COVID-19 and 30 basis points of restructuring costs. The decreases were partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives. The operating expense margin of 34.5% increased 470 basis points from 29.8% last year. This increase primarily reflects the impact of lower sales as well as 40 basis points of direct COVID-19 related costs and 20 basis points from restructuring actions. These items were partially offset by savings from cost containment actions in response to the lower volume. Operating earnings before financial services of $91.1 million, including $5.8 million of direct costs associated with COVID-19, $4 million of restructuring costs and $3.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $189.9 million in 2019. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 12.6% compared to 20% last year. Excluding the restructuring charges, operating earnings before financial services of $95.1 million or 13.1% of sales, decreased 49.9% from 2019 levels. Financial services revenue of $84.6 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared to $84.1 million last year, while operating earnings of $57. 6 million compared to $60.6 million in 2019, primarily reflecting a $3 million increase in provisions for credit losses. Consolidated operating earnings of $148.7 million, including $5.8 million of direct COVID related costs, $4 million of restructuring charges and $4.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $250.5 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 18.4% compares to 24.2% last year. On an adjusted basis, excluding restructuring, operating earnings of $152.7 million or 18.9% of revenues decreased 39% from 2019 levels. Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 24.1%, including a 20 basis point increase from the restructuring charges compared to 23.6% for the second quarter of last year. Finally, net earnings of $101.2 million or $1.85 per share, including a $0.06 charge for restructuring compared to $180.4 million or $3.22 per share a year ago. Excluding the restructuring charges, net earnings as adjusted were $104.5 million or $1.91 per share. Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I group on slide seven. Sales of $261.9 million compared to $335 million last year, reflecting a 20.22% organic sales decline and a $6.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic decrease includes mid-teen declines in both sales to customers in critical industries and in the power tools operation. Across the critical industries, gains in sales to various government-related agencies were more than offset by declines in natural resources, including oil and gas, as well as the lower technical education sales with the latter being impacted by school and campus closures. Gross margin of 34.4% decreased 420 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of decreased sales, including lower utilization of manufacturing capacity, as well as 80 basis points from $2 million of restructuring charges, 70 basis points of direct costs associated with COVID-19 and 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. These decreases were partially offset by material cost savings and benefits from the company's RCI initiatives. The operating expense margin of 25.7% increased 170 basis points from 24% last year, primarily due to the lower sales and 50 basis points of direct COVID-19 related costs. These items were partially offset by savings from cost containment efforts. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $22.9 million, including $3 million of direct COVID-19 related cost, $2 million of restructuring charges and $1.9 million of unfavorable foreign currencies effects compared to $48.9 million last year. The operating margin of 8.7%, including the 80 basis point charge for restructuring compared to 14.6% a year ago. Turning now to slide eight. Sales in the Snap-on Tools group of $323.3 million compared to $405.8 million in 2019, reflecting a 19.7% organic sales decline and $3.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales decrease reflects a mid-teen decline in our US franchise operations and a nearly 40% decline in the segment's international operations. As Nick mentioned, sales in our direct customer-facing businesses like the Snap-on Tools had the most dramatic year-over-year decreases in April, with notable sequential improvements in activity in May and June. Gross margin of 41.7% declined 340 basis points, primarily due to the impact of lower sales volumes, including cost to maintain manufacturing capacity as well as 30 basis points of direct costs associated with COVID-19, and there were 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. The operating expense margin of 29.8% increased from 27.5% last year, primarily due to the impact of the lower sales, 30 basis points of direct COVID-19 related costs and 20 basis points from $600,000 of restructuring charges. These costs were partially offset by savings from cost containment actions. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools group of $38.4 million, including $1.9 million of direct COVID-19 related costs, $1.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and $600,000 of restructuring charges compared to $71.3 million last year. The operating margin of 11.9% compared to 17.6% a year ago. Turning to the RS&I group shown on slide nine. Sales of $245 million compared to $348.9 million a year ago, reflecting a 29.5% organic sales decline and $4.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by $2.3 million of acquisition-related sales. The organic sales decline includes a mid-teens decrease in sales of diagnostic and information products to independent repair shop owners and managers as well as declines of over 30% in both sales of undercar equipment and sales to OEM dealerships. The lower sales of undercar equipment includes significantly lower sales of collision repair products, while lower sales to OEM dealerships largely reflect decreases in OEM facilitation projects. Gross margin of 47.4% improved 110 basis points from 46.3% last year primarily due to the impact of reduced sales and lower gross margin businesses and savings from RCI activities. The operating expense margin of 26.7% increased from 20.9% last year, primarily due to the lower sales and 50 basis points from $1.4 million of restructuring charges partially offset by savings from RCI and other cost containment actions. Operating earnings for the RS& I group of $50.6 million, including $1.4 million of restructuring charges, $700,000 of direct COVID-19 related costs and $800,000 of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $88.6 million last year. The operating margin of 20.7% compared to 25.4% a year ago. Now turning to slide 10. Revenue from financial services of $84.6 million compared to $84.1 million last year. Financial services operating earnings of $57.6 million compared to $60.6 million in 2019. Financial services expenses of $27 million increased $3.5 million from last year's levels, primarily due to $3 million of higher provisions for credit losses as compared to 2019. The second quarter of 2019 included lower provisions as a result of non-recurring favorable loss experience at that time. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1.3% and 1.1% in the second quarters of 2020 and 2019 respectively. The average yield on finance receivables was 17.6% in the second quarters of both 2020 and 2019. The respective average yield on contract receivables was 8.2% and 9.1%. The lower yield on contract receivables in the second quarter of 2020 primarily reflects the impact of approximately $20 million of lower interest business operation support loans for our franchisees. These loans were offered during the second quarter to help accommodate franchisee operations and dealing with the COVID-19 environment. Total loan originations of $255.8 million decreased $7.6 million or 2. 9% and included an 8.5% decrease in originations of finance receivables. This decline in finance receivables was partially offset by a 26.1% increase in originations of contract receivables resulting from the business operations support loans offered to franchisees mentioned earlier. Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our U.S. operation. Our worldwide gross financial services portfolio increased $54.3 million in the second quarter. Collections of finance receivables in the quarter of $166.8 million compared to collections of $191.6 million during the second quarter of 2019. This year's quarter reflected the greater use of deferred payment plan sales programs and short-term payment relief or forbearance to some of our franchisees qualifying customers. Similar to the trends elsewhere in our business, we saw the greatest number of requests for payment relief on extended credit or finance receivables in April. This lessened in May, and as of the end of June, forbearance was granted for approximately 2.5% of the portfolio. Historically, those accounts having forbearance terms are below 1% of the finance receivable portfolio. Trailing 12-month net losses on extended credit or finance receivables of $50.4 million represented 2.93% of outstandings at quarter end, down six basis points sequentially. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1% for U.S. extended credit is down 40 basis points from a year ago. This improvement primarily reflects the aforementioned programs, which took place during the quarter as well as the effective credit and collection practices executed by Snap-on and our franchisees throughout this period. Total charge-offs within the quarter totaled $15.1 million as compared to $14.9 million during the second quarter of 2019. Now, turning to slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $253.6 million in the quarter increased $108.1 million from comparable 2019 levels, primarily reflecting net changes in operating assets and liabilities, including $61.5 million in lower tax payments, $75.7 million in decreases in working investment, partially offset by lower net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $45.6 million included net additions to finance receivables of $35 million and capital expenditures of $11.8 million. In the quarter, our total free cash flow or cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures in the net change in finance receivables was $206.8 million. This reflected an improvement of $118.3 million from last year and represented 195% of net earnings. Net cash provided by financing activities of $289.5 million included the proceeds from the April sale of $500 million of 30-year senior notes, partially offset by $148.1 million of repayments of notes payable and other short-term borrowings and cash dividends of $58.7 million. While there were no repurchases of common stock under our existing share repurchase programs during the quarter. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $334.4 million of common stock under existing authorizations. Turning to slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivables decreased $131.1 million from 2019 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 59 days compared to 67 days at 2019 year-end. This reflected a reduction in days outstanding across all of our operating segments. Inventories increased $23.6 million from 2019 year-end, primarily to support the critical industries. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.3 compared to 2.6 at year-end 2019. Our quarter end cash position of $686.2 million compared to $184.5 million at year-end 2019. Our net debt to capital ratio of 17.9% compared to 22.1% at year-end 2019. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million in available credit facilities. As of quarter end, there were no outstanding amounts under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Despite the uncertainty in the current environment, we believe we have sufficient available cash and access to both committed and uncommitted credit facilities to cover expected funding needs in both the near-term and a long-term basis. That concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few updated outlook items. Given the improving trends experienced in the second quarter in the near-term, we believe there will be continued sequential improvements reflecting increasing levels of accommodations to the virus-related environment. However, we cannot provide assurance on the rate of progress due to the uncertain and evolving nature and duration of the pandemic. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in a range of $75 million to $85 million as compared to our prior estimate of $70 million to $80 million. Additionally, we continue to anticipate that our full year 2020 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 23% to 25%. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Yes. Chris, I'd just say that just to refresh everyone's memory, Q2 typically does see seasonal improvement as you progress from Q1. It's a period of time when people get their tax refunds, and obviously, we probably got a little bit of a bump up with stimulus checks coming in. But a reminder, not everybody got their tax refund yet because if you didn't submit your tax return electronically, you're still probably have it being reviewed the IRS. So there might be some tailwind that still occurs in Q3 from tax refunds. Having said that, the deferred payment programs forbearance they help a bit with the calculation, so if you look at the progress from Q1 to Q2, normally, we expect a 10 to 20 basis point sequential improvement. This time, we saw 70 and year-over-year, it was better by 40. I'd say, if you look year-over-year, there's probably 20, 30 basis points associated with the fact that you have deferred programs. So by definition customers on deferral couldn't be delinquent. So that will go away a bit. So I think you'll get more traditional levels. But geez, it looks a lot like a natural disaster from our history in the rearview mirror so far. So we'll see how the remainder plays out. It's still a pretty volatile environment. But like I said, we're pleased with the charge-offs in the quarter. Well, the contract receivables were up 26% in the quarter. So that's clearly broken out, if at contract receivables. So as Nick has mentioned, EEC was down 8.5%, David. To make it easy, the loans to the franchisees has nothing to do with EC. It has nothing to do with EC at all. So the EC originations... I don't think there was anything notable in the quarter in that regard. I mean, I - from our perspective, it was just a regular quarter in terms of the returns, which we tend to look at. So I mean, I think that our guys didn't necessarily flush a lot back into the system more than they do in any regular quarter, there's some back and forth. But that didn't affect things in this situation. No, I think the thing is some people might think franchisees are on hold or things like that, but that's not -- it's not really -- actually, there's a record for this all-time loan. Yes, it was the number of franchisees that are not paying, that are direct, they get to be on hold. For the record there... Good morning. Yes, Bret. Aldo. Certainly, we are continuously adding products that cater to the critical industry. There is unique requirements. Sometimes they're lower volumes, so it doesn't have the same level of addition as when a new product introduced to the Tools Group. But if you want to be a serious player in oil and gas and natural resources and aviation, there are certainly unique products that do not sell into the mechanic space that you have to have there. So we've been doing that as well. In addition, there's a lot of projects that we call kitting activity and that array in kitting activity, as an example, you might have 100 different items in the kit. As you stage it as you prepare for it, it requires higher levels of inventory as you prep and wait for other incoming items because not everything comes from a Snap-on facility. Oftentimes, the military or an aviation customer might like certain things that do not come from Snap-on, and they want that kitted in a rate with a tool storage cabinet that we might prepare for them, and we have a variety of different products that do that. And therefore, accommodating those requests forced us to expand both floor space and inventory when it comes to these things and we like that business. We think it could be better. We don't have an exact target that I'm going to delineate here today, but we think it could be better. I mean, obviously, the current situation puts a depressant on turnover tactics. But we've been getting a pretty good return on our inventory and in a low interest rate environment, we're more than willing to make investments in inventory, if we truly believe it will generate incremental sales."

Well, as some say, these are interesting times. There's considerable turbulence in business and all across the everyday landscape. But I believe we can be confident that Snap-on will navigate through it all and come out stronger than when it all started, just as we have done in the past. Before we get going, I think it's appropriate for all of you listening in, the investors, associates, franchisees, customers, retirees and analysts. You have our best wishes that you and your families weather these times safely and without harm.  Now, let's speak of Snap-on. Firstly, we're keeping our team safe. Snap-on people are working from home and where that's not possible and there are a number of these instances we're proceeding using government prescribed guide lines in the United States those put forward by the Centre for Disease Control the CDC, physical distancing, the use of personal protection equipment, cleaning of facilities deep and often, staggered shifts and break, and quick attention to those who have symptoms.  For our franchisees, we're active in helping, providing a playbook for staying safe. The people of the Snap-on team are a great advantage, working hard to preserve them and as we move through this difficulty. Having said that, it's clear our operations are essential. Snap-on plays an important role in the underpinning of our society supporting vital activities, like the military, transportation infrastructure, our critical vehicle repair, the areas we all depend on for emergency services, for food delivery, for distribution of medical supplies, and for a variety of essential needs. Government bodies, including the US Department of Homeland Security and multiple states have deemed it so.  And there have been clear examples that critical role from the United States to Italy, to the UK. And as such, our factories and distribution centers have pretty much remained active doing their part, keeping the world going. Consistent with that, our sourcing teams have been able to maintain our supply chain supporting both our factories and our kitting centers. Overwhelmingly, our sourcing partners have recognized the criticality of our needs, and have remained active to provide support. Now in this arena, particularly in the US, we do have an advantage because we make in the markets where we sell. Our supply chain is fine.  As you might expect, the impact of the virus varies across our operating landscape. Asia in general, and China in particular has seen the impact for some time, but now, particularly in China, it's showing some rays of light, restaurants are opening and people are driving in mass. Europe has seen weak economics for several quarters, and COVID-19 has made it worse, pretty much all over. It's a region that seems particularly hard hit. Of course, there's a lot being written about the United States, we do see a mix. There are points of light, primarily in the middle of the country, where franchisees have set personal positive records. And there are places particularly in the northeast where activity has been significantly restricted. And there are locations not that many at this point where we've seen green shoots of recovery.  If you view the world by business segment, most seem quite impacted. Oil and gas, of course, education and vehicle OEM projects, but there are other places like the military, like general industry and like trucking that appear more positive. Regardless of the current landscape, we believe we have the resilience and the strength to navigate the downturn, as Snap-on has done so many times before. The fact that since 1939, over all those years encountering several periods of significant challenge, Snap-on has paid a dividend every quarter and it's never reduced it. That record stands as evidence of a resilience.  So in that regard, we believe our longer term prospects have not been impacted, or the timelines are uncertain. We are confident on a positive outcome to this inner loop. You can see it in the last recession in 2009. Remember how uncertain it was? Bad news for breakfast, people thinking about putting their money in the mattresses, the idea of more deep wall seeming okay without stigma. Well, if you look at Snap-on's record during that weathering, we navigated the turbulence and came out stronger.  We believe that reflects the essential nature of our business, the strength of our position in that business and the experience and capability of our team. That wasn't our first rodeo. And neither is this. Because we believe in that recovery, we're keeping up with the elements of Snap-on value creation, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement. It's particularly evident in customer connection and innovation. Even in the turbulence, we're continuing with the stream of new products, the green shoots will grow, and we're going to be ready. Well, that's the overview.  Let me turn to the results. First Quarter as reported sales were 852.2 million down 7.5%, including a 10.3 million or 100 basis point impact from unfavorable foreign currency. Organic sales declined 6.9%, reflecting the ongoing weakness in Europe and the impact of the global economic uncertainty associated with COVID-19.  From an earnings perspective, Opco OI for the quarter of 138.9 million including 7.5 million of restructuring charges principally focused on Europe and 3.3 million of unfavorable currency effect was 48.5 million lower than 2019, which included $11.6 million benefit from the settlement of patent related litigation matters and that's a mouthful. But the 2020 as adjusted Opco OI of 146.4 million excluding restructuring was down 16.7% from last year's as adjusted level.  And if you consider the sequential impact of the turbulence caused by the pandemic, the first quarter sales of 852 million were down organically from the fourth quarter of 2019 by 10.5%, while the periods as adjusted OI of 146.4 million was down 14.6%. Regarding Opco's OI margin, the as adjusted 17.2% recorded in the first quarter compared with the as adjusted 19.1% and the 17.9% registered in the prior year and in the prior quarter respectively.  For financial services operating income of 56.9 million was down from last year's 62.1 million, including a $2.6 million higher credit reserve as a result of the economic uncertainty associated with the virus. Overall EPS on an as reported basis was $2. 49 and it compared to $3.16 last year. The as adjusted EPS was $2.60 and that compared with last year $3.01, down 13.5%.  Now let's move to the groups. C&I saw mixed progress to the end of February attenuated by significant declines in March, volume in the first quarter of 299.9 million including 5.3 million unfavorable foreign currency translation was down versus last year's 322.5 million, primarily on double digit declines in Asia Pacific and in Europe, reflecting the longer impact of the virus in Asia and the ongoing economic weakness in Europe combined with the later period effects of COVID-19. From an earnings perspective C&I operating income of 31.5 million decreased 15 million from 2019, including 4.4 million of restructuring and 1.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Now critical industries did show variation with relatively favorable performance in the military, trucking fleet and general industry. You can see the essential nature of those areas in our activities, as we supported the production and the maintenance of the F-35 fighter and as our critical tools helped keep the London ambulances on the road.  That positive activity was offset by weakness in natural resources, education and aerospace as some of our commercial customers struggled to respond to the pandemic and the resulting lower oil prices and technical school shutdowns and reduced flight and generally lower capital spending. Overall, however, the critical industries reflecting in part the essential nature of those tests were flat in the turbulence. We do remain confident in and committed to extending in the critical industry. So as a matter of fact, we're continuing to strengthen our product line enhancing our position even in the attenuated environment.  A great example just introduced this quarter from the power tools division is the new CT9100 three quarter inch cordless impact wrench equipped with the market leading combination of power and durability. The three quarter inch drive Anvil makes the unit great for essential tasks for big industrial applications, for power generation, for heavy duty fleets and for the military, where fastener sizes are larger, torque values are higher and reliability and consistent performances are pretty critical.  With its five amp hour lithium battery to CT9100 provides the 1000 pounds feet of bolting and 1300 pound feet of breakaway torque. That's real power and beyond the strength the tool has considerable versatility, three torque settings in forward and three in reverse optimizing performance for a wide range of applications, and it has a built in break, preventing the pot that powerful wrench from throwing fasteners or sockets around when you use it. That's a significant safety feature.  The tool is built in our Murphy, North Carolina plant, and it uses best in class components for superior toughness of substantial strength and long service life. The new impact was just released in February and in a limited distribution but it's already on track to become a hit $1 million product. It's been quite well received C&I, navigating the turbulence with customer connection, and innovation serving the essential.  Now onto the tools group, sales were 375.9 million in the quarter reflecting $31.8 million organic decline and 2.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The progress we saw in the US van channel early in the quarter was erased, and the continuing weakness of the international operation was amplified by the virus as the virus spread more widely. The operating earnings of 48.6 million including 1.4 of unfavorable foreign currency compared to 67.2 million in 2019.  One advantage, we believe our franchisees entered the difficulties with a strong underlying position and that base will come in handy during the immediate future. And as I said before van activity is mixed. There are points of light. We saw great record setting franchisee performance in Iowa, even in New York some have adjusted well turning in strong results, but there are places where the network is attenuated. The vans aren't seeing variation, but we have considerable confidence in their ability to adjust and return to full strength.  We've done it before in disasters like Superstorm Sandy and Hurricanes, Maria and Harvey, and the tools team is working again in this difficulty with focus to make sure our franchisees weather the storm and emerge with advantage. We're supporting the franchisees with tailored programs, targeted promotions and with again great new product, products like the new line of quarter inch drive Stubby Ratchets, boasting the shortest length on the market, the fixed head at two and a half inches and the flex set at three and a quarter inches, both offer improved accessibility and constraint spaces like over a quarter inch drive ratchets.  The new Stubby's include Dual 80 technology for convenient ratcheting arc five degrees and for more power and less lateral space. These have sealed heads which ensure long tool life and a screw style joint design that enables very easy repair all while maximizing strength. The new ratchets, they were launched regionally again in March and initial sales were nearly a million dollars, a significant success for a hand tool in a regional introduction, especially in the storm.  Now, let's talk about tool storage. Holding its own in the face of the pandemic, helped in part by the hundredth anniversary limited edition epic Roll Cab with the centennial themed panels and medallions, the 68 inch epic with the LED lighted power tool top features a gunmetal clear coat paint scheme and new brush red trim color, darker and richer than our standard. At first time color combination highlights our continued innovation and emphasizes our capacity to expand color choices for Cab and it captures the attention of technicians who want to declare they are a very special professional. Only 1920, were founded in 1920, only 1920 were built. In the numbered medallions will showcase each boxes place in Snap-on's history. Reception was strong, the buck sold out. Well that's the tools group navigating the challenges underpinned by strong product.  Now speaking of RS&I, the RS&I group finished the quarter at 314.6 million in sales compared to 327.9 million last year, reflecting at 12.9 million organic sales decrease. The growth through February showing an improvement in all businesses with the exception of our automotive OEM facing operation was overcome by slippage in March. Deeper decreases in the OEM area and end of quarter weakness in - end of quarter weaker volume in under car equipment for both automotive dealerships and independent repair shops. RS&I operating earnings of 77.3 million decreased 6.3 million including 3.1 million of European focused restructuring.  Operating margin was 24.6% including 100 basis points from the restructuring and compared to the 25.5% recorded last year. Excluding restructuring the OI margin was 25.6% up 10 basis points for RS&I despite the pandemic. Now the overall growth was impacted by continuing weakness in OEM programs and equipment volumes. Our diagnostics and repair information businesses did advance in the quarter and we're working to keep that momentum going with innovative new products and features attractions like our recently introduced interactive truck wiring diagrams. It's an enhancement to the Mitchell 1 heavy duty repair information system.  Now, just like the light vehicles technicians with the Mitchell 1 system can click on any picture component in a truck retrieving - when looked at a wiring diagram, it can retrieve a pop-up menu with specifications, physical locations, connector views and guided component tests. The new productivity enhancing truck wiring diagrams were introduced in late February. It was at a press conference, attended by the industry's top publications and reception was great. It's one of the reasons why Mitchell 1 kept growing in the quarter.  Also, during February we launched our new SOLUS Legend diagnostic scan tool. It's quick, a 10 second boot up and the ability to display scan results in as little as 30 seconds. It also offers a best in class eight inch touch screen color display, and it combines a full diagnostic capability. It combines full diagnostic capabilities for both standard vehicles and for motorcycles into one platform. That's a very popular feature. The new handheld also provides access to our sure track vehicle specific real fixes, repair tips, and commonly replaced parts all derived from operation Primary database of 1.3 billion repair actions. SOLUS Legend has the look of a very successful addition to our lineup.  We're confident in the strength of the RS&I product line we keep driving to expand its position with a repair shop owners and managers making work easier with great new products even in the days of the virus. Well, that's a Snap-on first quarter. Some momentum in the beginning checked by the virus, making sure our team is safe, maintaining our operations, they're essential to society, navigating the mixed effects of the virus across our geographies and industries, knowing we can weather the difficulties, not knowing the exact timeline but confident that our position is positive going forward and keeping our companies strong, Snap-on value creation and a continuing string of new products.  Now turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?\nAldo Pagliari : Thanks Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $852.2 million in the quarter compared to $921.7 million last year, reflecting a 6.9% organic sales decline, $10.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation and $3.5 million of acquisition related sales. The organic sales decrease this quarter primarily reflected the impact of economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, with sales declines and all three operating segments and across most geographies.  Through the month of February, with the exception of Asia Pacific and certain European geographies, sales were up on a year-over-year basis, as the effects of COVID-19 spread across Europe and the United States in March and as further government actions were put in place, demand slowed and access to some customers was interrupted, resulting in the lower year-over-year sales for the quarter.  During the quarter as a result of the continued economic slowdown in Europe as well as effects of COVID-19, we recorded $7.5 million of restructuring costs for actions primarily associated with our European operations. These costs were recorded in both the commercial industrial group and the repair systems and information group.  Consolidated gross margin of 49.5% compared to 51.2% last year, which is one of the highest quarterly gross margins reported in Snap-on's recent history. The 170 basis points decrease primarily reflect 60 basis points from restructuring costs, the impact of lower volumes, cost associated with COVID-19 related operating disruptions and 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.  The decrease was partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives. Despite the cost of restructurings and the impact of COVID-19 the first quarter, the gross margin rate of 49.5% improved sequentially from 47.2% in the fourth quarter of 2019.  The operating expenses margin of 33.2% increased 230 basis points from 30.9% last year. The first quarter of 2019 included $11.6 million or 120 basis point benefit associated with the legal settlement Nick mentioned earlier. The remaining increase primarily reflects the impact of lower sales volumes, 30 basis points from restructuring actions and 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.  Operating earnings before financial services of $138.9 million, including 7.5 million of restructuring cost and 3.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $187.4 million in 2019, which included the $11.6 million legal settlement. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 16.3% compared to 20.3% last year. On an adjusted basis for both years, excluding the impact of restructuring and the benefit of the legal settlement, operating earnings before financial services of $146.4 million, or 17.2% of sales decreased 16.7% from $175.8 million or 19.1% of sales in 2019.  Financial Services revenue of $85.9 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to $85.6 million last year, while operating earnings of 56.9 million compared to 62.1 million in 2019, primarily reflecting a $4.5 million increase in provisions for credit losses.  Included in the higher provisions under the recently adopted accounting standard update topic 326 on credit losses, often referred to as CECL was $2.6 million of higher reserve requirements resulting from the economic uncertainty caused by COVID-19. Consolidated operating earnings of $195.8 million, including $7.5 million of restructuring charges, $2.6 million of higher credit reserve requirements and $3.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $249.5 million last year, which included the legal settlement.  As a percentage of revenues the operating earnings margin of 20.9% compared to 24.8% last year. On an adjusted basis in both years excluding restructuring and the legal settlement, operating earnings of 203.3 million or 21.7% of revenues decreased 14.5% from $237.9 million, or 23.6% of revenues in 2019.  Our first quarter effective income tax rate of 24.2% compared to 24.3% last year. The effective rate in both periods were increased by 10 basis points from the restructuring charges in 2020 and the legal settlement in 2019. Finally, net earnings of $137.2 million or $2.49 per share, including an $0.11 charge for restructuring, a $0.04 impact from the COVID-19 related credit provisions and a $0.05 unfavorable impact associated with foreign currency compared to $177.9 million, or $3.16 per share a year ago.  On an adjusted basis, excluding the restructuring charges this year and the $0.15 benefit from the legal settlement in 2019, net earnings of 143.2 million or $2.60 per share, compared to $169.2 million or $3.01 per share last year.  Now, starting with the C&I group on Slide 7, sales of $299.9 million compared to $322.5 million last year, reflecting a 5.7% organic sales decline and a $5.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation partially offset by 0.7 million of acquisition related sales.  The organic decrease primarily includes double digit declines in sales in both the segments Asia Pacific operations and European based hand tools business, partially offset by a high single digit gain in our power tools operations.  Gross Margin of 36.8% decreased to 360 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to 150 basis points from $4.4 million of restructuring charges. The impact of lower sales volumes, as well as higher sales and lower gross margin businesses including sales to the military, and costs associated with COVID-19 related operating disruptions. These decreases were partially offset from savings from the company's RCI initiatives.  The operating expense margin 26.3% increased 30 basis points from 26% last year. Operating earnings for the C&I segment have $31.5 million, including $4.4 million of restructuring charges and $1.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $46.5 million last year. The operating margin of 10.5%, including the 150 basis point charge for restructuring, compared to 14.4% a year ago, and 12.8% in the fourth quarter of 2019.  Turning now to Slide 8, sales Snap-on Tools group of $375.9 million, compared to $410.2 million in 2019, reflecting a 7.8% organic sales decline, and $2.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.  The organic sales decline includes a mid single digit decrease in our US franchise operations and a double digit decline internationally. As Nick mentioned, sales in the United States were up year-over-year from February before the wider government restrictions impacted access to certain customers or locations during March.  Gross Margin of 42.7% declined 190 basis points, primarily due to the impact of lower sales volume, costs associated with COVID-19 related operating disruptions, and 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.  The operating expense margin of 29.8% increased from 28.2% last year, primarily due to the impact of lower sales volumes and 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.  Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools group of $48.6 million, including a $1.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $67.2 million last year, while the operating margin of 12.9% compared to 16.4% a year ago, and 13.2% in the fourth quarter of 2019. Turning to the RS&I group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $314.6 million compared to $327.9 million a year ago, reflecting a 4% organic sales decline and $3.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation partially offset by $2.8 million of acquisition related sales.  The organic sales decrease includes double digit decline in sales to OEM dealerships, and a low single digit decrease in sales of undercar equipment, partially offset by a low single digit gain in sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. Gross margin of 47.9%, including 20 basis points of cost from restructuring, decreased 30 basis points from 48.2% last year. The operating expense margin of 23.3%, including 80 basis points of cost from restructuring, increased 60 basis points from 22.7% in 2019.  Operating earnings for the RS&I group of $77.3 million compared to $83.6 million a year ago. And the operating margin of 24.6% including 100 basis points of cost from restructuring, decreased 90 basis points from 25.5% last year.  Now turning to Slide 10, revenue from Financial Services of $85.9 million compares to $85.6 million last year. Financial Services operating earnings of $56.9 million, compared to $62.1 billion in 2019.  Financial Services expenses of $29 million increased 5.5 million from last year's levels, primarily due to $4.5 million of increases in the provision for credit losses, which included $2.6 million under topic 326 or CECL for the impact of COVID-19. Excluding the $2.6 million associated with COVID-19, provisions for credit losses increased $500,000 from those recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019. As a percentage of the average portfolio, Financial Services expenses were 1.4% or 1.1% in the first quarter of 2020 and 2019, respectively. The average yield on finance receivables in the first quarter of 2020 was 17.7% compared to 17.8% last year. The respective average yield on contract receivables was 9% and 9.1.  Total loan originations of $255.6 million increased $3.1 million, or 1.2%, primarily due to a 1.1% increase in originations of finance receivables, and a 2% increase in originations of contract receivables, principally franchise finance. In the United States, extended originations were up 2% larger reflecting higher franchisee sales of big ticket products.  Moving to Slide 11, our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.1 billion of gross financing receivables, including 1.9 billion from our US operation. Our worldwide gross Financial Services portfolio decreased $19.8 million in the first quarter, primarily due to $26 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects. The 60 day plus delinquency rate of 1.7% for the United States extended credit is up 20 basis points from a year ago, but remains well below level seen in 2008 to 2010 and improved 10 basis points sequentially.  As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, the largest portion of the portfolio, trailing 12 month net losses of $50.4 million represented 2.99% of outstandings at quarter-end, up 8 basis points sequentially of which approximately 4 basis points is as a result of the unfavorable foreign currency effects on the portfolio.  Now, turning to Slide 12, cash provided by operating activities of $213.4 million in the quarter increased $12.1 million from comparable 2019 levels, primarily reflecting net changes in operating assets and liabilities, including decreases in working investment, partially offset by lower net earnings.  Net cash used by investing activities of $49.8 million included capital expenditures of $17.2 million and net additions to finance receivables of $22.1 million. Additions to and collections of finance receivables were consistent with that of the prior year.  In the quarter, our free cash flow from operating company of $143 million improved $10.7 million, as lower working investment largely offset the change in year-over-year net earnings. Additionally, the first quarter of 2019 cash flow reflected the settlement of a legal matter which resulted in a decrease in accrued liabilities of $11.6 million in that prior year period.  Total free cash flow or cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures and the net change in finance receivables of $174.1 million represented 123% of net earnings. Net Cash used by financing activities of 157.1 million included cash dividends of $59 million and the repurchase of 349,000 shares of common stock for $50.5 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $313.3 million of common stock under existing authorizations.  Turning to Slide 13, trade and other accounts receivable decreased $59.4 million from 2019 your end including $21.9 million from unfavorable foreign currency translation. Days sales outstanding of 62 days, compared to 67 days at 2019 year-end. Inventories decreased $3 million, including 25.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency from 2019 year-end. On a trailing 12 month basis inventory turns of 2.5 compared to 2.6 at year-end 2019.  At quarter-end cash position of $185.8 million compared to $184.5 million at year-end 2019. Our net debt to capital ratio of 21.7% compared to 22.1 at year-end 2019. At the end of the quarter, we had $150 million of short-term borrowings under our $800 billion revolving credit facility that terminates in September 2024. These funds were largely utilized to pay down commercial paper outstanding at year-end 2019. As such, there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at the end of the quarter, and our net debt levels were similar to year-end.  As of the end of the quarter, we were well within the permitted ranges set forth in the credit facilities financial covenants. Despite the uncertainty in the credit and financial markets, we currently believe we have sufficient available cash and access to both committed and uncommitted credit facilities to cover expected funding needs in both the near term and on a long term basis.  That concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few updated outlook items. While we do not generally provide quarterly sales or earnings projections in the near term, we anticipate no improvement in the macroeconomic environment. And as a result, expect sales, credit originations and earnings in the second quarter of 2020 to be lower than those in the same period last year.  We now anticipate that capital expenditures will be in a range of $70 million to $80 million as compared to our prior estimate of $90 million to $100 billion. Additionally, we currently anticipate that our full year 2020 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 25%.  I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?\nNick Pinchuk : Thanks Aldo. Snap-on first quarter, progress interrupted, a time of multiple headwinds, the ongoing economic weakness in Europe, the continuing impact of COVID-19 in Asia and the spread of the virus in Europe and North America, all in this quarter. As I said, our team's experienced. This isn't our first encounter with deep difficulty and in this we are keeping our people safe, working from home and when we can't, distancing, using PPE where appropriate, and cleaning deep and often. What we do is essential to society and we're acting accordingly, maintaining operations to keep the world going, supporting the professionals performing critical tasks.  The impact of the virus is mixed across our businesses, some sliding deeper, some flattening, some getting better, all at the same time. But we're confident that the continuing and essential nature of our mission, the advantage of our position, the strength of our balance sheet, the extraordinary experience and capability of our team will carry us through the turmoil. Our long history, navigating disruption, our dividend record, and our performance in the last great recession, all say so. We don't know the timeline or the shape of the disruption. But we do know we'll resume our upward trend with surety and because of that we're confident. Because of that confidence, we're working to preserve our strengths and our advantages.  We keep driving the elements of Snap-on value creation, building our capability, expanding our products, nurturing our networks, and we believe we'll emerge from this turbulence stronger than when we entered as we have so often before. Before I turn the call over to the operator, I want to speak directly to our associates and franchisees, the Snap-on front line. I know you're listening today. We will all pass through this challenge together. And in this difficulty, there's no other team I would rather be standing with for your courage in meeting the difficulties you have my admiration, for your capability and navigating the challenges of the day, you have my congratulations, and for your dedication and fulfilling your essential role in supporting our society, you have my thanks.  Now I'll turn the call over to up to the operator. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from David Leiker with Baird. \nErin Welcenbach: Good morning. This is Erin Welcenbach on for David. So my first question is about the sale of big ticket products. Based on the finance receivable originations and your commentary, it sounds like that held in better than maybe expected. So I guess I'm wondering if you can give any color on how that shaped up I guess throughout the quarter and expectations of that given the weaker economic conditions in Q2?\nNick Pinchuk : I think when you talk about looking forward I think we think we're going into a little more turbulence. It's going to be extended. Remember that the first California shelter at home was only done I think March 22. So we're only talking about a relatively short period of time in this kind of situation. So it's hard to make any extrapolations on that. But if you look at the quarter, here's what happened, I think I said it, tool storage held its own, diagnostics is pretty good and so you had the underpinning of those things. But remember that originations and sales \u2013 Tools group sales don't necessarily match up, there's a timing difference. And in the quarter the sales of the truck exceeded, were positive actually, exceeding the Tools group sales. So you have some of that mismatch there. But as I said, we were kind of pleased with the tool storage business held its own.\nErin Welcenbach: Okay, that's helpful. And then Nick, I think you had mentioned that you were doing some things to support the franchisees during this time, can you provide some more color on some of the actions you're taking?\nNick Pinchuk : Well, first and foremost what we're doing is we're trying to give them a playbook. I don't think many people have seen this before. So we're trying to \u2013 we did this actually in Superstorm Sandy. That's why I mentioned this stuff and Maria and so on. Each disaster is a little bit differently, what we're trying to tell them how to conduct their business serving essential and serving essential and critical tasks in the atmosphere of distancing. And so we have a playbook to help them and then we're kind of working with them with other things in terms of working with their financials and they're working with their business managers in each of their locations to try to find a path and the particular prescription that will help them and their individual franchisees move forward. Like I said, what I was trying to say is the world is mixed. So we have guys in Iowa who are kicking it. There was a guy in Iowa who had a tough week we couldn't believe and even in New York and in the New Rochelle area we had, but on the other hand, other people are having difficulties, so we try to \u2013 we're adjusting to each person, each franchisee.\nErin Welcenbach: Okay, and then finally, on Asia Pacific, you mentioned a better trajectory coming on to the end of the quarter and higher miles driven. I'm wondering what do you think is driving the miles driven recovery there, is just some pent up demand or are you seeing some at least anecdotes of a structural shift in terms of consumer behavior or kind of a preference towards private vehicle ownership?\nNick Pinchuk : Well, I don't know, this is early days and the thing is, I didn't say necessarily. I said, we see green shoots of recovery there, but do you want to be riding the subway now? I don't know. Right. Do you want to be taking a bus? Do you want to be ride sharing? I think this is a change. It's going to echo for a while. And we're seeing that in Beijing, Beijing snapped back in terms of traffic. I think people can see this in our anecdotal evidence about Shanghai is the same. So I think you're at least temporarily seeing people say I don't want to get sick again. \nErin Welcenbach: Okay great, thank you for taking my questions.\nNick Pinchuk : So I think actually ownership, I mean, when you go through that is it. I don't know I want to be selling real estate in New York now or for the next \u2013 for the future.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Gary Prestopino with Barrington.\nGary Prestopino: Good morning, everyone. Hey, could you maybe tell us and if you don't want to do that, that's fine. But what was the slide in sales over the last two weeks of March across all your businesses on an aggregate basis. \nNick Pinchuk : I say what you be \u2013 let me put it this way. Cut it you Gary, say, look, you could be confident it was double digits for sure. It was \u2013 we were down single digits. We said we were up already, we had a reasonable quarter and is going particularly in the Tools group US seemed pretty reasonable for us. So that was a significant slide. But I don't think \u2013 look, Gary, I don't think Gary, I don't think you can make a conclusion of that. Because remember, it's only a month. You got individual \u2013 franchisees who are trying to figure out how to deal with this, so it's hard to make any conclusions about those weeks I think. That's what we're thinking. It's going to play out in the future. Of course, we're going to live with it longer, but I'm not sure those weeks are extrapolation for the future. \nGary Prestopino: Okay, like I said, I'm just trying to get an idea of the magnitude here. If you look across your customer base really worldwide, I mean, how much of that do you still have access to? \nNick Pinchuk : Well, let's put it this way. I think in the Commercial Industrial group, if you're talking about the people, like the critical industry, generally we have access. Yeah, businesses some of those people are getting hammered like oil and gas or some of the aerospace businesses are getting hammered. So businesses are attenuated bug places. And so when we talk to our people, it's a mix. Some of them are calling directly on the people, some are dealing at a distance through social media or email or things like that or phone calls. If you're talking about the franchisee, same kind of thing, it's a mix, depending on where you live and where you're at and the size of the dealership and their requirements. One of the things that's true is generally we're pretty sure that critical repairs are happening. If somebody needs \u2013 if somebody's got a check engine, like they're bringing it in. If somebody going for oil changes, doesn't seem like it's happening. So we can tell that. And so some of the businesses that focused on that are a little less receptive to having people come in, if you're a transmission guy, you're probably doing okay. And you expect or people don't, it's quite a mix. \nGary Prestopino: Okay, and then lastly, could you maybe just go back to 2008, 2009, obviously, every situation is different, but we did have one hell of a recession at that period. What were the indicators to you that the business was coming back? I mean, which segments started to really show significant, I guess lack of a better word green shoots in and that you felt that okay to start to try. \nNick Pinchuk : It was a different deal, of course, but big ticket items coming back was the big thing. Generally, it was the attenuation of bad news for breakfast. I think people were getting scared by what they were being told about the banking system that was that was affecting it. So generally, it was big ticket in that situation, because people only were buying. I remember talking about it incessantly. People were only buying short payback items. And if you look at that, when we have recession, if you look at it, we came out of it and by the time you got to 2011 our trajectory was still a healthy double digits and profit growth, including at least us. \nGary Prestopino: Yeah, I do remember that. Okay, thanks.\nNick Pinchuk : Sure.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Bret Jordan with Jefferies.\nBret Jordan: Hey, good morning, guys. \nNick Pinchuk : Good morning.\nAldo Pagliari: Good morning.\nBret Jordan: When you look at the service channel, I mean, independent volume seemed that they were down 30% to 50% here in a pretty short period of time. I guess you're looking at the credit book and a lot of these guys are getting paid on piece work. Do you think that in the short-term, we're going to see delinquencies exceed what you saw in '08, '09 just give the magnitude and the relatively quick speed of the crank? And then I guess a follow up question on franchisee health, I mean, obviously, you hear about a lot of small businesses that didn't have liquidity to go into this type of dramatic contraction in a short period of time as well. I guess, are you doing much across the board, you talked about a couple of franchisees that are doing particularly well, but if you think about average franchisee liquidity, are you going to need to step in and help them a little bit in the second quarter assuming volumes remain down pretty dramatically. \nNick Pinchuk : Well, I think first of all, I think that the jury's out on delinquency rates, I'm not so sure how it will behave. I remember that losses improved, went up 100 basis points in the recession last time and delinquencies did go up. I think there is a question of the shock of this all that I think there's going to be sort of like timelines that will work its way through this situation where people get shocked and then figure it out and then deal with it for a while. I don't know what those timelines are. In terms of helping our franchisees, like I said, it depends on the segment of the country. For example, if you look at the Northeast, the franchisees are a little more attenuated. If you look at places like the central region or the North Central region where we're living in, where we're sitting in, now it's not so bad. Northwest seems to be coming back a little bit.  If you look at certain indicators, so we would look at franchisee by franchisee and then we would talk about things like well, loan extensions for them and some help in terms of their position. And we did that in the past, we did it in Superstorm Sandy, we did it in Maria, we did it in Harvey and it all worked out very well for us because our business managers highlight those guys who need help. And we get out there and help them. And of course, there are government programs they can access to, although I don't think it's that easy to do it these days. But in general, we've seen this movie before, in a more narrow way. Puerto Rico, in the East Coast and in the Houston area, and our actions around having the business managers deal with the franchisees and help them in some cases giving them extensions of deferral has worked very well for us.\nBret Jordan: Okay, great, thank you.\nNick Pinchuk : Yeah.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Scott Stember with CL King.\nScott Stember: Good morning and thanks for taking my questions.\nNick Pinchuk : Sure.\nScott Stember: You talked about how big ticket items such as storage held its own in the quarter, but can you just give us your expectations? I know you don't really guide by month or quarter, but is it safe to assume that we're going to start seeing some elevated declines in big ticket items at least in April. \nNick Pinchuk : What I'm trying to say Scott is sure, I think, if you're going to \u2013 if we're to lay bets now, I'd lay bets that the second quarter is worse than last year. And I lay bets that we have more weeks of eggs in the second quarter than we had in the first quarter. The shape of that is what I don't know because I don't know I think there was a lot of experience. I think \u2013 if you think about it in a practical sense, okay, you've got guys who are working on essential. Everybody recognize what we do is essential. Everybody recognizes this. The Department of Homeland Security talks about automotive repair. So every state proclamation says that, but our people are worried about how they deal with the customers. The customers are trying to figure out how they ply their essential trade. And our people are trying to figure out how to deal with them.  And so it's hard to figure out how that's going to play out. I don't know. I'm not sure. But we see a lot of variation in our situation. Yeah, big ticket, if you say, look, a recession creates eggs, and people are worried about uncertainty. Big ticket tends to go down like it did in the last environment because people say I don't want it. I got to hasten my own cash. But my suggestion is what's going to happen eventually is people come out of the woodwork to give their cars repaired. It's one of the first things that happen. Now, I don't know the timeline for that. But that's why I'm being a little bit I can't really predict so much about the second quarter, except that we're going to manage \u2013 I can't tell you anything that you don't know, really, these kinds of things. \nScott Stember: No, that's fair enough. And just \u2013 maybe just give us a little bit more commentary what you're hearing from the van channel, what they're seeing at the repair shop level as far as the help, the employment picture with their mechanics and just \u2013 and I know that we're milestone have been off obviously a lot, but just the general commentary about what they're seeing? \nNick Pinchuk : Yeah, generally \u2013 again, I'm sorry, it's like \u2013 it's mixed. Some are sliding papers, some are flattening, some are getting better. That's what I hear, but I will tell you this, I think, now, if you look at the BLS data, the BLS data says that the nominal spending of households on automotive repair in February, year-over-year was up 8% and change. So I would suggest that just like our franchisees, the garage has entered it, not bad shape. So I think the resilience is probably pretty good in this situation, so I don't \u2013 some are probably \u2013 we know some are closed, some are operating at reduced hours, some are going gangbusters. So it just depends I think in this situation. I can't say. I know that's not very helpful to building a model or anything, but I can't really give you anything like that. I think the one piece of data, I do think is worthwhile is that both the nominal repairs and that the household spending and the technician wages were up in February year-over-year. So I think they entered pretty good. \nScott Stember: Got it and last question, just remind us what \u2013 just going back to '08 through 2010, what the 60 day delinquency numbers went up to from a percentage standpoint and the losses \u2013 the total losses in the portfolio on a trailing 12 month basis. Thanks. \nNick Pinchuk : I'll let Aldo answer that.\nAldo Pagliari: Scott. I don't have the exact delinquency numbers in front of me. But they would be not so dissimilar to what you're seeing today. But the losses went up about 100 basis points. I think I mentioned earlier on the call, they hit a peak in a negative sense in Q4 of '09, and then moved from around 3% over the portfolio to around 4%. And then they declined back to below 3% until recent times, so that gives you a range I guess or a feel for what it might be like.\nScott Stember: Got it, thank you. \nNick Pinchuk : Sure.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.\nChristopher Glynn: Thanks, good morning. A lot's been asked, but just around the outlook lacking guidance. So I was curious, what your sense is of what among your three operating segments might see the biggest pain as you look at it? Should we use the 1Q magnitudes as a guide? \nNick Pinchuk : Look, I think my own view is Europe is sick. It was weak going \u2013 it was weak coming in here. About 18% of our business in Europe, that's the big \u2013 it's got a big dollop in C&I and so that's probably the place I think is going to be tougher. If you look at Spain and Italy, the pre-book of Milan asked us to get back in business in Italy because we were essential in that place. But I just think Europe's going to have a tougher time coming out of this. Asia. It's spreading through the \u2013 I think China starts to come back. Japan I think is resilient. I think Southeast Asia, I don't know your Indonesia seems to be sinking, Philippines seems to be in trouble and India has completely shut down. So I don't know about the southern Asia. I think China and Korea, and maybe Japan start to excel. United States, you guys know as best as I do, I kind of think so that in our business, our people will learn, will adjust to this, the garages will adjust and it'll kind of \u2013 they'll be adapting to this and we're going to help them. The question is how quickly does that happen? And we know it's going to be four more weeks in a second quarter. So I can't give you much more guidance than that. But I think we're better off in the United States and Europe for sure. \nChristopher Glynn: Okay, and then I was just curious on the costs to manage supply chains, people safety through the COVID experience. What is that layer of cost like in terms of magnitude or what do you have to spend for continuity? \nNick Pinchuk : Well, I don't think so much about continuity. You have lower volumes, so you have more people on the payroll and so on. I think the question is, what do you do about that as you go forward as the lower volumes get smaller? I think I've said in many forum that we're looking at this carefully. We have two sets of what we call profit assurance actions that will take actions depending on how long things go and so on. But we're not going to take precipitous action based on a few weeks. We have of course done the standard stuff like reduce travel and done other things. I would expect that on the other hand, working from home tends to be a little less efficient, I think. And so you have that floating. I would \u2013 I don't think we have a real number on the cost to clean and so on. Generally, though, our cases I'd say knock on wood seem to be stabilizing. So we seem to be in reasonable shape in that area. So I don't think we have \u2013 you can look at the first quarter make any conclusions about extrapolating those costs going forward because if it gets worse, we'll have to take other actions to reduce our costs.\nChristopher Glynn: Okay, thank you. \nNick Pinchuk : Sure.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Curtis Nagle with Bank of America.\nCurtis Nagle: Good morning. Thanks very much. \nNick Pinchuk : Good morning.\nCurtis Nagle: Good morning Nick, how you doing? \nNick Pinchuk : Okay. \nCurtis Nagle: Good. Okay, so turning just quickly back to the Tools group and then franchise network. I guess how many of the 3,500 or so in the fleet, how many are actually operating right now or are there any that are mandated not to run because of social distancing and things like that?\nNick Pinchuk : Look, we pretty much by phone talk to every franchisee every day and I would say a relatively small number, pretty small number are not running. But there's variations of that all the way up. we would say a lion's share of them are operating on a relatively normal, but attenuated activity because if they spend an hour, they're not getting as much return from some of the people because maybe they're not buying big ticket items or it's taken longer to get to people or they're have to set up an organization. And in between there there's a bunch of gradations. People might be working. Small number may be working on partial shifts or partial days. Some people are not even taken out their trucks.  They're putting their stuff in the car and they're driving around. Other people are spending half their day setting up appointments and then going out, but the lion's share of the business and way over the majority is working as normal, maybe not getting the returns as normal. Now, when I say working as normal, I'm not saying they're rolling into every garage or anything like that. Some garages are going into, other garages are putting the stuff on the outside, other people are bringing them on the van one by one. We had a guy who had a customer event, really, he brought people on he had tea and had food on the van, but he limited the number of people on and forced distancing. I had a great day.\nCurtis Nagle: Got it, okay, understood. And then kind of thinking about \u2013 so again, vehicle repairs is an essential service we'll get cars back in the road to some normalized at some point, but I would think, at least in the kind of a shorter, maybe a medium term, there might be some negative impact on repair demand, just because cars are being driven at the moment. Have you guys done any work trying to figure out is that \u2013 could be the case, what to tell them that can be able to be a residual impact of the distance not just related to \u2013\nNick Pinchuk : Well, I think \u2013 look, I think \u2013 like I said, I think a couple of things I can tell you, first of all trucks are being repaired. I'm right in 94, I-94 out here, it seems like there's as many trucks on I-94 as it ever was. And it kind of makes sense, right? People are getting deliveries, maybe more deliveries now than before. So trucks are \u2013 while they \u2013 well, I'm sure that truck shops \u2013 because the lighter trucks, maybe are attenuated a lot of these trucks are still rolling. So I think that they're probably doing okay, continuing. You're talking about regular vehicles, like I said I think are monitoring and we get a pretty good monitor of this is that generally maintenance is drying up and repairs continuing at a somewhat reduced rate, but still at a reasonable rate. I would expect that after this starts to play out, you're going to get a rush on the garages with maintenance, there's going to be a snapback as maintenance tends to come like death and taxes. You need to have your oil changed every once in a while, so that's going to happen.\nCurtis Nagle: Okay, fair enough. Good luck to you guys and thanks. \nNick Pinchuk : Alright, thanks a lot Curtis. \nCurtis Nagle: Take care.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.\nDavid MacGregor: Good morning, everyone.\nNick Pinchuk : Good morning. \nDavid MacGregor: Nick, good morning. It's just a couple of questions on credit, I guess, we've got mid teens unemployment in this country, small businesses are on the ropes. The $500,000 provision seems a little light. I wonder although if you could just discuss the key assumptions that were underlying that your provision decision and particularly in light of the fact that you're calling the second half of March down double digits, which would have relatively negative implications for what might happen in the second quarter. We've got to understand some of the key assumptions underlying that provision decision. \nAldo Pagliari: For sure, if you actually go Dave, remember, we're making our accounting adjustments effective at the end of the fiscal quarter, so that's March, so you have to keep that in mind as well and performance off the back of the van \u2013 performance for extended credit originations in general were pretty good. Yes, they were stronger at the beginning of the month than they were at the end of the month. But the performance was pretty good. And the performance of collection activity was pretty good. So it wasn't quite as good as Q1 of last year, which we actually saw lower levels of provisions in charge offs. But there was actually a better performance than what you would \u2013 had seen as a normal run rate. So we took that into account when we increase the reserve and then on top of it, we have to take a forward look, under CECL.  This gets to be a little bit more judgmental, certainly, because we've pressure tested the portfolio idea of circumstances of preparing for CECL's adoption. And actually, there's not any single variable that correlates so perfectly with it. So we look at a myriad of different things, and we have to apply some judgment. Having said all of that, we came to a conclusion that we thought it was appropriate to increase reserve by about $2.6 million. I'd say it's more specifically for the forward look. So it's not like it was nothing of dispensing the 500,000, just in reference to the sequential movement. But the CECL adjustment actually within the quarter was about 2.6 million and if you look at the level of reserves at the end of March as compared to the end of December, actually roughly 15% in total, so it's not like it's nothing. \nDavid MacGregor: Right, I guess just further on the credit. I didn't hear you mentioned in your prepared remarks about the 90 day payment deferral plan that began in March and we saw a rather parabolic upturn in UCC filings and I'm guessing although if you guys have you confirm it one way or the other if this was just technicians refinancing and franchisees rolling their IRA balances in DC? But can you just \u2013 I guess, under this 90 day deferral plan, how much forbearance has been granted at this point to end customers and franchisees? \nAldo Pagliari: Well, people think first off the \u2013 its early days. It was launched on March 23. We've had programs like this before, so timing is even better with the advent of CECL, you could look at this as not at CECL with the COVID-19. So you can look at this as a form of being able to help customers out. But we've done programs like this in the past. So it's not like it's something radical in any way, shape or form. So we'll see what the uptake is. But as of the end of March, it was only in the in the field for about the less than seven days, I guess, given our fiscal cut off, I think was March 29, so you have that.  Now, you have a separate program, where we grant forbearance or can allow extensions to certain people that's on a case by case basis. It is for a limited number of weeks. We try to work \u2013 one thing I'd snap on this it's personal, and that's not a bad word. Some people shy away from the word personal these days with the pandemic, but we're pretty intimate with our customers and we know our customers, both our franchisees and they know their end mechanics and we have to reach out and help them, but it was a relatively small percentage. I think it will increase going into Q2, but geez, I think at the end of the quarter, it might have been less than 5% of people had asked for some type of forbearance if you want to use that word. \nDavid MacGregor: Right and so this originations growth of 1.2%, does that include refinancing of VC and revolving cash balances? And if so, can you say what originations growth might have been based purely on purchases of merchandise unrelated to the deferred payment offer?\nAldo Pagliari: We measure origination to the same each and every quarter. It doesn't change because of what's going on. So extending credit can include both add-ons as well as sale of brand new products. But to be able to do so customers have to be in good standing. So in other words, if you want to add on to a contract, you've to be a customer that one has additional credit capacity, so we measure people's credit limits in that regard. And then it's got to be a minimum dollar sale in addition, which is typically I think, $300 and up. If you remember the cut off usually is more dollars than that, but that would be at least 300. So that's one of the determinants as to when people add on and add on to a contract they already have in place.\nDavid MacGregor: Right and finally, you mentioned you got $300 million left on your share repurchase authorization program, I guess with the stock haven't been sold off here rather hard. What would be your plans? Or how would you think about capital allocation here and maybe the priority of share purchase authorizations within that? \nAldo Pagliari: Well, first and foremost, you want to support the ongoing operations. And that's kind of obvious. You're in a mode here where I think people will be careful with their cash. I think no one has perfect visibility when you look forward. So the forecast with precision is not easy in normal times, let alone rockier times. So you're going to want to keep an eye on cash inflows, and of course, cash outflows. And one of the more discretionary items actually would be share repurchase. When we look at share repurchase, I would put that on the list of one of the more discretionary items. So first and foremost, I look at what's the cash position to the corporation, and how does that fit into the equation. I thought that Snap-on was a great bargain at $150 per share is even a better bargain today. Does that mean I can't buy it at a lower price tomorrow? I just don't know with certainty, so again, we have to apply judgment.\nDavid MacGregor: Alright, well, thanks for taking the questions and good luck everyone.\nAldo Pagliari: Thank you.\nOperator: And at this time, I would like to turn the conference back to Sara Verbsky for any additional or closing remarks. \nSara Verbsky: Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snap-on.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Nick Pinchuk",
            "content": "Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. Well, as some say, these are interesting times. There's considerable turbulence in business and all across the everyday landscape. But I believe we can be confident that Snap-on will navigate through it all and come out stronger than when it all started, just as we have done in the past. Before we get going, I think it's appropriate for all of you listening in, the investors, associates, franchisees, customers, retirees and analysts. You have our best wishes that you and your families weather these times safely and without harm.  Now, let's speak of Snap-on. Firstly, we're keeping our team safe. Snap-on people are working from home and where that's not possible and there are a number of these instances we're proceeding using government prescribed guide lines in the United States those put forward by the Centre for Disease Control the CDC, physical distancing, the use of personal protection equipment, cleaning of facilities deep and often, staggered shifts and break, and quick attention to those who have symptoms.  For our franchisees, we're active in helping, providing a playbook for staying safe. The people of the Snap-on team are a great advantage, working hard to preserve them and as we move through this difficulty. Having said that, it's clear our operations are essential. Snap-on plays an important role in the underpinning of our society supporting vital activities, like the military, transportation infrastructure, our critical vehicle repair, the areas we all depend on for emergency services, for food delivery, for distribution of medical supplies, and for a variety of essential needs. Government bodies, including the US Department of Homeland Security and multiple states have deemed it so.  And there have been clear examples that critical role from the United States to Italy, to the UK. And as such, our factories and distribution centers have pretty much remained active doing their part, keeping the world going. Consistent with that, our sourcing teams have been able to maintain our supply chain supporting both our factories and our kitting centers. Overwhelmingly, our sourcing partners have recognized the criticality of our needs, and have remained active to provide support. Now in this arena, particularly in the US, we do have an advantage because we make in the markets where we sell. Our supply chain is fine.  As you might expect, the impact of the virus varies across our operating landscape. Asia in general, and China in particular has seen the impact for some time, but now, particularly in China, it's showing some rays of light, restaurants are opening and people are driving in mass. Europe has seen weak economics for several quarters, and COVID-19 has made it worse, pretty much all over. It's a region that seems particularly hard hit. Of course, there's a lot being written about the United States, we do see a mix. There are points of light, primarily in the middle of the country, where franchisees have set personal positive records. And there are places particularly in the northeast where activity has been significantly restricted. And there are locations not that many at this point where we've seen green shoots of recovery.  If you view the world by business segment, most seem quite impacted. Oil and gas, of course, education and vehicle OEM projects, but there are other places like the military, like general industry and like trucking that appear more positive. Regardless of the current landscape, we believe we have the resilience and the strength to navigate the downturn, as Snap-on has done so many times before. The fact that since 1939, over all those years encountering several periods of significant challenge, Snap-on has paid a dividend every quarter and it's never reduced it. That record stands as evidence of a resilience.  So in that regard, we believe our longer term prospects have not been impacted, or the timelines are uncertain. We are confident on a positive outcome to this inner loop. You can see it in the last recession in 2009. Remember how uncertain it was? Bad news for breakfast, people thinking about putting their money in the mattresses, the idea of more deep wall seeming okay without stigma. Well, if you look at Snap-on's record during that weathering, we navigated the turbulence and came out stronger.  We believe that reflects the essential nature of our business, the strength of our position in that business and the experience and capability of our team. That wasn't our first rodeo. And neither is this. Because we believe in that recovery, we're keeping up with the elements of Snap-on value creation, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement. It's particularly evident in customer connection and innovation. Even in the turbulence, we're continuing with the stream of new products, the green shoots will grow, and we're going to be ready. Well, that's the overview.  Let me turn to the results. First Quarter as reported sales were 852.2 million down 7.5%, including a 10.3 million or 100 basis point impact from unfavorable foreign currency. Organic sales declined 6.9%, reflecting the ongoing weakness in Europe and the impact of the global economic uncertainty associated with COVID-19.  From an earnings perspective, Opco OI for the quarter of 138.9 million including 7.5 million of restructuring charges principally focused on Europe and 3.3 million of unfavorable currency effect was 48.5 million lower than 2019, which included $11.6 million benefit from the settlement of patent related litigation matters and that's a mouthful. But the 2020 as adjusted Opco OI of 146.4 million excluding restructuring was down 16.7% from last year's as adjusted level.  And if you consider the sequential impact of the turbulence caused by the pandemic, the first quarter sales of 852 million were down organically from the fourth quarter of 2019 by 10.5%, while the periods as adjusted OI of 146.4 million was down 14.6%. Regarding Opco's OI margin, the as adjusted 17.2% recorded in the first quarter compared with the as adjusted 19.1% and the 17.9% registered in the prior year and in the prior quarter respectively.  For financial services operating income of 56.9 million was down from last year's 62.1 million, including a $2.6 million higher credit reserve as a result of the economic uncertainty associated with the virus. Overall EPS on an as reported basis was $2. 49 and it compared to $3.16 last year. The as adjusted EPS was $2.60 and that compared with last year $3.01, down 13.5%.  Now let's move to the groups. C&I saw mixed progress to the end of February attenuated by significant declines in March, volume in the first quarter of 299.9 million including 5.3 million unfavorable foreign currency translation was down versus last year's 322.5 million, primarily on double digit declines in Asia Pacific and in Europe, reflecting the longer impact of the virus in Asia and the ongoing economic weakness in Europe combined with the later period effects of COVID-19. From an earnings perspective C&I operating income of 31.5 million decreased 15 million from 2019, including 4.4 million of restructuring and 1.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Now critical industries did show variation with relatively favorable performance in the military, trucking fleet and general industry. You can see the essential nature of those areas in our activities, as we supported the production and the maintenance of the F-35 fighter and as our critical tools helped keep the London ambulances on the road.  That positive activity was offset by weakness in natural resources, education and aerospace as some of our commercial customers struggled to respond to the pandemic and the resulting lower oil prices and technical school shutdowns and reduced flight and generally lower capital spending. Overall, however, the critical industries reflecting in part the essential nature of those tests were flat in the turbulence. We do remain confident in and committed to extending in the critical industry. So as a matter of fact, we're continuing to strengthen our product line enhancing our position even in the attenuated environment.  A great example just introduced this quarter from the power tools division is the new CT9100 three quarter inch cordless impact wrench equipped with the market leading combination of power and durability. The three quarter inch drive Anvil makes the unit great for essential tasks for big industrial applications, for power generation, for heavy duty fleets and for the military, where fastener sizes are larger, torque values are higher and reliability and consistent performances are pretty critical.  With its five amp hour lithium battery to CT9100 provides the 1000 pounds feet of bolting and 1300 pound feet of breakaway torque. That's real power and beyond the strength the tool has considerable versatility, three torque settings in forward and three in reverse optimizing performance for a wide range of applications, and it has a built in break, preventing the pot that powerful wrench from throwing fasteners or sockets around when you use it. That's a significant safety feature.  The tool is built in our Murphy, North Carolina plant, and it uses best in class components for superior toughness of substantial strength and long service life. The new impact was just released in February and in a limited distribution but it's already on track to become a hit $1 million product. It's been quite well received C&I, navigating the turbulence with customer connection, and innovation serving the essential.  Now onto the tools group, sales were 375.9 million in the quarter reflecting $31.8 million organic decline and 2.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The progress we saw in the US van channel early in the quarter was erased, and the continuing weakness of the international operation was amplified by the virus as the virus spread more widely. The operating earnings of 48.6 million including 1.4 of unfavorable foreign currency compared to 67.2 million in 2019.  One advantage, we believe our franchisees entered the difficulties with a strong underlying position and that base will come in handy during the immediate future. And as I said before van activity is mixed. There are points of light. We saw great record setting franchisee performance in Iowa, even in New York some have adjusted well turning in strong results, but there are places where the network is attenuated. The vans aren't seeing variation, but we have considerable confidence in their ability to adjust and return to full strength.  We've done it before in disasters like Superstorm Sandy and Hurricanes, Maria and Harvey, and the tools team is working again in this difficulty with focus to make sure our franchisees weather the storm and emerge with advantage. We're supporting the franchisees with tailored programs, targeted promotions and with again great new product, products like the new line of quarter inch drive Stubby Ratchets, boasting the shortest length on the market, the fixed head at two and a half inches and the flex set at three and a quarter inches, both offer improved accessibility and constraint spaces like over a quarter inch drive ratchets.  The new Stubby's include Dual 80 technology for convenient ratcheting arc five degrees and for more power and less lateral space. These have sealed heads which ensure long tool life and a screw style joint design that enables very easy repair all while maximizing strength. The new ratchets, they were launched regionally again in March and initial sales were nearly a million dollars, a significant success for a hand tool in a regional introduction, especially in the storm.  Now, let's talk about tool storage. Holding its own in the face of the pandemic, helped in part by the hundredth anniversary limited edition epic Roll Cab with the centennial themed panels and medallions, the 68 inch epic with the LED lighted power tool top features a gunmetal clear coat paint scheme and new brush red trim color, darker and richer than our standard. At first time color combination highlights our continued innovation and emphasizes our capacity to expand color choices for Cab and it captures the attention of technicians who want to declare they are a very special professional. Only 1920, were founded in 1920, only 1920 were built. In the numbered medallions will showcase each boxes place in Snap-on's history. Reception was strong, the buck sold out. Well that's the tools group navigating the challenges underpinned by strong product.  Now speaking of RS&I, the RS&I group finished the quarter at 314.6 million in sales compared to 327.9 million last year, reflecting at 12.9 million organic sales decrease. The growth through February showing an improvement in all businesses with the exception of our automotive OEM facing operation was overcome by slippage in March. Deeper decreases in the OEM area and end of quarter weakness in - end of quarter weaker volume in under car equipment for both automotive dealerships and independent repair shops. RS&I operating earnings of 77.3 million decreased 6.3 million including 3.1 million of European focused restructuring.  Operating margin was 24.6% including 100 basis points from the restructuring and compared to the 25.5% recorded last year. Excluding restructuring the OI margin was 25.6% up 10 basis points for RS&I despite the pandemic. Now the overall growth was impacted by continuing weakness in OEM programs and equipment volumes. Our diagnostics and repair information businesses did advance in the quarter and we're working to keep that momentum going with innovative new products and features attractions like our recently introduced interactive truck wiring diagrams. It's an enhancement to the Mitchell 1 heavy duty repair information system.  Now, just like the light vehicles technicians with the Mitchell 1 system can click on any picture component in a truck retrieving - when looked at a wiring diagram, it can retrieve a pop-up menu with specifications, physical locations, connector views and guided component tests. The new productivity enhancing truck wiring diagrams were introduced in late February. It was at a press conference, attended by the industry's top publications and reception was great. It's one of the reasons why Mitchell 1 kept growing in the quarter.  Also, during February we launched our new SOLUS Legend diagnostic scan tool. It's quick, a 10 second boot up and the ability to display scan results in as little as 30 seconds. It also offers a best in class eight inch touch screen color display, and it combines a full diagnostic capability. It combines full diagnostic capabilities for both standard vehicles and for motorcycles into one platform. That's a very popular feature. The new handheld also provides access to our sure track vehicle specific real fixes, repair tips, and commonly replaced parts all derived from operation Primary database of 1.3 billion repair actions. SOLUS Legend has the look of a very successful addition to our lineup.  We're confident in the strength of the RS&I product line we keep driving to expand its position with a repair shop owners and managers making work easier with great new products even in the days of the virus. Well, that's a Snap-on first quarter. Some momentum in the beginning checked by the virus, making sure our team is safe, maintaining our operations, they're essential to society, navigating the mixed effects of the virus across our geographies and industries, knowing we can weather the difficulties, not knowing the exact timeline but confident that our position is positive going forward and keeping our companies strong, Snap-on value creation and a continuing string of new products.  Now turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Thanks Aldo. Snap-on first quarter, progress interrupted, a time of multiple headwinds, the ongoing economic weakness in Europe, the continuing impact of COVID-19 in Asia and the spread of the virus in Europe and North America, all in this quarter. As I said, our team's experienced. This isn't our first encounter with deep difficulty and in this we are keeping our people safe, working from home and when we can't, distancing, using PPE where appropriate, and cleaning deep and often. What we do is essential to society and we're acting accordingly, maintaining operations to keep the world going, supporting the professionals performing critical tasks.  The impact of the virus is mixed across our businesses, some sliding deeper, some flattening, some getting better, all at the same time. But we're confident that the continuing and essential nature of our mission, the advantage of our position, the strength of our balance sheet, the extraordinary experience and capability of our team will carry us through the turmoil. Our long history, navigating disruption, our dividend record, and our performance in the last great recession, all say so. We don't know the timeline or the shape of the disruption. But we do know we'll resume our upward trend with surety and because of that we're confident. Because of that confidence, we're working to preserve our strengths and our advantages.  We keep driving the elements of Snap-on value creation, building our capability, expanding our products, nurturing our networks, and we believe we'll emerge from this turbulence stronger than when we entered as we have so often before. Before I turn the call over to the operator, I want to speak directly to our associates and franchisees, the Snap-on front line. I know you're listening today. We will all pass through this challenge together. And in this difficulty, there's no other team I would rather be standing with for your courage in meeting the difficulties you have my admiration, for your capability and navigating the challenges of the day, you have my congratulations, and for your dedication and fulfilling your essential role in supporting our society, you have my thanks.  Now I'll turn the call over to up to the operator. Operator? I think when you talk about looking forward I think we think we're going into a little more turbulence. It's going to be extended. Remember that the first California shelter at home was only done I think March 22. So we're only talking about a relatively short period of time in this kind of situation. So it's hard to make any extrapolations on that. But if you look at the quarter, here's what happened, I think I said it, tool storage held its own, diagnostics is pretty good and so you had the underpinning of those things. But remember that originations and sales \u2013 Tools group sales don't necessarily match up, there's a timing difference. And in the quarter the sales of the truck exceeded, were positive actually, exceeding the Tools group sales. So you have some of that mismatch there. But as I said, we were kind of pleased with the tool storage business held its own. Well, first and foremost what we're doing is we're trying to give them a playbook. I don't think many people have seen this before. So we're trying to \u2013 we did this actually in Superstorm Sandy. That's why I mentioned this stuff and Maria and so on. Each disaster is a little bit differently, what we're trying to tell them how to conduct their business serving essential and serving essential and critical tasks in the atmosphere of distancing. And so we have a playbook to help them and then we're kind of working with them with other things in terms of working with their financials and they're working with their business managers in each of their locations to try to find a path and the particular prescription that will help them and their individual franchisees move forward. Like I said, what I was trying to say is the world is mixed. So we have guys in Iowa who are kicking it. There was a guy in Iowa who had a tough week we couldn't believe and even in New York and in the New Rochelle area we had, but on the other hand, other people are having difficulties, so we try to \u2013 we're adjusting to each person, each franchisee. Well, I don't know, this is early days and the thing is, I didn't say necessarily. I said, we see green shoots of recovery there, but do you want to be riding the subway now? I don't know. Right. Do you want to be taking a bus? Do you want to be ride sharing? I think this is a change. It's going to echo for a while. And we're seeing that in Beijing, Beijing snapped back in terms of traffic. I think people can see this in our anecdotal evidence about Shanghai is the same. So I think you're at least temporarily seeing people say I don't want to get sick again. So I think actually ownership, I mean, when you go through that is it. I don't know I want to be selling real estate in New York now or for the next \u2013 for the future. I say what you be \u2013 let me put it this way. Cut it you Gary, say, look, you could be confident it was double digits for sure. It was \u2013 we were down single digits. We said we were up already, we had a reasonable quarter and is going particularly in the Tools group US seemed pretty reasonable for us. So that was a significant slide. But I don't think \u2013 look, Gary, I don't think Gary, I don't think you can make a conclusion of that. Because remember, it's only a month. You got individual \u2013 franchisees who are trying to figure out how to deal with this, so it's hard to make any conclusions about those weeks I think. That's what we're thinking. It's going to play out in the future. Of course, we're going to live with it longer, but I'm not sure those weeks are extrapolation for the future. Well, let's put it this way. I think in the Commercial Industrial group, if you're talking about the people, like the critical industry, generally we have access. Yeah, businesses some of those people are getting hammered like oil and gas or some of the aerospace businesses are getting hammered. So businesses are attenuated bug places. And so when we talk to our people, it's a mix. Some of them are calling directly on the people, some are dealing at a distance through social media or email or things like that or phone calls. If you're talking about the franchisee, same kind of thing, it's a mix, depending on where you live and where you're at and the size of the dealership and their requirements. One of the things that's true is generally we're pretty sure that critical repairs are happening. If somebody needs \u2013 if somebody's got a check engine, like they're bringing it in. If somebody going for oil changes, doesn't seem like it's happening. So we can tell that. And so some of the businesses that focused on that are a little less receptive to having people come in, if you're a transmission guy, you're probably doing okay. And you expect or people don't, it's quite a mix. It was a different deal, of course, but big ticket items coming back was the big thing. Generally, it was the attenuation of bad news for breakfast. I think people were getting scared by what they were being told about the banking system that was that was affecting it. So generally, it was big ticket in that situation, because people only were buying. I remember talking about it incessantly. People were only buying short payback items. And if you look at that, when we have recession, if you look at it, we came out of it and by the time you got to 2011 our trajectory was still a healthy double digits and profit growth, including at least us. Sure. Good morning. Well, I think first of all, I think that the jury's out on delinquency rates, I'm not so sure how it will behave. I remember that losses improved, went up 100 basis points in the recession last time and delinquencies did go up. I think there is a question of the shock of this all that I think there's going to be sort of like timelines that will work its way through this situation where people get shocked and then figure it out and then deal with it for a while. I don't know what those timelines are. In terms of helping our franchisees, like I said, it depends on the segment of the country. For example, if you look at the Northeast, the franchisees are a little more attenuated. If you look at places like the central region or the North Central region where we're living in, where we're sitting in, now it's not so bad. Northwest seems to be coming back a little bit.  If you look at certain indicators, so we would look at franchisee by franchisee and then we would talk about things like well, loan extensions for them and some help in terms of their position. And we did that in the past, we did it in Superstorm Sandy, we did it in Maria, we did it in Harvey and it all worked out very well for us because our business managers highlight those guys who need help. And we get out there and help them. And of course, there are government programs they can access to, although I don't think it's that easy to do it these days. But in general, we've seen this movie before, in a more narrow way. Puerto Rico, in the East Coast and in the Houston area, and our actions around having the business managers deal with the franchisees and help them in some cases giving them extensions of deferral has worked very well for us. Yeah. Sure. What I'm trying to say Scott is sure, I think, if you're going to \u2013 if we're to lay bets now, I'd lay bets that the second quarter is worse than last year. And I lay bets that we have more weeks of eggs in the second quarter than we had in the first quarter. The shape of that is what I don't know because I don't know I think there was a lot of experience. I think \u2013 if you think about it in a practical sense, okay, you've got guys who are working on essential. Everybody recognize what we do is essential. Everybody recognizes this. The Department of Homeland Security talks about automotive repair. So every state proclamation says that, but our people are worried about how they deal with the customers. The customers are trying to figure out how they ply their essential trade. And our people are trying to figure out how to deal with them.  And so it's hard to figure out how that's going to play out. I don't know. I'm not sure. But we see a lot of variation in our situation. Yeah, big ticket, if you say, look, a recession creates eggs, and people are worried about uncertainty. Big ticket tends to go down like it did in the last environment because people say I don't want it. I got to hasten my own cash. But my suggestion is what's going to happen eventually is people come out of the woodwork to give their cars repaired. It's one of the first things that happen. Now, I don't know the timeline for that. But that's why I'm being a little bit I can't really predict so much about the second quarter, except that we're going to manage \u2013 I can't tell you anything that you don't know, really, these kinds of things. Yeah, generally \u2013 again, I'm sorry, it's like \u2013 it's mixed. Some are sliding papers, some are flattening, some are getting better. That's what I hear, but I will tell you this, I think, now, if you look at the BLS data, the BLS data says that the nominal spending of households on automotive repair in February, year-over-year was up 8% and change. So I would suggest that just like our franchisees, the garage has entered it, not bad shape. So I think the resilience is probably pretty good in this situation, so I don't \u2013 some are probably \u2013 we know some are closed, some are operating at reduced hours, some are going gangbusters. So it just depends I think in this situation. I can't say. I know that's not very helpful to building a model or anything, but I can't really give you anything like that. I think the one piece of data, I do think is worthwhile is that both the nominal repairs and that the household spending and the technician wages were up in February year-over-year. So I think they entered pretty good. I'll let Aldo answer that. Sure. Look, I think my own view is Europe is sick. It was weak going \u2013 it was weak coming in here. About 18% of our business in Europe, that's the big \u2013 it's got a big dollop in C&I and so that's probably the place I think is going to be tougher. If you look at Spain and Italy, the pre-book of Milan asked us to get back in business in Italy because we were essential in that place. But I just think Europe's going to have a tougher time coming out of this. Asia. It's spreading through the \u2013 I think China starts to come back. Japan I think is resilient. I think Southeast Asia, I don't know your Indonesia seems to be sinking, Philippines seems to be in trouble and India has completely shut down. So I don't know about the southern Asia. I think China and Korea, and maybe Japan start to excel. United States, you guys know as best as I do, I kind of think so that in our business, our people will learn, will adjust to this, the garages will adjust and it'll kind of \u2013 they'll be adapting to this and we're going to help them. The question is how quickly does that happen? And we know it's going to be four more weeks in a second quarter. So I can't give you much more guidance than that. But I think we're better off in the United States and Europe for sure. Well, I don't think so much about continuity. You have lower volumes, so you have more people on the payroll and so on. I think the question is, what do you do about that as you go forward as the lower volumes get smaller? I think I've said in many forum that we're looking at this carefully. We have two sets of what we call profit assurance actions that will take actions depending on how long things go and so on. But we're not going to take precipitous action based on a few weeks. We have of course done the standard stuff like reduce travel and done other things. I would expect that on the other hand, working from home tends to be a little less efficient, I think. And so you have that floating. I would \u2013 I don't think we have a real number on the cost to clean and so on. Generally, though, our cases I'd say knock on wood seem to be stabilizing. So we seem to be in reasonable shape in that area. So I don't think we have \u2013 you can look at the first quarter make any conclusions about extrapolating those costs going forward because if it gets worse, we'll have to take other actions to reduce our costs. Sure. Good morning. Okay. Look, we pretty much by phone talk to every franchisee every day and I would say a relatively small number, pretty small number are not running. But there's variations of that all the way up. we would say a lion's share of them are operating on a relatively normal, but attenuated activity because if they spend an hour, they're not getting as much return from some of the people because maybe they're not buying big ticket items or it's taken longer to get to people or they're have to set up an organization. And in between there there's a bunch of gradations. People might be working. Small number may be working on partial shifts or partial days. Some people are not even taken out their trucks.  They're putting their stuff in the car and they're driving around. Other people are spending half their day setting up appointments and then going out, but the lion's share of the business and way over the majority is working as normal, maybe not getting the returns as normal. Now, when I say working as normal, I'm not saying they're rolling into every garage or anything like that. Some garages are going into, other garages are putting the stuff on the outside, other people are bringing them on the van one by one. We had a guy who had a customer event, really, he brought people on he had tea and had food on the van, but he limited the number of people on and forced distancing. I had a great day. Well, I think \u2013 look, I think \u2013 like I said, I think a couple of things I can tell you, first of all trucks are being repaired. I'm right in 94, I-94 out here, it seems like there's as many trucks on I-94 as it ever was. And it kind of makes sense, right? People are getting deliveries, maybe more deliveries now than before. So trucks are \u2013 while they \u2013 well, I'm sure that truck shops \u2013 because the lighter trucks, maybe are attenuated a lot of these trucks are still rolling. So I think that they're probably doing okay, continuing. You're talking about regular vehicles, like I said I think are monitoring and we get a pretty good monitor of this is that generally maintenance is drying up and repairs continuing at a somewhat reduced rate, but still at a reasonable rate. I would expect that after this starts to play out, you're going to get a rush on the garages with maintenance, there's going to be a snapback as maintenance tends to come like death and taxes. You need to have your oil changed every once in a while, so that's going to happen. Alright, thanks a lot Curtis. Good morning."

            "content": "Thanks Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $852.2 million in the quarter compared to $921.7 million last year, reflecting a 6.9% organic sales decline, $10.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation and $3.5 million of acquisition related sales. The organic sales decrease this quarter primarily reflected the impact of economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, with sales declines and all three operating segments and across most geographies.  Through the month of February, with the exception of Asia Pacific and certain European geographies, sales were up on a year-over-year basis, as the effects of COVID-19 spread across Europe and the United States in March and as further government actions were put in place, demand slowed and access to some customers was interrupted, resulting in the lower year-over-year sales for the quarter.  During the quarter as a result of the continued economic slowdown in Europe as well as effects of COVID-19, we recorded $7.5 million of restructuring costs for actions primarily associated with our European operations. These costs were recorded in both the commercial industrial group and the repair systems and information group.  Consolidated gross margin of 49.5% compared to 51.2% last year, which is one of the highest quarterly gross margins reported in Snap-on's recent history. The 170 basis points decrease primarily reflect 60 basis points from restructuring costs, the impact of lower volumes, cost associated with COVID-19 related operating disruptions and 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.  The decrease was partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives. Despite the cost of restructurings and the impact of COVID-19 the first quarter, the gross margin rate of 49.5% improved sequentially from 47.2% in the fourth quarter of 2019.  The operating expenses margin of 33.2% increased 230 basis points from 30.9% last year. The first quarter of 2019 included $11.6 million or 120 basis point benefit associated with the legal settlement Nick mentioned earlier. The remaining increase primarily reflects the impact of lower sales volumes, 30 basis points from restructuring actions and 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.  Operating earnings before financial services of $138.9 million, including 7.5 million of restructuring cost and 3.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $187.4 million in 2019, which included the $11.6 million legal settlement. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 16.3% compared to 20.3% last year. On an adjusted basis for both years, excluding the impact of restructuring and the benefit of the legal settlement, operating earnings before financial services of $146.4 million, or 17.2% of sales decreased 16.7% from $175.8 million or 19.1% of sales in 2019.  Financial Services revenue of $85.9 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to $85.6 million last year, while operating earnings of 56.9 million compared to 62.1 million in 2019, primarily reflecting a $4.5 million increase in provisions for credit losses.  Included in the higher provisions under the recently adopted accounting standard update topic 326 on credit losses, often referred to as CECL was $2.6 million of higher reserve requirements resulting from the economic uncertainty caused by COVID-19. Consolidated operating earnings of $195.8 million, including $7.5 million of restructuring charges, $2.6 million of higher credit reserve requirements and $3.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $249.5 million last year, which included the legal settlement.  As a percentage of revenues the operating earnings margin of 20.9% compared to 24.8% last year. On an adjusted basis in both years excluding restructuring and the legal settlement, operating earnings of 203.3 million or 21.7% of revenues decreased 14.5% from $237.9 million, or 23.6% of revenues in 2019.  Our first quarter effective income tax rate of 24.2% compared to 24.3% last year. The effective rate in both periods were increased by 10 basis points from the restructuring charges in 2020 and the legal settlement in 2019. Finally, net earnings of $137.2 million or $2.49 per share, including an $0.11 charge for restructuring, a $0.04 impact from the COVID-19 related credit provisions and a $0.05 unfavorable impact associated with foreign currency compared to $177.9 million, or $3.16 per share a year ago.  On an adjusted basis, excluding the restructuring charges this year and the $0.15 benefit from the legal settlement in 2019, net earnings of 143.2 million or $2.60 per share, compared to $169.2 million or $3.01 per share last year.  Now, starting with the C&I group on Slide 7, sales of $299.9 million compared to $322.5 million last year, reflecting a 5.7% organic sales decline and a $5.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation partially offset by 0.7 million of acquisition related sales.  The organic decrease primarily includes double digit declines in sales in both the segments Asia Pacific operations and European based hand tools business, partially offset by a high single digit gain in our power tools operations.  Gross Margin of 36.8% decreased to 360 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to 150 basis points from $4.4 million of restructuring charges. The impact of lower sales volumes, as well as higher sales and lower gross margin businesses including sales to the military, and costs associated with COVID-19 related operating disruptions. These decreases were partially offset from savings from the company's RCI initiatives.  The operating expense margin 26.3% increased 30 basis points from 26% last year. Operating earnings for the C&I segment have $31.5 million, including $4.4 million of restructuring charges and $1.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $46.5 million last year. The operating margin of 10.5%, including the 150 basis point charge for restructuring, compared to 14.4% a year ago, and 12.8% in the fourth quarter of 2019.  Turning now to Slide 8, sales Snap-on Tools group of $375.9 million, compared to $410.2 million in 2019, reflecting a 7.8% organic sales decline, and $2.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.  The organic sales decline includes a mid single digit decrease in our US franchise operations and a double digit decline internationally. As Nick mentioned, sales in the United States were up year-over-year from February before the wider government restrictions impacted access to certain customers or locations during March.  Gross Margin of 42.7% declined 190 basis points, primarily due to the impact of lower sales volume, costs associated with COVID-19 related operating disruptions, and 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.  The operating expense margin of 29.8% increased from 28.2% last year, primarily due to the impact of lower sales volumes and 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.  Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools group of $48.6 million, including a $1.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $67.2 million last year, while the operating margin of 12.9% compared to 16.4% a year ago, and 13.2% in the fourth quarter of 2019. Turning to the RS&I group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $314.6 million compared to $327.9 million a year ago, reflecting a 4% organic sales decline and $3.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation partially offset by $2.8 million of acquisition related sales.  The organic sales decrease includes double digit decline in sales to OEM dealerships, and a low single digit decrease in sales of undercar equipment, partially offset by a low single digit gain in sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. Gross margin of 47.9%, including 20 basis points of cost from restructuring, decreased 30 basis points from 48.2% last year. The operating expense margin of 23.3%, including 80 basis points of cost from restructuring, increased 60 basis points from 22.7% in 2019.  Operating earnings for the RS&I group of $77.3 million compared to $83.6 million a year ago. And the operating margin of 24.6% including 100 basis points of cost from restructuring, decreased 90 basis points from 25.5% last year.  Now turning to Slide 10, revenue from Financial Services of $85.9 million compares to $85.6 million last year. Financial Services operating earnings of $56.9 million, compared to $62.1 billion in 2019.  Financial Services expenses of $29 million increased 5.5 million from last year's levels, primarily due to $4.5 million of increases in the provision for credit losses, which included $2.6 million under topic 326 or CECL for the impact of COVID-19. Excluding the $2.6 million associated with COVID-19, provisions for credit losses increased $500,000 from those recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019. As a percentage of the average portfolio, Financial Services expenses were 1.4% or 1.1% in the first quarter of 2020 and 2019, respectively. The average yield on finance receivables in the first quarter of 2020 was 17.7% compared to 17.8% last year. The respective average yield on contract receivables was 9% and 9.1.  Total loan originations of $255.6 million increased $3.1 million, or 1.2%, primarily due to a 1.1% increase in originations of finance receivables, and a 2% increase in originations of contract receivables, principally franchise finance. In the United States, extended originations were up 2% larger reflecting higher franchisee sales of big ticket products.  Moving to Slide 11, our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.1 billion of gross financing receivables, including 1.9 billion from our US operation. Our worldwide gross Financial Services portfolio decreased $19.8 million in the first quarter, primarily due to $26 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects. The 60 day plus delinquency rate of 1.7% for the United States extended credit is up 20 basis points from a year ago, but remains well below level seen in 2008 to 2010 and improved 10 basis points sequentially.  As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, the largest portion of the portfolio, trailing 12 month net losses of $50.4 million represented 2.99% of outstandings at quarter-end, up 8 basis points sequentially of which approximately 4 basis points is as a result of the unfavorable foreign currency effects on the portfolio.  Now, turning to Slide 12, cash provided by operating activities of $213.4 million in the quarter increased $12.1 million from comparable 2019 levels, primarily reflecting net changes in operating assets and liabilities, including decreases in working investment, partially offset by lower net earnings.  Net cash used by investing activities of $49.8 million included capital expenditures of $17.2 million and net additions to finance receivables of $22.1 million. Additions to and collections of finance receivables were consistent with that of the prior year.  In the quarter, our free cash flow from operating company of $143 million improved $10.7 million, as lower working investment largely offset the change in year-over-year net earnings. Additionally, the first quarter of 2019 cash flow reflected the settlement of a legal matter which resulted in a decrease in accrued liabilities of $11.6 million in that prior year period.  Total free cash flow or cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures and the net change in finance receivables of $174.1 million represented 123% of net earnings. Net Cash used by financing activities of 157.1 million included cash dividends of $59 million and the repurchase of 349,000 shares of common stock for $50.5 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $313.3 million of common stock under existing authorizations.  Turning to Slide 13, trade and other accounts receivable decreased $59.4 million from 2019 your end including $21.9 million from unfavorable foreign currency translation. Days sales outstanding of 62 days, compared to 67 days at 2019 year-end. Inventories decreased $3 million, including 25.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency from 2019 year-end. On a trailing 12 month basis inventory turns of 2.5 compared to 2.6 at year-end 2019.  At quarter-end cash position of $185.8 million compared to $184.5 million at year-end 2019. Our net debt to capital ratio of 21.7% compared to 22.1 at year-end 2019. At the end of the quarter, we had $150 million of short-term borrowings under our $800 billion revolving credit facility that terminates in September 2024. These funds were largely utilized to pay down commercial paper outstanding at year-end 2019. As such, there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at the end of the quarter, and our net debt levels were similar to year-end.  As of the end of the quarter, we were well within the permitted ranges set forth in the credit facilities financial covenants. Despite the uncertainty in the credit and financial markets, we currently believe we have sufficient available cash and access to both committed and uncommitted credit facilities to cover expected funding needs in both the near term and on a long term basis.  That concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few updated outlook items. While we do not generally provide quarterly sales or earnings projections in the near term, we anticipate no improvement in the macroeconomic environment. And as a result, expect sales, credit originations and earnings in the second quarter of 2020 to be lower than those in the same period last year.  We now anticipate that capital expenditures will be in a range of $70 million to $80 million as compared to our prior estimate of $90 million to $100 billion. Additionally, we currently anticipate that our full year 2020 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 25%.  I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Good morning. Scott. I don't have the exact delinquency numbers in front of me. But they would be not so dissimilar to what you're seeing today. But the losses went up about 100 basis points. I think I mentioned earlier on the call, they hit a peak in a negative sense in Q4 of '09, and then moved from around 3% over the portfolio to around 4%. And then they declined back to below 3% until recent times, so that gives you a range I guess or a feel for what it might be like. For sure, if you actually go Dave, remember, we're making our accounting adjustments effective at the end of the fiscal quarter, so that's March, so you have to keep that in mind as well and performance off the back of the van \u2013 performance for extended credit originations in general were pretty good. Yes, they were stronger at the beginning of the month than they were at the end of the month. But the performance was pretty good. And the performance of collection activity was pretty good. So it wasn't quite as good as Q1 of last year, which we actually saw lower levels of provisions in charge offs. But there was actually a better performance than what you would \u2013 had seen as a normal run rate. So we took that into account when we increase the reserve and then on top of it, we have to take a forward look, under CECL.  This gets to be a little bit more judgmental, certainly, because we've pressure tested the portfolio idea of circumstances of preparing for CECL's adoption. And actually, there's not any single variable that correlates so perfectly with it. So we look at a myriad of different things, and we have to apply some judgment. Having said all of that, we came to a conclusion that we thought it was appropriate to increase reserve by about $2.6 million. I'd say it's more specifically for the forward look. So it's not like it was nothing of dispensing the 500,000, just in reference to the sequential movement. But the CECL adjustment actually within the quarter was about 2.6 million and if you look at the level of reserves at the end of March as compared to the end of December, actually roughly 15% in total, so it's not like it's nothing. Well, people think first off the \u2013 its early days. It was launched on March 23. We've had programs like this before, so timing is even better with the advent of CECL, you could look at this as not at CECL with the COVID-19. So you can look at this as a form of being able to help customers out. But we've done programs like this in the past. So it's not like it's something radical in any way, shape or form. So we'll see what the uptake is. But as of the end of March, it was only in the in the field for about the less than seven days, I guess, given our fiscal cut off, I think was March 29, so you have that.  Now, you have a separate program, where we grant forbearance or can allow extensions to certain people that's on a case by case basis. It is for a limited number of weeks. We try to work \u2013 one thing I'd snap on this it's personal, and that's not a bad word. Some people shy away from the word personal these days with the pandemic, but we're pretty intimate with our customers and we know our customers, both our franchisees and they know their end mechanics and we have to reach out and help them, but it was a relatively small percentage. I think it will increase going into Q2, but geez, I think at the end of the quarter, it might have been less than 5% of people had asked for some type of forbearance if you want to use that word. We measure origination to the same each and every quarter. It doesn't change because of what's going on. So extending credit can include both add-ons as well as sale of brand new products. But to be able to do so customers have to be in good standing. So in other words, if you want to add on to a contract, you've to be a customer that one has additional credit capacity, so we measure people's credit limits in that regard. And then it's got to be a minimum dollar sale in addition, which is typically I think, $300 and up. If you remember the cut off usually is more dollars than that, but that would be at least 300. So that's one of the determinants as to when people add on and add on to a contract they already have in place. Well, first and foremost, you want to support the ongoing operations. And that's kind of obvious. You're in a mode here where I think people will be careful with their cash. I think no one has perfect visibility when you look forward. So the forecast with precision is not easy in normal times, let alone rockier times. So you're going to want to keep an eye on cash inflows, and of course, cash outflows. And one of the more discretionary items actually would be share repurchase. When we look at share repurchase, I would put that on the list of one of the more discretionary items. So first and foremost, I look at what's the cash position to the corporation, and how does that fit into the equation. I thought that Snap-on was a great bargain at $150 per share is even a better bargain today. Does that mean I can't buy it at a lower price tomorrow? I just don't know with certainty, so again, we have to apply judgment. Thank you."

Nick?\nNick Pinchuk: Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. Today, I'll start with a view of our fourth quarter, give you an update on the environment and the trends we see and I'll take you through some of the turbulence we've overcome and the advancements we've made and Aldo will then, as usual, give you a more detailed review of the financials. The fourth quarter was encouraging. It affirm the characteristics that make Snap-on the company we know it to be, the resilience of our markets, the power of our strategic position and the consistent and capable execution of our teams. It all added up to momentum, cutting through the challenges and the numbers testified to just that. Our reported sales in the quarter of $1,108.3 million were up 3.2%, including $12.2 million from acquisitions being offset by $3 million of unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Organically, our sales grew by 2.3%. Importantly, if you compare to the prepandemic levels of 2019, before the period-to-period variability of last year, you see a clear and unmistakable upward drive. Versus 2019, sales in this past quarter were up 16% as reported and 13% organically, continuing an ongoing trend of accelerating expansion, increasing higher and higher over pre-COVID levels. The quarter also bears the marks of the Snap-on value creation processes. Safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, as we call it, all combining to offer significant progress. The progress, there was. Opco operating income of $232.2 million was up $16.16 million point from last year and the OI margin was 21%, an all-time high, up 90 basis points from last year and 310 basis points from 2019, all achieved by overcoming the challenges of this day. For financial services, operating income of $67.2 million was down from the $68.5 million of last year. But delinquencies in the quarter were below both 2020 and those of 2019, an ongoing testament to our unique business model and it's ability to navigate through the most threatening of environments. And the combination of results from opco and financial services offered an overall consolidated operating margin of 25.1%, up from the 24.4% of last year and the 22.5% recorded in 2019. Our quarterly EPS was $4.10, well over the $3.82 of a year ago which included a $0.02 charge for restructuring. And that $4.10 was up 33.1% over 2019, a considerable gain in my book. Those are the numbers. Now, let's speak about the markets. We do believe the auto repair environment continues to be favorable. In the areas serving vehicle OEMs and dealerships, we do see some turbulence. New car sales around the world remain mixed, with China generally progressing but both North America and Europe having a tough fourth quarter. Overall volume below the 2019 levels and some new model releases and features were delayed by supply chain constraints and that impacted the associated essential tool programs that we are involved in. OEM projects aside, however, dealership repair, maintenance and warranty are all healthy. Techs are seeing good times and the dealers are looking to support their expansion in their shop. In effect, the OEM market is mixed but technicians are quite positive. There's a growing appetite for repair shop equipment but essential tool programs are attenuated. Now in the independent repair shop, it's a horse of a different color. Confidence is uniformly sky high. Based on what we hear from our franchisees, shop owners and technicians, optimism and independent repair shop continues to be strong. And our sales in that sector may reflect that confidence. So we believe, on balance, vehicle repair is a great place to operate for our tools too and for our Repair System & Information or RS&I Group. The critical industries where our Commercial & Industrial group play or C&I plays, we are seeing areas of progress but the lingering effects of virus have created headwinds. And the results in the quarter showed that trend with variations from country to country. A recovery in Asia and emerging markets but Europe being quite mixed. There are also differences from sector to sector. Education, natural resources and general industry showing improvement while the military spending continues to experience, what I'd say, a substantial challenges. Overall, however, I would describe our C&I markets as holding their own against the turbulence, public variation. We do believe we're well positioned and I think the numbers say this, to confront the challenges of this time, advancing a long ways for growth. We're also confident that we have continuing potential on our runways for improvement. The Snap-on Value Creation processes, they're a constant fuel for our progress, especially customer connection, understanding the work of professional technicians; and innovation, matching that insight to technology. We believe our product lineup just keeps getting stronger every day and we keep investing to make it so. Vehicles are rising in complexity, technicians needs assistance and so products are becoming more sophisticated to match the changing requirements and Snap-on is keeping pace. In 2021, we had more hit $1 million projects than ever before. We've endeavored through the virus era to maintain our product, our brand, I've spoken of this before. And the virus era, we've endeavored to maintain our product, our brand and our people. And we believe that continuing commitment has served us well, offering positive results and creating substantial momentum for the days ahead. And that momentum is apparent in our full year results. Sales of $4,252 million, up 18.4% including an organic increase of 15.1% compared to last year and a 14% organic gain over 2019. Strong numbers. The as-reported opco OI margin for the year was 20%, a new high, up from the 17.6% of 2020, exceeding the 19.2% of the prepandemic 2019. As-reported earnings per share for the year were $14.92, up 30.4%, or 28.3% as adjusted for the nonrecurring restructuring and the restructuring in 2020 and up 21.7% as adjusted from 2019. All clear signs of ongoing momentum. Now, for the operating groups. Let's start with C&I. Fourth quarter sales of $358.7 million for the group were down $5.7 million, including $4.1 million of unfavorable currency. Versus 2019, sales grew $5.8 million, reflecting primarily acquisition volume and currency impact. The period saw a recovery in Asia with Indonesia. And in the quarter, we saw -- we did see a recovery in Asia with Indonesia, India, Japan, South Korea and China rising. Europe and North America were more impacted by the environment and were down slightly in the quarter. Looking at the sectors, nice progress with our precision -- was achieved in our precision torque line. And that progress was -- but that progress was more than offset by lower critical industry activity attenuated in those critical industries, primarily by lower U.S. military spending and by supply chain-driven constraints and in the custom kitting area. C&I operating income was $50.1 million, down $6.1 million, including $1.2 million of unfavorable currency. The gains in Asia and the torque were more than offset by the reduced military activity in the industrial kitting constraints. As I mentioned, however, specialty torque -- the specialty torque operation did register continuing progress driven by innovative new products, developed through customer connection and observational work. Great offerings like our recently released QB4R line of 3/4-inch Drive Break-Over Torque Wrenches, capable of -- this wrench is capable of accurately fastening from 450- to 750-pound feet. It's designed specifically for heavy-duty applications, tough jobs such as torquing lug nuts on big trucks. The new unit combines our Norbar, our regionally acquired Norbar industrial torque technology with a robust ratchet designs produced on Elizabeth and Tennessee factory. Those original light vehicle ratcheting mechanisms of our Tennessee plant were reengineered for higher tension heavy requirements and were directly matched to our unique Norbar breakover device which provides a clear indication that the torque target has been reached, ensuring reliable accuracy every time. The ratchet design with our patent steel head is rugged, capable of withstanding very high stresses and has an easy-to-read adjustment mechanism that reduces the possibility of error and is virtually maintenance-free. The new wrench also has a quick release feature for easy disassembly, compact storage and great portability. The Snap-on QB4R, we like to say strength, accuracy and convenience. And as you might expect, sales have been strong. As the need for precision increases, torque products are becoming more prominent and Snap-on is playing an active role in that rise. C&I, mixed results but significant areas of progress boding well for it's future. Now let's go on to the Tools Group. Sales of $504.8 million, up $9.9 million, including favorable currency and a $7.9 million organic rise from continued expansion in the U.S., a positive that was somewhat attenuated this quarter by a low single-digit decline in the international networks. But versus 2019, a more comparable base, the Tools Group rose 21.5% and has been up now from prepandemic levels for six straight quarters. And the operating margin was 21.9%, easily one of the highest ever, up 300 basis points from last year, all despite the ongoing challenges of this day. We have continued to invest in product, brand and people. And the Tools Group has used that focus to advantage. The expanding and considerable gains from the time before the virus makes that clear. In the quarter and throughout the year, the Tools Group results continue to confirm the leadership position of our van network. We believe the franchisees are growing stronger and that's evidenced in the franchisee health metrics we monitor each period. They're on an unmistakably favorable trend. And that positivity was acknowledged by multiple publications, all this thing Snap-on as a franchise of choice. This quarter, we were once again ranked among the top franchise organizations, both in the U.S. and abroad, recognized by the Franchise Business Review which in it's latest ranking for franchisee satisfaction, listed Snap-on as the top 50 franchise for the 15th consecutive year. We're also featured at number three among all franchises in Entrepreneurial Magazine's 2020 list of top franchises for veterans. And abroad, Snap-on was ranked number two in Elite Franchise Magazine's top U.K. franchises. The judges in that ranking state that the durability and innovation shown in the face of unimaginable circumstances are what is decided in this year's top 10 and the panel was right on. Durability and innovation are what makes the Tools Group -- what marks the Tools Group in the storm is clear. Now this type of recognition is a point of pride for us but it reflects the fundamental strength of our franchisees and of our van business in general but it would not have been achieved without a continuous stream of innovative new products developed through our strong customer connections, learning and leading to multiple new problem solving innovations. And the results of our insight in experience in the changing universe of vehicle repair. Customer connection gives us a great window on that changing universe and we put it to good use. Our sales of hand tools were up nicely in the quarter. And of course, new products led the way there. Our innovative 30, LS, DM, core half-inch drive impact sockets were a significant contributor. Born out of customer connection, observing the work in automotive shops, the special sockets, they range from to 17 to 22 millimeters, come with an extra deep hex, up to 3/4 inch deeper, accommodating the lug nuts with decorative caps that are becoming so common on the latest models. The new sockets provide the clearance needed to fit right over those nut covers without damage, grab the lug and enable quick removal without having to remove the caps. It saves techs significant time over a day of repair activity. They made right here in our Milwaukee plant. They released just this past quarter and initial sales have been gangbusters, I'm telling you. And making those sales have made that new socket line a hit product just in the volume in the fourth quarter. Accelerated sales. Well, that's the Tools Group, expanding the success in the U.S., balancing the international operations, continuing to innovate, building on our underlying advantages, stronger-than-ever performance all achieved against the wind. Now for RS&I; volume for the fourth quarter was $392.5 million, up 8.7%, including acquisitions and 5.5% of organic growth with gains in sales of modern car equipment, increased volume of handheld diagnostics and the rise of information and data subscriptions being partially offset by a decrease in our business focused on vehicle OEMs and dealerships. RS&I operating margins of $97.2 million rose $7.2 million or 8% versus 2020. And that number in 2020 included $1 million of restructuring costs. Compared with the prepandemic levels of 2019, sales grew $57.5 million, 17.2%, including a $43.7 million or 13% organic gain. And the RS&I gross OI margin of 24.8% compared with a 24.9% and a 26% registered in 2020 and 2010, respectively, with the impact of acquisitions attenuating a generally positive balance for the operations. Again, software products and subscriptions for RS&I were a significant plus. Along those lines, I'll mention one division, providing software to independent shops, continue to succeed, pursuing customer connection and innovation, launching great new products to improve shop efficiency. RS&I just added more powerful and exclusive features to it's award-winning Mitchell 1 ProDemand auto repair information software. You see, as auto electronics have expanded, wiring diagrams have become of rising importance in vehicle diagnosis and repair. And the new ProDemand significantly advances what is already a clear lead from Mitchell 1 in diagram navigation, offering new features that provide interactive drop-downs, display connection data, allow easy movement to the next diagram on the diagnostic trail and enable a seamless recall of previous viewed circuits should a look-back be needed in the repair process. And as you might expect, the initial reactions to the new updates have been quite enthusiastic from both the shops and from the technicians. It's all music to our ears. We keep driving to expand RS&I's position with repair shop owners and managers, offering them more and more solutions for their day-to-day challenges, developed by our value creation processes or added by our strategic coherent acquisitions. And we're confident it's a winning formula. So those are the highlights of the quarter, doing what we expect to do, achieve ongoing process again -- achieve ongoing progress against the storm. A continuing rise versus the prepandemic levels, up more each quarter now for several straight periods. Gains forged through our Snap-on Value Creation processes, strengthening our business and driving to a 21% opco operating margin, up 90 basis points. A new record. EPS $4.10, a considerable rise to new heights, overcoming all headwinds and demonstrating continued confirmation that Snap-on has emerged from the pandemic much stronger than when we entered with the momentum that we're confident will propel us to even higher heights as we move forward. Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?\nAldo Pagliari: Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the resilience and continued strength of our business model enabled Snap-on to close the year with another period of robust financial performance. The quarter also compared favorably with the fourth quarter of 2019 which being a pre-COVID-19 time period, in some cases, may serve to be the more meaningful baseline. Net sales of $1,108.3 million in the quarter increased 3.2% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 2.3% organic sales gain and a $12.2 million of acquisition-related sales, partially offset by $3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Additionally, net sales in the period increased 16% from $955.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, including a 13% organic gain, $20.9 million of acquisition-related sales and $7.1 million of favorable foreign currency translation. In both comparisons, the organic gains more than offset lower sales for the military. Consolidated gross margin of 48.1% improved 10 basis points from 48% last year. The gross margin contributions from the higher sales volume, pricing actions, 30 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects and benefits from the company's RCI initiatives offset higher material and other costs. For the quarter, the corporation continued to navigate effectively the supply chain dynamics associated with the global pandemic. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 27.1%, improved 80 basis points from 27.9% last year which included 10 basis points of cost from restructuring actions. The improvement is primarily due to higher sales volumes, partially offset by 40 basis points of unfavorable acquisition effect. Operating earnings before financial services of $232.2 million compared to $216.2 million in 2020 and $171.4 million in 2019, reflecting an improvement of 7.4% and 35.5%, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 21% improved 90 basis points from last year and 310 basis points from 2019. The operating company margin of 21% represents the highest quarterly level of profitability in Snap-on's modern day history. Financial services revenue of $86.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to $93.4 million last year which included an extra week of interest income associated with the 53rd week 2020 fiscal calendar. Operating earnings of $67.2 million decreased $1.3 million from 2020 levels, reflecting the lower revenue, partially offset by lower provisions for credit losses. Consolidated operating earnings of $299.4 million increased 5.2% from $284.7 million last year and 28.2% from $233.6 million in 2019. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 25.1% compared to 24.4% in 2020 and 22.5% in 2019. Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 22.3% compared to 21.8% last year which includes a 10 basis point increase related to the restructuring actions. Net earnings of $223.7 million or $4.10 per diluted share increased $14.8 million or $0.28 per share from last year's levels, representing a 7.3% increase in diluted earnings per year. As compared to the fourth quarter 2019, net earnings increased $53.1 million or $1.02 per share, representing a 33.1% increase in diluted earnings per share. Now let's turn to our segment results, starting with the C&I group on Slide 7. Sales of $358.7 million decreased from $364.4 million last year, reflecting a $1.6 million organic sales decline and $4.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic decrease primarily reflects a low single-digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries. Within critical industries, lower sales to the military were partially offset by gains in general industry and technical education as well as by improved sales into oil and gas applications. As a further comparison, net sales in the period increased 1.6% from 2016 levels, reflecting $8.7 million of acquisition-related sales and $3.8 million of favorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by a $6.7 million organic sales decline. As compared to 2019, sales in our European-based hand tools business were up mid-teens. Those gains were more than offset by lower activity with the military. As you may recall, the fourth quarter of 2019 included sales for a major project that is substantially complete. Gross margin of 36.5% declined 130 basis points from 37.8% in the fourth quarter of 2020 primarily due to the higher material and other costs, partially offset by benefits from RCI initiatives. While pricing actions have been taken in this segment to help offset the increasing cost, the longer-term nature of certain customer agreements affects the timing of price realization. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22.5% in the quarter compared to 22.4% last year. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $50.1 million compared to $56.2 million last year. The operating margin of 14% compared to 15.4% a year ago. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $504.8 million increased 2% from $494.9 million in 2020, reflecting a 1.6% organic sales gain and $2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase reflects a low single-digit gain in our U.S. business, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in our international operations. Net sales in the period increased 22.6% from $411.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, reflecting a 21.5% organic sales gain and $3.9 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Sales gains in the quarter were led by our hand tools category with strong performance sequentially as well as versus both the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019. Gross margin of 43.9% in the quarter improved 100 basis points from last year, primarily due to the higher sales volumes, pricing actions and 60 basis points from favorable foreign currency effects which offset higher material and other costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22% improved from 24% last year, primarily reflecting the higher sales and benefits from ongoing RCI and cost containment efforts. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $110.5 million compared to $93.6 million last year. The operating margin of 21.9% improved 300 basis points from 18.9% last year. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $392.5 million compared to $361.1 million a year ago, reflecting a 5.5% organic sales gain and $12.2 million of acquisition-related sales, partially offset by $500,000 of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain is comprised of a double-digit increase in sales of undercar equipment and a mid-single-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers, partially offset by a low single-digit decrease in sales to OEM dealerships. Also during the quarter, the RS&I Group continue to benefit from the increasing number of monthly software subscribers for it's aftermarket and dealership repair shops. As compared to 2019 levels, net sales increased $57.5 million from $335 million, reflecting a 13% organic sales gain, $12.2 million of acquisition-related sales and $1.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Gross margin of 46.1% was unchanged from last year as benefits from pricing actions and 60 basis points from acquisitions were offset by higher material and other costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales was 21.3% compared to 21.2% last year, primarily dot [ph] to 150 basis points of unfavorable acquisition effects, partially offset by the impact of higher sales and 30 basis points from lower expenses related to $1 million of restructuring costs that were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $97.2 million compared to $90 million last year. The operating margin of 24.8% compared to 24.9% a year ago. Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services of $86.9 million decreased $6.5 million from $93.4 million last year, primarily as a result of an additional week of interest income occurring in the 53rd 2020 fiscal year. Financial services operating earnings of $67.2 million compared to $68.5 million in 2020. Financial services expenses of $19.7 million were down $5.2 million from 2020 levels, primarily due to $5.6 million of decreased provisions for credit losses resulting from favorable loan portfolio trends, including reduced year-over-year net charge-offs which support lower forward-looking estimated reserve requirements. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 0.9% and 1.4% in the fourth quarter of 2021 and 2020, respectively. In the fourth quarters of both 2021 and 2020, the average yield on finance receivables was 17.7% and the average yield on contract receivables was 8.5%. Total loan originations of $256.3 million in the fourth quarter decreased $16.1 million or 5.9% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 3.6% decrease in originations of finance receivables and a 16.6% decrease in originations of contract receivables. Last year's extra week in the quarter contributed approximately $10 million of finance receivable originations. As a reminder, revenues in the quarter are generally dependent on the average size of the financing portfolio rather than originations in any one period. Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our U.S. operation. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.6% for U.S. extended credit compared to 1.8% in the fourth quarter of 2020. On a sequential basis, the rate is up 20 basis points, reflecting the typical seasonal increase we experienced between the third and fourth quarters. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $41.1 million represented 2.38% of outstandings at quarter end, down 24 basis points as compared to the same period last year. Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $222.7 million in the quarter reflects 97.2% of net earnings and compared to $317.6 million the last year. The decrease from the fourth quarter of 2020 primarily reflects higher cash payments for income and other taxes, an $85 million increase in working investment, partially offset by higher net earnings. The change in working investment is largely driven by increased receivables and higher levels of inventory this year versus a reduction of inventory in 2020. The increase in inventory primarily reflects higher demand as well as incremental buffer stocks and expanded levels of in-transit inventories associated with the supply chain dynamics in the current macro environment. Net cash used by investing activities of $23.8 million included net additions to finance receivables of $9.7 million and $16.3 million of capital expenditures. Net cash used by financing activities of $154.1 million included cash dividends of $76.1 million and a repurchase of 355,000 shares of common stock for $75.5 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of year-end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $454.9 million of common stock under existing authorizations. The 2021 full year free cash flow generation of $872.6 million represented about 104% of net earnings. Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $41.6 million from 2020 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 58 days compared to 64 days at 2020 year-end. Inventories increased $57.3 million from 2020 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.8x compared to 2.4x at year-end 2020. Our year-end cash position of $780 million compared to $923.4 million at year-end 2020. Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 9.1% compared to 12.1% at year-end 2020. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million available under our credit facilities. As of year-end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2022. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. In addition, we currently anticipate, absent any changes to U.S. tax legislation, that our full year 2022 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%. So, I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?\nNick Pinchuk: Thanks, Aldo. That's our fourth quarter. Positive performance, overcoming challenges as we expect to do. In these times of turbulence, we continue to rise based on the resilience of our markets, vehicle repair expanding at the shop level, tax pumped and garage is optimistic, overcoming the postponement of essential OEM programs. Critical industry is mixed but with promising areas, gains in general industry, natural resources and education and progress in emerging markets. Difficulties are in the air but we're able to prosper nonetheless on the power of our strategic position, controlling the customer interface with our wide product line and unique brand. And perhaps most importantly, we rose on the consistent and capable execution by our team, employing agile marketing, considered an active pricing, new and higher-value products, quick redesigns to match available materials, aggressive spot buying and as always, our ongoing RCI. It's a combination that offers another positive performance and has all spelled out clearly in our numbers. Sales rising organically over prepandemic levels by 13% with the last four periods, up organically 8%, 9%, 11% and 13%, expanding the gain over 2019, demonstrating a positive second derivative in the rising sales quarter-by-quarter. Opco OI margins of 21%, a record high in the midst of multiple challenges, up 90 basis points from last year and up substantially more from 2019. And it all came together for an EPS of $4.10, up 7.2% from last year and 33% from the prepandemic period, leading to a full year EPS of $14.92, new heights despite the storm. It was an encouraging quarter and a year. The period clearly had challenges but we were able to overcome maintaining our progress, extending our upward trend. And we believe that Snap-on exits 2021 with a substantial momentum that will carry us forward. And as we mine the abundant opportunities of our resilient markets, we held the advantages of our unique strategic position and engage the considerable capabilities of our challenged-tested team. We'll continue to track progress throughout 2022 and well beyond. Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. Many of them are listening to this call. My friends, you are the base of the success we've registered this quarter and this year. For the extraordinary progress you achieved, you have my congratulations. For the unique individual and collective capabilities you brought to bear against the challenges, you have my admiration. And for the commitment you bring to our now and the conviction you hold in our future, you have my thanks. Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Scott Stember with CL King.\nScott Stember: Hi, good morning, guys and thanks for taking my questions. \nNick Pinchuk: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Stember: To better frame things out, obviously, as the comparisons are getting more difficult, can you maybe talk about, in the Tools Group, in the U.S., on a two year stack and maybe also sort of flush it out by tools and some of the other segments?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, look, I think the Tools Group is demonstrating itself. I mean, if you look at the prepandemic levels, it's been up now six straight quarters and it was up over 21% in this quarter. I think it was 21.5%. So it seems to be moving upwards. And all of our good power -- in this time of turbulence, the Tools Group is really well positioned. When I say a strategic advantage of being -- with wide product line and unique brand to control the interface with the end customer, that's exactly what the Tools Group does in spades. It's able to price. It's able to bring value, new value products that don't look like price increases because people are paying for more features. And so that's a very strong position they have. Also, they can market agilely. So if you have supply chain problems, they can pitch their promotions to move people towards what we have a lot of and have a way somewhat from things we have less of. At the same time, they're working pretty well in the factories because they're vertically integrated. So you see their kind of numbers. The 21.9%, I think we were very encouraged by when we saw it. And so you see the Tools Group doing well in sales, in terms of profitability. And if you look back to 2019, what's happened is, I think I said before, is that we have figured out over the period, we were investing in SG&A in, say, like '18 and '19 to try to figure out how to expand the Tools Group's selling capability. And it seems to have worked. Our selling capability, our franchisees has gone up each quarter over that. You can see the expansion. The second derivative looks pretty good. So you're seeing that play out. What we're doing now is we're, of course, plumbing the ceiling of that, see how far it would take us. And we're investing and looking at other possibilities to keep that string going. We think -- we don't know how far those things we understood in terms of social media, in terms of being able to train more effectively will bring us but we're pretty optimistic about it. And I thought I was pretty clear about our views about momentum going forward in this period. If you look at RS&I, RS&I start to come back -- I mean, the thing it's had some good quarters but it's had some quarters where the margins were down. But this quarter, 23.8%, down 10 basis points and that's against multiple that get -- much more, like 80 or 90 basis points of acquisition impact. And what you see in RS&I is continuing positivity around the independent repair shops, particularly diagnostics and information products and the rise of subscriptions and software keeps ticking up because we keep emphasizing that, particularly things like the innovation you heard about Mitchell in terms of navigating the wiring diagrams and the car -- it deals those kind of situations. So you see that playing out. RS&I, I think they were up 5.5% organically in the quarter and up 13% versus -- last year and up 13% versus prepandemic levels, another very positive quarter. C&I is more vulnerable to the turbulence of the date because you have a lot of mixed markets. C&I is in a lot of sectors, a lot of countries. And in that cocktail, you see some countries that are down, particularly in Europe in this quarter which was difficult for you. And then C&I in some of the businesses, I did say, the customized toolkits, well, these customized toolkits are great. Just great margins on them but you have in those kits sometimes a couple of hundred tools. And the sourcing situation of today, when you're going to deliver those all, many of them from individual sources, you can get disruptive in terms of when you're going to be able to deliver and create some problems. And then on top of it for C&I, a big piece in the critical industry is the military business is pretty weak. We always -- we expect that to come back and we expect C&I to come forward. But we see Tools Group gangbusters. We see RS&I coming back, coming back from -- they've been -- they have been weak but they're getting better. They're heating up. You can see that number. And you see C&I kind of holding its own, kind of flat sales. But we figure as we get better at managing the situation, we have a challenged-tested team that does pretty well in this C&I is going to keep coming back. So we like our momentum going forward.\nScott Stember: Got it. And just last question. This seems to be the first quarter that we've heard about or any quasi meaningful impact from supply chain. Can you maybe talk about that? And any further mitigation efforts that you guys could put through, whether it's RCI or anything else?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, let me just say, though, I didn't say -- I said when I burrowed down on C&I, I mentioned supply chain. But our view of this is it's always something. It's always something. And if you look at our numbers, up, what, 15% -- 13% over prepandemic levels, 21% OI margin. I don't know if you look at the numbers, you can see any turbulence in those numbers. So I think we're managing through it. Yes, of course, it will get better as we go forward. I mean, it's hard for me to predict. But as you get into the moment, you get better at managing it. Right now, we're pretty good at agile marketing. We're good at managing or redesigning our products. We're good at spot buying. So we don't get it disruptive in general. We have certain modules of disruption that we'll figure out and we'll solve but you don't really get that kind of problem going forward. Now some of our businesses like, for example, you could look at tool storage. We could sell more tool storage if we could turn some more out and we're working on that. So you may see some of that going forward. But I don't accept the idea that we're being impacted by this. We're dealing with it. I think the number is saying, that was a good quarter whether we thought we had turbulence or not.\nScott Stember: Got it. Thanks for the color. That's all I had.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Bret Jordan with Jefferies.\nBret Jordan: Hey, good morning, guys.\nNick Pinchuk: Good morning.\nAldo Pagliari: Good morning, Bret. \nBret Jordan: You called out, I guess, some of the pricing contracts in C&I as obviously, costs of everything have gone up versus the prices you received. Could you talk maybe about the magnitude and the timing of some of the pricing resets that you have going forward?\nNick Pinchuk: Yes. I don't -- they're all over the map in terms of that situation and they're by segment. But look, C&I is -- I just -- our point there was C&I is a longer wave business. So you have commitments with some customers, not all customers, so you see some impact on that and you price associated with that. We're getting some pricing in C&I, some but not as much as not other things. Our big thing isn't so much about pricing. It's managing those costs. And so the idea of C&I, I think our disruption is mostly associated with what I pointed out in terms of the custom kitting situation, trying to deliver those things. That's been more probably the biggest impact on this, attenuating some of their volumes, particularly in critical industries.\nBret Jordan: Okay. great. And then within the OE business, was there any improvement in cadence as we got through the quarter? Obviously, some of the OEs on the auto side are talking about some improvement in supply chain but did you see any change in their buying patterns as the quarter progressed?\nNick Pinchuk: Yes, I'd be kidding. Their fourth quarter was terrible, wasn't it? I thought the fourth quarter for those guys was brutal. So we didn't see much -- if we're talking about projects, we didn't see much cadence difference. I mean, actually, there's a lot of new models coming out that are going to come out new features and I don't think we saw any cadence change in the quarter. Now I'm on shaky ground a little bit about saying that there might have been some of it but I -- my macro view of it, Bret, is it was a tough quarter for the auto companies. So I think as we go forward, it's got to get better. They're going to shake loose some of those. And so we're going to get -- because we're already involved in some of those products, we're just waiting for them to come out. That's what I see. I think the -- if you look at the dealerships, if you go -- like I thought I'd try to make clear, at the dealerships level, the repair is great at that situation. So we're seeing dealerships buy equipment. And one of the upticks in we didn't -- I don't think I mentioned it here but one of the upticks in the RS&I business, it's a rise -- a nice rise in repair shop undercar equipment. Collision and the balances and changes and those kinds of things. And so that's been going up. Also, they're buying software from us. So that's pretty good in that situation. But if you're talking about the programs out of the OEM, your guess is as good as mine when that breaks loose. All we know is they've got a backlog in there that's going to be good for us when it breaks.\nBret Jordan: Okay, great. And then one final question. I guess you called out hand tools as strong in the Tools Group a couple of times. Did you say what the spread was sort of hand tools relative to storage and diagnostics?\nNick Pinchuk: I did not.\nBret Jordan: Why did not?\nNick Pinchuk: And the reason is I want to get away from talking about the numbers by product line in the Tools Group. To us, it doesn't matter. We skin the cat many ways. So the point about the Tools Group is 21.9% margin. Now hand tools were a nice piece of that. But I will tell you the big ticket items were also up in that period. Tool storage and diagnostics were up. The hand tools are sort of the flavor of the day -- these days because, of course, we're more vertically integrated. Fundamentally, when the hand tool comes in the door, all we add is steel, capital and labor, boom. So it was -- but it's been strong for a number of different periods. So, I don't really want to get down that road. Just saying hand tools was a nice product. Nice -- but as was diagnostics in the period and we had increases in tool storage as well.\nBret Jordan: Okay, great. Thank you.\nNick Pinchuk: Great.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Luke Junk with Baird.\nLuke Junk: Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. First question, Nick, I wanted to ask a follow-up on something that you mentioned a couple callers ago and that's regarding the investment spending past year as we begin '22 or maybe even more broadly as we go through the next few years at this stage of the cycle, you've been steadfast about maintaining the rate of investment in the Tools Group, in particular and you referenced plumbing to death of these capacity creation initiatives from here. Just wondering if you're able to talk about any new focus areas, or within the capacity creation initiatives where we might see the company push a little incrementally in '22?\nNick Pinchuk: Look, I think this, we have -- of course, we're taking a look at where -- how we source and where we need more capacity in the factories and those kinds of things. But I don't see it there -- I don't see it distorting our financials in that regard. I think a couple of things. When I said that I didn't mean that the OE was going to explode or anything like that. Fundamentally, our OE was higher before because we were spending a lot of effort and a lot of different corridors trying to figure out what would actually resonate with the Tools Group and make a difference. Our OE is in a nice place now. And of course, as you come out, you know how you say this, you're kind of loosening your belt a little bit when you've had a downtick in the COVID but I think our OE is at a nice level. It may go up a little bit but not that much. We're not going to -- but the areas where we're going to spend, I think, would be -- we're going to push more on social media because we've learned more about that. Boy, you know what, we've got a lot of data on our franchisees. We get the franchisees and our customers. We got oodles of data and we could do a better job in terms of predictive behavior on those things. So we're spending time looking at that right now. I don't have anything to report other than, boy, it's obvious to us we have Mitchell-type SureTrack data which we have about cars. We have that about our customers. And so we think we'll be able to wheel that to make the Tools Group even more effective. So our guys can make better choices when they engage customers. That's probably another area we're looking at right now.\nLuke Junk: Okay. And then I want to ask a bigger picture question as a follow-up. Thank you for that. Dealer FX were, I think, approaching the one year anniversary of that acquisition. I don't know if you could to progress in year one under the company's ownership? And looking forward, more importantly, should we expect to hear more about this business in the future as a complementary software platform sitting alongside Mitchell 1 in that dealership environment? Thank you.\nNick Pinchuk: Sure. I mean, look, I think that's why we bought it for two reasons. One, from a financial point of view, it is a twin of Mitchell 1. And I don't know if you're familiar with Mitchell 1 but if you pay -- I know you are, we've been paying -- we've been talking about the growth of our diagnostics and software in independent repair shops almost every quarter since I've been here. They just keep going upward. Boom, boom, boom. And so Mitchell 1 knows how to handle that interface. And so we're using that knowledge that, I would say, challenged-tested understanding of the business to apply to Dealer FX and in the fullness of time, that's going to work it's magic there. We believe we'll have a kind of a twin. I'm not saying it's going to be as great as Mitchell 1, it may be but it's going to be a good business. So you're going to see it from a financial point of view but it's also important from us strategically because as you know, it has a window on what happens with these new technologies and the new technology is going to be the drivers of the future and it's going to call it -- help us call in the airstrikes for what product we develop because we're going to see it first in Dealer FX. So you're going to hear us talking about that. But these are early days. It's the first year. There's a lot of turbulence, these kinds of things. In terms of Canada, I think Justin Trudeau just got the COVID himself. So this impacts the activity in Canada. But I believe certainly Dealer FX was up in the quarter and we're making -- we're sort of making our expectations in this but you'll hear more of it as we go forward because it's going to be a big factor on us in terms of early warning. Also, financially.\nLuke Junk: Great. Well, yes, I appreciate that it's still early days there. That's great color and I'll leave it there.\nNick Pinchuk: Okay. Sure.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Liz Suzuki with Bank of America.\nElizabeth Suzuki: So this one is for Aldo. I guess could you just talk about the inflation impact that you expect through the course of the year and how the cadence of that could work out with the dynamic of cost and price and how that would impact the P&L?\nAldo Pagliari: Well, certainly, of course, everybody is talking more about inflation than in the past and Snap-on is not immune from that. However, Liz, I think it is something we manage and strive. First, we always look for alternative ways to reduce cost, whether that be alternative sourcing, alternative componentry, rapid continuous improvement to get some productivity. And of course, if we can't cover that, then we look for pricing actions to help us out. We do believe we have pricing power personified by the Tools Group. And then as Nick already has said, we get pricing over time in the commercial industrial group and repair systems and information in light of the fact that they have longer-term customer agreements. So, we don't immediately just put pen to paper and say, oh, it's got to be this pricing. We try and strive to see what we can offset internally. At the same time, we're cognizant of the new features we always bring to market. So rather than bring a price increase to market, our preference is, can we bring a higher featured product to market and talk more about that feature, even though it might cost more to the customer. We try to create that vision as there's more productivity being brought to market. So that's kind of our broad-based approach. So yes, there's more inflation but we'll continue to try to bring more innovation and more value add for the customer.\nNick Pinchuk: Now to put in perspective, Liz, just I'd add on that, if you just look at our hit products, we bring couple of three dozen new products every quarter to the market. So that's a big factor for us.\nElizabeth Suzuki: Great. And I guess second question is just on priorities for capital. I mean, your net debt-to-capital ratio came down about three percentage points since last year. It's at a historically low level. What are you thinking about for this upcoming year and beyond in terms of where your priorities lie?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, look, I think our priorities are still in line. I think, we believe, the best return on capital for our people -- for our investors and for constituents is investing in our business. So to the extent we can invest it in business in some of these new activities or anything like that, we will. We support that. Secondly, we have a pretty full, I would say, pipeline of acquisitions that we keep looking at. And I kind of think, call me crazy but I think in the turbulence, the acquisitions may be more available in this situation. So we're kind of hoping that -- we're kind of focused on a few things that may have some ability to move. And we're not afraid to take big ones or small ones in that situation. And then we have -- our Board just reloaded our share buyback situation and I think now another $500 million. And we have our dividend which we look at and we're kind of -- I think it's been kind of a front piece for Snap-on where we have paid a dividend every quarter for -- since 1939 and we've never reduced it. So we hold it in perpetuity in terms of our policy. And we always look to see if it's appropriate to upgrade it. So those are the kinds of things we're looking at. I think every year changes and this year, it's marked by the idea there's a lot of turbulence out there, maybe there's some opportunities for us.\nElizabeth Suzuki: Great, thank you. It's very helpful.\nOperator: And we'll go to our next question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.\nDavid MacGregor: Hi, good morning, everyone. Nick, it's encouraging to hear you leaning a little more into the data analytics. So I think that has the potential to move the needle. So congratulations on that initiative. I guess to start off with, what do you think sales of the truck were up year-over-year?\nNick Pinchuk: I think about the same. I think roughly the same as the Tools Group, I would say, in the same ballpark. In fact, if you look over -- David, if you look over two years' worth, there's differences from quarter-to-quarter. But if you look back over two years, they've been about the same, like we generally see and this quarter was the same kind of thing. There's a little bit of noise with the 53rd week and the franchisees probably doing a little more than they would order from us. But I think generally, it's roughly the same. They're in practically lockstep. So we see the inventory kind of on the Tools Group holding pretty flat.\nDavid MacGregor: Got it. And then just still on the Tools Group, you talked about the 300 basis points of operating margin improvement. About 200 basis points of that came out of SG&A and 60 basis points was FX. So clearly, it feels like the price cost pressures that everybody else in the world seems to be feeling are coming home to roost at Snap-on as well. Go ahead.\nNick Pinchuk: We make -- holding gross margins are -- is a common occurrence in this environment.\nDavid MacGregor: Well, I'm just trying to get a kind of -- I'm just trying to get it to kind of the price cost pressure.\nNick Pinchuk: It's like this though. I think, look, I think yes, we have pressures on a lot of different things. There's a lot of things that go in that gross margin and there are a lot of things that go in the SG&A. I think our view was on the OI margin in general, the up to 300 basis points. We -- I think I've said this on other calls long ago that we're kind of agnostic between those two numbers. We kind of focus on the OI margin, up 300 basis points, not bad. Now you could say, okay, well, the gross margin is up less than the OE. But if you look back to prepandemic levels, they're both up reasonably well. I think, 100 basis points and 200 basis points. And I don't think that's chop-liver in this environment. Yes, there are pressures associated with the supply and sourcing but we're able to manage it such that we don't give up anything.\nDavid MacGregor: So, I guess my question on this is really just as you look forward to 2022, Nick, you talked about is the opportunity to -- Aldo referenced the opportunity to raise pricing within the tools segment but also to bring kind of better margin products and better incremental margin products to the marketplace and cover your cost that way or cost and productivity that way. Can you give us a sense of how you're thinking about the split between those two opportunities? Do you think you'll be leaning a little more on to the pricing side and then supplementing that with a better margin product? Or are you leaning a little more towards a better margin product and supplementing that with pricing?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, generally, I think if it's the latter, I think that we would rather have it with our new products and then be foolish around those. I think it isn't a ball-based. I mean, fundamentally, I just want to come back to your original question. It would be a mistake to think that the costs weren't coursing through our numbers this quarter because they are. And so we have those and we're holding our own against those with pricing and with those -- like I said, people -- I think sometimes people don't realize how many new products we bring out. If you just look at the hit products and they're the ones that are the incandescent ones, $1 million in the first year, we have two to three dozen every quarter. And so we have a lot of opportunity in both those areas. And I think that's what allows us to maintain this. And our -- this ain't our first rodeo. So we know how to manage this. I think our team -- not me. I'm just a trained dog at the top of the [indiscernible]. But the thing is the guys know how to manage this such they can bring with the combination of direct pricing plus promotions plus the new products. They can manage that interface very well. That's what I meant about the strategic position. So we're not hanging our hands at all, David.\nDavid MacGregor: Great. Okay. I guess I wanted to also ask about the originations down, 6%. Are you -- and I noticed the yield is coming down a little bit on the portfolio as well. Are you just seeing changes in patterns in terms of how new techs are using credit? Or how much of this is maybe just substitution of RA credit. You're just losing share to your franchisees on the credit front. Or -- and how much it might just be alternative sources of credit as some others have talked about?\nNick Pinchuk: I don't think -- I was just with the franchisees at the kickoff in Omaha. I got to go to Omaha. I'll go back to Orlando. You can figure that one out in January. But I was with the group. Our franchisees don't think we're losing any share to other alternative sources. They just think, look, these guys are flushed; so they're willing to pay. I mean, if you look at the numbers, the BLS data says that investment in repair, up double digits on a year-over-year basis in both nominal and real basis and the technician wages are up over 5% year-over-year. And the number of technicians out there are growing. So I think you see this kind of a growing flush group of people and they're not -- they're staying with RA. They don't want to pay the interest. We think it's great because fundamentally, the guys have debt capacity available when they need it. The other factor is, I think, in this is that I never wanted to say this. I said it wouldn't last time. But if you look at the 53rd week last year, generally, our stuff cuts off. But even if the franchisees go out for a day or two or three, they're going to generate more year-over-year originations because it happens in the field at some point. I don't know how much that accounts for but you can knock down some of that. So I don't think that's an unusual situation.\nDavid MacGregor: And then the credit origination is down 16.6. What -- can you talk a little bit about what might have been happening there?\nAldo Pagliari: Well, Aldo -- I'd say if you take into account $10 million that I mentioned that, that extra week allowed, we would have probably been up slightly, I'd say, in the U.S. environment. Down a little bit international. International is not quite as robust as the U.S. I think we mentioned that as well that we were up in the U.S. in terms of our sales versus international. And then, if you look at the -- even the contract originations, in 2020, we had more new start-ups. There's a little bit more stable environment now with the franchisees. So there was less startups in the international arena in particular. And when you start up franchise, David, many of the franchisees tend to like the lease vans and borrow from Snap-on credit; so that could affect it. So, it's really -- I don't want to dismiss it. And I always try to remind people that you're still not in a completely certain environment that we find over the time of history that people tend to buy lower price point items until certainty restores. So I don't think tool storage has been as robust as you see in the revolving credit accounts and therefore, you see more revolving action on the [indiscernible].\nDavid MacGregor: That makes sense. Last question for me is just with respect to the share repurchase activity and you talked about the fact that you just had another authorization from the Board. But activity in the fourth quarter really didn't change much year-over-year, roughly in that $70-odd million. A good number for the full year, by the way. So good activity there. But how do we think about share repurchase here? And why wouldn't you step up and just get a lot more aggressive here in terms of buying back your stock at these levels?\nAldo Pagliari: Well, we always think of things like that. But if you look at the funnel of time, it averages between 2% and 3% of the outstanding share count, more or less. And it's hard to be an expert in this market. I have no idea if the advertising revenues of Facebook will impact Snap-on the next day when I get up and things of that nature and I'm being extreme of that example. But we try to take a measured approach to it. It has it's role. It's not the only solution in terms of how to use cash.\nDavid MacGregor: Okay, great. Thanks very much, gentlemen.\nAldo Pagliari: Welcome, David.\nOperator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Ms. Verbsky, at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.\nSara Verbsky: Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Nick Pinchuk",
            "content": "Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. Today, I'll start with a view of our fourth quarter, give you an update on the environment and the trends we see and I'll take you through some of the turbulence we've overcome and the advancements we've made and Aldo will then, as usual, give you a more detailed review of the financials. The fourth quarter was encouraging. It affirm the characteristics that make Snap-on the company we know it to be, the resilience of our markets, the power of our strategic position and the consistent and capable execution of our teams. It all added up to momentum, cutting through the challenges and the numbers testified to just that. Our reported sales in the quarter of $1,108.3 million were up 3.2%, including $12.2 million from acquisitions being offset by $3 million of unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Organically, our sales grew by 2.3%. Importantly, if you compare to the prepandemic levels of 2019, before the period-to-period variability of last year, you see a clear and unmistakable upward drive. Versus 2019, sales in this past quarter were up 16% as reported and 13% organically, continuing an ongoing trend of accelerating expansion, increasing higher and higher over pre-COVID levels. The quarter also bears the marks of the Snap-on value creation processes. Safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, as we call it, all combining to offer significant progress. The progress, there was. Opco operating income of $232.2 million was up $16.16 million point from last year and the OI margin was 21%, an all-time high, up 90 basis points from last year and 310 basis points from 2019, all achieved by overcoming the challenges of this day. For financial services, operating income of $67.2 million was down from the $68.5 million of last year. But delinquencies in the quarter were below both 2020 and those of 2019, an ongoing testament to our unique business model and it's ability to navigate through the most threatening of environments. And the combination of results from opco and financial services offered an overall consolidated operating margin of 25.1%, up from the 24.4% of last year and the 22.5% recorded in 2019. Our quarterly EPS was $4.10, well over the $3.82 of a year ago which included a $0.02 charge for restructuring. And that $4.10 was up 33.1% over 2019, a considerable gain in my book. Those are the numbers. Now, let's speak about the markets. We do believe the auto repair environment continues to be favorable. In the areas serving vehicle OEMs and dealerships, we do see some turbulence. New car sales around the world remain mixed, with China generally progressing but both North America and Europe having a tough fourth quarter. Overall volume below the 2019 levels and some new model releases and features were delayed by supply chain constraints and that impacted the associated essential tool programs that we are involved in. OEM projects aside, however, dealership repair, maintenance and warranty are all healthy. Techs are seeing good times and the dealers are looking to support their expansion in their shop. In effect, the OEM market is mixed but technicians are quite positive. There's a growing appetite for repair shop equipment but essential tool programs are attenuated. Now in the independent repair shop, it's a horse of a different color. Confidence is uniformly sky high. Based on what we hear from our franchisees, shop owners and technicians, optimism and independent repair shop continues to be strong. And our sales in that sector may reflect that confidence. So we believe, on balance, vehicle repair is a great place to operate for our tools too and for our Repair System & Information or RS&I Group. The critical industries where our Commercial & Industrial group play or C&I plays, we are seeing areas of progress but the lingering effects of virus have created headwinds. And the results in the quarter showed that trend with variations from country to country. A recovery in Asia and emerging markets but Europe being quite mixed. There are also differences from sector to sector. Education, natural resources and general industry showing improvement while the military spending continues to experience, what I'd say, a substantial challenges. Overall, however, I would describe our C&I markets as holding their own against the turbulence, public variation. We do believe we're well positioned and I think the numbers say this, to confront the challenges of this time, advancing a long ways for growth. We're also confident that we have continuing potential on our runways for improvement. The Snap-on Value Creation processes, they're a constant fuel for our progress, especially customer connection, understanding the work of professional technicians; and innovation, matching that insight to technology. We believe our product lineup just keeps getting stronger every day and we keep investing to make it so. Vehicles are rising in complexity, technicians needs assistance and so products are becoming more sophisticated to match the changing requirements and Snap-on is keeping pace. In 2021, we had more hit $1 million projects than ever before. We've endeavored through the virus era to maintain our product, our brand, I've spoken of this before. And the virus era, we've endeavored to maintain our product, our brand and our people. And we believe that continuing commitment has served us well, offering positive results and creating substantial momentum for the days ahead. And that momentum is apparent in our full year results. Sales of $4,252 million, up 18.4% including an organic increase of 15.1% compared to last year and a 14% organic gain over 2019. Strong numbers. The as-reported opco OI margin for the year was 20%, a new high, up from the 17.6% of 2020, exceeding the 19.2% of the prepandemic 2019. As-reported earnings per share for the year were $14.92, up 30.4%, or 28.3% as adjusted for the nonrecurring restructuring and the restructuring in 2020 and up 21.7% as adjusted from 2019. All clear signs of ongoing momentum. Now, for the operating groups. Let's start with C&I. Fourth quarter sales of $358.7 million for the group were down $5.7 million, including $4.1 million of unfavorable currency. Versus 2019, sales grew $5.8 million, reflecting primarily acquisition volume and currency impact. The period saw a recovery in Asia with Indonesia. And in the quarter, we saw -- we did see a recovery in Asia with Indonesia, India, Japan, South Korea and China rising. Europe and North America were more impacted by the environment and were down slightly in the quarter. Looking at the sectors, nice progress with our precision -- was achieved in our precision torque line. And that progress was -- but that progress was more than offset by lower critical industry activity attenuated in those critical industries, primarily by lower U.S. military spending and by supply chain-driven constraints and in the custom kitting area. C&I operating income was $50.1 million, down $6.1 million, including $1.2 million of unfavorable currency. The gains in Asia and the torque were more than offset by the reduced military activity in the industrial kitting constraints. As I mentioned, however, specialty torque -- the specialty torque operation did register continuing progress driven by innovative new products, developed through customer connection and observational work. Great offerings like our recently released QB4R line of 3/4-inch Drive Break-Over Torque Wrenches, capable of -- this wrench is capable of accurately fastening from 450- to 750-pound feet. It's designed specifically for heavy-duty applications, tough jobs such as torquing lug nuts on big trucks. The new unit combines our Norbar, our regionally acquired Norbar industrial torque technology with a robust ratchet designs produced on Elizabeth and Tennessee factory. Those original light vehicle ratcheting mechanisms of our Tennessee plant were reengineered for higher tension heavy requirements and were directly matched to our unique Norbar breakover device which provides a clear indication that the torque target has been reached, ensuring reliable accuracy every time. The ratchet design with our patent steel head is rugged, capable of withstanding very high stresses and has an easy-to-read adjustment mechanism that reduces the possibility of error and is virtually maintenance-free. The new wrench also has a quick release feature for easy disassembly, compact storage and great portability. The Snap-on QB4R, we like to say strength, accuracy and convenience. And as you might expect, sales have been strong. As the need for precision increases, torque products are becoming more prominent and Snap-on is playing an active role in that rise. C&I, mixed results but significant areas of progress boding well for it's future. Now let's go on to the Tools Group. Sales of $504.8 million, up $9.9 million, including favorable currency and a $7.9 million organic rise from continued expansion in the U.S., a positive that was somewhat attenuated this quarter by a low single-digit decline in the international networks. But versus 2019, a more comparable base, the Tools Group rose 21.5% and has been up now from prepandemic levels for six straight quarters. And the operating margin was 21.9%, easily one of the highest ever, up 300 basis points from last year, all despite the ongoing challenges of this day. We have continued to invest in product, brand and people. And the Tools Group has used that focus to advantage. The expanding and considerable gains from the time before the virus makes that clear. In the quarter and throughout the year, the Tools Group results continue to confirm the leadership position of our van network. We believe the franchisees are growing stronger and that's evidenced in the franchisee health metrics we monitor each period. They're on an unmistakably favorable trend. And that positivity was acknowledged by multiple publications, all this thing Snap-on as a franchise of choice. This quarter, we were once again ranked among the top franchise organizations, both in the U.S. and abroad, recognized by the Franchise Business Review which in it's latest ranking for franchisee satisfaction, listed Snap-on as the top 50 franchise for the 15th consecutive year. We're also featured at number three among all franchises in Entrepreneurial Magazine's 2020 list of top franchises for veterans. And abroad, Snap-on was ranked number two in Elite Franchise Magazine's top U.K. franchises. The judges in that ranking state that the durability and innovation shown in the face of unimaginable circumstances are what is decided in this year's top 10 and the panel was right on. Durability and innovation are what makes the Tools Group -- what marks the Tools Group in the storm is clear. Now this type of recognition is a point of pride for us but it reflects the fundamental strength of our franchisees and of our van business in general but it would not have been achieved without a continuous stream of innovative new products developed through our strong customer connections, learning and leading to multiple new problem solving innovations. And the results of our insight in experience in the changing universe of vehicle repair. Customer connection gives us a great window on that changing universe and we put it to good use. Our sales of hand tools were up nicely in the quarter. And of course, new products led the way there. Our innovative 30, LS, DM, core half-inch drive impact sockets were a significant contributor. Born out of customer connection, observing the work in automotive shops, the special sockets, they range from to 17 to 22 millimeters, come with an extra deep hex, up to 3/4 inch deeper, accommodating the lug nuts with decorative caps that are becoming so common on the latest models. The new sockets provide the clearance needed to fit right over those nut covers without damage, grab the lug and enable quick removal without having to remove the caps. It saves techs significant time over a day of repair activity. They made right here in our Milwaukee plant. They released just this past quarter and initial sales have been gangbusters, I'm telling you. And making those sales have made that new socket line a hit product just in the volume in the fourth quarter. Accelerated sales. Well, that's the Tools Group, expanding the success in the U.S., balancing the international operations, continuing to innovate, building on our underlying advantages, stronger-than-ever performance all achieved against the wind. Now for RS&I; volume for the fourth quarter was $392.5 million, up 8.7%, including acquisitions and 5.5% of organic growth with gains in sales of modern car equipment, increased volume of handheld diagnostics and the rise of information and data subscriptions being partially offset by a decrease in our business focused on vehicle OEMs and dealerships. RS&I operating margins of $97.2 million rose $7.2 million or 8% versus 2020. And that number in 2020 included $1 million of restructuring costs. Compared with the prepandemic levels of 2019, sales grew $57.5 million, 17.2%, including a $43.7 million or 13% organic gain. And the RS&I gross OI margin of 24.8% compared with a 24.9% and a 26% registered in 2020 and 2010, respectively, with the impact of acquisitions attenuating a generally positive balance for the operations. Again, software products and subscriptions for RS&I were a significant plus. Along those lines, I'll mention one division, providing software to independent shops, continue to succeed, pursuing customer connection and innovation, launching great new products to improve shop efficiency. RS&I just added more powerful and exclusive features to it's award-winning Mitchell 1 ProDemand auto repair information software. You see, as auto electronics have expanded, wiring diagrams have become of rising importance in vehicle diagnosis and repair. And the new ProDemand significantly advances what is already a clear lead from Mitchell 1 in diagram navigation, offering new features that provide interactive drop-downs, display connection data, allow easy movement to the next diagram on the diagnostic trail and enable a seamless recall of previous viewed circuits should a look-back be needed in the repair process. And as you might expect, the initial reactions to the new updates have been quite enthusiastic from both the shops and from the technicians. It's all music to our ears. We keep driving to expand RS&I's position with repair shop owners and managers, offering them more and more solutions for their day-to-day challenges, developed by our value creation processes or added by our strategic coherent acquisitions. And we're confident it's a winning formula. So those are the highlights of the quarter, doing what we expect to do, achieve ongoing process again -- achieve ongoing progress against the storm. A continuing rise versus the prepandemic levels, up more each quarter now for several straight periods. Gains forged through our Snap-on Value Creation processes, strengthening our business and driving to a 21% opco operating margin, up 90 basis points. A new record. EPS $4.10, a considerable rise to new heights, overcoming all headwinds and demonstrating continued confirmation that Snap-on has emerged from the pandemic much stronger than when we entered with the momentum that we're confident will propel us to even higher heights as we move forward. Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Thanks, Aldo. That's our fourth quarter. Positive performance, overcoming challenges as we expect to do. In these times of turbulence, we continue to rise based on the resilience of our markets, vehicle repair expanding at the shop level, tax pumped and garage is optimistic, overcoming the postponement of essential OEM programs. Critical industry is mixed but with promising areas, gains in general industry, natural resources and education and progress in emerging markets. Difficulties are in the air but we're able to prosper nonetheless on the power of our strategic position, controlling the customer interface with our wide product line and unique brand. And perhaps most importantly, we rose on the consistent and capable execution by our team, employing agile marketing, considered an active pricing, new and higher-value products, quick redesigns to match available materials, aggressive spot buying and as always, our ongoing RCI. It's a combination that offers another positive performance and has all spelled out clearly in our numbers. Sales rising organically over prepandemic levels by 13% with the last four periods, up organically 8%, 9%, 11% and 13%, expanding the gain over 2019, demonstrating a positive second derivative in the rising sales quarter-by-quarter. Opco OI margins of 21%, a record high in the midst of multiple challenges, up 90 basis points from last year and up substantially more from 2019. And it all came together for an EPS of $4.10, up 7.2% from last year and 33% from the prepandemic period, leading to a full year EPS of $14.92, new heights despite the storm. It was an encouraging quarter and a year. The period clearly had challenges but we were able to overcome maintaining our progress, extending our upward trend. And we believe that Snap-on exits 2021 with a substantial momentum that will carry us forward. And as we mine the abundant opportunities of our resilient markets, we held the advantages of our unique strategic position and engage the considerable capabilities of our challenged-tested team. We'll continue to track progress throughout 2022 and well beyond. Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. Many of them are listening to this call. My friends, you are the base of the success we've registered this quarter and this year. For the extraordinary progress you achieved, you have my congratulations. For the unique individual and collective capabilities you brought to bear against the challenges, you have my admiration. And for the commitment you bring to our now and the conviction you hold in our future, you have my thanks. Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Good morning, Scott. Well, look, I think the Tools Group is demonstrating itself. I mean, if you look at the prepandemic levels, it's been up now six straight quarters and it was up over 21% in this quarter. I think it was 21.5%. So it seems to be moving upwards. And all of our good power -- in this time of turbulence, the Tools Group is really well positioned. When I say a strategic advantage of being -- with wide product line and unique brand to control the interface with the end customer, that's exactly what the Tools Group does in spades. It's able to price. It's able to bring value, new value products that don't look like price increases because people are paying for more features. And so that's a very strong position they have. Also, they can market agilely. So if you have supply chain problems, they can pitch their promotions to move people towards what we have a lot of and have a way somewhat from things we have less of. At the same time, they're working pretty well in the factories because they're vertically integrated. So you see their kind of numbers. The 21.9%, I think we were very encouraged by when we saw it. And so you see the Tools Group doing well in sales, in terms of profitability. And if you look back to 2019, what's happened is, I think I said before, is that we have figured out over the period, we were investing in SG&A in, say, like '18 and '19 to try to figure out how to expand the Tools Group's selling capability. And it seems to have worked. Our selling capability, our franchisees has gone up each quarter over that. You can see the expansion. The second derivative looks pretty good. So you're seeing that play out. What we're doing now is we're, of course, plumbing the ceiling of that, see how far it would take us. And we're investing and looking at other possibilities to keep that string going. We think -- we don't know how far those things we understood in terms of social media, in terms of being able to train more effectively will bring us but we're pretty optimistic about it. And I thought I was pretty clear about our views about momentum going forward in this period. If you look at RS&I, RS&I start to come back -- I mean, the thing it's had some good quarters but it's had some quarters where the margins were down. But this quarter, 23.8%, down 10 basis points and that's against multiple that get -- much more, like 80 or 90 basis points of acquisition impact. And what you see in RS&I is continuing positivity around the independent repair shops, particularly diagnostics and information products and the rise of subscriptions and software keeps ticking up because we keep emphasizing that, particularly things like the innovation you heard about Mitchell in terms of navigating the wiring diagrams and the car -- it deals those kind of situations. So you see that playing out. RS&I, I think they were up 5.5% organically in the quarter and up 13% versus -- last year and up 13% versus prepandemic levels, another very positive quarter. C&I is more vulnerable to the turbulence of the date because you have a lot of mixed markets. C&I is in a lot of sectors, a lot of countries. And in that cocktail, you see some countries that are down, particularly in Europe in this quarter which was difficult for you. And then C&I in some of the businesses, I did say, the customized toolkits, well, these customized toolkits are great. Just great margins on them but you have in those kits sometimes a couple of hundred tools. And the sourcing situation of today, when you're going to deliver those all, many of them from individual sources, you can get disruptive in terms of when you're going to be able to deliver and create some problems. And then on top of it for C&I, a big piece in the critical industry is the military business is pretty weak. We always -- we expect that to come back and we expect C&I to come forward. But we see Tools Group gangbusters. We see RS&I coming back, coming back from -- they've been -- they have been weak but they're getting better. They're heating up. You can see that number. And you see C&I kind of holding its own, kind of flat sales. But we figure as we get better at managing the situation, we have a challenged-tested team that does pretty well in this C&I is going to keep coming back. So we like our momentum going forward. Well, let me just say, though, I didn't say -- I said when I burrowed down on C&I, I mentioned supply chain. But our view of this is it's always something. It's always something. And if you look at our numbers, up, what, 15% -- 13% over prepandemic levels, 21% OI margin. I don't know if you look at the numbers, you can see any turbulence in those numbers. So I think we're managing through it. Yes, of course, it will get better as we go forward. I mean, it's hard for me to predict. But as you get into the moment, you get better at managing it. Right now, we're pretty good at agile marketing. We're good at managing or redesigning our products. We're good at spot buying. So we don't get it disruptive in general. We have certain modules of disruption that we'll figure out and we'll solve but you don't really get that kind of problem going forward. Now some of our businesses like, for example, you could look at tool storage. We could sell more tool storage if we could turn some more out and we're working on that. So you may see some of that going forward. But I don't accept the idea that we're being impacted by this. We're dealing with it. I think the number is saying, that was a good quarter whether we thought we had turbulence or not. Good morning. Yes. I don't -- they're all over the map in terms of that situation and they're by segment. But look, C&I is -- I just -- our point there was C&I is a longer wave business. So you have commitments with some customers, not all customers, so you see some impact on that and you price associated with that. We're getting some pricing in C&I, some but not as much as not other things. Our big thing isn't so much about pricing. It's managing those costs. And so the idea of C&I, I think our disruption is mostly associated with what I pointed out in terms of the custom kitting situation, trying to deliver those things. That's been more probably the biggest impact on this, attenuating some of their volumes, particularly in critical industries. Yes, I'd be kidding. Their fourth quarter was terrible, wasn't it? I thought the fourth quarter for those guys was brutal. So we didn't see much -- if we're talking about projects, we didn't see much cadence difference. I mean, actually, there's a lot of new models coming out that are going to come out new features and I don't think we saw any cadence change in the quarter. Now I'm on shaky ground a little bit about saying that there might have been some of it but I -- my macro view of it, Bret, is it was a tough quarter for the auto companies. So I think as we go forward, it's got to get better. They're going to shake loose some of those. And so we're going to get -- because we're already involved in some of those products, we're just waiting for them to come out. That's what I see. I think the -- if you look at the dealerships, if you go -- like I thought I'd try to make clear, at the dealerships level, the repair is great at that situation. So we're seeing dealerships buy equipment. And one of the upticks in we didn't -- I don't think I mentioned it here but one of the upticks in the RS&I business, it's a rise -- a nice rise in repair shop undercar equipment. Collision and the balances and changes and those kinds of things. And so that's been going up. Also, they're buying software from us. So that's pretty good in that situation. But if you're talking about the programs out of the OEM, your guess is as good as mine when that breaks loose. All we know is they've got a backlog in there that's going to be good for us when it breaks. I did not. And the reason is I want to get away from talking about the numbers by product line in the Tools Group. To us, it doesn't matter. We skin the cat many ways. So the point about the Tools Group is 21.9% margin. Now hand tools were a nice piece of that. But I will tell you the big ticket items were also up in that period. Tool storage and diagnostics were up. The hand tools are sort of the flavor of the day -- these days because, of course, we're more vertically integrated. Fundamentally, when the hand tool comes in the door, all we add is steel, capital and labor, boom. So it was -- but it's been strong for a number of different periods. So, I don't really want to get down that road. Just saying hand tools was a nice product. Nice -- but as was diagnostics in the period and we had increases in tool storage as well. Great. Look, I think this, we have -- of course, we're taking a look at where -- how we source and where we need more capacity in the factories and those kinds of things. But I don't see it there -- I don't see it distorting our financials in that regard. I think a couple of things. When I said that I didn't mean that the OE was going to explode or anything like that. Fundamentally, our OE was higher before because we were spending a lot of effort and a lot of different corridors trying to figure out what would actually resonate with the Tools Group and make a difference. Our OE is in a nice place now. And of course, as you come out, you know how you say this, you're kind of loosening your belt a little bit when you've had a downtick in the COVID but I think our OE is at a nice level. It may go up a little bit but not that much. We're not going to -- but the areas where we're going to spend, I think, would be -- we're going to push more on social media because we've learned more about that. Boy, you know what, we've got a lot of data on our franchisees. We get the franchisees and our customers. We got oodles of data and we could do a better job in terms of predictive behavior on those things. So we're spending time looking at that right now. I don't have anything to report other than, boy, it's obvious to us we have Mitchell-type SureTrack data which we have about cars. We have that about our customers. And so we think we'll be able to wheel that to make the Tools Group even more effective. So our guys can make better choices when they engage customers. That's probably another area we're looking at right now. Sure. I mean, look, I think that's why we bought it for two reasons. One, from a financial point of view, it is a twin of Mitchell 1. And I don't know if you're familiar with Mitchell 1 but if you pay -- I know you are, we've been paying -- we've been talking about the growth of our diagnostics and software in independent repair shops almost every quarter since I've been here. They just keep going upward. Boom, boom, boom. And so Mitchell 1 knows how to handle that interface. And so we're using that knowledge that, I would say, challenged-tested understanding of the business to apply to Dealer FX and in the fullness of time, that's going to work it's magic there. We believe we'll have a kind of a twin. I'm not saying it's going to be as great as Mitchell 1, it may be but it's going to be a good business. So you're going to see it from a financial point of view but it's also important from us strategically because as you know, it has a window on what happens with these new technologies and the new technology is going to be the drivers of the future and it's going to call it -- help us call in the airstrikes for what product we develop because we're going to see it first in Dealer FX. So you're going to hear us talking about that. But these are early days. It's the first year. There's a lot of turbulence, these kinds of things. In terms of Canada, I think Justin Trudeau just got the COVID himself. So this impacts the activity in Canada. But I believe certainly Dealer FX was up in the quarter and we're making -- we're sort of making our expectations in this but you'll hear more of it as we go forward because it's going to be a big factor on us in terms of early warning. Also, financially. Okay. Sure. Now to put in perspective, Liz, just I'd add on that, if you just look at our hit products, we bring couple of three dozen new products every quarter to the market. So that's a big factor for us. Well, look, I think our priorities are still in line. I think, we believe, the best return on capital for our people -- for our investors and for constituents is investing in our business. So to the extent we can invest it in business in some of these new activities or anything like that, we will. We support that. Secondly, we have a pretty full, I would say, pipeline of acquisitions that we keep looking at. And I kind of think, call me crazy but I think in the turbulence, the acquisitions may be more available in this situation. So we're kind of hoping that -- we're kind of focused on a few things that may have some ability to move. And we're not afraid to take big ones or small ones in that situation. And then we have -- our Board just reloaded our share buyback situation and I think now another $500 million. And we have our dividend which we look at and we're kind of -- I think it's been kind of a front piece for Snap-on where we have paid a dividend every quarter for -- since 1939 and we've never reduced it. So we hold it in perpetuity in terms of our policy. And we always look to see if it's appropriate to upgrade it. So those are the kinds of things we're looking at. I think every year changes and this year, it's marked by the idea there's a lot of turbulence out there, maybe there's some opportunities for us. I think about the same. I think roughly the same as the Tools Group, I would say, in the same ballpark. In fact, if you look over -- David, if you look over two years' worth, there's differences from quarter-to-quarter. But if you look back over two years, they've been about the same, like we generally see and this quarter was the same kind of thing. There's a little bit of noise with the 53rd week and the franchisees probably doing a little more than they would order from us. But I think generally, it's roughly the same. They're in practically lockstep. So we see the inventory kind of on the Tools Group holding pretty flat. We make -- holding gross margins are -- is a common occurrence in this environment. It's like this though. I think, look, I think yes, we have pressures on a lot of different things. There's a lot of things that go in that gross margin and there are a lot of things that go in the SG&A. I think our view was on the OI margin in general, the up to 300 basis points. We -- I think I've said this on other calls long ago that we're kind of agnostic between those two numbers. We kind of focus on the OI margin, up 300 basis points, not bad. Now you could say, okay, well, the gross margin is up less than the OE. But if you look back to prepandemic levels, they're both up reasonably well. I think, 100 basis points and 200 basis points. And I don't think that's chop-liver in this environment. Yes, there are pressures associated with the supply and sourcing but we're able to manage it such that we don't give up anything. Well, generally, I think if it's the latter, I think that we would rather have it with our new products and then be foolish around those. I think it isn't a ball-based. I mean, fundamentally, I just want to come back to your original question. It would be a mistake to think that the costs weren't coursing through our numbers this quarter because they are. And so we have those and we're holding our own against those with pricing and with those -- like I said, people -- I think sometimes people don't realize how many new products we bring out. If you just look at the hit products and they're the ones that are the incandescent ones, $1 million in the first year, we have two to three dozen every quarter. And so we have a lot of opportunity in both those areas. And I think that's what allows us to maintain this. And our -- this ain't our first rodeo. So we know how to manage this. I think our team -- not me. I'm just a trained dog at the top of the [indiscernible]. But the thing is the guys know how to manage this such they can bring with the combination of direct pricing plus promotions plus the new products. They can manage that interface very well. That's what I meant about the strategic position. So we're not hanging our hands at all, David. I don't think -- I was just with the franchisees at the kickoff in Omaha. I got to go to Omaha. I'll go back to Orlando. You can figure that one out in January. But I was with the group. Our franchisees don't think we're losing any share to other alternative sources. They just think, look, these guys are flushed; so they're willing to pay. I mean, if you look at the numbers, the BLS data says that investment in repair, up double digits on a year-over-year basis in both nominal and real basis and the technician wages are up over 5% year-over-year. And the number of technicians out there are growing. So I think you see this kind of a growing flush group of people and they're not -- they're staying with RA. They don't want to pay the interest. We think it's great because fundamentally, the guys have debt capacity available when they need it. The other factor is, I think, in this is that I never wanted to say this. I said it wouldn't last time. But if you look at the 53rd week last year, generally, our stuff cuts off. But even if the franchisees go out for a day or two or three, they're going to generate more year-over-year originations because it happens in the field at some point. I don't know how much that accounts for but you can knock down some of that. So I don't think that's an unusual situation."

            "content": "Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the resilience and continued strength of our business model enabled Snap-on to close the year with another period of robust financial performance. The quarter also compared favorably with the fourth quarter of 2019 which being a pre-COVID-19 time period, in some cases, may serve to be the more meaningful baseline. Net sales of $1,108.3 million in the quarter increased 3.2% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 2.3% organic sales gain and a $12.2 million of acquisition-related sales, partially offset by $3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Additionally, net sales in the period increased 16% from $955.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, including a 13% organic gain, $20.9 million of acquisition-related sales and $7.1 million of favorable foreign currency translation. In both comparisons, the organic gains more than offset lower sales for the military. Consolidated gross margin of 48.1% improved 10 basis points from 48% last year. The gross margin contributions from the higher sales volume, pricing actions, 30 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects and benefits from the company's RCI initiatives offset higher material and other costs. For the quarter, the corporation continued to navigate effectively the supply chain dynamics associated with the global pandemic. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 27.1%, improved 80 basis points from 27.9% last year which included 10 basis points of cost from restructuring actions. The improvement is primarily due to higher sales volumes, partially offset by 40 basis points of unfavorable acquisition effect. Operating earnings before financial services of $232.2 million compared to $216.2 million in 2020 and $171.4 million in 2019, reflecting an improvement of 7.4% and 35.5%, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 21% improved 90 basis points from last year and 310 basis points from 2019. The operating company margin of 21% represents the highest quarterly level of profitability in Snap-on's modern day history. Financial services revenue of $86.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to $93.4 million last year which included an extra week of interest income associated with the 53rd week 2020 fiscal calendar. Operating earnings of $67.2 million decreased $1.3 million from 2020 levels, reflecting the lower revenue, partially offset by lower provisions for credit losses. Consolidated operating earnings of $299.4 million increased 5.2% from $284.7 million last year and 28.2% from $233.6 million in 2019. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 25.1% compared to 24.4% in 2020 and 22.5% in 2019. Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 22.3% compared to 21.8% last year which includes a 10 basis point increase related to the restructuring actions. Net earnings of $223.7 million or $4.10 per diluted share increased $14.8 million or $0.28 per share from last year's levels, representing a 7.3% increase in diluted earnings per year. As compared to the fourth quarter 2019, net earnings increased $53.1 million or $1.02 per share, representing a 33.1% increase in diluted earnings per share. Now let's turn to our segment results, starting with the C&I group on Slide 7. Sales of $358.7 million decreased from $364.4 million last year, reflecting a $1.6 million organic sales decline and $4.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic decrease primarily reflects a low single-digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries. Within critical industries, lower sales to the military were partially offset by gains in general industry and technical education as well as by improved sales into oil and gas applications. As a further comparison, net sales in the period increased 1.6% from 2016 levels, reflecting $8.7 million of acquisition-related sales and $3.8 million of favorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by a $6.7 million organic sales decline. As compared to 2019, sales in our European-based hand tools business were up mid-teens. Those gains were more than offset by lower activity with the military. As you may recall, the fourth quarter of 2019 included sales for a major project that is substantially complete. Gross margin of 36.5% declined 130 basis points from 37.8% in the fourth quarter of 2020 primarily due to the higher material and other costs, partially offset by benefits from RCI initiatives. While pricing actions have been taken in this segment to help offset the increasing cost, the longer-term nature of certain customer agreements affects the timing of price realization. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22.5% in the quarter compared to 22.4% last year. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $50.1 million compared to $56.2 million last year. The operating margin of 14% compared to 15.4% a year ago. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $504.8 million increased 2% from $494.9 million in 2020, reflecting a 1.6% organic sales gain and $2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase reflects a low single-digit gain in our U.S. business, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in our international operations. Net sales in the period increased 22.6% from $411.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, reflecting a 21.5% organic sales gain and $3.9 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Sales gains in the quarter were led by our hand tools category with strong performance sequentially as well as versus both the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019. Gross margin of 43.9% in the quarter improved 100 basis points from last year, primarily due to the higher sales volumes, pricing actions and 60 basis points from favorable foreign currency effects which offset higher material and other costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22% improved from 24% last year, primarily reflecting the higher sales and benefits from ongoing RCI and cost containment efforts. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $110.5 million compared to $93.6 million last year. The operating margin of 21.9% improved 300 basis points from 18.9% last year. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $392.5 million compared to $361.1 million a year ago, reflecting a 5.5% organic sales gain and $12.2 million of acquisition-related sales, partially offset by $500,000 of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain is comprised of a double-digit increase in sales of undercar equipment and a mid-single-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers, partially offset by a low single-digit decrease in sales to OEM dealerships. Also during the quarter, the RS&I Group continue to benefit from the increasing number of monthly software subscribers for it's aftermarket and dealership repair shops. As compared to 2019 levels, net sales increased $57.5 million from $335 million, reflecting a 13% organic sales gain, $12.2 million of acquisition-related sales and $1.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Gross margin of 46.1% was unchanged from last year as benefits from pricing actions and 60 basis points from acquisitions were offset by higher material and other costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales was 21.3% compared to 21.2% last year, primarily dot [ph] to 150 basis points of unfavorable acquisition effects, partially offset by the impact of higher sales and 30 basis points from lower expenses related to $1 million of restructuring costs that were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $97.2 million compared to $90 million last year. The operating margin of 24.8% compared to 24.9% a year ago. Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services of $86.9 million decreased $6.5 million from $93.4 million last year, primarily as a result of an additional week of interest income occurring in the 53rd 2020 fiscal year. Financial services operating earnings of $67.2 million compared to $68.5 million in 2020. Financial services expenses of $19.7 million were down $5.2 million from 2020 levels, primarily due to $5.6 million of decreased provisions for credit losses resulting from favorable loan portfolio trends, including reduced year-over-year net charge-offs which support lower forward-looking estimated reserve requirements. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 0.9% and 1.4% in the fourth quarter of 2021 and 2020, respectively. In the fourth quarters of both 2021 and 2020, the average yield on finance receivables was 17.7% and the average yield on contract receivables was 8.5%. Total loan originations of $256.3 million in the fourth quarter decreased $16.1 million or 5.9% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 3.6% decrease in originations of finance receivables and a 16.6% decrease in originations of contract receivables. Last year's extra week in the quarter contributed approximately $10 million of finance receivable originations. As a reminder, revenues in the quarter are generally dependent on the average size of the financing portfolio rather than originations in any one period. Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our U.S. operation. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.6% for U.S. extended credit compared to 1.8% in the fourth quarter of 2020. On a sequential basis, the rate is up 20 basis points, reflecting the typical seasonal increase we experienced between the third and fourth quarters. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $41.1 million represented 2.38% of outstandings at quarter end, down 24 basis points as compared to the same period last year. Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $222.7 million in the quarter reflects 97.2% of net earnings and compared to $317.6 million the last year. The decrease from the fourth quarter of 2020 primarily reflects higher cash payments for income and other taxes, an $85 million increase in working investment, partially offset by higher net earnings. The change in working investment is largely driven by increased receivables and higher levels of inventory this year versus a reduction of inventory in 2020. The increase in inventory primarily reflects higher demand as well as incremental buffer stocks and expanded levels of in-transit inventories associated with the supply chain dynamics in the current macro environment. Net cash used by investing activities of $23.8 million included net additions to finance receivables of $9.7 million and $16.3 million of capital expenditures. Net cash used by financing activities of $154.1 million included cash dividends of $76.1 million and a repurchase of 355,000 shares of common stock for $75.5 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of year-end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $454.9 million of common stock under existing authorizations. The 2021 full year free cash flow generation of $872.6 million represented about 104% of net earnings. Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $41.6 million from 2020 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 58 days compared to 64 days at 2020 year-end. Inventories increased $57.3 million from 2020 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.8x compared to 2.4x at year-end 2020. Our year-end cash position of $780 million compared to $923.4 million at year-end 2020. Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 9.1% compared to 12.1% at year-end 2020. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million available under our credit facilities. As of year-end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2022. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. In addition, we currently anticipate, absent any changes to U.S. tax legislation, that our full year 2022 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%. So, I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Good morning, Bret. Well, certainly, of course, everybody is talking more about inflation than in the past and Snap-on is not immune from that. However, Liz, I think it is something we manage and strive. First, we always look for alternative ways to reduce cost, whether that be alternative sourcing, alternative componentry, rapid continuous improvement to get some productivity. And of course, if we can't cover that, then we look for pricing actions to help us out. We do believe we have pricing power personified by the Tools Group. And then as Nick already has said, we get pricing over time in the commercial industrial group and repair systems and information in light of the fact that they have longer-term customer agreements. So, we don't immediately just put pen to paper and say, oh, it's got to be this pricing. We try and strive to see what we can offset internally. At the same time, we're cognizant of the new features we always bring to market. So rather than bring a price increase to market, our preference is, can we bring a higher featured product to market and talk more about that feature, even though it might cost more to the customer. We try to create that vision as there's more productivity being brought to market. So that's kind of our broad-based approach. So yes, there's more inflation but we'll continue to try to bring more innovation and more value add for the customer. Well, Aldo -- I'd say if you take into account $10 million that I mentioned that, that extra week allowed, we would have probably been up slightly, I'd say, in the U.S. environment. Down a little bit international. International is not quite as robust as the U.S. I think we mentioned that as well that we were up in the U.S. in terms of our sales versus international. And then, if you look at the -- even the contract originations, in 2020, we had more new start-ups. There's a little bit more stable environment now with the franchisees. So there was less startups in the international arena in particular. And when you start up franchise, David, many of the franchisees tend to like the lease vans and borrow from Snap-on credit; so that could affect it. So, it's really -- I don't want to dismiss it. And I always try to remind people that you're still not in a completely certain environment that we find over the time of history that people tend to buy lower price point items until certainty restores. So I don't think tool storage has been as robust as you see in the revolving credit accounts and therefore, you see more revolving action on the [indiscernible]. Well, we always think of things like that. But if you look at the funnel of time, it averages between 2% and 3% of the outstanding share count, more or less. And it's hard to be an expert in this market. I have no idea if the advertising revenues of Facebook will impact Snap-on the next day when I get up and things of that nature and I'm being extreme of that example. But we try to take a measured approach to it. It has it's role. It's not the only solution in terms of how to use cash. Welcome, David."

With that said, I would now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?\nNick Pinchuk: Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I will start the call by covering the highlights of our third quarter and along the way, I will give you my perspective on our results. They are encouraging. On our market, they are positive and more than resilient, and I will speak about our progress. It\u2019s been considerable each period demonstrating increasing strength even when in the midst of solvency and headwind. And we will also speak about what it all means to our future. It\u2019s incredibly promising. And then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. Our reported sales in the quarter were $1.377 billion. They were up 10.2%, including $9.6 million of favorable foreign currency and $19.5 million of acquisition-related sales. Our organic sales growth was up 7% \u2013 was 7%, gains in every group. It was our fifth straight quarter of above pre-pandemic performance and Snap-on value creation processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, as we call it, all combined to drive that progress. And progress it was. Opco operating income of $201.3 million was up $15.6 million from last year. The OI margin was 19.4%, down 30 basis points, impacted negatively by acquisitions, but still very strong at a strong level. For financial services, operating income of $70.6 million increased 7.6% and the delinquencies were down even below the 2019 pre-pandemic levels, a continuing testimony to our unique business model and its ability to navigate the most threatening of environments. First quarter EPS was $2.57, up $0.29 or 8.8% from last year. And as I said before, we believe Snap-on is stronger now than when we entered this great withering and our third quarter results testifies to just that. Compared with 2019, before we ever heard of the virus, our sales grew $135.9 million or 15.1%, which includes $21 million from acquisition-related sales, $13.6 million of favorable foreign currency, and a $101.3 million or 11.1% organic gain. And that 2021 OpCo operating margin of 19.4% was up 80 basis points from the pre-pandemic levels, even while absorbing the impact of new acquisitions and while meeting what we can call a considerable disruption of these days. Now, let\u2019s talk about the markets. Water repair remains quite resilient. The technicians are prospering. They know they weather the depths of the COVID shock, learn to accommodate the virus environment and are well along the psychological recovery. Techs are resilient. They have been at their post for the last 18 months undoing it and they won\u2019t be shots again and they are optimistic about the future of their profession, about the outlook of individual transportation, and about the greater need for their skills as the vehicle park changes with new technology. Vehicle repair is strong \u2013 is a strong and resilient market. You can hear it in the franchisees voice and you can see it written clearly across our numbers every quarter. Also on auto repair, there are our shop owners and managers different from the techs. That\u2019s where our Repair Systems & Information Group, RS&I, plies its trade. Demand for new and used cars is high despite limited supply in dealership repair and maintenance and warranty is rebounding and dealers are starting to invest again. And we have been able to make \u2013 we have been able to take advantage with groundbreaking products like our award winning Tru-Point advanced driver assistance calibration system, our new diagnostic, our new diagnostic, TRITON-D10, Intelligent Diagnostic and our acclaimed Mitchell1 ProDemand repair estimating guide, all representing new technologies and data deployed to make work easier in the shop. Vehicle repair looks more promising than ever and Snap-on is poised to capitalize. Now, let\u2019s talk about critical indices which Snap-on rolls out of the garage, solving task of consequence. These are commercial industrial as C&I operates. The virus had a much longer impact on these customers. They were slower to accommodate, but they are recovering. And in the quarter, our results showed that trend, gains in North America, Europe and in Asia, all over the globe. So overall, I describe our C&I markets as improving. And coupled with the strength of the auto repair sectors, our markets are beyond resilient and we are ready and well-positioned to make progress along those run-rates to recover. At the same time, it\u2019s clear that we have ongoing potential on our runways for improvement, the Snap-on value creation processes. They have never been more important, helping to counter the turbulence of the day, especially important with customer connection as understanding the work of professional technicians and innovation, matching that insight with technology, driving new products. And just this quarter, Snap-on was prominently represented with 9 Professional Tool & Equipment News we call it P10 People\u2019s Choice Awards where the actual users, the technicians make the selection. We are also recognized with two P10 Innovation awards and we are honored with 2 Motor Magazine Top Tool awards. An essential driver of Snap-on growth is innovative product that makes work easier and the awards are the one are our testimony that great Snap-on products just keep coming, matching the growing complexity of the task, becoming more essential to technicians and driving our forward progress. That\u2019s the environment, pretty positive. Now, we will move to the operating groups. In C&I, volume in the quarter rose 13.9% or $42 million versus 2020 on significant growth across all divisions, reflecting \u2013 reflected a $32.9 million or 10.6% organic uplift and $7.5 million from our AutoCrib acquisition. And double-digit growth in our European hand tool businesses and a high single-digit rise in critical industries led the way. C&I operating income of $52.6 million, was up $10.5 million or 24.4% and the operating margin was 15.3%. That\u2019s an increase of 130 basis points versus last year. I\u2019d say that\u2019s an attention getting rise against the wind. Now, compared to the pre-pandemic 2019 results, sales were up 4.8%, including a 0.9% organic gain and that OI margin of 15.3% was up 90 basis points against the 70 point impact of acquisitions and unfavorable currency. Once again, SNA Europe delivered double-digit growth beyond \u2013 double-digit growth beyond pre-virus levels against a complex and varied marketing environment propelled by the customization power of their Bahco ERGO Tool Management System. And our industrial division roles in critical industries, recording nice gains in general industry, heavy duty, education and U.S. aviation, a number of positive sectors overcoming weakness and continuing weakness in the military and natural resources. P&I is rising and we are enthusiastic about the possibilities. We will keep strengthening our position to capture those opportunities and enabling that intent is our expanding lineup of innovative new products. And the third quarter did see some great new offerings like our 14.4-volt 3h-inch drive brushless reaction, the CDR861. It\u2019s already popular. And it\u2019s no wonder. It\u2019s a powerful combination of strength and speed, high torque, 60-foot bumps, the bus loose, very suborn bolts and rapid operations, 275 RPM for getting those fasteners off in quick time. It\u2019s made in our Murphy, North Carolina plant and it features a full frame brushless motor for longer runtime and durability. It includes a safety switch that shuts in an equipment safety switch that shuts down \u2013 shuts down the tool after 2 minutes of continuous use that\u2019s eliminating the chance of overheating. It also has a super bright 18 aluminum front-facing light that stays illuminated after the trigger is released, allowing easy and immediate inspection of the work. This ratchet also features a built-in break that stops the tool from throwing or fasteners, which it seems like not much, but it\u2019s an important safety feature for technicians. And it also offers a great cushion grip that makes for more comfortable tool control even during extended use. The CDR861 power, speed and comfort, it\u2019s in a very compact package. It\u2019s a mighty might for accomplishing critical tasks and the professionals love it. Well, that\u2019s C&I, continuing upward, exceeding pre-pandemic volumes, strong profitability and positions for more. Now, on to the Tools Group, sales of $471.4 million, up $21.8 million including $4.9 million of favorable currency and a $16.9 million or 3.7% organic gain, growth in the U.S. \u2013 both in the U.S. and the international operations. And the operating margin was 20.8%, one of our highest effort and up 140 basis points from last year. Compared with the pre-virus 2019 level, the organic gain was $80.4 million or 20.6% and the 20.8% operating margin was up 700 basis points compared with the pre-pandemic level, 700 basis points in the midst of operating turbulence. Tools Group is responding to the challenges of the day, increasing its product advantage, fortifying its brands and further enabling its franchisees, giving them more selling capacity, it\u2019s all working. Five strong quarters of above pre-pandemic performance says it so. Now, the third quarter is when we hold our \u2013 most of you know this, the third quarter is when we hold our annual Snap-on Franchisee Conference, our SFC. This year\u2019s we are back again in person at the Gaylord in Orlando, Florida, over 9,000 attendees, a record. We have training seminars in sales growth and intelligent diagnostics. They were well attended and well received. And we had several football fields of products. So, our franchisees could get up close and personal with our latest innovations. For the franchisees, the SFC is an opportunity for learning, for touching and ordering new products and for recharging their Snap-on batteries and believe me, they are charged. For the company, the SFC is an opportunity to gauge the franchisees\u2019 outlook on the business. One quantitative way is orders. Well, they were up, strong double digits over last year\u2019s virtual live from the Forge event and from the 2019 SFC live in Washington, D.C. And when I say up, I mean all of our product categories showed substantial gains over both of those events. And so that\u2019s the quantitative look at it. Qualitatively, I spoke with many of our franchisees. And I can attest that they were beaming, showing a lot of confidence in our business and declaring considerable optimism on their future days and decades ahead with Snap-on. We do believe our franchisees are continuing to grow stronger each quarter and we continue to invest in our future. And if you were with us in Orlando, you would have seen it unmistakably and we are investing, building franchisees\u2019 ability to use the direct interface with technicians, enabling them to better communicate their unique capability and growing technology of Snap-on product lines. We have great confidence in the power of our products and there are real reasons for the confidence. You heard about the product awards. Well, beyond that, there is a continuous stream of terrific new offerings. During the SFC, the Tools Group unveiled its new KHP415, portable 40-inch substation power card. It\u2019s targeted at entry level technicians, the ones working on a narrow scope of repairs. It\u2019s built in our Albona, Iowa factory and the new card enables young mechanics to invest in Snap-on storage at a value price, while at the same time getting some very attractive professional features, a lockable comp compartment, fourfold distort and adjustable power tool rack that holds up the 10 tools and a power strip with 5 outlets and 2 USB ports for battery and device charging. New cart, it was well received. And it\u2019s quickly reaching what we call hit product status over $1 million of sales. It\u2019s raising upward on a steep trajectory. Beyond products, we spent time working to expand franchise\u2019se selling capacity, harnessing social media, improving product training and RCI and the van operations and it\u2019s working. Selling capacity is up and you can see it clearly in the 5 straight gangbuster quarters for our van network. The Tools Group is on a very positive trend, ascending and leaving pre-pandemic levels way behind. Nowon to RS&I. Sales were up 14.8% or $46.9 million, including a $31.7 million or 9.9% organic uplift. Growth was weighted toward undercar equipment, but our diagnostics and information businesses also chipped in with double-digit increases. Versus 2020, RCI operating earnings were $83.3 million, representing a rise of $3.2 million. Comparing with 2019, sales grew $41.7 million or 12.9%, including $24.2 million or 7.4% organic grain, nice growth. The RS&I OI margin was down versus the last 2 years, attenuated by business mix, acquisitions and currency, but it was still a strong 22.9%. So, we clearly see the potential of our runway with RS&I, expanding Snap-on\u2019s presence in the garage with coherent acquisitions and a growing line of powerful products. Third quarter annual growth was broad-based, but a strong double-digit rise in undercar equipment was an especially welcome turn. That\u2019s a nice turnaround and it was led by innovative products like our 15K four-post alignment lift. It\u2019s really taking a hold in the repair shops as they have resumed investing. This new 15K provides professional grade alignment lifting for a variety of vehicle sizes, with open front columns, best-in-class ultra-wide 26-inch runways, and integrated 100-inch show long-wear plates. It\u2019s suited to accommodate vehicles from compact passenger cars, compact passenger cars to big pickup trucks and it\u2019s low easy on approach angle makes it great even for low-profile sports cars that are often a challenge for other lifts. Made in our Louisville, Kentucky plant on an assembly line, it\u2019s made in our Louisville, Kentucky plant on assembly line, I am very familiar with. I participated in an RCI event for that process. Our new 15K has helped drive the recovery for undercar equipment and it\u2019s driven the rise in RS&I volumes. We are quite positive about RSI\u2019s possibilities to repair shop owners and managers as the vehicle industry evolves, it\u2019s got a great future. So, that\u2019s the highlights of our quarter. Continued and strong progress, our fifth straight period exceeding pre-pandemic levels, C&I on track with strong sales and increasing profitability. RS&I, undercar, coming back, Tools Group, strong, pumped and moving vertically, the credit company solid in a storm and profitable, the overall corporation, organic sales rising 7%, Opco operating margin, 19.4%, and EPS of $3.57, a considerable rise. And most important, more testimony that Snap-on has emerged from the turbulence much stronger than we entered. It was an encouraging quarter. Now, I will turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?\nAldo Pagliari: Thanks Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. The third quarter of 2021 exhibited another period of solid financial performance. The results also compared favorably with the third quarter of 2019, which being a pre-COVID-19 time period in some cases may serve to be the more meaningful baseline. Net sales of $1.377 billion in the quarter increased 10.2% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 7% organic sales gain, $19.5 million of acquisition-related sales, and $9.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Additionally, net sales in the period increased 15.1% from $901.8 million in the third quarter of 2019, including an 11.1% organic gain, $21.0 million of acquisition-related sales and $13.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Consolidated gross margin of 50.2% improved 30 basis points from 49.9% last year. The gross margin contributions from the higher sales volumes, 60 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects and benefits from the company\u2019s RCI initiatives more than offset higher material and other costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 30.8% increased 60 basis points from 30.2% last year, primarily due to 60 basis points of unfavorable acquisition effects. Benefits from the higher sales volumes were offset by increased brand building, travel and other costs, including the restoration of our annual in-person Snap-on Franchisee Conference. Operating earnings before financial services of $201.3 million compared to $185.7 million in 2020 and $167.7 million in 2019, reflecting an 8.4% and a 20% improvement respectively. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 19.4% compared to 19.7% last year and 18.6% in 2019. Financial services revenue of $87.3 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared to $85.8 million last year, while operating earnings of $70.6 million increased $5 million from 2020 levels, reflecting the higher revenue as well as lower provisions for credit losses. Consolidated operating earnings of $271.9 million increased 8.2% from $251.3 million last year and 18.9% from $228.7 million in 2019. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 24.2% compared to 24.5% in 2020 and 23.2% in 2019. Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 23.7% compared to 23.4% last year. Net earnings of $196.2 million or $3.57 per diluted share increased $16.5 million or $0.29 per share from last year\u2019s levels, representing an 8.8% increase in diluted earnings per share. As compared to the third quarter of 2019, net earnings increased to $31.6 million or $0.61 per share, representing a 20.6% increase in diluted earnings per share. Now, let\u2019s turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I group on Slide 11, sales of $351.4 million increased 13.9% from $308.4 million last year, reflecting a 10.6% organic sales gain, $7.5 million of acquisition-related sales, and $2.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain reflects higher activity in all of the segment\u2019s operations and includes high single-digit increases in sales to customers in critical industries. Within the critical industries, year-over-year sales gains were achieved in general industry, heavy duty and technical education, but were partially offset by declines in sales to the military and international aviation, both of which had particularly robust sales in the prior year period. As a further comparison, net sales in the period increased 4.8% from 2019 levels, reflecting a $3 million organic sales gain, $7.5 million of acquisition-related sales and $5.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. As compared to 2019, sales in our European-based hand tools business were up mid-teens. With respect to critical industry sales activity in that period, our lower sales to the military international aerospace and natural resource segments offset gains in our sales to technical education, heavy duty and general industry customers. Gross margin of 38.2% improved 90 basis points from 37.3% in the third quarter of 2020. Contributions from the higher sales volumes and benefits from RCI initiatives were partially offset by higher material and other costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22.9% improved 40 basis points as compared to last year primarily due to the improved volumes, which were partially offset by higher travel and other costs. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $53.6 million compared to $43.1 million last year, the operating margin of 15.3% compared to 14% a year ago. Turning now to Slide 8 sales of the Snap-on Tools Group of $471.4 million increased 4.8% from $449.8 million in 2020, reflecting a 3.7% organic sales gain and $4.9 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase reflects a mid-single-digit gain in our U.S. business and a low single-digit gain in our international operations. Net sales in the period increased 22.4% from $385.2 million in the third quarter of 2019, reflecting a 20.6% organic sales gain and $5.8 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Gross margin of 45.8% in the quarter improved 30 basis points from last year, primarily due to the higher sales volumes and 130 basis points from favorable foreign currency effects, which offset higher material and other costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 25% improved from 26.1% last year, primarily reflecting the higher sales. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $98.2 million compared to $87.1 million last year. The operating margin of 20.8% compared to 19.4% a year ago, an improvement of 140 basis points. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9, sales of $364.4 million compared to $317.5 million a year ago, reflecting a 9.9% organic sales gain, $12 million of acquisition-related sales and $3.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase reflects double-digit increases in sales of undercar equipment and in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers. While activity focused on OEM dealerships was essentially flat. As compared to 2019 levels, net sales increased $41.7 million from $322.7 million, reflecting a 7.4% organic sales gain, $13.5 million of acquisition-related sales and $4 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Gross margin of 46.8% declined from 47.3% last year, primarily due to the impact of higher sales and lower gross margin businesses, increased material and other costs and 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. These declines were partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives and 60 basis points of benefits from acquisitions. As a reminder, undercar equipment, which had healthy sales increases in the quarter, typically has a gross margin rate that is below the RS&I segment\u2019s average. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 23.9% increased 180 basis points from 22.1% last year, primarily due to 170 basis points of unfavorable acquisition effects. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $83.3 million compared to $80.1 million last year. The operating margin of 22.9% compared to 25.2% a year ago. Now turning to Slide 10, revenue from financial services of $87.3 million compared to $85.8 million last year. Financial services operating earnings of $70.6 million compared to $65.6 million in 2020. Financial services expenses of $16.7 million decreased $3.5 million from 2020 levels, primarily due to lower provisions for credit losses, resulting from favorable loan portfolio trends, which support lower forward-looking estimated reserve requirements. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 0.8% and 0.9% in the third quarter of 2021 and 2020, respectively. In the third quarters of both 2021 and 2020, the average yield on finance receivables was 17.8%. The respective average yield on contract receivables, were 8.5% and 8.4%, respectively. Total loan originations of $269.3 million in the third quarter increased $16.5 million or 6.5% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 5.7% increase in originations of finance receivables and a 9.5% increase in originations of contract receivables. Moving to Slide 11, our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our U.S. operation. Our worldwide gross financial services portfolio increased $7.5 million in the third quarter. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.4% for U.S. extended credit compared to 1.5% in the third quarter of 2020 and 1.7% in the third quarter of 2019. On a sequential basis, the rate is up 20 basis points, reflecting the typical seasonal increase of 20 to 30 basis points we experienced between the second and third quarters. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $42.7 million represented 2.48% of outstandings at quarter end, down 22 basis points as compared to the same period last year. Now turning to Slide 12, cash provided by operating activities of $186.4 million in the quarter reflects 92.5% of net earnings. While this represents a decrease of $37.6 million from 2020 levels, this cash conversion rate compares favorably with 77.5% of net earnings in both the third quarters of 2019 and 2018. The decrease from the third quarter of 2020 primarily reflects the higher net earnings being more than offset by net changes in operating assets and liabilities, including a $61.9 million increase in working capital. This change in working capital is largely driven by the more typical seasonal inventory build in the third quarter of 2021 as compared to the reduction of inventory experienced in the period last year. Inventory additions also reflect some increases in buffer stocks and higher levels of in-transit inventories associated with the supply chain dynamics being seen in the macro environment.  Net cash used by investing activities of $29.7 million included net additions of finance receivables of $7.6 million and $16.2 million of capital expenditures. Net cash used by financing activities of $385.8 million included $250 million in senior note repayments, cash dividends of $66.3 million and the repurchase of 300,000 shares of common stock for $66.5 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $197.1 million of common stock under existing authorizations. Turning to Slide 13, trade and other accounts receivable increased $12.5 million from 2020 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 56 days compared to 64 days of 2020 year-end. Inventories increased $43.1 million from 2020 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.7 compared to 2.4 at year-end 2020. Our quarter end cash position of $735.5 million compared to $923.4 million at year-end 2020. Our net debt to capital ratio of 10.3% compared to 12.1% at year-end 2020. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million in available credit facilities. As of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. I\u2019ll now briefly review a few outlook items for the balance of 2021. We now forecast that capital expenditures will approximate $90 million. In addition, we currently anticipate, absent any changes to U.S. tax legislation that our full year 2021 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?\nNick Pinchuk: Thanks, Aldo. The Snap-on third quarter can be summarized in one word, momentum. Our markets are showing extraordinary possibilities, almost across the board with order repair the most advanced going beyond resilience. We sold the COVID-19 playing out with our customers in three phases, shock, interruption in the face of virus uncertainty, a combination of gradual learning to pursue essential work while staying safe and psychological recovery, our confidence in the future and return to normal buying. But now we\u2019re seeing a fourth phase, exhilaration of certainty that we\u2019re moving sharply to higher levels, ignited by the conviction that we have met and manage the virus and they want \u2013 and that we won\u2019t get shocked again. It\u2019s a bright outlook. And Snap-on with continuing investment in product and brand and people is well positioned to serve that trend. Of course, the COVID is still lingering, and its side effects, inflation and supply disruption around the loose, but Snap-on is strongly arrayed to engage those challenges. A direct selling model and strong brand position enables agile pricing. Our vertical integration and shorter supply chains make us less vulnerable to sourcing viscosities. Our broad product line, more than 80,000 SKUs supports flex \u2013 flexible marketing to guide around shortages, and our RCI culture drives cost offsets. We found opportunities on our runway for growth and improvement even amidst these challenging times, and you can see it in the numbers, encouraging. C&I sales up from \u2013 both from last year and 2019, OI margin, 15.3% strong and rising 130 basis points and 90 basis points versus 2020 and 2019, respectively. RS&I, up organically, 9.9% versus last year and 7.4% beyond the pre-pandemic levels. OI margins of 22.9%. And the Tools Group, organic volume rising 3.7% versus last year\u2019s record level and up 20.6% versus the day before the virus. OI margin, it was 20.8%, up 140 basis points from last year and up 700 basis points from 2019. It all led to our corporation being organically up 7% compared with last year and a strong 11.1% versus pre-pandemic numbers. Overall, OI margin was 19.4%, solid in the face of turbulence in our credit company, navigating then certainly without disruptions. Profit is up, delinquencies down. And EPS, $3.57, rising emphatically versus all comparisons. We have emerged from the virus stronger than when we entered, and the numbers confirm it. We\u2019ve now recorded five, five straight quarters of above pre-pandemic performances, and we believe that with our markets reaching beyond resilience to exhiliration with the capabilities of our model to overcome the challenges of the environment, and with a considerable advantage nurtured by our continuing investment in product, brand and people will continue to rise, maintaining our upward trajectory through the end of this year and well beyond. Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I want to speak directly to our franchisees and associates. I always know you\u2019re listening. This is a period of great momentum for Snap-on. You are the fuel that is ignited and fan that drive forward and upward. For your success in creating this encouraging performance, you have my congratulations. For the capabilities you bring to bear in achieving our progress every day, you have my admiration. And for your commitment to our present and your confidence in our future, you have my thanks. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Glynn: Hi, thanks. Good morning.\nNick Pinchuk: Good morning, Chris.\nChristopher Glynn: So Snap-on tools looked really good sequentially is usually down about 5% seasonally. I think it was down about half that, suggests little incremental commercial execution taking place. Wondering if you think I\u2019m looking at that a little too closely or how you might characterize that?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, I think, look, I think they are certainly on an upward trajectory. So that would include better sequential performance. I think that\u2019s quite true. We\u2019re pretty \u2013 as I\u2019ve used many times in my comments, we were encouraged by this performance and they seem to be rising. If you look at pre-pandemic levels, which is the appropriate comparison up big and their operating margins are strong. And this is a turbulent time, and they are managing over it. And doing well.\nChristopher Glynn: Okay. And curious, you talked about vertical integration, shorter supply chain, that\u2019s clearly characteristic. But probably not necessarily for every product you have. So I\u2019m wondering if you did kind of have kind of a general kind of quantification of any revenue gaps in the quarter that created some backlog build given the widespread dynamics.\nNick Pinchuk: Yes. Nothing I can put my finger on. Look, I mean, I think it\u2019s the place you would expect to see that might be in the critical industries where we have a huge range of products, we put together these big kits and you have to ship them complete. So you might have a kit with 1,000 items in it and you have to ship it complete, yet that business was up pretty well in the quarter. C&I was up nicely in the quarter, and that led critical industries led the way. So I don\u2019t think I can put my finger on any of that. Of course, we had some of that. But we overcame it. Part of it is, like I said, agile marketing, allowing yourself, okay, I got something else to sell. So I think generally, it\u2019s not like we weren\u2019t without impact, but we kind of overcame it. It\u2019s sort of like \u2013 you remember \u2013 you probably don\u2019t remember this Saturday Night Live, Roseanne Roseannadanna, it\u2019s always something. And this is just something of the day and it\u2019s our job as managers to get through it.\nChristopher Glynn: So, right school of management. And so also, just to comment on the balance sheet the stocks down 5% or 6% this morning. You\u2019ve got SOT compounding nicely off of 16% prior year organic. Any kind of fresh thoughts on using the balance sheet to address what looks maybe like a little disconnect between performance and reaction?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, I don\u2019t know the electrodes that are implanted in my body giving me the stock price at every moment. I haven\u2019t looked at yet. No, actually, we didn\u2019t see that it was down necessarily. But look, I don\u2019t know, we take advantage of situations. So I don\u2019t know. We say that we\u2019re trying to be agile in terms of share buyback. So I\u2019ll just leave it at that.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now move to our next caller. Next, we have Scott Stember with CL King. Please go ahead.\nScott Stember: Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions.\nNick Pinchuk: Sure.\nScott Stember: Could you break out within the Tools Group? I don\u2019t know if you gave this before hand tools versus some of the bigger ticket items health, how those perform versus last year?\nNick Pinchuk: I\u2019m trying to get off the quarter-by-quarter train of looking at product lines because I don\u2019t know whether they mean that much, but I will tell you that hand tools were down this quarter actually versus what we\u2019re, I would say, in condescent levels of Q3. And the bigger ticket items were up in aggregate double digits. So I think that kind of sets kind sort of a reversal of what\u2019s going to happen in lately. And that \u2013 I think that gray actually even though the margin was 28.8% \u2013 20.8%, that\u2019s kind of a drag on margins because the highest margin business is hand tools for us in the Tools Group. So that\u2019s kind of an interesting observation, I think, in that regard. But it seems like, at least for our franchisees that tool storage and diagnostics were getting a little more prominent at this time. Of course, euro versus the pre-pandemic levels, they were all up nicely. It has to be to contribute to the 20.6%.\nScott Stember: Right. So but at least on a year-over-year basis, we\u2019re talking like last year\u2019s hand tools were just through the rest?\nNick Pinchuk: Yes. Handles tools were down. But \u2013 okay, it\u2019s like I said, it\u2019s always something. They go up and down like that. You can\u2019t read too much into a quarter, but that\u2019s what happened. But we kind of think that boy, it was encouraging to us to see tool stores come back double digits and diagnostics to be nice as well.\nScott Stember: Alright. And the SFC, anything that stood out, it sounds like everything was up year-over-year or even versus 2 years ago, more importantly? But is there any products or any one area or line that really stood out?\nNick Pinchuk: I don\u2019t know. No, I wouldn\u2019t say \u2013 I don\u2019t think so. It seemed to all be good. I couldn\u2019t parse between. Of course, there are variances in that. I think tool storage very popular at the SFC actually. But I want to point out, Scott, these are all \u2013 there are orders. And so you never know. SFC \u2013 a great SFC doesn\u2019t guarantee a great finish to the year or first quarter next year. A bad SFC doesn\u2019t doom you to a bad one because you have a lot of other things that goes on between August and the end of the year in terms of selling and ordering and so on. But it\u2019s better than a poke than I would a sharp stick in everything, everything is up double digits. And if you were there, you would have been impressed. I mean the franchisees are pumped. I really mean it. They were \u2013 I\u2019ve never seen a more enthusiastic. That\u2019s why we get the idea of exhilaration. I think, we\u2019re going beyond resilience when you\u2019re looking at the auto repair market in this situation.\nScott Stember: Got it. And then last question on the EV side. I know you guys have worked with OEMs and have gained some, I guess, business-related tool kits that are specific in diagnostics to EVs. Is some of that embedded in some of the RS&I increases that you talked about for this quarter?\nNick Pinchuk: Yes. It\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s actually \u2013 yes, we have a couple of projects in this quarter. I think they are extending \u2013 we have one project that\u2019s extended for a couple of quarters, but it\u2019s added a couple \u2013 I think another vehicle this quarter where we have from one big manufacturer, we don\u2019t like to name them, but they have four or five EV models that are coming out, and we\u2019re providing a package to dealerships and metered out portion across the country. So there is some of that there. And then, of course, you\u2019ve got dealer FX that is still coming to fruition, but was up nicely quarter-over-quarter, still a little bit of a drag in terms of margins And it\u2019s something year-over-year. So that was pretty nice. We\u2019re seeing ourselves kind of get on that EV train, get in the early warnings. All these things are early warning. I mean when you\u2019re with EV, when you\u2019re getting projects with the OEM, that\u2019s an early warning on what the vehicle is going to need by the time they get into the business. And as dealer effects grows, we have a sort of like a neural network of early warning to see what\u2019s happened in the garage. So we\u2019re kind of positive about that, but it\u2019s a page, there aren\u2019t that many on the road yet.\nScott Stember: Got it. That\u2019s all I have. Thanks again.\nNick Pinchuk: Okay, sure.\nOperator: Next, we will go to Luke Junk with Baird. Please go ahead.\nLuke Junk: Nick, Aldo, good morning.\nNick Pinchuk: Good morning.\nAldo Pagliari: Good morning.\nLuke Junk: I got two questions this morning. First, Nick, you touched on the benefits of vertical integration in your comments to wrap up the prepared piece. Certainly, a lot of investor attention right now being paid to the supply chain issues and the environment generally speaking. So just hoping you could expand on any steps that you\u2019ve taken going into the fourth quarter and next year. Of course, we can see overall gross margin up 30 basis points year-on-year this quarter. You mentioned RCI-related benefits. I\u2019m sure there is some other factors going into that would it be safe to say that you feel like you\u2019re on the front foot in terms of addressing the current supply chain environment?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, who knows? I mean, every day, there is something new, but I think we\u2019re \u2013 what I was trying to say was, Luke, we do take steps and our model enables those stacks to be particularly efficacious. The vertical integration means that we don\u2019t buy that much. Most of the stuff is in our house. If you think about a hand tool, Raw steel comes in the back of the factory. And basically, we add very little when it comes out to you\u2019re worried about steel. We buy the steel in the U.S., short of supply chain. We buy some of our chips in the U.S. And closer place. That\u2019s not bad \u2013 circuit boards, those kinds of things, so we have those things as well as one of the advantages we have, Luke, and we do this, we\u2019re very aggressive in spot buying. So we go out a spot buy because we don\u2019t buy large quantities of any one thing. If you\u2019re an auto manufacturer, I used to be in Ford. You\u2019re buying something for the new Mustang or for the Ford Focus or whatever it is, you\u2019re buying a lot of stuff and it\u2019s hard to \u2013 once that supply chain gets disrupted because the Shanghai port closes because of a couple of cases, you kind of have trouble to move \u2013 get any alternative. Well, if you\u2019re only buying a little bit, you go out, you find them in the intercity of the system, and we have our guys actively doing that. That\u2019s why we are not seeing so much in terms of shortage. It may be still a little cost increase, but then we\u2019re agile pricing. So we don\u2019t have such a big problem in that regard. I\u2019m not saying we\u2019re not actively working because, boy, our people are putting a lot of energy into it, but if you look at the numbers, pretty well managed.\nLuke Junk: Thank you for that. And then maybe this might be a question for Aldo. Curious, what insights you draw looking at your current credit metrics in terms of end mechanic customer health and barn capacity from here. I guess specifically, I am looking at the fact that the finance bad debt expense was down quite a bit the last couple of quarters now. And while originations are up, the tools group top line is certainly growing quite a bit faster than originations, especially if I look at, say, a 2-year stack basis. So, just any thoughts there as well as if there is any qualitative feedback from franchisees that would be interesting as well? Thanks.\nAldo Pagliari: So my view, Luke, would be that I think technicians themselves are in a better financial position than where they were maybe a year or 2 years or even back ago. I think that\u2019s a broad statement that applies to many industries. I think you hear that out of the big banks. I mean customers are better servicing their debt than they were before. I think they have more discretionary power and spending. And so far, they have been applying it to their indebtedness. And I think we see the same trends. It\u2019s our job to capture that incremental savings that they might be seeing if they are not borrowing as much as before in capturing business with tool sales. And I think you see that. So, the Snap-on tool sales being up more than originations, I think as I applaud the tools group by being able to entice customers to buy more stuff because they have more money. From what you read from the Bureau Labor statistics, technician wages is doing pretty darn good. So, they seem to be strong. They seem to have more flexibility in what they choose to buy, and they seem to like to buy our products. So again, they are in a better position, I think than they were a year or so ago. And of course, every quarter brings potential new changes. But right now, it\u2019s been running very favorable. And as a result of that, our going forward provision rates are lower than they might have been a year or 2 years ago. It\u2019s going back pre-pandemic, simply because of the debt servicing trends.\nLuke Junk: Good. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we move to Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Please go ahead.\nGary Prestopino: Good morning everyone.\nNick Pinchuk: Hi Gary.\nGary Prestopino: Got a series of questions here. First of all, Nick as you talk to your franchisees, and you say they are like really pumped. I mean what \u2013 can you cite like two or three reasons why they are so optimistic about the repair industry for the next year or so that\u2019s reflected in their order rates?\nNick Pinchuk:\nSo, Cowan 5231:\nGary Prestopino: Okay. That\u2019s very encouraging. And then in terms of you saw a strong-double digit growth in orders out of the Snap-on Franchisee Conference, what was the growth in orders \u2013 well, the 2020 conference and even particularly in the 2019 conference. Do you \u2013 off the top of your head, do you remember how you came out of the\u2026?\nNick Pinchuk: I don\u2019t know, but it wasn\u2019t double digits. I mean and it wasn\u2019t as you know. It was probably \u2013 if I remember last year it was kind of a little bit less across \u2013 sort of across the board in 19, it was probably different ups and downs. So, some guys were up some products, I am talking about guys because I am thinking to the product managers. Some areas were up double digits and others were down. This thing was across the board double digits. It was maple. This is a game plus.\nGary Prestopino: Yes. Great. And then just lastly, on the\u2026\nNick Pinchuk: Gary, before you go away from that, I want to emphasize, like I said for this is orders, not sales, it\u2019s directionally indicative not \u2013 but better than a poke and I with a sharp stick, it tells you, you come away feeling good about this. We feel good about this better than we have of any SFC that have been around here.\nGary Prestopino: Okay. That\u2019s fine. And then just lastly, on the diagnostic side. As older cars come into the park that have ADAS, is that directly affecting your end demand for some of your diagnostic products?\nNick Pinchuk: Yes. Well, it\u2019s actually broadly spoken, I think at first, it\u2019s certainly \u2013 it\u2019s affecting the \u2013 first, it\u2019s affecting the demand for Mitchell, which is up nicely, because Mitchell has got a very complete ADS suite in it, that\u2019s industry leading. And then it\u2019s also helping to drive the equipment business because the equipment I remember, equipment business is holding up. This conference was going to the dogs. And so the \u2013 the TruFit \u2013 ADAS system, which I talked about I think is something that\u2019s helping drive that undercar equipment growth. And that\u2019s where you set up a system that helps \u2013 that physically calibrates the system in the garage. And it\u2019s also driving some of the diagnostics. But the diagnostics with their intelligent features are probably yet to feel the impetus from that. You will see it coming in future quarters.\nGary Prestopino: Okay. Thank you. Sorry about the dog.\nNick Pinchuk: That\u2019s okay. No problem.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now move to Liz Suzuki with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nLiz Suzuki: Great. Thanks for squeezing in my question. Could you talk about what you are seeing in cost inflation and how much of the organic growth in the Tools segment is impacted by price increases as you pass through those cost increases?\nNick Pinchuk: We are not going to go into that necessarily. I would say there is some price increase in there. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s the major portion of the organic growth because price rolls through the system. We are seeing some cost increases, but the tools group has been able to manage that somewhat. To the extent you do get pricing offsetting cost increases, it tends to \u2013 it tends to knock down your margins because, of course, you get $1 of sales and $1 a cost that tends to do it. But it wasn\u2019t a major effect in this quarter.\nLiz Suzuki: Got it. And then Nick and Aldo, I think you have both touched on this a little bit in the prepared remarks and in the Q&A just about supply chain disruptions. I mean from a competitive standpoint, does this create an opportunity for Snap-on to meet the needs of your customers with some of your competitors that may do more importing, maybe more constrained on inventory?\nNick Pinchuk: Sure. Well, I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t speak for my competitors about being constrained. Actually, in reality to tell you the truth Liz, we \u2013 Snap-on is kind of interesting, it kind of works on itself. Our technicians either decide to buy Snap-on or they decide to buy another group of products. They hard \u2013 to choose from another group of products, they hardly ever say, \u201cOh, I am going to buy another product.\u201d And then say, \u201cOh, I will settle for the Snap-on as the other one isn\u2019t available.\u201d So, I am not sure how much that helps. It certainly puts us in a better position to grow and probably capture new customers who might not be serviced by these people. There is some of that, I think. But I don\u2019t really like to talk about the competition because we really compete against ourselves pretty much. The better we get, the more franchisees capability we have, the more they are able to sell, the better our product is, the more it grows regardless of what the competition does.\nLiz Suzuki: Great. Understood. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we go to David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.\nDavid MacGregor: Yes. Good morning everyone.\nNick Pinchuk: Good morning.\nDavid MacGregor: I wanted to just start off by building on the last question. And I guess it would appear now so you are offsetting a lot of the cost inflation with volume growth in RCI. And I am just wondering what your expectations are for pricing going forward and your ability to price some of that cost inflation going forward rather than relying on volume growth in RCI?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, look, I think first of all, I think I tried to make the case and I think it\u2019s quite true that we have a lot of insulation against that. We believe that we can price as we need to because you have \u2013 we have a direct model in a lot of cases where we are direct to the end customer versus some other people who are going through several layers. And then secondly, the brand position allows us always to be the price leader. So, we pretty much price relative to our prior products when we are doing normal pricing, David. When we are bringing out a new product, we look at where we are happy really where the competition is. So generally, I think to the extent we see costs arising, we can price against that. I don\u2019t have much worry about that. There is probably not in every nook and cranny of our business, but I think it\u2019s true in most of our business, particularly given that \u2013 given our brand position.\nDavid MacGregor: Got it. Next question, really, is there a way to sort of help us understand just what sales growth was off the truck, what the sell-through growth was in the quarter?\nNick Pinchuk: No, I can tell you exactly. It was about the same as the sales growth to the truck.\nDavid MacGregor: Okay.\nNick Pinchuk: I can\u2019t give you much insight on what was sold off the truck so much with such precision, but it was pretty much the same.\nDavid MacGregor: Was pretty close. So, how would you characterize truck level inventories right now, Nick? And maybe any way to hand tools versus bigger ticket items, it would be helpful?\nNick Pinchuk: I would say everybody I talk to seems to be looking for tool storage. Now of course, that\u2019s a windshield survey. You are kind of familiar with those. But the thing is that you seem to see \u2013 I think there is a need \u2013 people want a little more tool storage. I think inventory, if anything are probably down some versus historical levels. Because, yes, this quarter we had equal, but in past quarters, sales off the truck kind of exceeded the \u2013 our sales to the truck. So, I think we have had \u2013 if you look back over the last three quarters, four quarters, five quarters, six quarters, you have seen that sales off the truck exceeded. So, I think inventories are kind of down. Now I don\u2019t know what that means. I am not sure that there is going to be a restocking or not. I kind of get the feel that maybe they may restock certain product. Tool storage was nice this quarter. I think off to demand. We had a nice \u2013 in fact, big ticket was nice double digits this quarter. So, it\u2019s kind of a little bit of a reversal of what\u2019s been happening previously. You haven\u2019t seen it yet fully in the originations, I guess. But look, I think there is a couple of things, I think one, it takes a while to work through that. And then secondly, I think people are kind of paid down their credit. So, they have got their kind of in a situation where they are able to buy some things that they are able to finance themselves.\nDavid MacGregor: Great. I guess just to pick up on your comment about credit. It seems like there has been \u2013 and you have talked about this yourself, there has been more rotation towards revolving account credit as opposed to extended credit over the last year or so. And just thinking about how that\u2019s playing out now, your franchisees, obviously, they are a little more liquid. And so maybe in a better position to be able to provide that revolving account credit. I am just wondering how \u2013 if you could update us in terms of what credit penetration rates look like for big ticket right now? Once upon a time, I think you told us big ticket was up \u2013 was about 90% credit, diagnostics was 50% to 60% credit. What would those credit penetrations look like in kind of this new world?\nNick Pinchuk: I don\u2019t really have that number, but it\u2019s somewhat lower now. Part of it is because I think just what you say, customer is a little more pros. The franchisees are a little more liquid. But also, make no mistake about this optimism floats in this. I mean the franchisees get a little bit more optimistic, and they say, \u201cHey, if I can put $1 in RA, I am going to get it back. It\u2019s a great investment for me. Why would I put in the bank or something.\u201d So there is some of that flow through the franchise system. What I \u2013 what we view is, I think for sure, is that the customers themselves have unused credit or untapped credit capacity. So, that will come up. We haven\u2019t really seen \u2013 there was a rotation at the beginning of the virus period toward RA. But this quarter, I would say it\u2019s kind of stayed solid. RA and EC have been the same as last quarter and maybe the quarter before that was the same way. So, we have kind of found that equilibrium right now. We will see how it plays out going forward. Whatever it has, it didn\u2019t impact our big ticket sales this time.\nDavid MacGregor: Yes. Congratulations there. And on the contract, $9.5 million versus the finance receivables, $5.7 million in terms of originations growth, contract has been out in front of finance receivables for a while now. Do you expect that to continue, or do you see that at some point or nearby kind of getting back to a more equal level or maybe finance receivables getting to a faster level of growth of contract?\nAldo Pagliari: No, contract receivables tend to run up a little bit with the Snap-on Franchisee Conference because you get some short-term lower financing arrangements there. But no, there is nothing structurally there that would say that the EC will not get back to higher levels. And I would say EC was pretty decent and the U.S. was above the average in this case. So, they had strong performance and it was nice originations David, in both tool storage and diagnostics in the quarter.\nDavid MacGregor: Yes. Last question for me is just social media sales. And I guess you have kind of alluded to this in your comments, Nick, about online sales. But you don\u2019t have to look very far online to see franchisees selling tools through Facebook and other platforms. Can you just talk about how you foresee that growing? And does that accelerate? Does that help you in terms of your sales going forward?\nNick Pinchuk: Actually David, I wasn\u2019t \u2013 in my comments, I wasn\u2019t talking about sales. I was talking about using social media to inform customers about products and promotions and other things, which frees up face-to-face time for actual selling. I don\u2019t really see social media sales as growing that much. I mean it\u2019s not much of a factor right now. Now it might, but I think generally, by and large, the overwhelming use of electronic media via the franchisees are just that to try to orchestrate. Okay, I want you to know about this. So, when I come in and I am going to tell you why you need it, that kind of thing.\nDavid MacGregor: Productivity.\nNick Pinchuk: Sure.\nDavid MacGregor: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. We have time for one additional question. Our final question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nNick Pinchuk: Bret Jordan.\nEthan Huntley: Hi, good morning. This is actually Ethan Huntley on for Bret.\nNick Pinchuk: Okay.\nEthan Huntley: Yes, could you just provide any color on the sales cadence throughout the quarter?\nNick Pinchuk: Say that again. I didn\u2019t quite hear it. Could you say it again, please? Sales cadence?\nEthan Huntley: Yes, correct. Yes, just on sales cadence.\nNick Pinchuk: Yes. Look, it was pretty much the same as past quarters. I think generally, a little bit interrupted \u2013 if you want to go back to \u2013 I will give you this. If you go back 2 years beyond the COVID era, the third quarter was particularly aberrated by the franchisee conference. So, you get kind of a week early couple of months, certainly early one month in the quarter. July was like a wasteland. And so then things would come roaring back when you got the SFC, people would be keeping their powder dry pretty much. The last 2 years, we have been able to get out of that by a number of artifices. And so it\u2019s a much more standard where you have, of course, a quarter is 4, 5, and so you get kind of that kind of distribution, maybe with a little higher number in the last quarter, but it\u2019s nothing particularly special. I think this quarter of course is above. So, each quarter, it\u2019s kind of an upwards versus its prior numbers. And so you feel like the upward trajectory, you can see it if you look very, very closely at the month-to-month numbers in a quarter as you are going to \u2013 as we are going through the months and the quarters and the years upwards. But not much difference in distribution except for that sort of general monotonic trend.\nEthan Huntley: Understood. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then another one here on the corporate expense, it was pretty high, $34 million, up about $10 million year-over-year and $5 million sequentially. I know you mentioned sort of performance-based comp and some brand building costs, but anything outside of those two buckets?\nNick Pinchuk: Yes. Well, the SFC was live this year. So, you think \u2013 look, think of it this way. Okay, we had brand building, we had stock \u2013 we had comp expense lease cost. And this was our celebration of our 100th anniversary. So, the SFC and the celebrations we had there were bigger than \u2013 bigger and better than any prior years. So, you have some of that into your situation because the franchisees are investing in the company. I think I said they are positive about the days and decades ahead with Snap-on. And so that merits a little bit of celebration when you reach a Centennial milestone. So, there is some of that in there.\nEthan Huntley: Sure. Thank you. And then just one last one, if you don\u2019t mind. Given the strong business performance and cash flow, and I know you sort of mentioned opportunistically repurchasing shares, but where do share repurchases stand in terms of capital allocation given where the stock share is?\nNick Pinchuk: We have a four-piece capital allocation. We tend to be working capital investors. You know what I mean, this is a working capital-intense company. So, when we grow, we tend to \u2013 the COVID kind of changed \u2013 not changed but obscure that dynamics somewhat. But generally as you grow you have working capital, then we look at acquisitions, we believe we have runways for growth, particularly in owners and managers and the garages or in maybe in C&I in some places. And we have done some of that and Dealer-FX is an example. We have a dividend that we have paid a dividend every quarter since 1939. We have never reduced it. So, we take a look at our dividend with the intent of perpetuity and whether we should increase it or not, and we look at that carefully. And then we are agile about share purchases. So, we have kind of a four-way look at that, and they are all \u2013 they are all a draw on what we might do with cash depending on the situation.\nEthan Huntley: Thank you very much.\nOperator: That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. Ms. Verbsky, at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any closing remarks.\nSara Verbsky: Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day.\nOperator: Thank you all for your attention. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. All participants may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Nick Pinchuk",
            "content": "Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I will start the call by covering the highlights of our third quarter and along the way, I will give you my perspective on our results. They are encouraging. On our market, they are positive and more than resilient, and I will speak about our progress. It's been considerable each period demonstrating increasing strength even when in the midst of solvency and headwind. And we will also speak about what it all means to our future. It's incredibly promising. And then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. Our reported sales in the quarter were $1.377 billion. They were up 10.2%, including $9.6 million of favorable foreign currency and $19.5 million of acquisition-related sales. Our organic sales growth was up 7% \u2013 was 7%, gains in every group. It was our fifth straight quarter of above pre-pandemic performance and Snap-on value creation processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, as we call it, all combined to drive that progress. And progress it was. Opco operating income of $201.3 million was up $15.6 million from last year. The OI margin was 19.4%, down 30 basis points, impacted negatively by acquisitions, but still very strong at a strong level. For financial services, operating income of $70.6 million increased 7.6% and the delinquencies were down even below the 2019 pre-pandemic levels, a continuing testimony to our unique business model and its ability to navigate the most threatening of environments. First quarter EPS was $2.57, up $0.29 or 8.8% from last year. And as I said before, we believe Snap-on is stronger now than when we entered this great withering and our third quarter results testifies to just that. Compared with 2019, before we ever heard of the virus, our sales grew $135.9 million or 15.1%, which includes $21 million from acquisition-related sales, $13.6 million of favorable foreign currency, and a $101.3 million or 11.1% organic gain. And that 2021 OpCo operating margin of 19.4% was up 80 basis points from the pre-pandemic levels, even while absorbing the impact of new acquisitions and while meeting what we can call a considerable disruption of these days. Now, let's talk about the markets. Water repair remains quite resilient. The technicians are prospering. They know they weather the depths of the COVID shock, learn to accommodate the virus environment and are well along the psychological recovery. Techs are resilient. They have been at their post for the last 18 months undoing it and they won't be shots again and they are optimistic about the future of their profession, about the outlook of individual transportation, and about the greater need for their skills as the vehicle park changes with new technology. Vehicle repair is strong \u2013 is a strong and resilient market. You can hear it in the franchisees voice and you can see it written clearly across our numbers every quarter. Also on auto repair, there are our shop owners and managers different from the techs. That's where our Repair Systems & Information Group, RS&I, plies its trade. Demand for new and used cars is high despite limited supply in dealership repair and maintenance and warranty is rebounding and dealers are starting to invest again. And we have been able to make \u2013 we have been able to take advantage with groundbreaking products like our award winning Tru-Point advanced driver assistance calibration system, our new diagnostic, our new diagnostic, TRITON-D10, Intelligent Diagnostic and our acclaimed Mitchell1 ProDemand repair estimating guide, all representing new technologies and data deployed to make work easier in the shop. Vehicle repair looks more promising than ever and Snap-on is poised to capitalize. Now, let's talk about critical indices which Snap-on rolls out of the garage, solving task of consequence. These are commercial industrial as C&I operates. The virus had a much longer impact on these customers. They were slower to accommodate, but they are recovering. And in the quarter, our results showed that trend, gains in North America, Europe and in Asia, all over the globe. So overall, I describe our C&I markets as improving. And coupled with the strength of the auto repair sectors, our markets are beyond resilient and we are ready and well-positioned to make progress along those run-rates to recover. At the same time, it's clear that we have ongoing potential on our runways for improvement, the Snap-on value creation processes. They have never been more important, helping to counter the turbulence of the day, especially important with customer connection as understanding the work of professional technicians and innovation, matching that insight with technology, driving new products. And just this quarter, Snap-on was prominently represented with 9 Professional Tool & Equipment News we call it P10 People's Choice Awards where the actual users, the technicians make the selection. We are also recognized with two P10 Innovation awards and we are honored with 2 Motor Magazine Top Tool awards. An essential driver of Snap-on growth is innovative product that makes work easier and the awards are the one are our testimony that great Snap-on products just keep coming, matching the growing complexity of the task, becoming more essential to technicians and driving our forward progress. That's the environment, pretty positive. Now, we will move to the operating groups. In C&I, volume in the quarter rose 13.9% or $42 million versus 2020 on significant growth across all divisions, reflecting \u2013 reflected a $32.9 million or 10.6% organic uplift and $7.5 million from our AutoCrib acquisition. And double-digit growth in our European hand tool businesses and a high single-digit rise in critical industries led the way. C&I operating income of $52.6 million, was up $10.5 million or 24.4% and the operating margin was 15.3%. That's an increase of 130 basis points versus last year. I'd say that's an attention getting rise against the wind. Now, compared to the pre-pandemic 2019 results, sales were up 4.8%, including a 0.9% organic gain and that OI margin of 15.3% was up 90 basis points against the 70 point impact of acquisitions and unfavorable currency. Once again, SNA Europe delivered double-digit growth beyond \u2013 double-digit growth beyond pre-virus levels against a complex and varied marketing environment propelled by the customization power of their Bahco ERGO Tool Management System. And our industrial division roles in critical industries, recording nice gains in general industry, heavy duty, education and U.S. aviation, a number of positive sectors overcoming weakness and continuing weakness in the military and natural resources. P&I is rising and we are enthusiastic about the possibilities. We will keep strengthening our position to capture those opportunities and enabling that intent is our expanding lineup of innovative new products. And the third quarter did see some great new offerings like our 14.4-volt 3h-inch drive brushless reaction, the CDR861. It's already popular. And it's no wonder. It's a powerful combination of strength and speed, high torque, 60-foot bumps, the bus loose, very suborn bolts and rapid operations, 275 RPM for getting those fasteners off in quick time. It's made in our Murphy, North Carolina plant and it features a full frame brushless motor for longer runtime and durability. It includes a safety switch that shuts in an equipment safety switch that shuts down \u2013 shuts down the tool after 2 minutes of continuous use that's eliminating the chance of overheating. It also has a super bright 18 aluminum front-facing light that stays illuminated after the trigger is released, allowing easy and immediate inspection of the work. This ratchet also features a built-in break that stops the tool from throwing or fasteners, which it seems like not much, but it's an important safety feature for technicians. And it also offers a great cushion grip that makes for more comfortable tool control even during extended use. The CDR861 power, speed and comfort, it's in a very compact package. It's a mighty might for accomplishing critical tasks and the professionals love it. Well, that's C&I, continuing upward, exceeding pre-pandemic volumes, strong profitability and positions for more. Now, on to the Tools Group, sales of $471.4 million, up $21.8 million including $4.9 million of favorable currency and a $16.9 million or 3.7% organic gain, growth in the U.S. \u2013 both in the U.S. and the international operations. And the operating margin was 20.8%, one of our highest effort and up 140 basis points from last year. Compared with the pre-virus 2019 level, the organic gain was $80.4 million or 20.6% and the 20.8% operating margin was up 700 basis points compared with the pre-pandemic level, 700 basis points in the midst of operating turbulence. Tools Group is responding to the challenges of the day, increasing its product advantage, fortifying its brands and further enabling its franchisees, giving them more selling capacity, it's all working. Five strong quarters of above pre-pandemic performance says it so. Now, the third quarter is when we hold our \u2013 most of you know this, the third quarter is when we hold our annual Snap-on Franchisee Conference, our SFC. This year's we are back again in person at the Gaylord in Orlando, Florida, over 9,000 attendees, a record. We have training seminars in sales growth and intelligent diagnostics. They were well attended and well received. And we had several football fields of products. So, our franchisees could get up close and personal with our latest innovations. For the franchisees, the SFC is an opportunity for learning, for touching and ordering new products and for recharging their Snap-on batteries and believe me, they are charged. For the company, the SFC is an opportunity to gauge the franchisees' outlook on the business. One quantitative way is orders. Well, they were up, strong double digits over last year's virtual live from the Forge event and from the 2019 SFC live in Washington, D.C. And when I say up, I mean all of our product categories showed substantial gains over both of those events. And so that's the quantitative look at it. Qualitatively, I spoke with many of our franchisees. And I can attest that they were beaming, showing a lot of confidence in our business and declaring considerable optimism on their future days and decades ahead with Snap-on. We do believe our franchisees are continuing to grow stronger each quarter and we continue to invest in our future. And if you were with us in Orlando, you would have seen it unmistakably and we are investing, building franchisees' ability to use the direct interface with technicians, enabling them to better communicate their unique capability and growing technology of Snap-on product lines. We have great confidence in the power of our products and there are real reasons for the confidence. You heard about the product awards. Well, beyond that, there is a continuous stream of terrific new offerings. During the SFC, the Tools Group unveiled its new KHP415, portable 40-inch substation power card. It's targeted at entry level technicians, the ones working on a narrow scope of repairs. It's built in our Albona, Iowa factory and the new card enables young mechanics to invest in Snap-on storage at a value price, while at the same time getting some very attractive professional features, a lockable comp compartment, fourfold distort and adjustable power tool rack that holds up the 10 tools and a power strip with 5 outlets and 2 USB ports for battery and device charging. New cart, it was well received. And it's quickly reaching what we call hit product status over $1 million of sales. It's raising upward on a steep trajectory. Beyond products, we spent time working to expand franchise'se selling capacity, harnessing social media, improving product training and RCI and the van operations and it's working. Selling capacity is up and you can see it clearly in the 5 straight gangbuster quarters for our van network. The Tools Group is on a very positive trend, ascending and leaving pre-pandemic levels way behind. Nowon to RS&I. Sales were up 14.8% or $46.9 million, including a $31.7 million or 9.9% organic uplift. Growth was weighted toward undercar equipment, but our diagnostics and information businesses also chipped in with double-digit increases. Versus 2020, RCI operating earnings were $83.3 million, representing a rise of $3.2 million. Comparing with 2019, sales grew $41.7 million or 12.9%, including $24.2 million or 7.4% organic grain, nice growth. The RS&I OI margin was down versus the last 2 years, attenuated by business mix, acquisitions and currency, but it was still a strong 22.9%. So, we clearly see the potential of our runway with RS&I, expanding Snap-on's presence in the garage with coherent acquisitions and a growing line of powerful products. Third quarter annual growth was broad-based, but a strong double-digit rise in undercar equipment was an especially welcome turn. That's a nice turnaround and it was led by innovative products like our 15K four-post alignment lift. It's really taking a hold in the repair shops as they have resumed investing. This new 15K provides professional grade alignment lifting for a variety of vehicle sizes, with open front columns, best-in-class ultra-wide 26-inch runways, and integrated 100-inch show long-wear plates. It's suited to accommodate vehicles from compact passenger cars, compact passenger cars to big pickup trucks and it's low easy on approach angle makes it great even for low-profile sports cars that are often a challenge for other lifts. Made in our Louisville, Kentucky plant on an assembly line, it's made in our Louisville, Kentucky plant on assembly line, I am very familiar with. I participated in an RCI event for that process. Our new 15K has helped drive the recovery for undercar equipment and it's driven the rise in RS&I volumes. We are quite positive about RSI's possibilities to repair shop owners and managers as the vehicle industry evolves, it's got a great future. So, that's the highlights of our quarter. Continued and strong progress, our fifth straight period exceeding pre-pandemic levels, C&I on track with strong sales and increasing profitability. RS&I, undercar, coming back, Tools Group, strong, pumped and moving vertically, the credit company solid in a storm and profitable, the overall corporation, organic sales rising 7%, Opco operating margin, 19.4%, and EPS of $3.57, a considerable rise. And most important, more testimony that Snap-on has emerged from the turbulence much stronger than we entered. It was an encouraging quarter. Now, I will turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Thanks, Aldo. The Snap-on third quarter can be summarized in one word, momentum. Our markets are showing extraordinary possibilities, almost across the board with order repair the most advanced going beyond resilience. We sold the COVID-19 playing out with our customers in three phases, shock, interruption in the face of virus uncertainty, a combination of gradual learning to pursue essential work while staying safe and psychological recovery, our confidence in the future and return to normal buying. But now we're seeing a fourth phase, exhilaration of certainty that we're moving sharply to higher levels, ignited by the conviction that we have met and manage the virus and they want \u2013 and that we won't get shocked again. It's a bright outlook. And Snap-on with continuing investment in product and brand and people is well positioned to serve that trend. Of course, the COVID is still lingering, and its side effects, inflation and supply disruption around the loose, but Snap-on is strongly arrayed to engage those challenges. A direct selling model and strong brand position enables agile pricing. Our vertical integration and shorter supply chains make us less vulnerable to sourcing viscosities. Our broad product line, more than 80,000 SKUs supports flex \u2013 flexible marketing to guide around shortages, and our RCI culture drives cost offsets. We found opportunities on our runway for growth and improvement even amidst these challenging times, and you can see it in the numbers, encouraging. C&I sales up from \u2013 both from last year and 2019, OI margin, 15.3% strong and rising 130 basis points and 90 basis points versus 2020 and 2019, respectively. RS&I, up organically, 9.9% versus last year and 7.4% beyond the pre-pandemic levels. OI margins of 22.9%. And the Tools Group, organic volume rising 3.7% versus last year's record level and up 20.6% versus the day before the virus. OI margin, it was 20.8%, up 140 basis points from last year and up 700 basis points from 2019. It all led to our corporation being organically up 7% compared with last year and a strong 11.1% versus pre-pandemic numbers. Overall, OI margin was 19.4%, solid in the face of turbulence in our credit company, navigating then certainly without disruptions. Profit is up, delinquencies down. And EPS, $3.57, rising emphatically versus all comparisons. We have emerged from the virus stronger than when we entered, and the numbers confirm it. We've now recorded five, five straight quarters of above pre-pandemic performances, and we believe that with our markets reaching beyond resilience to exhiliration with the capabilities of our model to overcome the challenges of the environment, and with a considerable advantage nurtured by our continuing investment in product, brand and people will continue to rise, maintaining our upward trajectory through the end of this year and well beyond. Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I want to speak directly to our franchisees and associates. I always know you're listening. This is a period of great momentum for Snap-on. You are the fuel that is ignited and fan that drive forward and upward. For your success in creating this encouraging performance, you have my congratulations. For the capabilities you bring to bear in achieving our progress every day, you have my admiration. And for your commitment to our present and your confidence in our future, you have my thanks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Good morning, Chris. Well, I think, look, I think they are certainly on an upward trajectory. So that would include better sequential performance. I think that's quite true. We're pretty \u2013 as I've used many times in my comments, we were encouraged by this performance and they seem to be rising. If you look at pre-pandemic levels, which is the appropriate comparison up big and their operating margins are strong. And this is a turbulent time, and they are managing over it. And doing well. Yes. Nothing I can put my finger on. Look, I mean, I think it's the place you would expect to see that might be in the critical industries where we have a huge range of products, we put together these big kits and you have to ship them complete. So you might have a kit with 1,000 items in it and you have to ship it complete, yet that business was up pretty well in the quarter. C&I was up nicely in the quarter, and that led critical industries led the way. So I don't think I can put my finger on any of that. Of course, we had some of that. But we overcame it. Part of it is, like I said, agile marketing, allowing yourself, okay, I got something else to sell. So I think generally, it's not like we weren't without impact, but we kind of overcame it. It's sort of like \u2013 you remember \u2013 you probably don't remember this Saturday Night Live, Roseanne Roseannadanna, it's always something. And this is just something of the day and it's our job as managers to get through it. Well, I don't know the electrodes that are implanted in my body giving me the stock price at every moment. I haven't looked at yet. No, actually, we didn't see that it was down necessarily. But look, I don't know, we take advantage of situations. So I don't know. We say that we're trying to be agile in terms of share buyback. So I'll just leave it at that. Sure. I'm trying to get off the quarter-by-quarter train of looking at product lines because I don't know whether they mean that much, but I will tell you that hand tools were down this quarter actually versus what we're, I would say, in condescent levels of Q3. And the bigger ticket items were up in aggregate double digits. So I think that kind of sets kind sort of a reversal of what's going to happen in lately. And that \u2013 I think that gray actually even though the margin was 28.8% \u2013 20.8%, that's kind of a drag on margins because the highest margin business is hand tools for us in the Tools Group. So that's kind of an interesting observation, I think, in that regard. But it seems like, at least for our franchisees that tool storage and diagnostics were getting a little more prominent at this time. Of course, euro versus the pre-pandemic levels, they were all up nicely. It has to be to contribute to the 20.6%. Yes. Handles tools were down. But \u2013 okay, it's like I said, it's always something. They go up and down like that. You can't read too much into a quarter, but that's what happened. But we kind of think that boy, it was encouraging to us to see tool stores come back double digits and diagnostics to be nice as well. I don't know. No, I wouldn't say \u2013 I don't think so. It seemed to all be good. I couldn't parse between. Of course, there are variances in that. I think tool storage very popular at the SFC actually. But I want to point out, Scott, these are all \u2013 there are orders. And so you never know. SFC \u2013 a great SFC doesn't guarantee a great finish to the year or first quarter next year. A bad SFC doesn't doom you to a bad one because you have a lot of other things that goes on between August and the end of the year in terms of selling and ordering and so on. But it's better than a poke than I would a sharp stick in everything, everything is up double digits. And if you were there, you would have been impressed. I mean the franchisees are pumped. I really mean it. They were \u2013 I've never seen a more enthusiastic. That's why we get the idea of exhilaration. I think, we're going beyond resilience when you're looking at the auto repair market in this situation. Yes. It's \u2013 it's actually \u2013 yes, we have a couple of projects in this quarter. I think they are extending \u2013 we have one project that's extended for a couple of quarters, but it's added a couple \u2013 I think another vehicle this quarter where we have from one big manufacturer, we don't like to name them, but they have four or five EV models that are coming out, and we're providing a package to dealerships and metered out portion across the country. So there is some of that there. And then, of course, you've got dealer FX that is still coming to fruition, but was up nicely quarter-over-quarter, still a little bit of a drag in terms of margins And it's something year-over-year. So that was pretty nice. We're seeing ourselves kind of get on that EV train, get in the early warnings. All these things are early warning. I mean when you're with EV, when you're getting projects with the OEM, that's an early warning on what the vehicle is going to need by the time they get into the business. And as dealer effects grows, we have a sort of like a neural network of early warning to see what's happened in the garage. So we're kind of positive about that, but it's a page, there aren't that many on the road yet. Okay, sure. Good morning. Well, who knows? I mean, every day, there is something new, but I think we're \u2013 what I was trying to say was, Luke, we do take steps and our model enables those stacks to be particularly efficacious. The vertical integration means that we don't buy that much. Most of the stuff is in our house. If you think about a hand tool, Raw steel comes in the back of the factory. And basically, we add very little when it comes out to you're worried about steel. We buy the steel in the U.S., short of supply chain. We buy some of our chips in the U.S. And closer place. That's not bad \u2013 circuit boards, those kinds of things, so we have those things as well as one of the advantages we have, Luke, and we do this, we're very aggressive in spot buying. So we go out a spot buy because we don't buy large quantities of any one thing. If you're an auto manufacturer, I used to be in Ford. You're buying something for the new Mustang or for the Ford Focus or whatever it is, you're buying a lot of stuff and it's hard to \u2013 once that supply chain gets disrupted because the Shanghai port closes because of a couple of cases, you kind of have trouble to move \u2013 get any alternative. Well, if you're only buying a little bit, you go out, you find them in the intercity of the system, and we have our guys actively doing that. That's why we are not seeing so much in terms of shortage. It may be still a little cost increase, but then we're agile pricing. So we don't have such a big problem in that regard. I'm not saying we're not actively working because, boy, our people are putting a lot of energy into it, but if you look at the numbers, pretty well managed. Hi Gary. So, Cowan 5231: I don't know, but it wasn't double digits. I mean and it wasn't as you know. It was probably \u2013 if I remember last year it was kind of a little bit less across \u2013 sort of across the board in 19, it was probably different ups and downs. So, some guys were up some products, I am talking about guys because I am thinking to the product managers. Some areas were up double digits and others were down. This thing was across the board double digits. It was maple. This is a game plus. Gary, before you go away from that, I want to emphasize, like I said for this is orders, not sales, it's directionally indicative not \u2013 but better than a poke and I with a sharp stick, it tells you, you come away feeling good about this. We feel good about this better than we have of any SFC that have been around here. Yes. Well, it's actually broadly spoken, I think at first, it's certainly \u2013 it's affecting the \u2013 first, it's affecting the demand for Mitchell, which is up nicely, because Mitchell has got a very complete ADS suite in it, that's industry leading. And then it's also helping to drive the equipment business because the equipment I remember, equipment business is holding up. This conference was going to the dogs. And so the \u2013 the TruFit \u2013 ADAS system, which I talked about I think is something that's helping drive that undercar equipment growth. And that's where you set up a system that helps \u2013 that physically calibrates the system in the garage. And it's also driving some of the diagnostics. But the diagnostics with their intelligent features are probably yet to feel the impetus from that. You will see it coming in future quarters. That's okay. No problem. We are not going to go into that necessarily. I would say there is some price increase in there. I wouldn't say it's the major portion of the organic growth because price rolls through the system. We are seeing some cost increases, but the tools group has been able to manage that somewhat. To the extent you do get pricing offsetting cost increases, it tends to \u2013 it tends to knock down your margins because, of course, you get $1 of sales and $1 a cost that tends to do it. But it wasn't a major effect in this quarter. Sure. Well, I don't know. I can't speak for my competitors about being constrained. Actually, in reality to tell you the truth Liz, we \u2013 Snap-on is kind of interesting, it kind of works on itself. Our technicians either decide to buy Snap-on or they decide to buy another group of products. They hard \u2013 to choose from another group of products, they hardly ever say, \u201cOh, I am going to buy another product.\u201d And then say, \u201cOh, I will settle for the Snap-on as the other one isn't available.\u201d So, I am not sure how much that helps. It certainly puts us in a better position to grow and probably capture new customers who might not be serviced by these people. There is some of that, I think. But I don't really like to talk about the competition because we really compete against ourselves pretty much. The better we get, the more franchisees capability we have, the more they are able to sell, the better our product is, the more it grows regardless of what the competition does. Good morning. Well, look, I think first of all, I think I tried to make the case and I think it's quite true that we have a lot of insulation against that. We believe that we can price as we need to because you have \u2013 we have a direct model in a lot of cases where we are direct to the end customer versus some other people who are going through several layers. And then secondly, the brand position allows us always to be the price leader. So, we pretty much price relative to our prior products when we are doing normal pricing, David. When we are bringing out a new product, we look at where we are happy really where the competition is. So generally, I think to the extent we see costs arising, we can price against that. I don't have much worry about that. There is probably not in every nook and cranny of our business, but I think it's true in most of our business, particularly given that \u2013 given our brand position. No, I can tell you exactly. It was about the same as the sales growth to the truck. I can't give you much insight on what was sold off the truck so much with such precision, but it was pretty much the same. I would say everybody I talk to seems to be looking for tool storage. Now of course, that's a windshield survey. You are kind of familiar with those. But the thing is that you seem to see \u2013 I think there is a need \u2013 people want a little more tool storage. I think inventory, if anything are probably down some versus historical levels. Because, yes, this quarter we had equal, but in past quarters, sales off the truck kind of exceeded the \u2013 our sales to the truck. So, I think we have had \u2013 if you look back over the last three quarters, four quarters, five quarters, six quarters, you have seen that sales off the truck exceeded. So, I think inventories are kind of down. Now I don't know what that means. I am not sure that there is going to be a restocking or not. I kind of get the feel that maybe they may restock certain product. Tool storage was nice this quarter. I think off to demand. We had a nice \u2013 in fact, big ticket was nice double digits this quarter. So, it's kind of a little bit of a reversal of what's been happening previously. You haven't seen it yet fully in the originations, I guess. But look, I think there is a couple of things, I think one, it takes a while to work through that. And then secondly, I think people are kind of paid down their credit. So, they have got their kind of in a situation where they are able to buy some things that they are able to finance themselves. I don't really have that number, but it's somewhat lower now. Part of it is because I think just what you say, customer is a little more pros. The franchisees are a little more liquid. But also, make no mistake about this optimism floats in this. I mean the franchisees get a little bit more optimistic, and they say, \u201cHey, if I can put $1 in RA, I am going to get it back. It's a great investment for me. Why would I put in the bank or something.\u201d So there is some of that flow through the franchise system. What I \u2013 what we view is, I think for sure, is that the customers themselves have unused credit or untapped credit capacity. So, that will come up. We haven't really seen \u2013 there was a rotation at the beginning of the virus period toward RA. But this quarter, I would say it's kind of stayed solid. RA and EC have been the same as last quarter and maybe the quarter before that was the same way. So, we have kind of found that equilibrium right now. We will see how it plays out going forward. Whatever it has, it didn't impact our big ticket sales this time. Actually David, I wasn't \u2013 in my comments, I wasn't talking about sales. I was talking about using social media to inform customers about products and promotions and other things, which frees up face-to-face time for actual selling. I don't really see social media sales as growing that much. I mean it's not much of a factor right now. Now it might, but I think generally, by and large, the overwhelming use of electronic media via the franchisees are just that to try to orchestrate. Okay, I want you to know about this. So, when I come in and I am going to tell you why you need it, that kind of thing. Sure. Bret Jordan. Okay. Say that again. I didn't quite hear it. Could you say it again, please? Sales cadence? Yes. Look, it was pretty much the same as past quarters. I think generally, a little bit interrupted \u2013 if you want to go back to \u2013 I will give you this. If you go back 2 years beyond the COVID era, the third quarter was particularly aberrated by the franchisee conference. So, you get kind of a week early couple of months, certainly early one month in the quarter. July was like a wasteland. And so then things would come roaring back when you got the SFC, people would be keeping their powder dry pretty much. The last 2 years, we have been able to get out of that by a number of artifices. And so it's a much more standard where you have, of course, a quarter is 4, 5, and so you get kind of that kind of distribution, maybe with a little higher number in the last quarter, but it's nothing particularly special. I think this quarter of course is above. So, each quarter, it's kind of an upwards versus its prior numbers. And so you feel like the upward trajectory, you can see it if you look very, very closely at the month-to-month numbers in a quarter as you are going to \u2013 as we are going through the months and the quarters and the years upwards. But not much difference in distribution except for that sort of general monotonic trend. Yes. Well, the SFC was live this year. So, you think \u2013 look, think of it this way. Okay, we had brand building, we had stock \u2013 we had comp expense lease cost. And this was our celebration of our 100th anniversary. So, the SFC and the celebrations we had there were bigger than \u2013 bigger and better than any prior years. So, you have some of that into your situation because the franchisees are investing in the company. I think I said they are positive about the days and decades ahead with Snap-on. And so that merits a little bit of celebration when you reach a Centennial milestone. So, there is some of that in there. We have a four-piece capital allocation. We tend to be working capital investors. You know what I mean, this is a working capital-intense company. So, when we grow, we tend to \u2013 the COVID kind of changed \u2013 not changed but obscure that dynamics somewhat. But generally as you grow you have working capital, then we look at acquisitions, we believe we have runways for growth, particularly in owners and managers and the garages or in maybe in C&I in some places. And we have done some of that and Dealer-FX is an example. We have a dividend that we have paid a dividend every quarter since 1939. We have never reduced it. So, we take a look at our dividend with the intent of perpetuity and whether we should increase it or not, and we look at that carefully. And then we are agile about share purchases. So, we have kind of a four-way look at that, and they are all \u2013 they are all a draw on what we might do with cash depending on the situation."

            "content": "Thanks Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. The third quarter of 2021 exhibited another period of solid financial performance. The results also compared favorably with the third quarter of 2019, which being a pre-COVID-19 time period in some cases may serve to be the more meaningful baseline. Net sales of $1.377 billion in the quarter increased 10.2% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 7% organic sales gain, $19.5 million of acquisition-related sales, and $9.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Additionally, net sales in the period increased 15.1% from $901.8 million in the third quarter of 2019, including an 11.1% organic gain, $21.0 million of acquisition-related sales and $13.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Consolidated gross margin of 50.2% improved 30 basis points from 49.9% last year. The gross margin contributions from the higher sales volumes, 60 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects and benefits from the company's RCI initiatives more than offset higher material and other costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 30.8% increased 60 basis points from 30.2% last year, primarily due to 60 basis points of unfavorable acquisition effects. Benefits from the higher sales volumes were offset by increased brand building, travel and other costs, including the restoration of our annual in-person Snap-on Franchisee Conference. Operating earnings before financial services of $201.3 million compared to $185.7 million in 2020 and $167.7 million in 2019, reflecting an 8.4% and a 20% improvement respectively. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 19.4% compared to 19.7% last year and 18.6% in 2019. Financial services revenue of $87.3 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared to $85.8 million last year, while operating earnings of $70.6 million increased $5 million from 2020 levels, reflecting the higher revenue as well as lower provisions for credit losses. Consolidated operating earnings of $271.9 million increased 8.2% from $251.3 million last year and 18.9% from $228.7 million in 2019. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 24.2% compared to 24.5% in 2020 and 23.2% in 2019. Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 23.7% compared to 23.4% last year. Net earnings of $196.2 million or $3.57 per diluted share increased $16.5 million or $0.29 per share from last year's levels, representing an 8.8% increase in diluted earnings per share. As compared to the third quarter of 2019, net earnings increased to $31.6 million or $0.61 per share, representing a 20.6% increase in diluted earnings per share. Now, let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I group on Slide 11, sales of $351.4 million increased 13.9% from $308.4 million last year, reflecting a 10.6% organic sales gain, $7.5 million of acquisition-related sales, and $2.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain reflects higher activity in all of the segment's operations and includes high single-digit increases in sales to customers in critical industries. Within the critical industries, year-over-year sales gains were achieved in general industry, heavy duty and technical education, but were partially offset by declines in sales to the military and international aviation, both of which had particularly robust sales in the prior year period. As a further comparison, net sales in the period increased 4.8% from 2019 levels, reflecting a $3 million organic sales gain, $7.5 million of acquisition-related sales and $5.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. As compared to 2019, sales in our European-based hand tools business were up mid-teens. With respect to critical industry sales activity in that period, our lower sales to the military international aerospace and natural resource segments offset gains in our sales to technical education, heavy duty and general industry customers. Gross margin of 38.2% improved 90 basis points from 37.3% in the third quarter of 2020. Contributions from the higher sales volumes and benefits from RCI initiatives were partially offset by higher material and other costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22.9% improved 40 basis points as compared to last year primarily due to the improved volumes, which were partially offset by higher travel and other costs. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $53.6 million compared to $43.1 million last year, the operating margin of 15.3% compared to 14% a year ago. Turning now to Slide 8 sales of the Snap-on Tools Group of $471.4 million increased 4.8% from $449.8 million in 2020, reflecting a 3.7% organic sales gain and $4.9 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase reflects a mid-single-digit gain in our U.S. business and a low single-digit gain in our international operations. Net sales in the period increased 22.4% from $385.2 million in the third quarter of 2019, reflecting a 20.6% organic sales gain and $5.8 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Gross margin of 45.8% in the quarter improved 30 basis points from last year, primarily due to the higher sales volumes and 130 basis points from favorable foreign currency effects, which offset higher material and other costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 25% improved from 26.1% last year, primarily reflecting the higher sales. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $98.2 million compared to $87.1 million last year. The operating margin of 20.8% compared to 19.4% a year ago, an improvement of 140 basis points. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9, sales of $364.4 million compared to $317.5 million a year ago, reflecting a 9.9% organic sales gain, $12 million of acquisition-related sales and $3.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase reflects double-digit increases in sales of undercar equipment and in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers. While activity focused on OEM dealerships was essentially flat. As compared to 2019 levels, net sales increased $41.7 million from $322.7 million, reflecting a 7.4% organic sales gain, $13.5 million of acquisition-related sales and $4 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Gross margin of 46.8% declined from 47.3% last year, primarily due to the impact of higher sales and lower gross margin businesses, increased material and other costs and 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. These declines were partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives and 60 basis points of benefits from acquisitions. As a reminder, undercar equipment, which had healthy sales increases in the quarter, typically has a gross margin rate that is below the RS&I segment's average. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 23.9% increased 180 basis points from 22.1% last year, primarily due to 170 basis points of unfavorable acquisition effects. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $83.3 million compared to $80.1 million last year. The operating margin of 22.9% compared to 25.2% a year ago. Now turning to Slide 10, revenue from financial services of $87.3 million compared to $85.8 million last year. Financial services operating earnings of $70.6 million compared to $65.6 million in 2020. Financial services expenses of $16.7 million decreased $3.5 million from 2020 levels, primarily due to lower provisions for credit losses, resulting from favorable loan portfolio trends, which support lower forward-looking estimated reserve requirements. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 0.8% and 0.9% in the third quarter of 2021 and 2020, respectively. In the third quarters of both 2021 and 2020, the average yield on finance receivables was 17.8%. The respective average yield on contract receivables, were 8.5% and 8.4%, respectively. Total loan originations of $269.3 million in the third quarter increased $16.5 million or 6.5% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 5.7% increase in originations of finance receivables and a 9.5% increase in originations of contract receivables. Moving to Slide 11, our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our U.S. operation. Our worldwide gross financial services portfolio increased $7.5 million in the third quarter. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.4% for U.S. extended credit compared to 1.5% in the third quarter of 2020 and 1.7% in the third quarter of 2019. On a sequential basis, the rate is up 20 basis points, reflecting the typical seasonal increase of 20 to 30 basis points we experienced between the second and third quarters. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $42.7 million represented 2.48% of outstandings at quarter end, down 22 basis points as compared to the same period last year. Now turning to Slide 12, cash provided by operating activities of $186.4 million in the quarter reflects 92.5% of net earnings. While this represents a decrease of $37.6 million from 2020 levels, this cash conversion rate compares favorably with 77.5% of net earnings in both the third quarters of 2019 and 2018. The decrease from the third quarter of 2020 primarily reflects the higher net earnings being more than offset by net changes in operating assets and liabilities, including a $61.9 million increase in working capital. This change in working capital is largely driven by the more typical seasonal inventory build in the third quarter of 2021 as compared to the reduction of inventory experienced in the period last year. Inventory additions also reflect some increases in buffer stocks and higher levels of in-transit inventories associated with the supply chain dynamics being seen in the macro environment.  Net cash used by investing activities of $29.7 million included net additions of finance receivables of $7.6 million and $16.2 million of capital expenditures. Net cash used by financing activities of $385.8 million included $250 million in senior note repayments, cash dividends of $66.3 million and the repurchase of 300,000 shares of common stock for $66.5 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $197.1 million of common stock under existing authorizations. Turning to Slide 13, trade and other accounts receivable increased $12.5 million from 2020 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 56 days compared to 64 days of 2020 year-end. Inventories increased $43.1 million from 2020 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.7 compared to 2.4 at year-end 2020. Our quarter end cash position of $735.5 million compared to $923.4 million at year-end 2020. Our net debt to capital ratio of 10.3% compared to 12.1% at year-end 2020. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million in available credit facilities. As of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for the balance of 2021. We now forecast that capital expenditures will approximate $90 million. In addition, we currently anticipate, absent any changes to U.S. tax legislation that our full year 2021 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Good morning. So my view, Luke, would be that I think technicians themselves are in a better financial position than where they were maybe a year or 2 years or even back ago. I think that's a broad statement that applies to many industries. I think you hear that out of the big banks. I mean customers are better servicing their debt than they were before. I think they have more discretionary power and spending. And so far, they have been applying it to their indebtedness. And I think we see the same trends. It's our job to capture that incremental savings that they might be seeing if they are not borrowing as much as before in capturing business with tool sales. And I think you see that. So, the Snap-on tool sales being up more than originations, I think as I applaud the tools group by being able to entice customers to buy more stuff because they have more money. From what you read from the Bureau Labor statistics, technician wages is doing pretty darn good. So, they seem to be strong. They seem to have more flexibility in what they choose to buy, and they seem to like to buy our products. So again, they are in a better position, I think than they were a year or so ago. And of course, every quarter brings potential new changes. But right now, it's been running very favorable. And as a result of that, our going forward provision rates are lower than they might have been a year or 2 years ago. It's going back pre-pandemic, simply because of the debt servicing trends. No, contract receivables tend to run up a little bit with the Snap-on Franchisee Conference because you get some short-term lower financing arrangements there. But no, there is nothing structurally there that would say that the EC will not get back to higher levels. And I would say EC was pretty decent and the U.S. was above the average in this case. So, they had strong performance and it was nice originations David, in both tool storage and diagnostics in the quarter."

With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick.\nNick Pinchuk: Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I'm going to start the call by covering the highlights of our second quarter and along the way I'll give you my perspective on our results. Once again they were encouraging and our markets, robust and promising and our continued progress and strength amidst the pandemic. The pandemic isn\u2019t over, but we believe we're stronger right now than when it all started. Of course, we\u2019ll also speak about what it all means, then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials.  We believe that our second quarter again demonstrates Snap-on\u2019s ability to continue with the trajectory of positive results, overcoming a variety of ongoing headwinds, accommodating to the lingering virus environment, meeting the challenges of the day across the business world and advancing along our runaways for growth and for improvement.  Our reported sales on the quarter were 1,081.4 million and they were up versus last year, $357.1 million or 49.3%, including $20.6 million of favorable foreign currency change and $19.6 million in acquisition related sales. The organic sales were up 42.5% with significant gains in every group; our fourth straight quarter being above pre-pandemic levels, a V-shaped trajectory that defines resilience and flexible capability.  The OpCo operating income of $217.1 million was up $126 million from last year, which included $4 million of restructuring charge. OpCo operating margin was 20.1%, up from the 2020 level of 12.6% or 13.1% as adjusted for restructuring, representing a 700 basis point as adjusted improvement.  The financial services operating income of $68.9 million increased 19.6%, higher originations, lower losses, delinquencies, below pre-pandemic levels, our finance company passing the greatest stress test of our time with flying colors, and that result combined with OpCo for a consolidated operating margin of 24.5% up 560 basis points as adjusted.  Quarterly EPS was $3.76 up a 103.2% from last year, and excluding the 2020 restructuring charges EPS grew 96.9% versus the pre-pandemic levels of 2019 the EPS grew 16.8%, clearly tracing an ongoing positive trend. I've said it before, but it bears repeating, we believe Snap-on is stronger now than when we entered this great weathering, and we believe our second quarter is emphatic evidence of that fact.  Compared with 2019 our sales in the past quarter grew $130.1 million or 13.7%. That reflects $23 million of acquisition related sales, $17.2 million of favorable foreign currency and $89.9 million or 9.3% organic game.  The 2021 OpCo operating margin of 20.1% was up 10 basis points from 2019, but that gain was achieved against 70 basis points of unfavorable currency and acquisition impacts, all while absorbing the lingering effects of the virus, it's not gone. So, those are the numbers.  From a macro market perspective, it's clear that our automotive repair sector remains favorable. The technicians across the map are still at their posts, repairing cars and trucks, keeping the world running and they are busy, and as expected after the COVID, it appears that people are leaning more towards personal transportation and are holding onto their vehicles longer every year. Auto repair is a strong and resilient market. You can hear it from our franchisees and you can see it in our numbers.  As we look forward we see greater opportunities as vehicle techs encountered even more complex repairs, new technologies, alternative powertrains, greater proliferation of driver assistance electronics, it\u2019s all music to our ears. And then there is the repair shop owners and managers, RS&I territory, a little more mixed, particularly in Europe, but a return to growth in repair, garages and dealerships. They are starting to invest. Undercar equipment and OEM programs are coming back and RS&I is taking advantage of that trend with new equipment offerings and advanced database solution continually improving our software products and our diagnostic releases.  Products like Mitchell 1 Repair Information Software and Shop Management Software and Electronic Parts Catalogues and our Dealer-FX shop management technology, and our heavy duty and our intelligent diagnostic units, big data basis and getting more powerful, and easier to use, helping the shop fix it right the first time efficiently. Repair shop is changing, rising in complexity and RS&I has the products to match.  Finally, let's talk about critical industries where the Snap-on rolls out of the garage, solving past the consequence. This is where the C&I operates, our most international operations where the customers have endured the longest impact of the virus and have been slower to accommodate it or recovering it, what I call varied rates.  Segments like oil and gas and aviations in geographies like Southeast Asia and India still down. But despite the variation we did see growth in critical industries, improvements in education. The students are coming back and in power generation and heavy duty fleet, all combining to offset that continuing turbulence.  So overall I describe our C&I market as healthy and representing clear opportunity, and coupled with auto repair, we believe our markets are robust now and there\u2019s considerable opportunity ahead, and we have opportunity ahead for us as we move along our runways for growth and improvement, and I can't leave [ph] this section, about robust progress and abundant possibilities without speaking on the engine of our advance Snap-on value creation. Customer connection and innovation, developing new products and solutions, born out of insights and observations, gathered right in the workplaces and RCI, guiding the expansion of franchisees selling capacity with better processes, more effective training and a new focus on social media, it will all help drive our progress, overcoming the \u2013 accommodating the virus and enabling us to take full advantage of the opportunities and chart a continuing and positive trend forward; that's the overview.  Now let\u2019s move to the segments. In the C&I group, sales in the quarter were up 33.8% or $88.6 million versus 2020, including a $71.3 million or 26.3% organic uplift with double digit progress across all of the divisions. From an earnings perspective C&I operating income of $55.5 million including $1.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency represents a rise of $32.6 million compared to 2020, which included a $2 million or restructuring.  That all means an as-adjusted increase of over 122.9% and the operating margin was 15.8%, an as reported increase of 710 basis points, a rise of 630 basis points as adjusted and an uplift of 120 basis points from the pre-pandemic level in 2019 despite 90 basis points of unfavorable currency. When compared with pre-pandemic 2019, sales were up 4.6%, including a 0.4% organic gain, above flat, now a continuing bright spot for C&I.  SNA Europe did deliver yet another quarter of growth expanding beyond pre-pandemic levels against the wind, with the sparkle of Ergo Tool Management System leading the way, tailoring products specific to customer needs.  Europe is a varied market environment, but SNA in Europe is defining economic gravity again, and that positive was joined by contributions from recovering areas in critical industry like heavy duty, power generation and as I said before, education, whose come to the party just now. And from Asia Pacific geographies like China and Japan, and those gains were balanced by declines in attenuated sectors like the military, aerospace and natural resources, all still weak. We do remain confident in and committed to extending in critical industries and we're committed with great new products.  Speaking of product, in the last quarter it helped solve challenging tasks across aviation and other critical industries. We launched the new Snap-on 14.4 volt microlithium cordless right angle mini drill, with a 6000 RPM, making it ideal for drilling a variety of materials, plastics to aluminum to fiberglass. The unit has a compact 90 degree head, which provides easier access to confined spaces and reduces worker fatigue, it\u2019s a big factor. In addition, it also offers a higher quality chuck that achieves precise drilling with minimum run-out, ensuring tight tolerances are met with considerable reliability.  To top it all off, the drill also utilizes a double ball bearing supported spindle shaft and spiral bevel gears. I know that\u2019s a mouthful, but it all means that the new power tool has a clear superiority and durability. The cordless right angle midi is a great innovation with an array of advantages and the techs are noticing it. So that\u2019s C&I, a promising quarter, moving down it's runways for growth with strong profitability, C&I, OI margin 15.8%.  Now on to the tools group. Sales were $484.1 million up $160.8 million, including $154 million or 46.7% organic gain, double digit growth both in the U.S. and the international operations, and the operating margin was 21.4%, up 930 basis points. Compared with pre-virus 2019 sales grew $78.3 million, including $70.7 million or 17.1% organic gain and this quarter its 21.4% operating margin. It was up 380 basis points compared with the pre-virus numbers, coming out of the pandemic stronger indeed, another power \u2013 I was going to say powerful, I guess I could say that, but another positive quarter with double digit expansion across all geographies and all products.  We do believe our van network remains quite strong. Just a few weeks ago I spent time with a dozen franchisees on our \u2013 dozen franchisees on our U.S. National Franchisee Advisory Council at our Algona, Iowa tool storage plant and they were pumped and prosperous, excited by their current position, positive about the other vans in the regions - in the regions they represent, and very optimistic about their prospects for even more, beyond the windshield surveys.  We see other indications of continuing strength, like the Business Health Metrics, they remain quite favorable, qualitative and quantitative indicators, both very positive, and that positivity was not just internal, it was reinforced by the external view. Snap-on was recognized again this year among the top 50 in the franchise industry by Entrepreneur Magazine and once again we scored highest in the tools distribution category, place we\u2019ve held for quite some time and now this type of recognition, this kind of positivity reflects the fundamental in contemporary strength of our franchisees and of our overall van business, and would not have been achieved without a continuous stream of unique new products.  Hand tools were up in the quarter and part of that, and part of that torque is rising in importance as more mechanical provisions, precision becomes necessary to support vehicle automation and we are riding that wave with great new products, like our new ATECH micro torque wrench with a quick release head. The quarter inch drive quick release has a positive locking mechanism to retain the socket solidly and securely in place, and at the same time it offers a push button for easy tool disengagement. It holds and it ejects, both important under the hood, at it\u2019s a time saver. It\u2019s quite a time saver in close clearance applications like valve cover removal and spark plug replacements that happen every day in the garage.  The tool also offers visual and \u2013 visual, audible, and vibration alerts to confirm that the proper torque has been applied and it has a wide torque range, 12 to 240 pound inches, and the new micro also includes a 50 degree flex head ratchet for better access to fasteners, a 72 tooth quarter inch drive socket ratchet enabling efficient operation in tight areas and a plus or minus 2% accuracy. Our micro tech takes precision fastening to the next level.  Tool storage is also strong in the quarter and part of that success was our KTL 1023 A3 Roll Cab, a wide 72 inch Triple-Bank Tool storage box. It offers three extra wide drawers for longer and larger tools, giving the technician more organizational options. Our patented lock and roll latch mechanism which prevents draws from drifting opened and our ISO-Ride\u00ae Caster for riding a smooth ride, smooth rolling and excellent weight capacity, plus, plus it adds our LED lighted power top which spans the full width of the cabinet for better illumination and great eye appeal. It includes 10 offset AC outlets and 4 USB ports for charging a larger array of the tech select electronics. The KTL 1023 A3, storage efficiency in a box that captures sharp attention in any shop. Sales of the unit, well it\u2019s a sellout.  Our new products are in fact making a difference in the tools group. You can\u2019t miss it in the numbers. They also \u2013 and the group also registered its fourth straight quarter of above pre-pandemic levels, the tools group unmistakably is moving onward and upward.  Now on to the RS&I group. Sales were up 62.7% or $153.6 million versus last year, including $135.7 million or 54.1% organic uplift with double digit growth weighted toward our under car equipment and our OEM project businesses. But with our diagnostics and information product businesses still delivering strong double digit increases in addition to the waiting towards undercar equipment and OEM projects.  From an earnings perspective RS&I operating income of $86.7 million represents a rise of $36.1 million or 71.3% compared to 2020, which included $1.4 million of restructuring. And the operating margin was 21.8%, an increase of 110 basis points from last year, 60 basis points as adjusted but again to the 180 basis point impact of unfavorable currency and acquisition affects.  When compared with 2019, sales were up 14.2% as reported and organic growth was $29.7 million or 8.4% with double digit advances in undercar equipment, OEM projects, diagnostics and information in North America, all of that being attenuated by a general weakness in Europe. For profitability the OI margin was 21.8% -- the OI margin of 21.8% was down 360 basis points, with a 150 point impact from unfavorable currency and acquisition effects and with a further drag from the higher sales of undercar equipment in OEM projects, both at the lower end of RS&I margins.  Having said that, RS&I has great opportunities and we are fortifying its way forward with more new products. We just introduced our new ZEUS Mobile work centers, giving the technicians the ability to use the full capabilities of our top of the line diagnostics information systems, including our exclusive fast track intelligent diagnostics from anywhere on the service bay. It is a compact footprint for great mobility, reaching all over the shop. It also incorporates a lockable tool drawer, tool storage cabinets and a large 27 inch touch-screen display.  The new ZEUS workstation offers significant improvements in convenience, in security and in visibility, combined with the power of our most sophisticated databases. It's just the ticket for those shops that want to solve the most difficult repair challenges and want to visibly display their advance capability for all the customers to see as they come in the shop, and the new workstation is making a difference, attracting attention and it's setting new volume levels for this category.  So to wrap-up RS&I, improving position with repair shop owners and managers, strong growth across all the divisions, recovering areas of undercar equipment and OEM projects and expanding product lines to lead the way forward.  Well, those are the highlights of the quarter, tools group, strong progress everywhere, unmistakable strength. C&I reporting a positive performance with significant profitability against variations across industry and geographies and RS&I expanding volume in independent repair shops and OEM dealerships, gains in the U.S. overcoming weakness in Europe.  Overall sales increasing for the corporation up nicely, both versus last year at 42.5% up and compared with pre-pandemic levels at 9.3% up, continuing our V-shaped recovery. OpCo operating margin, a strong 21% up again in the face of 70 basis points of unfavorable currency and acquisition effect. EPS, $3.76 in the quarter, up for the fourth quarter in a row, up versus last year, up versus last quarter, up versus pre-pandemic levels. It was another encouraging quarter.  Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo.\nAldo Pagliari: Thanks Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on slide six. The second quarter of 2021 exhibited solid financial performance, particularly as compared to last year's heavily pandemic impacted second quarter. The results also compared favorably with the second quarter of 2019, which being a pre-COVID-19 time period may serve to be the more meaningful baseline.  Net sales of $1,081.4 million in the quarter increased 49.3% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 42.5% organic sales gain, $19.6 million of acquisition related sales and $20.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Sequentially organic sales improved by 4.5% as compared to the first quarter of 2021. Additionally, net sales in the period increased 13.7% from $951.3 million in the second quarter of 2019, including a 9.3% organic gain, $23.0 million of acquisition-related sales, and $17.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Consolidated gross margin of 50.2% improved 310 basis points from 47.1% last year, which included 30 basis points from restructuring costs. The gross margin contributions from the higher sales volumes and benefits from the company's RCI initiatives were partially offset by 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.  Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 30.1% improved 440 basis points from 34.5% last year, which included 20 basis points from restructuring costs. The improvement primarily reflects the benefits of higher sales volumes, partially offset by higher stock based cost and 70 basis points of unfavorable acquisition effects.  Operating earnings before financial services of $217.1 million compared to $91.1 million in 2020, reflecting 138.3% year-over-year improvement. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 20.1% improved 750 basis points from 12.6% last year, which included 50 basis points for restructuring costs.  Financial services revenue of $86.9 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $84.6 million last year, while operating earnings of $68.9 million increased $11.3 million from 2020 levels, primarily as a result of higher revenue and lower provisions for credit losses. Consolidated operating earnings of $286 million increased 92.3% from $148.7 million last year.  As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 24.5% compared to 18.4% in 2020, which included 50 basis points from restructuring costs. Excluding the restructuring costs, operating earnings margin in 2021 increased 560 basis points from last year.  Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 23.3% compared to 24.1% last year, which included a 20 basis point increase related to the prior year quarter's restructuring charges. Net earnings of $208 million of $3.76 per diluted share increased to $106.8 million or $1.91 per share from last year's levels, representing a 103.2% increase in diluted earnings per share.  As compared to 2020, excluding the restructuring charges of $3.3 million after tax or $0.06 per diluted share, diluted earnings per share increased 96.9%. Relative to the second quarter of 2019, net earnings increased $27.6 million or $0.54 per share, representing a 16.8% increase in diluted earnings per share.  Now, let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I group on slide seven, sales of $350.5 million increased 33.8% from $261.9 million last year, reflecting a 26.3% organic sales gain, $7.7 million of acquisition related sales and $9.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation.  The organic gain reflects higher activity in all of the segments operations and includes mid-teen increases in sales to customers in critical industries. Within critical industries, robust sales gains were achieved in general industry, heavy duty and technical education, but were partially offset by year-over-year declines in sales to the military, which had remained strong in the pandemic impacted period last year.  As a further comparisons, net sales in the period increased 4.6% from 2019 levels, reflecting $1.4 million of organic sales gains, $7.7 million of acquisition related sales and $6.4 million of favorable foreign currency translation. As compared to 2019, sales in our European based hand tools business were up high single digits. With respect to critical industry sales activity in that period, our military, international aerospace and natural resources segments were below 2019 levels. All other critical industry segments are at or about the second quarter of 2019.  Gross margin of 39.5% improved 510 basis points from 34.4% in the second quarter of 2020, which included 80 basis points from restructuring charges. Contributions from the higher sales volumes and the improvements resulting from the lower restructuring costs were partially offset by 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.  Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 23.7% improved 200 basis points compared to last year, primarily as a result of the improved volumes. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $55.5 million including $1.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $22.9 million last year. The operating margin of 15.8% compared to 8.7% a year ago.  Turning now to slide eight. Sales in the Snap-on tools group of $484.1 million increased 49.7% from $323.3 million in 2020, reflecting a 46.7% organic sales gain and $6.7 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase reflects a gain of approximately 40% in our U.S. business and a gain of approximately 80% in our international operations, with strong growth across all product lines.  Net sales in the period increased 19.3% from $405.8 million in the second quarter of 2019, reflecting a 17.1% organic sales gain and $7.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Additionally, sales in the U.S. operation were up 18.8% in that period, while franchisees sales of the van versus 2019 were up 21%. Gross margin of 46.8% in the quarter improved 510 basis points from last year, primarily due to the higher sales volumes, benefits from RCI initiatives and 50 basis points from favorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 25.4% improved from 29.8% last year, primarily due to the higher sales volumes. Operating earnings for the Snap-on tools group of $103.5 million compared to $38.4 million last year. The operating margin of 21.4% compared to 11.9% a year ago, an improvement of 950 basis points.  Turning to the RS&I group shown on slide nine, sales of $398.6 million compared to $245 milling a year ago, reflecting a 54.1% organic sales gain, $11.9 million of acquisition related sales and $6 million of favorable foreign currency translation.  The organic increase reflects a rise of approximately 80% in sales of undercar equipment, as well as a gain of approximately 50% in sales to OEM dealership and an increase of approximately 30% in sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. As compared to 2019 levels, net sales increased $49.7 million from $348.9 million, reflecting an 8.4% organic sales gain, $15.3 million of acquisition related sales and $4.7 million of favorable foreign currency translation.  Gross margin of 44.7% declined from 47.4% last year, primarily due to the impact of higher sales and lower gross margin businesses and 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by 70 basis points of benefits from acquisition. As a reminder, undercar equipment, as well as the facilitation program related activity, both of which had healthy sales increases in the quarter, typically have a gross margin rate that is below the RS&I segment\u2019s average.  Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22.9% improved 380 basis points from 26.7% last year, which included 50 basis points of restructuring costs. Contributions from the higher sales volumes and benefits from lower costs related to restructuring were partially offset by 190 basis points of unfavorable acquisition effects. Operating earnings for the RS&I group of $86.7 million compared to $50.6 million last year. The operating margin of 21.8% compared to 20.7% a year ago.  Now, turning to slide 10. Revenue from financial services of $86.9 million compared to $84.6 million last year. Financial services operating earnings of $68.9 million compared to $57.6 million in 2020. Financial services expenses of $18 million decreased $9 million from 2020 levels, primarily due to lower provisions for credit losses resulting from $2.8 million of lower year-over-year net loan charge offs, as well as favorable loan portfolio trends which support lower expected reserve requirements. As a percent of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were eight-tenths of 1% and 1.3% in the second quarter of 2021 and 2020 respectively.  In the second quarter the average yield on finance receivables of 17.5% in 2021 compared to 17.6% in 2020. The respective average yield on contract receivables was 8.5% and 8.2%. The lower yield on contract receivables in 2020 includes the impact of lower interest business operations support loans for our franchisee. These loans were offered during the second quarter of 2020 to help accommodate franchisee operations in dealing with the COVID-19 environment. As of the end of the current quarter, approximately $8 million of these business operation support loans remain outstanding.  Total loan originations of $285.8 million in the second quarter increased $30 million or 11.7% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 17.9% increase in originations of finance receivables, while originations of contract receivables were down 11.5%. Last year's contract receivable originations included the aforementioned offering of business operation support loans to qualified franchisees during the second quarter of 2020. Moving to slide 11, our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our U.S. operation. Our worldwide gross financial services portfolio increased $13.2 million in the second quarter, primarily due to the higher originations.  The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.2% in the United States extended credit is up 20 basis points from the rate of 1% in the second quarter of 2020. As we commented during our second quarter 2020 earnings call, we estimated in the quarter the 60-day plus delinquency rate was favorably affected by 20 to 30 basis points as a result of forbearance and deferred payment programs in place during that period last year.  As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12 month net losses of $41.6 million representing 2.4% of outstandings at quarter end is down 15 basis points sequentially and down 53 basis points compared to the same period last year.  Now turning to slide 12, cash provided by operating activities of $238.2 million in the quarter decreased $15.4 million from comparable 2020 levels, primarily reflecting the higher net earnings more than offset by net changes in operating assets and liabilities, including $98.4 million of higher income tax payments. The increase in cash paid for income taxes reflects both higher levels of taxable profitability, as well as the IRS no longer allowing companies to defer estimated tax payments as compared to the IRS accommodation offered during the second quarter of 2020.  Net cash used by investing activities in the $29.7 million included net additions of finance receivables of $18.7 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $147.9 million included cash dividends of $66.7 million and the repurchase of 566,900 shares of common stock for $137.4 million under our existing share repurchase programs, partially offset by proceeds from stock purchase and option plans of $61.8 million. As of quarter end, we have remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $251.6 million of common stock under existing authorizations.  Turning to slide 13, trade and other accounts receivable increased $4.7 million from 2020 year end. Day sales outstanding of 56 days compared to 64 days at 2020 year end. Inventories increased $14.4 million from 2020 year end, but on a trailing 12 month basis inventory turns of 2.7 compared to 2.4 at year end 2020.  Our quarter end cash position of $965.9 million compared to $923.4 million at year end 2020. Our net debt to capital ratio of 10.8% compared to 12.1% at year-end 2020. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million in available credit facilities. As of quarter end there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility and there are no commercial paper borrowings outstanding.  That concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. I\u2019ll now briefly review a few of the guidance for 2021. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in a range of $90 million to $100 million. We currently anticipate absent any changes the U.S. tax legislation, that our full year 2021 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 23% to 24%. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?\nNick Pinchuk: Thanks Aldo. Well, at the beginning I said I would speak on what this all means, I want to try. First, it means that Snap-on and its markets are resilient. The virus, probably the greatest threat to our society and to business and in many decades it was a great shock. Miles driven down big dealerships, many furloughed, no travelers, aviation, no travelers, oil and gas and free-fall [ph] and education, virtually little need for equipment, nobody is in the classrooms, and yet we weathered this shock without trauma.  The credit company stepped in with just the right bridging at just the right place for customers and franchisees and our direct selling vans kept rolling, quickly accommodating to the environment. Snap-on kept investing in our product, our brands and our people, and we accommodated and recovered to post four straight quarters of above pre-pandemic results, tracing a B shaped recovery and emerging from the height of the storm stronger than we entered, resilience against the greatest business threat in memory. But it's more than resilience, more than bounce back, it also demonstrates great flexibility. As the world passed through this shock, through accommodations of psychological recovery, change was the order of the day and Snap-on adjusted. Fuel by our fortified advantages and product brand and people, we accommodate it. The pandemic limited face-to-face interaction. We expanded virtual contact and came away with some long term social media tools that will enable our franchisees for some time.  When technicians focused on shorter pay back items, we gave them hand tools and power tools and torque. When repair leaned away from maintenance to complex repairs and the shock, we provided ADAS calibration tools and intelligent diagnostics and helped our franchisees expand their selling capacity to manage those more complicated offerings efficiently.  When some critical industries weaken, we developed offerings for those that maintained. When the virus attenuated the distributors in Europe, we focused on customization and more direct interactions. All of that achievement in a time of change demonstrate Snap-on\u2019s flexibility and confirms we can prosper mid-future change going forward as we've always done, by observing work and solving whatever the new problems are.  Snap-on\u2019s second quarter, tools grew up in all geographies and in all product lines. Sales up 17.1% compared with 2019 and OI margins up 21.4%. C&I gains offsetting the challenges of the lingering COVID, rising profitability to 15.8%, up 120 basis points from the pre-pandemic level, even with the 90 basis point impact from unfavorable currency.  RS&I, sales up 8.5% versus 2019. Undercar equipment and OEM projects recovering in an OI of 21.8% down from the pre-pandemic, but still strong. In Snap-on overall sales is up 9.3% organically versus 2019, an OI margin of 20.1% and an EPS at $3.76, up meaningfully versus every comparison. It was an encouraging period again, demonstrating resilience and flexibility. Encouraging for the now and we're confident, encouraging for the prospects of growth and improvement for the future on through 2021 and well beyond.  Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. Your support is the fundamental element in driving our continuing positive trend; for your role in helping our society and our company to navigate the pandemic, you have my admiration. For your contributions in offering this quarter\u2019s strong results, you have my congratulations; and for your continued commitment to the Snap-on team, you have my thanks.  Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator. Operator.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies.\nBret Jordan: Hey! Good morning guys.\nNick Pinchuk: Good morning.\nBret Jordan: When you think about the mechanic in the tool segment, you know I guess demand has been very strong, we're hearing a lot about labor rate inflation. Are you seeing a real change in their buying patterns that they are more liquid than they have historically been, and you know more biased to pay cash for higher ticket items I guess? \nNick Pinchuk: I think it's a combination of that. I think they are. I think they are and our franchisees are more flush and therefore they are able to underwrite the shorter payback that even for bigger, even for a medium ticket items which might have going on EC before the franchisees are willing to underwrite it and let them pay RA.  I do think the technicians are kind of \u2013 have good cash, because the business has been going well for quite a long period of time and they are interested in continually investing in tools, so you see that as a factor. I mean that's certainly a factor in the business. And one of things we see is, is that you'll notice that RA is very strong versus EC in this quarter and we see that as you know the technicians are buying and still have capacity to buy more in the future, because they have borrowing capacity under our EC. \nBret Jordan: When you think about the technicians as they relate to this next round of stimulus on the child tax credits, do you have any demographic color as to whether they are more or less likely to have kids that are going to give them a stimulus check? \nNick Pinchuk: You know, I don't know, the technician population is pretty spread. I wouldn't say they are more or less. In fact I think they are \u2013 I think they are the kind of the average, the every man. There are old technicians and young technician, so I don't think there's any particular concentration. You know you don't go into a garage and see all young people. You don't go see all old people either, so I don't think there's any particular position in that and they have some kids, but not different than the regular population. By the way, you know Aldo has to apologize for his voice. He was at the Deer District overnight at the Bucks game, so he's a little under the weather.\nBret Jordan: Thanks guys.\nNick Pinchuk: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Curtis Nagle with Bank of America.\nCurtis Nagle: Thanks very much. Just a quick one. You just \u2013 I got to ask this, because you brought it up a couple of times in the prepared remarks about new social media tools. Could you expand on what you're talking about, what these tools are, your targeting new customers? [Cross Talk] \nNick Pinchuk: They are no so much \u2013 sure, they target new customers, but what I\u2019m really referring to hear without \u2013 I didn't want to get into in the remarks because there\u2019ll be a lot to say and I don't.  Really what this is we used social media before, but in the pandemic we realized a more effective way to use them was to pre-brief customers, in other words to contact them. You know at first we started out by saying, okay, we want to stay in touch with our customers via social media or any electronic means that could do it at a distance, but then we realized, Boy! It's a powerful tool for making for sales efficiency when you're actually in front of them.  Because what you can do is contact them on the social media, you have a relationship with them, you can pre-brief them about how a great new prod \u2013 what the elements of a particular new product is, like the 14.4V power tool I talked about or the Techwrench I talked about and then you can also pre-brief them on any promotions we might have. And so then when you're actually spending the time in front of the technician, you can spend your time closing the deal. This kind of shrinks the time and so it takes some of the pre-sell out of the face time and makes it more efficient, that's what we're talking about here. We learned how to do that very well in this \u2013 in the pandemic and that's going to serve us well.  And as part of the idea, remember I always said that the pacing element for sales through the tools group has been the franchisees time where they are hitting new limits. They are up 17% versus pre-pandemic levels and it's because we've expanded their capacity. \nCurtis Nagle: Got it, okay. And just you know a follow-up, just any general comments in the U.S. tools group in terms of competition with your \u2013 well your close competitors Matco and anything \u2013 any notable changes relative to your last quarter? \nA - Nick Pinchuk: Jeez, I don't know. I can tell you \u2013 you know I just spent. We were \u2013 Aldo and I were just in California talking to our franchisee. You know we were out there visiting plants and we visit franchisees and I was at the NFAC at our Algona plant and I was like, those guys think they're crushing it. So I don't know what that means in terms of market share, but it sounds good to me. \nCurtis Nagle: Got it, okay. Fair enough. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Stember with C.L. King.\nScott Stember: Good morning, guys and congrats on the Bucks win. \nNick Pinchuk: The Bucks, yeah this is NBA Championship Headquarters right here.\nScott Stember: Just talking about in tools you guys said that everything was up pretty much. It sound like tools led the way, hand tools. Can you talk about the diagnostics? [Cross Talk]\nNick Pinchuk: Excuse me Scott, I didn't actually say that. Hand tools did not lead the way this quarter. It was up big, but actually the best year-over-year number was tool storage. \nScott Stember: Oh okay. \nNick Pinchuk: Yeah, but they were all big. I mean when you compare it to 2020, everything looks great you know. I mean it's all great, that was the nature of downturn. But there is no doubt, what I tried to say with that, all products, all geographies, just our way of saying that tools group had a gangbusters quarter. \nScott Stember: Got it. And any comments on tools, I mean on sales off of the van versus sell-in. The last couple of quarters you had sounded like it was pretty much in line.\nA - Nick Pinchuk: Yeah, I think Aldo said \u2013 yeah, they are generally holding in line and like Aldo said, it was what, you know we were up 17% versus pre-pandemic levels and sales of the van were up 21 I think or something like that. So I think you know it's going pretty well, just rolling through the van. \nScott Stember: Good. And lastly on Europe, European within Snap-on tools, tremendous growth there. Maybe just speak to what's been driving the recovery there and did you give \u2013 for Europe at least, are we back to pre-pandemic levels for tools? \nNick Pinchuk: Yeah, Europe is above pre-pandemic levels. Now, okay to be fair you know, Europe wasn't all that hot you know in 2019, but it's still clearly above the pre-pandemic levels. In other words it's offset whatever the impact of the pre-pandemic was. The tools group is pretty much across all geographies, which is kind of interesting, because there ain\u2019t no stimulus in the U.K. and Australia and Canada. \nScott Stember: Got it. Thanks again for taking my questions.\nNick Pinchuk: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Luke Junk with Baird.\nLuke Junk: Good morning Nick, Aldo. Good talking this morning.\nNick Pinchuk: Hi Luke.\nLuke Junk: So first question I had, a near term question. As we get further into the psychological recovery post the onset of COVID, we saw an increase in originations both year-over-year and sequentially this quarter. Nick, as you put your finger on the pulse of bigger ticket purchases, tool storage especially, do you feel like we're getting closer to or may be already at an inflection point in terms of mechanic attitudes around discretionary spend right now?\nNick Pinchuk: Yeah, I think we are. I mean I don't know. Who \u2013 you know it could be famous last words Luke you know. You got a lot of people talking about the delta variant and all this stuff, I don't think so. I think the people of work, the people in the factories and the people in the garages, like I\u2019ve said on other calls, are kind of thinking you know they've weathered the storm you know and they're not going to get shocked again no matter what, and so I think they kind of changed their level, they are starting to recover, and so you start to see people \u2013 you know we saw it in our tool storage numbers. One of the reasons why we took the franchisees, you know the franchise council to Algona, our tool storage plant, is everybody is screaming for more tool storage. Now, one of the effects was that when we entered the COVID they sold down their used inventory \u2013 their used boxes that they had taken in trade you know, so they had a lot of that rolling out, but still they are looking for boxes now, so I think things have turned.  The question is, are the franchisees so flush with cash that they want to finance some of those boxes or some of them, sometimes they sell them a locker, which is not quite as expensive as a box and they can afford to finance those kinds of things. But I do think, when I talk to franchisees, they are telling me that they\u2019ve kind of turned the corner. They\u2019ve turned the corners probably to \u2013 maybe too binary a word for it you know. We were coming back though. Things are pretty optimistic in the shops. \nLuke Junk: Good, that\u2019s helpful. And second, wondering, looking forward here, how we should think about the impact of the franchisee conference this year. What I'm wondering is both in absolute terms, i.e., what is that event going to look like this year, and also in relative terms given the unique nature of last year's virtual conference. \nA - Nick Pinchuk: Yeah, look it's going to be bigger than any of the conference, we think, who knows? We still got a few weeks ago, but registrations are higher than they've ever been. When I talk to the franchisees, they are really excited about going, no matter who I talked to. I heard \u2013 they were always kind of optimistic about it, but this one is really big, because it's \u2013 you know we're celebrating our 100th really and they\u2019ve been kind of \u2013 and they\u2019ve been away for \u2013 they didn't have it last year, so they are really, really talking about it, so it\u2019s going to be bigger I think, and so what will the effect be.  I\u2019ve said for dogs age on these calls that the third quarter can be a little bit variable, because there's a lot of wind \u2013 you know how many people go to the franchise conference, do they take more weeks, what happens in Europe and so on, but I'm telling you, I am not forecasting any weakness or anything like that. I'm just telling you, you never know how those things are going to turn out, but I like how we\u2019re entering the quarter, I like our moment you know. So I think whatever happens, we'll make the best of it. We're in a great position to navigate the quarter.  Hello? Okay, he was \u2013 he had to go to the Bucks celebration, so okay, don\u2019t ask right. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.\nChristopher Glynn: Thank you.\nNick Pinchuk: Okay Chris.\nChristopher Glynn: Aldo, feel better.\nAldo Pagliari: Yeah, I got it Chris, I got it covered.\nChristopher Glynn: Alright. So you know great commentary on the momentum and the overall buzz around the operations. The counts are kind of binary into the back half and you know your language around tools is that the momentum is so robust, you know storage sold out. So you know I think you were a little more hedged the last couple quarters about what current run rates mean for continued growth, but what I'm hearing is you're very confident and you can continue to compound not just overall, but at SOT. So I just wanted to bounce that off you, if I\u2019m kind of hearing you right. \nNick Pinchuk: You know you're not going to get me to forecast the quarter, you know what I mean. I'm not going to say you know we're going to build on a 17 \u2013 they were upward over 17% increase over pre pandemic levels. But all I'm saying is the tools group, the reason why we say all products all geographies is we can't find anything wrong with it, and we always can find warps in some places you know, this is a good, you know what I mean, so we like our moment. How that plays out in the third quarter, I'm not sure.  You know you've been on the call. We\u2019ve been on these calls a long time and I've always said that the third quarter is not \u2013 I'm saying I like our momentum. I think we're going into the quarter really strong. We feel stronger than last quarter, but I will add that I've always said that the third quarter is not necessarily a trend indicator, whether it's way up or way down, it has to do with all that windage, you know how many how many vacations to people take in Europe is one big thing, and the franchisees are allowed to take the same vacation as last year or more, I don't know, but I do think I haven't seen the tools group this strong. \nChristopher Glynn: Okay, great. And just a more pointed question. Are you seeing an increased uptake in interested and franchisees adopting second associates over the past couple months. \nNick Pinchuk: Yeah well, if you \u2013 you know I don\u2019t know. I think \u2013 look it\u2019s starting to come out of the thaw, because I think you can imagine why people are a little more reluctant in the COVID. There\u2019s a lot of interaction questions, a lot of viscosity and that kind of thing. I think they grew by 2% to 2.5% sequentially, so that's not bad I think.  So whether that has to do with the thaw or actually people getting more excited, I don't know. I do think when I talked to franchisees, they do more quickly go to the conversation. Gee! May be I ought to get a \u2013 I\u2019m doing so many, so much business, maybe I better get a franchisee. The guy in California was just talking about that. This guy just started like a few years ago. He signed up for a competitor and then he was talking to the guy and he said, you ought to go \u2013 the guy was sold him the thing. He wanted to go to the best, so he came to Snap-on and the thing is this guy is so pumped, he is going up so far, he's talking about, gee, maybe I could do more with an assistant. I need an assistant and a lot more and more people are doing that. So we would expect some expansion in this area. \nChristopher Glynn: Great! Thanks. \nNick Pinchuk: Sure. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. \nDavid MacGregor : Hey! Good morning everyone. And Nick, congratulations on a really strong quarter. Just outstanding growth, outstanding results across the enterprise. So I guess I wanted to understand, just a couple of housekeeping questions. What was the changer of provisions? If you mentioned that, I missed it. \nNick Pinchuk: Change? Sorry Dave, change of provisions? \nDavid MacGregor : Yeah, a question for Aldo. Didn\u2019t you\u2026\nAldo Pagliari: Specifically David, we said that the charge offs were lower by $2.8 million. But the charge-offs are just one of the indicators. When you look at your overall provision for losses, its down about $9 million to cut to the chase, but that's based on an assessment of what is the reserves side that we think we need for expected losses over the duration of the portfolio, which runs a little over four years on average, so that's the change of order.  But again as you\u2019ll see \u2013 you'll get more information obviously when the Q comes out, but if you look at charge offs are lower, the 60 plus day delinquency rate is lower, the net trailing 12 month losses are lower. The recoveries are better, the non-performing loans number are lower, the amount of past due accounts are lower. So you\u2019ll put that all together and that what\u2019ll arrive \u2013 lets us arrive at the conclusion that the reserves were able to be reduced somewhat. \nDavid MacGregor : Sure, that makes sense. But $9 million is the number, that\u2019s what I was looking for.  I guess my question is, I guess going back to the whole discussion around originations and Nick, you talked about the fact that the technicians are just in better shape today than they've been in a while. I guess you know a lot of stimulus and a little wage growth will do that. But I just wondered right now to what extent you think the slower origination growth may be attributed to technicians. Again, because they're in better shape, just qualifying for lower cost credit from alternative sources and they are just going on. \nNick Pinchuk: Well I, you know I have a tougher time figuring that out. I don't think so though, because it might be, it might be in the U.S. I don't think \u2013 I actually don't think David, I don't think stimulus is a much of a factor, maybe some, because you know we have pretty good growth in international operations. We don't see as clear a pumping of the money into the economy. So when we look at it across the world, it doesn't seem as though that specific characteristic of America is a factor. I don't know \u2013 maybe, but I tend to think it's more a combination of the franchisees feeling more flush.  You know you kind of got an interesting interaction. You have people who at first were leaning toward shorter payback items, and maybe that expands to away from hand to you know past handled tools up into lockers or spiffier [ph] tops for tools storage boxes which are more, which are more fundable by the franchisees over time. Franchisees like to build their shorter term credit, so they like that, and it is true that the technicians do have more cash. I mean they've been working all through the pandemic, and so that that's kind of built up in a relative cash. It could be eligible for other credit, we have no way of knowing that. I don't hear anybody mention it though.  Now, I talked to a lot of franchisees and they may not necessarily mention, but we haven't heard, we have heard that particular thing come up in any environment, so I don't know. \nDavid MacGregor : Yes, it\u2019s an interesting dynamic. I guess we\u2019ll watch and see where it goes. You talked about the strength in storage, which I guess was surprising to hear and certainly strength to me is counterintuitive given \u2013 it's hard to think of another product you sell that would be more carbon steel intensive, and given you know cold rolled steel now hitting $2,000 a ton this week, you know there has been an awful lot of inflation which I'm assuming you past through. So is there just no elasticity there in storage or are legacy storage sales kind of flat and what were you seeing the growth on \u2013 why this new product introductions? \nNick Pinchuk: Yeah, no it was a strong quarter in storage. I think somewhat, I'd like to think our offerings are kind of spiffier than they have been. You know I talked about this extra wide, the 72 inch master series in the call with the lighted top, those things are statement makers in garages, and I think that having refrained from some this for a period of time, technicians are getting more anxious to buy them and they have the money and they get are getting a little more confident, so they go out and look at them. That\u2019s really \u2013 I think that's the situation.  I wouldn\u2019t say there is no elasticity, but I think you know \u2013 I mean is there elasticity with new cars. I mean the thing is people are buying new cars and reused cars and so on. I mean so I think when people want something in this category, which is I\u2019ve often said, I think you and I have had conversation that a tool storage box like car, so people tend to want them and they\u2019ll pay a little bit more. It\u2019s not no elasticity, but people will go up and pay from them, that's my analysis.  It's really the psychology and the need. A combination of need and psychology and our biggest cycle \u2013 the product we have, which is the biggest psychological factor in people buying is tool storage. Now, all I can tell you is, our tool storage plant is sold out, sold out. \nDavid MacGregor : Yeah, that\u2019s fantastic, that\u2019s great. I guess, you talk about the strong growth in storage. How much of that growth was from some of the new products? I guess what was the legacy product growth looking like? \nNick Pinchuk: Well look, I think when I say \u2013 I don't know, I don't have that number at my fingertips, but there's a lot of wrinkles you can put in tool storage you know. Like we wouldn't necessarily call a new color a new product. On the other hand, if you roll out a new color, remember when we rolled out purple, there was an explosion you know, so some of that happens. It just has to do with the wrinkle that makes it, oh! This is the best box in the shop or it\u2019s the newest thing, that's really what happens. So we are constantly doing that stuff. \nDavid MacGregor : I just want to wrap up, one last question, and I guess you know you kind of touched on this earlier in your conversation, so maybe I'll ask the question in a slightly different way, but I\u2019m just thinking about tool segment growth sort of going forward and prior to the pandemic tools were struggling with growth for a rather extended period of time, and certainly we are coming short of that 4% goal that you\u2019d set for the segment.  Now, you know through the last four quarters, you know just sort of the easy compares are behind you, but you deliver remarkable growth through that period of time, including on a two year basis just to be fair. I guess if we think about the growth potential for the business now that you know you have four easy compares that are behind you, I guess what has changed the support or sort of growth going forward and what gives you confidence that the segment can track forward at greater than 4% when you were having so much [Cross Talk].\nNick Pinchuk: Okay, I\u2019ll tell you, it is this way, a simple statement. We figured out new ways to expand the selling efficient of the franchisees. This has happened before, there's a precedent for this. If you go back and you look before that term which you told, you know you said that they struggled for growth, and it\u2019s a fair characterization in some ways, between 11 and 16 the compounded annual growth rate was 7.2% and that was fueled by the expansion of the capabilities we found artifices [ph] would do that, the vans, the Rock 'n Roll Cab and so on, and in this case, we believe we\u2019ve broken through another ceiling to a new level and it's provable by the absolute amounts that are flowing through the vans at this point.  So that's certainly true for us and so we keep \u2013 we've always said, keep pounding that and we can sell more. We're not bound by the market; we are bound by our ability to sell. And so that's part of it, that's part of getting those franchisees to be able to deal with these more complex products, and we think we've made a step change over the last \u2013 now we\u2019ve been investing in it for like three years or something. You know trying to get that, but we think we've done it, and we think this is probable by the absolute amounts. Whatever the source of that volume is, it proves that the franchisees can accommodate it, they couldn't before. \nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. \nGary Prestopino: Hey! Good morning everyone.\nA - Nick Pinchuk: Hey Gary!\nGary Prestopino: Most of the questions have been answered, but I guess I just wanted to pick up on some of the things the last questioner was asking, as it relates to the margins. You know it looks like your tool and C&I margins from Q2 \u201819 have expanded fairly significantly, particularly the tools group. I mean is there anything that's inherently changed in the business or is that just the function of, that's just the leverage of the business with the sales growth? \nNick Pinchuk: Well look, I think there is leverage you know in that situation, so that's good. I think it would be a mistake to overlook the idea that embedded in there is some pricing to offset. You know we\u2019ve got a whole bunch of \u2013 we've got material costs in there. I don't want to get in as its documented, but we got a great dollar for material costs. Anybody who's reading the press sees that the varying levels of steel we use from steel rod to plate steel to sheet steel and on have gone up tremendously. The costs of freight are up tremendously, yet through pricing and RCI we shove them aside and we got that 20.  So yes, there's leverage, but there's also great RCI in there that\u2019s dealing with the material cost, that\u2019s one thing to think about. So you got a combination of those and you have some other costs in there. I think we talked about it, I think you will see some of it when you see in the Q, but I do think it's a combination of those working very well.  21.4 I think might be the highest we've ever seen in the tools group, I don't know, but we kind of hope to get the highest every quarter actually. So I don't like to say that, but we're pretty pleased with that. \nGary Prestopino: Okay, thank you. \nNick Pinchuk: Sure. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to now turn it back to our presenters for any closing remarks. \nSara Verbsky : Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day! \nOperator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Nick Pinchuk",
            "content": "Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I'm going to start the call by covering the highlights of our second quarter and along the way I'll give you my perspective on our results. Once again they were encouraging and our markets, robust and promising and our continued progress and strength amidst the pandemic. The pandemic isn't over, but we believe we're stronger right now than when it all started. Of course, we'll also speak about what it all means, then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials.  We believe that our second quarter again demonstrates Snap-on's ability to continue with the trajectory of positive results, overcoming a variety of ongoing headwinds, accommodating to the lingering virus environment, meeting the challenges of the day across the business world and advancing along our runaways for growth and for improvement.  Our reported sales on the quarter were 1,081.4 million and they were up versus last year, $357.1 million or 49.3%, including $20.6 million of favorable foreign currency change and $19.6 million in acquisition related sales. The organic sales were up 42.5% with significant gains in every group; our fourth straight quarter being above pre-pandemic levels, a V-shaped trajectory that defines resilience and flexible capability.  The OpCo operating income of $217.1 million was up $126 million from last year, which included $4 million of restructuring charge. OpCo operating margin was 20.1%, up from the 2020 level of 12.6% or 13.1% as adjusted for restructuring, representing a 700 basis point as adjusted improvement.  The financial services operating income of $68.9 million increased 19.6%, higher originations, lower losses, delinquencies, below pre-pandemic levels, our finance company passing the greatest stress test of our time with flying colors, and that result combined with OpCo for a consolidated operating margin of 24.5% up 560 basis points as adjusted.  Quarterly EPS was $3.76 up a 103.2% from last year, and excluding the 2020 restructuring charges EPS grew 96.9% versus the pre-pandemic levels of 2019 the EPS grew 16.8%, clearly tracing an ongoing positive trend. I've said it before, but it bears repeating, we believe Snap-on is stronger now than when we entered this great weathering, and we believe our second quarter is emphatic evidence of that fact.  Compared with 2019 our sales in the past quarter grew $130.1 million or 13.7%. That reflects $23 million of acquisition related sales, $17.2 million of favorable foreign currency and $89.9 million or 9.3% organic game.  The 2021 OpCo operating margin of 20.1% was up 10 basis points from 2019, but that gain was achieved against 70 basis points of unfavorable currency and acquisition impacts, all while absorbing the lingering effects of the virus, it's not gone. So, those are the numbers.  From a macro market perspective, it's clear that our automotive repair sector remains favorable. The technicians across the map are still at their posts, repairing cars and trucks, keeping the world running and they are busy, and as expected after the COVID, it appears that people are leaning more towards personal transportation and are holding onto their vehicles longer every year. Auto repair is a strong and resilient market. You can hear it from our franchisees and you can see it in our numbers.  As we look forward we see greater opportunities as vehicle techs encountered even more complex repairs, new technologies, alternative powertrains, greater proliferation of driver assistance electronics, it's all music to our ears. And then there is the repair shop owners and managers, RS&I territory, a little more mixed, particularly in Europe, but a return to growth in repair, garages and dealerships. They are starting to invest. Undercar equipment and OEM programs are coming back and RS&I is taking advantage of that trend with new equipment offerings and advanced database solution continually improving our software products and our diagnostic releases.  Products like Mitchell 1 Repair Information Software and Shop Management Software and Electronic Parts Catalogues and our Dealer-FX shop management technology, and our heavy duty and our intelligent diagnostic units, big data basis and getting more powerful, and easier to use, helping the shop fix it right the first time efficiently. Repair shop is changing, rising in complexity and RS&I has the products to match.  Finally, let's talk about critical industries where the Snap-on rolls out of the garage, solving past the consequence. This is where the C&I operates, our most international operations where the customers have endured the longest impact of the virus and have been slower to accommodate it or recovering it, what I call varied rates.  Segments like oil and gas and aviations in geographies like Southeast Asia and India still down. But despite the variation we did see growth in critical industries, improvements in education. The students are coming back and in power generation and heavy duty fleet, all combining to offset that continuing turbulence.  So overall I describe our C&I market as healthy and representing clear opportunity, and coupled with auto repair, we believe our markets are robust now and there's considerable opportunity ahead, and we have opportunity ahead for us as we move along our runways for growth and improvement, and I can't leave [ph] this section, about robust progress and abundant possibilities without speaking on the engine of our advance Snap-on value creation. Customer connection and innovation, developing new products and solutions, born out of insights and observations, gathered right in the workplaces and RCI, guiding the expansion of franchisees selling capacity with better processes, more effective training and a new focus on social media, it will all help drive our progress, overcoming the \u2013 accommodating the virus and enabling us to take full advantage of the opportunities and chart a continuing and positive trend forward; that's the overview.  Now let's move to the segments. In the C&I group, sales in the quarter were up 33.8% or $88.6 million versus 2020, including a $71.3 million or 26.3% organic uplift with double digit progress across all of the divisions. From an earnings perspective C&I operating income of $55.5 million including $1.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency represents a rise of $32.6 million compared to 2020, which included a $2 million or restructuring.  That all means an as-adjusted increase of over 122.9% and the operating margin was 15.8%, an as reported increase of 710 basis points, a rise of 630 basis points as adjusted and an uplift of 120 basis points from the pre-pandemic level in 2019 despite 90 basis points of unfavorable currency. When compared with pre-pandemic 2019, sales were up 4.6%, including a 0.4% organic gain, above flat, now a continuing bright spot for C&I.  SNA Europe did deliver yet another quarter of growth expanding beyond pre-pandemic levels against the wind, with the sparkle of Ergo Tool Management System leading the way, tailoring products specific to customer needs.  Europe is a varied market environment, but SNA in Europe is defining economic gravity again, and that positive was joined by contributions from recovering areas in critical industry like heavy duty, power generation and as I said before, education, whose come to the party just now. And from Asia Pacific geographies like China and Japan, and those gains were balanced by declines in attenuated sectors like the military, aerospace and natural resources, all still weak. We do remain confident in and committed to extending in critical industries and we're committed with great new products.  Speaking of product, in the last quarter it helped solve challenging tasks across aviation and other critical industries. We launched the new Snap-on 14.4 volt microlithium cordless right angle mini drill, with a 6000 RPM, making it ideal for drilling a variety of materials, plastics to aluminum to fiberglass. The unit has a compact 90 degree head, which provides easier access to confined spaces and reduces worker fatigue, it's a big factor. In addition, it also offers a higher quality chuck that achieves precise drilling with minimum run-out, ensuring tight tolerances are met with considerable reliability.  To top it all off, the drill also utilizes a double ball bearing supported spindle shaft and spiral bevel gears. I know that's a mouthful, but it all means that the new power tool has a clear superiority and durability. The cordless right angle midi is a great innovation with an array of advantages and the techs are noticing it. So that's C&I, a promising quarter, moving down it's runways for growth with strong profitability, C&I, OI margin 15.8%.  Now on to the tools group. Sales were $484.1 million up $160.8 million, including $154 million or 46.7% organic gain, double digit growth both in the U.S. and the international operations, and the operating margin was 21.4%, up 930 basis points. Compared with pre-virus 2019 sales grew $78.3 million, including $70.7 million or 17.1% organic gain and this quarter its 21.4% operating margin. It was up 380 basis points compared with the pre-virus numbers, coming out of the pandemic stronger indeed, another power \u2013 I was going to say powerful, I guess I could say that, but another positive quarter with double digit expansion across all geographies and all products.  We do believe our van network remains quite strong. Just a few weeks ago I spent time with a dozen franchisees on our \u2013 dozen franchisees on our U.S. National Franchisee Advisory Council at our Algona, Iowa tool storage plant and they were pumped and prosperous, excited by their current position, positive about the other vans in the regions - in the regions they represent, and very optimistic about their prospects for even more, beyond the windshield surveys.  We see other indications of continuing strength, like the Business Health Metrics, they remain quite favorable, qualitative and quantitative indicators, both very positive, and that positivity was not just internal, it was reinforced by the external view. Snap-on was recognized again this year among the top 50 in the franchise industry by Entrepreneur Magazine and once again we scored highest in the tools distribution category, place we've held for quite some time and now this type of recognition, this kind of positivity reflects the fundamental in contemporary strength of our franchisees and of our overall van business, and would not have been achieved without a continuous stream of unique new products.  Hand tools were up in the quarter and part of that, and part of that torque is rising in importance as more mechanical provisions, precision becomes necessary to support vehicle automation and we are riding that wave with great new products, like our new ATECH micro torque wrench with a quick release head. The quarter inch drive quick release has a positive locking mechanism to retain the socket solidly and securely in place, and at the same time it offers a push button for easy tool disengagement. It holds and it ejects, both important under the hood, at it's a time saver. It's quite a time saver in close clearance applications like valve cover removal and spark plug replacements that happen every day in the garage.  The tool also offers visual and \u2013 visual, audible, and vibration alerts to confirm that the proper torque has been applied and it has a wide torque range, 12 to 240 pound inches, and the new micro also includes a 50 degree flex head ratchet for better access to fasteners, a 72 tooth quarter inch drive socket ratchet enabling efficient operation in tight areas and a plus or minus 2% accuracy. Our micro tech takes precision fastening to the next level.  Tool storage is also strong in the quarter and part of that success was our KTL 1023 A3 Roll Cab, a wide 72 inch Triple-Bank Tool storage box. It offers three extra wide drawers for longer and larger tools, giving the technician more organizational options. Our patented lock and roll latch mechanism which prevents draws from drifting opened and our ISO-Ride\u00ae Caster for riding a smooth ride, smooth rolling and excellent weight capacity, plus, plus it adds our LED lighted power top which spans the full width of the cabinet for better illumination and great eye appeal. It includes 10 offset AC outlets and 4 USB ports for charging a larger array of the tech select electronics. The KTL 1023 A3, storage efficiency in a box that captures sharp attention in any shop. Sales of the unit, well it's a sellout.  Our new products are in fact making a difference in the tools group. You can't miss it in the numbers. They also \u2013 and the group also registered its fourth straight quarter of above pre-pandemic levels, the tools group unmistakably is moving onward and upward.  Now on to the RS&I group. Sales were up 62.7% or $153.6 million versus last year, including $135.7 million or 54.1% organic uplift with double digit growth weighted toward our under car equipment and our OEM project businesses. But with our diagnostics and information product businesses still delivering strong double digit increases in addition to the waiting towards undercar equipment and OEM projects.  From an earnings perspective RS&I operating income of $86.7 million represents a rise of $36.1 million or 71.3% compared to 2020, which included $1.4 million of restructuring. And the operating margin was 21.8%, an increase of 110 basis points from last year, 60 basis points as adjusted but again to the 180 basis point impact of unfavorable currency and acquisition affects.  When compared with 2019, sales were up 14.2% as reported and organic growth was $29.7 million or 8.4% with double digit advances in undercar equipment, OEM projects, diagnostics and information in North America, all of that being attenuated by a general weakness in Europe. For profitability the OI margin was 21.8% -- the OI margin of 21.8% was down 360 basis points, with a 150 point impact from unfavorable currency and acquisition effects and with a further drag from the higher sales of undercar equipment in OEM projects, both at the lower end of RS&I margins.  Having said that, RS&I has great opportunities and we are fortifying its way forward with more new products. We just introduced our new ZEUS Mobile work centers, giving the technicians the ability to use the full capabilities of our top of the line diagnostics information systems, including our exclusive fast track intelligent diagnostics from anywhere on the service bay. It is a compact footprint for great mobility, reaching all over the shop. It also incorporates a lockable tool drawer, tool storage cabinets and a large 27 inch touch-screen display.  The new ZEUS workstation offers significant improvements in convenience, in security and in visibility, combined with the power of our most sophisticated databases. It's just the ticket for those shops that want to solve the most difficult repair challenges and want to visibly display their advance capability for all the customers to see as they come in the shop, and the new workstation is making a difference, attracting attention and it's setting new volume levels for this category.  So to wrap-up RS&I, improving position with repair shop owners and managers, strong growth across all the divisions, recovering areas of undercar equipment and OEM projects and expanding product lines to lead the way forward.  Well, those are the highlights of the quarter, tools group, strong progress everywhere, unmistakable strength. C&I reporting a positive performance with significant profitability against variations across industry and geographies and RS&I expanding volume in independent repair shops and OEM dealerships, gains in the U.S. overcoming weakness in Europe.  Overall sales increasing for the corporation up nicely, both versus last year at 42.5% up and compared with pre-pandemic levels at 9.3% up, continuing our V-shaped recovery. OpCo operating margin, a strong 21% up again in the face of 70 basis points of unfavorable currency and acquisition effect. EPS, $3.76 in the quarter, up for the fourth quarter in a row, up versus last year, up versus last quarter, up versus pre-pandemic levels. It was another encouraging quarter.  Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo. Thanks Aldo. Well, at the beginning I said I would speak on what this all means, I want to try. First, it means that Snap-on and its markets are resilient. The virus, probably the greatest threat to our society and to business and in many decades it was a great shock. Miles driven down big dealerships, many furloughed, no travelers, aviation, no travelers, oil and gas and free-fall [ph] and education, virtually little need for equipment, nobody is in the classrooms, and yet we weathered this shock without trauma.  The credit company stepped in with just the right bridging at just the right place for customers and franchisees and our direct selling vans kept rolling, quickly accommodating to the environment. Snap-on kept investing in our product, our brands and our people, and we accommodated and recovered to post four straight quarters of above pre-pandemic results, tracing a B shaped recovery and emerging from the height of the storm stronger than we entered, resilience against the greatest business threat in memory. But it's more than resilience, more than bounce back, it also demonstrates great flexibility. As the world passed through this shock, through accommodations of psychological recovery, change was the order of the day and Snap-on adjusted. Fuel by our fortified advantages and product brand and people, we accommodate it. The pandemic limited face-to-face interaction. We expanded virtual contact and came away with some long term social media tools that will enable our franchisees for some time.  When technicians focused on shorter pay back items, we gave them hand tools and power tools and torque. When repair leaned away from maintenance to complex repairs and the shock, we provided ADAS calibration tools and intelligent diagnostics and helped our franchisees expand their selling capacity to manage those more complicated offerings efficiently.  When some critical industries weaken, we developed offerings for those that maintained. When the virus attenuated the distributors in Europe, we focused on customization and more direct interactions. All of that achievement in a time of change demonstrate Snap-on's flexibility and confirms we can prosper mid-future change going forward as we've always done, by observing work and solving whatever the new problems are.  Snap-on's second quarter, tools grew up in all geographies and in all product lines. Sales up 17.1% compared with 2019 and OI margins up 21.4%. C&I gains offsetting the challenges of the lingering COVID, rising profitability to 15.8%, up 120 basis points from the pre-pandemic level, even with the 90 basis point impact from unfavorable currency.  RS&I, sales up 8.5% versus 2019. Undercar equipment and OEM projects recovering in an OI of 21.8% down from the pre-pandemic, but still strong. In Snap-on overall sales is up 9.3% organically versus 2019, an OI margin of 20.1% and an EPS at $3.76, up meaningfully versus every comparison. It was an encouraging period again, demonstrating resilience and flexibility. Encouraging for the now and we're confident, encouraging for the prospects of growth and improvement for the future on through 2021 and well beyond.  Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. Your support is the fundamental element in driving our continuing positive trend; for your role in helping our society and our company to navigate the pandemic, you have my admiration. For your contributions in offering this quarter's strong results, you have my congratulations; and for your continued commitment to the Snap-on team, you have my thanks.  Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator. Good morning. I think it's a combination of that. I think they are. I think they are and our franchisees are more flush and therefore they are able to underwrite the shorter payback that even for bigger, even for a medium ticket items which might have going on EC before the franchisees are willing to underwrite it and let them pay RA.  I do think the technicians are kind of \u2013 have good cash, because the business has been going well for quite a long period of time and they are interested in continually investing in tools, so you see that as a factor. I mean that's certainly a factor in the business. And one of things we see is, is that you'll notice that RA is very strong versus EC in this quarter and we see that as you know the technicians are buying and still have capacity to buy more in the future, because they have borrowing capacity under our EC. You know, I don't know, the technician population is pretty spread. I wouldn't say they are more or less. In fact I think they are \u2013 I think they are the kind of the average, the every man. There are old technicians and young technician, so I don't think there's any particular concentration. You know you don't go into a garage and see all young people. You don't go see all old people either, so I don't think there's any particular position in that and they have some kids, but not different than the regular population. By the way, you know Aldo has to apologize for his voice. He was at the Deer District overnight at the Bucks game, so he's a little under the weather. Sure. They are no so much \u2013 sure, they target new customers, but what I'm really referring to hear without \u2013 I didn't want to get into in the remarks because there'll be a lot to say and I don't.  Really what this is we used social media before, but in the pandemic we realized a more effective way to use them was to pre-brief customers, in other words to contact them. You know at first we started out by saying, okay, we want to stay in touch with our customers via social media or any electronic means that could do it at a distance, but then we realized, Boy! It's a powerful tool for making for sales efficiency when you're actually in front of them.  Because what you can do is contact them on the social media, you have a relationship with them, you can pre-brief them about how a great new prod \u2013 what the elements of a particular new product is, like the 14.4V power tool I talked about or the Techwrench I talked about and then you can also pre-brief them on any promotions we might have. And so then when you're actually spending the time in front of the technician, you can spend your time closing the deal. This kind of shrinks the time and so it takes some of the pre-sell out of the face time and makes it more efficient, that's what we're talking about here. We learned how to do that very well in this \u2013 in the pandemic and that's going to serve us well.  And as part of the idea, remember I always said that the pacing element for sales through the tools group has been the franchisees time where they are hitting new limits. They are up 17% versus pre-pandemic levels and it's because we've expanded their capacity. The Bucks, yeah this is NBA Championship Headquarters right here. Excuse me Scott, I didn't actually say that. Hand tools did not lead the way this quarter. It was up big, but actually the best year-over-year number was tool storage. Yeah, but they were all big. I mean when you compare it to 2020, everything looks great you know. I mean it's all great, that was the nature of downturn. But there is no doubt, what I tried to say with that, all products, all geographies, just our way of saying that tools group had a gangbusters quarter. Yeah, Europe is above pre-pandemic levels. Now, okay to be fair you know, Europe wasn't all that hot you know in 2019, but it's still clearly above the pre-pandemic levels. In other words it's offset whatever the impact of the pre-pandemic was. The tools group is pretty much across all geographies, which is kind of interesting, because there ain't no stimulus in the U.K. and Australia and Canada. Sure. Hi Luke. Yeah, I think we are. I mean I don't know. Who \u2013 you know it could be famous last words Luke you know. You got a lot of people talking about the delta variant and all this stuff, I don't think so. I think the people of work, the people in the factories and the people in the garages, like I've said on other calls, are kind of thinking you know they've weathered the storm you know and they're not going to get shocked again no matter what, and so I think they kind of changed their level, they are starting to recover, and so you start to see people \u2013 you know we saw it in our tool storage numbers. One of the reasons why we took the franchisees, you know the franchise council to Algona, our tool storage plant, is everybody is screaming for more tool storage. Now, one of the effects was that when we entered the COVID they sold down their used inventory \u2013 their used boxes that they had taken in trade you know, so they had a lot of that rolling out, but still they are looking for boxes now, so I think things have turned.  The question is, are the franchisees so flush with cash that they want to finance some of those boxes or some of them, sometimes they sell them a locker, which is not quite as expensive as a box and they can afford to finance those kinds of things. But I do think, when I talk to franchisees, they are telling me that they've kind of turned the corner. They've turned the corners probably to \u2013 maybe too binary a word for it you know. We were coming back though. Things are pretty optimistic in the shops. Okay Chris. You know you're not going to get me to forecast the quarter, you know what I mean. I'm not going to say you know we're going to build on a 17 \u2013 they were upward over 17% increase over pre pandemic levels. But all I'm saying is the tools group, the reason why we say all products all geographies is we can't find anything wrong with it, and we always can find warps in some places you know, this is a good, you know what I mean, so we like our moment. How that plays out in the third quarter, I'm not sure.  You know you've been on the call. We've been on these calls a long time and I've always said that the third quarter is not \u2013 I'm saying I like our momentum. I think we're going into the quarter really strong. We feel stronger than last quarter, but I will add that I've always said that the third quarter is not necessarily a trend indicator, whether it's way up or way down, it has to do with all that windage, you know how many how many vacations to people take in Europe is one big thing, and the franchisees are allowed to take the same vacation as last year or more, I don't know, but I do think I haven't seen the tools group this strong. Yeah well, if you \u2013 you know I don't know. I think \u2013 look it's starting to come out of the thaw, because I think you can imagine why people are a little more reluctant in the COVID. There's a lot of interaction questions, a lot of viscosity and that kind of thing. I think they grew by 2% to 2.5% sequentially, so that's not bad I think.  So whether that has to do with the thaw or actually people getting more excited, I don't know. I do think when I talked to franchisees, they do more quickly go to the conversation. Gee! May be I ought to get a \u2013 I'm doing so many, so much business, maybe I better get a franchisee. The guy in California was just talking about that. This guy just started like a few years ago. He signed up for a competitor and then he was talking to the guy and he said, you ought to go \u2013 the guy was sold him the thing. He wanted to go to the best, so he came to Snap-on and the thing is this guy is so pumped, he is going up so far, he's talking about, gee, maybe I could do more with an assistant. I need an assistant and a lot more and more people are doing that. So we would expect some expansion in this area. Sure. Change? Sorry Dave, change of provisions? Well I, you know I have a tougher time figuring that out. I don't think so though, because it might be, it might be in the U.S. I don't think \u2013 I actually don't think David, I don't think stimulus is a much of a factor, maybe some, because you know we have pretty good growth in international operations. We don't see as clear a pumping of the money into the economy. So when we look at it across the world, it doesn't seem as though that specific characteristic of America is a factor. I don't know \u2013 maybe, but I tend to think it's more a combination of the franchisees feeling more flush.  You know you kind of got an interesting interaction. You have people who at first were leaning toward shorter payback items, and maybe that expands to away from hand to you know past handled tools up into lockers or spiffier [ph] tops for tools storage boxes which are more, which are more fundable by the franchisees over time. Franchisees like to build their shorter term credit, so they like that, and it is true that the technicians do have more cash. I mean they've been working all through the pandemic, and so that that's kind of built up in a relative cash. It could be eligible for other credit, we have no way of knowing that. I don't hear anybody mention it though.  Now, I talked to a lot of franchisees and they may not necessarily mention, but we haven't heard, we have heard that particular thing come up in any environment, so I don't know. Yeah, no it was a strong quarter in storage. I think somewhat, I'd like to think our offerings are kind of spiffier than they have been. You know I talked about this extra wide, the 72 inch master series in the call with the lighted top, those things are statement makers in garages, and I think that having refrained from some this for a period of time, technicians are getting more anxious to buy them and they have the money and they get are getting a little more confident, so they go out and look at them. That's really \u2013 I think that's the situation.  I wouldn't say there is no elasticity, but I think you know \u2013 I mean is there elasticity with new cars. I mean the thing is people are buying new cars and reused cars and so on. I mean so I think when people want something in this category, which is I've often said, I think you and I have had conversation that a tool storage box like car, so people tend to want them and they'll pay a little bit more. It's not no elasticity, but people will go up and pay from them, that's my analysis.  It's really the psychology and the need. A combination of need and psychology and our biggest cycle \u2013 the product we have, which is the biggest psychological factor in people buying is tool storage. Now, all I can tell you is, our tool storage plant is sold out, sold out. Well look, I think when I say \u2013 I don't know, I don't have that number at my fingertips, but there's a lot of wrinkles you can put in tool storage you know. Like we wouldn't necessarily call a new color a new product. On the other hand, if you roll out a new color, remember when we rolled out purple, there was an explosion you know, so some of that happens. It just has to do with the wrinkle that makes it, oh! This is the best box in the shop or it's the newest thing, that's really what happens. So we are constantly doing that stuff. Okay, I'll tell you, it is this way, a simple statement. We figured out new ways to expand the selling efficient of the franchisees. This has happened before, there's a precedent for this. If you go back and you look before that term which you told, you know you said that they struggled for growth, and it's a fair characterization in some ways, between 11 and 16 the compounded annual growth rate was 7.2% and that was fueled by the expansion of the capabilities we found artifices [ph] would do that, the vans, the Rock 'n Roll Cab and so on, and in this case, we believe we've broken through another ceiling to a new level and it's provable by the absolute amounts that are flowing through the vans at this point.  So that's certainly true for us and so we keep \u2013 we've always said, keep pounding that and we can sell more. We're not bound by the market; we are bound by our ability to sell. And so that's part of it, that's part of getting those franchisees to be able to deal with these more complex products, and we think we've made a step change over the last \u2013 now we've been investing in it for like three years or something. You know trying to get that, but we think we've done it, and we think this is probable by the absolute amounts. Whatever the source of that volume is, it proves that the franchisees can accommodate it, they couldn't before. Well look, I think there is leverage you know in that situation, so that's good. I think it would be a mistake to overlook the idea that embedded in there is some pricing to offset. You know we've got a whole bunch of \u2013 we've got material costs in there. I don't want to get in as its documented, but we got a great dollar for material costs. Anybody who's reading the press sees that the varying levels of steel we use from steel rod to plate steel to sheet steel and on have gone up tremendously. The costs of freight are up tremendously, yet through pricing and RCI we shove them aside and we got that 20.  So yes, there's leverage, but there's also great RCI in there that's dealing with the material cost, that's one thing to think about. So you got a combination of those and you have some other costs in there. I think we talked about it, I think you will see some of it when you see in the Q, but I do think it's a combination of those working very well.  21.4 I think might be the highest we've ever seen in the tools group, I don't know, but we kind of hope to get the highest every quarter actually. So I don't like to say that, but we're pretty pleased with that. Sure."

You know we were out there visiting plants and we visit franchisees and I was at the NFAC at our Algona plant and I was like, those guys think they're crushing it. So I don't know what that means in terms of market share, but it sounds good to me. Yeah, I think Aldo said \u2013 yeah, they are generally holding in line and like Aldo said, it was what, you know we were up 17% versus pre-pandemic levels and sales of the van were up 21 I think or something like that. So I think you know it's going pretty well, just rolling through the van. Yeah, look it's going to be bigger than any of the conference, we think, who knows? We still got a few weeks ago, but registrations are higher than they've ever been. When I talk to the franchisees, they are really excited about going, no matter who I talked to. I heard \u2013 they were always kind of optimistic about it, but this one is really big, because it's \u2013 you know we're celebrating our 100th really and they've been kind of \u2013 and they've been away for \u2013 they didn't have it last year, so they are really, really talking about it, so it's going to be bigger I think, and so what will the effect be.  I've said for dogs age on these calls that the third quarter can be a little bit variable, because there's a lot of wind \u2013 you know how many people go to the franchise conference, do they take more weeks, what happens in Europe and so on, but I'm telling you, I am not forecasting any weakness or anything like that. I'm just telling you, you never know how those things are going to turn out, but I like how we're entering the quarter, I like our moment you know. So I think whatever happens, we'll make the best of it. We're in a great position to navigate the quarter.  Hello? Okay, he was \u2013 he had to go to the Bucks celebration, so okay, don't ask right.

            "content": "Thanks Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on slide six. The second quarter of 2021 exhibited solid financial performance, particularly as compared to last year's heavily pandemic impacted second quarter. The results also compared favorably with the second quarter of 2019, which being a pre-COVID-19 time period may serve to be the more meaningful baseline.  Net sales of $1,081.4 million in the quarter increased 49.3% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 42.5% organic sales gain, $19.6 million of acquisition related sales and $20.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Sequentially organic sales improved by 4.5% as compared to the first quarter of 2021. Additionally, net sales in the period increased 13.7% from $951.3 million in the second quarter of 2019, including a 9.3% organic gain, $23.0 million of acquisition-related sales, and $17.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Consolidated gross margin of 50.2% improved 310 basis points from 47.1% last year, which included 30 basis points from restructuring costs. The gross margin contributions from the higher sales volumes and benefits from the company's RCI initiatives were partially offset by 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.  Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 30.1% improved 440 basis points from 34.5% last year, which included 20 basis points from restructuring costs. The improvement primarily reflects the benefits of higher sales volumes, partially offset by higher stock based cost and 70 basis points of unfavorable acquisition effects.  Operating earnings before financial services of $217.1 million compared to $91.1 million in 2020, reflecting 138.3% year-over-year improvement. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 20.1% improved 750 basis points from 12.6% last year, which included 50 basis points for restructuring costs.  Financial services revenue of $86.9 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $84.6 million last year, while operating earnings of $68.9 million increased $11.3 million from 2020 levels, primarily as a result of higher revenue and lower provisions for credit losses. Consolidated operating earnings of $286 million increased 92.3% from $148.7 million last year.  As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 24.5% compared to 18.4% in 2020, which included 50 basis points from restructuring costs. Excluding the restructuring costs, operating earnings margin in 2021 increased 560 basis points from last year.  Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 23.3% compared to 24.1% last year, which included a 20 basis point increase related to the prior year quarter's restructuring charges. Net earnings of $208 million of $3.76 per diluted share increased to $106.8 million or $1.91 per share from last year's levels, representing a 103.2% increase in diluted earnings per share.  As compared to 2020, excluding the restructuring charges of $3.3 million after tax or $0.06 per diluted share, diluted earnings per share increased 96.9%. Relative to the second quarter of 2019, net earnings increased $27.6 million or $0.54 per share, representing a 16.8% increase in diluted earnings per share.  Now, let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I group on slide seven, sales of $350.5 million increased 33.8% from $261.9 million last year, reflecting a 26.3% organic sales gain, $7.7 million of acquisition related sales and $9.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation.  The organic gain reflects higher activity in all of the segments operations and includes mid-teen increases in sales to customers in critical industries. Within critical industries, robust sales gains were achieved in general industry, heavy duty and technical education, but were partially offset by year-over-year declines in sales to the military, which had remained strong in the pandemic impacted period last year.  As a further comparisons, net sales in the period increased 4.6% from 2019 levels, reflecting $1.4 million of organic sales gains, $7.7 million of acquisition related sales and $6.4 million of favorable foreign currency translation. As compared to 2019, sales in our European based hand tools business were up high single digits. With respect to critical industry sales activity in that period, our military, international aerospace and natural resources segments were below 2019 levels. All other critical industry segments are at or about the second quarter of 2019.  Gross margin of 39.5% improved 510 basis points from 34.4% in the second quarter of 2020, which included 80 basis points from restructuring charges. Contributions from the higher sales volumes and the improvements resulting from the lower restructuring costs were partially offset by 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.  Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 23.7% improved 200 basis points compared to last year, primarily as a result of the improved volumes. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $55.5 million including $1.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $22.9 million last year. The operating margin of 15.8% compared to 8.7% a year ago.  Turning now to slide eight. Sales in the Snap-on tools group of $484.1 million increased 49.7% from $323.3 million in 2020, reflecting a 46.7% organic sales gain and $6.7 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase reflects a gain of approximately 40% in our U.S. business and a gain of approximately 80% in our international operations, with strong growth across all product lines.  Net sales in the period increased 19.3% from $405.8 million in the second quarter of 2019, reflecting a 17.1% organic sales gain and $7.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Additionally, sales in the U.S. operation were up 18.8% in that period, while franchisees sales of the van versus 2019 were up 21%. Gross margin of 46.8% in the quarter improved 510 basis points from last year, primarily due to the higher sales volumes, benefits from RCI initiatives and 50 basis points from favorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 25.4% improved from 29.8% last year, primarily due to the higher sales volumes. Operating earnings for the Snap-on tools group of $103.5 million compared to $38.4 million last year. The operating margin of 21.4% compared to 11.9% a year ago, an improvement of 950 basis points.  Turning to the RS&I group shown on slide nine, sales of $398.6 million compared to $245 milling a year ago, reflecting a 54.1% organic sales gain, $11.9 million of acquisition related sales and $6 million of favorable foreign currency translation.  The organic increase reflects a rise of approximately 80% in sales of undercar equipment, as well as a gain of approximately 50% in sales to OEM dealership and an increase of approximately 30% in sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. As compared to 2019 levels, net sales increased $49.7 million from $348.9 million, reflecting an 8.4% organic sales gain, $15.3 million of acquisition related sales and $4.7 million of favorable foreign currency translation.  Gross margin of 44.7% declined from 47.4% last year, primarily due to the impact of higher sales and lower gross margin businesses and 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by 70 basis points of benefits from acquisition. As a reminder, undercar equipment, as well as the facilitation program related activity, both of which had healthy sales increases in the quarter, typically have a gross margin rate that is below the RS&I segment's average.  Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22.9% improved 380 basis points from 26.7% last year, which included 50 basis points of restructuring costs. Contributions from the higher sales volumes and benefits from lower costs related to restructuring were partially offset by 190 basis points of unfavorable acquisition effects. Operating earnings for the RS&I group of $86.7 million compared to $50.6 million last year. The operating margin of 21.8% compared to 20.7% a year ago.  Now, turning to slide 10. Revenue from financial services of $86.9 million compared to $84.6 million last year. Financial services operating earnings of $68.9 million compared to $57.6 million in 2020. Financial services expenses of $18 million decreased $9 million from 2020 levels, primarily due to lower provisions for credit losses resulting from $2.8 million of lower year-over-year net loan charge offs, as well as favorable loan portfolio trends which support lower expected reserve requirements. As a percent of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were eight-tenths of 1% and 1.3% in the second quarter of 2021 and 2020 respectively.  In the second quarter the average yield on finance receivables of 17.5% in 2021 compared to 17.6% in 2020. The respective average yield on contract receivables was 8.5% and 8.2%. The lower yield on contract receivables in 2020 includes the impact of lower interest business operations support loans for our franchisee. These loans were offered during the second quarter of 2020 to help accommodate franchisee operations in dealing with the COVID-19 environment. As of the end of the current quarter, approximately $8 million of these business operation support loans remain outstanding.  Total loan originations of $285.8 million in the second quarter increased $30 million or 11.7% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 17.9% increase in originations of finance receivables, while originations of contract receivables were down 11.5%. Last year's contract receivable originations included the aforementioned offering of business operation support loans to qualified franchisees during the second quarter of 2020. Moving to slide 11, our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our U.S. operation. Our worldwide gross financial services portfolio increased $13.2 million in the second quarter, primarily due to the higher originations.  The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.2% in the United States extended credit is up 20 basis points from the rate of 1% in the second quarter of 2020. As we commented during our second quarter 2020 earnings call, we estimated in the quarter the 60-day plus delinquency rate was favorably affected by 20 to 30 basis points as a result of forbearance and deferred payment programs in place during that period last year.  As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12 month net losses of $41.6 million representing 2.4% of outstandings at quarter end is down 15 basis points sequentially and down 53 basis points compared to the same period last year.  Now turning to slide 12, cash provided by operating activities of $238.2 million in the quarter decreased $15.4 million from comparable 2020 levels, primarily reflecting the higher net earnings more than offset by net changes in operating assets and liabilities, including $98.4 million of higher income tax payments. The increase in cash paid for income taxes reflects both higher levels of taxable profitability, as well as the IRS no longer allowing companies to defer estimated tax payments as compared to the IRS accommodation offered during the second quarter of 2020.  Net cash used by investing activities in the $29.7 million included net additions of finance receivables of $18.7 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $147.9 million included cash dividends of $66.7 million and the repurchase of 566,900 shares of common stock for $137.4 million under our existing share repurchase programs, partially offset by proceeds from stock purchase and option plans of $61.8 million. As of quarter end, we have remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $251.6 million of common stock under existing authorizations.  Turning to slide 13, trade and other accounts receivable increased $4.7 million from 2020 year end. Day sales outstanding of 56 days compared to 64 days at 2020 year end. Inventories increased $14.4 million from 2020 year end, but on a trailing 12 month basis inventory turns of 2.7 compared to 2.4 at year end 2020.  Our quarter end cash position of $965.9 million compared to $923.4 million at year end 2020. Our net debt to capital ratio of 10.8% compared to 12.1% at year-end 2020. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million in available credit facilities. As of quarter end there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility and there are no commercial paper borrowings outstanding.  That concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few of the guidance for 2021. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in a range of $90 million to $100 million. We currently anticipate absent any changes the U.S. tax legislation, that our full year 2021 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 23% to 24%. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Yeah, I got it Chris, I got it covered. Specifically David, we said that the charge offs were lower by $2.8 million. But the charge-offs are just one of the indicators. When you look at your overall provision for losses, its down about $9 million to cut to the chase, but that's based on an assessment of what is the reserves side that we think we need for expected losses over the duration of the portfolio, which runs a little over four years on average, so that's the change of order.  But again as you'll see \u2013 you'll get more information obviously when the Q comes out, but if you look at charge offs are lower, the 60 plus day delinquency rate is lower, the net trailing 12 month losses are lower. The recoveries are better, the non-performing loans number are lower, the amount of past due accounts are lower. So you'll put that all together and that what'll arrive \u2013 lets us arrive at the conclusion that the reserves were able to be reduced somewhat."

With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?\nNick Pinchuk: Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I'll start the call by covering the highlights of our first quarter and along the way, I'll give you my perspective on our results, they are encouraging, on our markets they're standing firm and, on our progress, it's made us stronger than ever before. And we'll also speak about what it all means. We believe it means we're getting better and better position for more even while we're still in the midst of a once in a 100-year pandemic. After all that Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. We believe our first quarter is clear confirmation of Snap-on's ability to continue its trajectory of positive results, further accommodating to the virus environment, overcoming periods of period variations from business-to-business, dealing with macroeconomic headwinds and advancing along our runways for both growth and improvement. Our reported sales in the quarter of $1.246 billion were up 20.2%, including 19.2 million a favorable foreign exchange and 11.3 million of acquisition related sales. Organic sales growth was 16.3% gains in every group. It's our third straight, straight quarter of being above our pre-pandemic levels and ongoing contributions from our Strap-on value creation processes. The principles we use every day safety quality, customer connection, innovation, and rapid continuous improvement or RCI. They all combine to drive that progress, progress there was. OpCo operating income of 200.9 9 million was up 62 million from last year, which included 7.5 million of restructuring charges. OpCo operating margin was 19.6% up from the 2020 level of 16.3% or 17.2% as adjusted for restructuring. For financial services, operating income of 65.3 million increased 14.8% and the delinquencies were down even in the midst of a pandemic stress test during a commercial trial of what we would call extraordinary proportion. And that results combined with OpCo for a consolidated operating margin of 23.9% a 300 basis point improvement as reported and up 220 basis points as adjusted. First Quarter EPS was $3.50 up 40.6% from last year's 240 and exploding the 2020 restructuring charges EPS grew 34.6%. I said it before and I'll say it again. We believe Snap-on's stronger now than when we entered the great weathering. And we also believe that our first quarter results testify to just that, especially when we compare them to 2019 before the virus, so let's do that. Versus 2019, our sales in the past quarter grew 102.9 million or 11.2% that reflects 15.3 million of acquisition related sales, 11.6 million a favorable foreign currency and a $76 million or 8.1% economic gain. The 2021 OpCo operating margin of 19.6% was up 50 basis points from 2019 level as adjusted for a legal settlement in that earlier period. And that 50 point gain was achieved against 80 points of unfavorable currency and acquisition impacts, all while still absorbing the COVID. Now to our markets, auto repair remains quite resilient, the technicians are rolling. They know they've weathered the depths of the COVID shock and have learned to accommodate the virus environment and are moving to psychological recovery. There's still some air of vigilance. But their activities are robust. And they know they won't be shocked again by a spike. They're quite positive regarding the future of driving as people pivot from shared mobility to individual transportation. And it's - vehicle repair with the technicians is a strong and resilient market. You can hear it, you can hear it in our franchisees voices, and you can see it written clearly across our double-digit numbers. Also on auto repair, there are shop owners and managers. There are signs that the auto business is rising. Demand for new cars is high but dealership repair and maintenance and warranty is still attenuated. So there is a gradual gain, and we're positioned to take advantage with a broader and stronger product line with innovations like our TRITON-D10 diagnostics and new acquisitions like Dealer-FX, putting us deeper into dealerships than ever before, and providing us a clearer view of the future repair trends, new technologies and evolving vehicle platforms. Dealer-FX puts us at the right place at the right time as thing change. Finally, let's talk about critical industries, where Snap-on rules out of the garage solving tasks of consequence. This is where C&I operates the most international of our operations and these are the customers that have been most impacted by the virus. They're slower to accommodate and to recover, but they have been recovering. And in the quarter the results showed that trend, despite some significant headwinds, including the continuing impact of the virus, the February freeze in Texas, some challenged business sectors like oil and gas, and troubled geographies, like Southeast Asia. Despite that variation, we did see growth in critical industries, improvement in a number of areas in aviation, in education, in heavy duty fleet. They all combined to overcome the continuing turbulence in natural resources. Also in C&I, SNA Europe, another quarter of double-digit growth, with broad strength across the geographies in places like France, Spain, Italy, Germany, and the Nordic Region and from our Asia Pacific division, up double digits as well with solid increases in key countries like China and India and Japan. So overall, I describe our C&I markets is improving and representing clear opportunity, and coupled with our auto repair related businesses, we believe there's clear overall progress along our runways for growth, enhancing the van network, expanding to repair shop owners and managers, extended critical industries and building in emerging markets, leveraging our broadening product line, wielding or strengthening brand, and deploying the increasing understanding of the work that is the hallmark of Snap-on people, even in the throes of the pandemic shock. About a year ago as we entered the virus, we recognized the resilience of our markets and the strength of our model, projecting a B recovery. And that's how it played out. You can see it in the results. So now let's turn to the segments and discuss those results. In the C&I group on a reported basis, including 9.2 million favorable foreign currency translation, and 7.3 million of acquisition related sales, first Quarter volume rose 15.3% compared to last year. Organic sales were up 9.5%. Double digit growth in our European hand tool business and a mid-single digit rise in critical industries led the way. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income of 50.7 million including 1.4 million of unfavorable currency represents a rise of 19.2 million compared to the 31.5 million registered in 2020, which included 4.4 million of restructuring. That all means on an adjusted basis an adjusted increase of over 40% and as adjusted increase of over 40% and the operating margin was 14.7% and as reported increase of 420 basis points, and 290 as adjusted. Now, when compared with 2019, the pandemic free measuring stick sales were up 7.2% and that includes 10 million or 3.1% organic gain, 8 million of acquisitions and 5.2 million for favorable foreign currency. Once again C&I demonstrated sequential improvement. If you go back and look at those numbers, they keep getting closer and closer and now they're above pre-pandemic levels. Despite the ongoing uncertainty, it's one of the things I think we want to remember the virus isn't gone and was still bearing it and we didn't have it in 2019 and C&I is above that level. As part of the trend, we remain committed to extending in critical industries. That's the C&I sweet spot. So we'll keep strengthening our position to capture those opportunities as they arise. And enabling that attempt intent is our expanding lineup of innovative new products developed specially to make critical work easier. One example is our CT9010 3 inches drive 18 volt brushless impact wrench, the newest member of our MonsterLithium family, aimed at tight spaces, sustained power, rugged durability, and precise control. The 9010 features 320 pound feet of bolt break-away torque and 240 pound feet of working torque all the power of technician needs when they're working in confirmed quarters. It offers a variable speed trigger and three speed selections in forward and reverse. That means greater control adaptable to any applications and no over torquing important. The 9010 advanced design also reduces motor temperature rise to delivering higher durability and great power to weight ratio. It's managed fitted with a 100 lumen headlight that helps technicians work in dark environments. Just what's needed for those close jobs. And the 18volt battery with the five amp hours ensures consistent output and extended run time, which translates to less charging and more efficient work day. And all this comes and this is the best part I think, all of this comes in an extremely compact size or only six and three quarter inches in overall length that will fit into the tightest of work space. The ct 9010 is a great tool. It's had strong demand, and it's already one of our $1 million hit products. I don't want to leave C&I without mentioning SNA Europe. Double digit sales growth again, progress by the overall tool management system, expanding product customization to the needs of the task, driving progress across - against the twin headwinds of a difficult COVID environment. Europe is not so easy these days and the uncertainty of Brexit, no small feat. Well that's C&I, continuing the sequential improvement and position for more. Now onto the tools group, sales a 478.3 million up 102.4 million including 6.7 million of favorable currency and a 95.7 million or 25% organic gain, double digit growth both in the US in the international operations, the operating margin was 20.7%. Yes, 20.7% up 780 basis points, compared with pre-virus to 2019, tools group sales grew 68.1 million, 16.6% including 5.2 million favorable currency translation and 62.9 million or 15.1% organic gain. And this year's 20.7 operating margin was up 430 basis points compared with pre-pandemic 2019. The tools group is responding to the challenges of the day, increasing its product advantage, fortifying its brands and further enabling its franchisees and the results show it. We do believe our runway for coherent growth enhancing the franchise. Franchise network represents a continuing opportunity and there's evidence that we're realizing some of that potential across the van channel in our franchisee metrics, the financial and physical indicators that we monitor closely. Again this quarter they remain clearly favorable. And based on those metrics, we believe the franchisees have never been stronger. And they say so in our direct interactions at events like this past January's kickoff meeting held this year at a distance. It was a great affair. Well attended strong orders, visible commitment to our brand, watch parties all over the country. I zoomed into several myself and they were brimming with enthusiasm and optimism. Our franchisees, entrepreneurs and professionals all are pumped, confident and reaching higher. The tools group quarter, that's a strong advantage for us. The tools group quarter was also marked with Snap-on value creation, customer connection and innovation. Offering new products sometimes just an improvement on an established line, but clearly making work easier solving problems, delivering productivity gains. All of these are born out of observing the changing work in shops on an everyday basis. We're in those shops every day. We watch the work. We offer the products. One such add is our KERN681, 7-Drawer Single Bank EPIQ Series Roll Cab, configured entirely with extra wide 62 inch drawers, greater flexibility and capacity and a standard footprint making the most of limited shop space. Our franchisees are already calling it uninterrupted storage. It's the first large capacity roll cab paired with a full complement of extra wide drawers in the industry. To me Algona, Iowa plant I saw some of being made there just last month and the local team is proud of them. It comes with two swivel and two rigid casters located right on the corners of the box, doesn't seem like much of a change. But that's a clever innovation that provides mobility and tight spaces while also greatly enhancing box stability. That's a very important feature for a high capacity unit. The KERN681 epic strength, styling and styling 8000 pounds of low capacity and more than 45,000 cubic inches of storage space. The franchisees are saying it's been a clear hit and they're right. We spent some time over several quarters working to expand franchisees selling capacity, harnessing social media, improving product training, and RCI and van operations. So that's paid off, selling capacity is up, and you can see it clearly in the three straight gangbusters quarters for our tools group. I don't need to say any more about them. Now let's speak about RS&I, first quarter organic sales rose 7.6% with varying gains across the board. Undercar equipment coming back delivering double digit rise, diagnostics and information products, independent repair shops growing at mid single digits and the business focused on OEM dealerships, advancing low single digits. Operating earnings of 81.4 million, including 1.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased 4.1 million from 2020, which included 3.1 million of restructuring costs. Compared with 2019 sales grew 19.7 million or 6% including 10 million or 3.1% organic gain, 7.3 million from acquisitions and 2.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency. We clearly see the potential and a runway for growth in the RS&I group expanding Snap-on's presence in the garage with coherent acquisitions and a growing line of powerful products. RSI's organic growth in the quarter was broad based, but the double digit rise in undercar equipment was especially welcome turn and was led by innovative products like our newly introduced Tru-Point ADAS calibration system. Advanced driver assistance systems or ADAS are active and passive aids to keep vehicle passengers safe, things like collision avoidance, lane departure warnings, automatic parking and crosswind stabilization. These new features are great. But what's really music to our ears is that they require periodic calibrations to make sure they're working with precision and calibrations can be complicated. Sensors and cameras vary considerably across vehicle makes and models and if you get a faulty recalibration, it leads to rework and it's not good for safety. So our new John Bean 2.8 ADAS calibration system is the fix, making sure the vehicle is physically aligned correctly, guiding calibration of the sensors and documenting that the procedure was performed - formed appropriately. And it does so for the multitude of makes and models seen regularly in OEM and aftermarket shops. The new Tru-Point is easy to use. It requires minimal training. It compensates for the floor regularities that are so common in garages and big devils alignment and calibration is quick and efficient. And it's OEM compliance. It's a powerful product right in the crosshairs of automated vehicle technology that's so prominent today. Progress in diagnostics and information with independent repair shop owners and managers was also clearly evident in our diagnostics business and our RS&I activity. And in this quarter, the launch of the new Triton d 10 hand belt helped both of that positive. The new TRITON is ultra fast, a two second boot up and it has a best in class 10 inch touchscreen. It's geared to the more capable technician offering a one touch full diagnostic code scan, scope capabilities for performance display, and guided testing of suspect components that you may want to replace. But you want to make sure that there's a problem. It's loaded with our Fast-Track Intelligent Diagnostics rooted in our proprietary database of over 200 billion vehicle events a Snap-on only feature that enables quick and accurate diagnosis of even the most difficult and unusual repairs, ensuring an efficient and effective solution for those very, very time-consuming problems. Just what the capable and senior technician needs. Now, as I've said before, we've spent considerable effort working to help franchisees sell the complex tools of today efficiently and it's paying off with TTITON. Each of our franchisees received a demonstration unit, facilitating the hands-on training guided by the video presentations that were a prominent part of our networks February sales meetings. Following that initial instructions, a demo unit could then be put immediately in the hands of a technician to physically showcase the great benefits of our powerful new tool and it worked. The launch has been a success. Our franchisees are comfortable selling new and complex tool and many are now calling the TRITON-D10 the best diagnostic unit ever. Finally, RS&I got a nice boost in the quarter. As often is the case by the new tech - by new technologies and OEM dealerships helped by some significant essential tools and equipment programs supporting the new electric vehicle launches. We're quite positive about RS&I's future repair shop owners and managers as the vehicle industry evolves. It plays to our strength. So that's the highlights of the quarter, continued and strong progress. Our third straight period exceeding pre-pandemic levels, C&I, sequential improvement, sequential advancement, RS&I solid, the tools group strong and prompt, organic sales rising 16.3%, OpCo operating margin 19.6%, EPS $3.50 a big rise and most important. Most important, more testimony that Snap-on has emerged from the turbulence much stronger than when we entered. It was an encouraging quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?\nAldo Pagliari: Thanks Nick. Our consolidated operating results is summarized on Slide 6. The first quarter of 2021 exhibited robust financial performance, particularly as compared to last year when we experienced initial shock of the virus. The quarter's results also compared favorably with the first quarter of 2019, which being a pre-pandemic time period may serve to be the more meaningful baseline. Net sales of $1.246 billion in the quarter increased 20.2% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 16.3% organic sales again, $11.3 million of acquisition related sales and $19.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Additionally, net sales in the period increased 11.2% from $921.7 million in the first quarter of 2019, including an 8.1% organic gain, $15.3 million of acquisition related sales and $11.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation Consolidated gross margin of 50.1% compared to 49.5% last year, which included 60 basis points from restructuring costs. The gross margin contributions from the higher sales volumes of benefit from the company's RCI initiatives were offset by 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 30.5% improved 270 basis points from 33.2% last year, which included 30 basis points from restructuring costs. The improvements primarily reflect the impact of higher sales and cost containment actions, partially offset by higher stock-based cost and 30 basis points of operating expenses related to acquisitions. Operating earnings before financial services of $200.9 million, compared to $138.9 million in 2020, reflecting a 44.6% year-over-year improvement. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 19.6% improved 330 basis points from 16.3% last year, which included 90 basis points for restructuring costs. Financial services revenues of $88.6 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to $85.9 million last year, while operating earnings of $65.3 million increased $8.4 million from 2020 levels, principally due to the higher revenue as well as lower provisions for credit losses. Last year's provisions included a $2.6 million charge for higher reserves resulting from the economic uncertainty caused by COVID-19. Consolidated operating earnings of $266.2 million increased 36% from $195.8 billion last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 23.9% compared to 20.9% in 2020, which included 80 basis points from restructuring costs. Excluding the restructuring costs operating earnings margin in 2021 increased 220 basis points from last year. Our first quarter effective income tax rate is 23.5% compared to 24.2% last year, which included a 10 basis point increase related to the prior year quarter's restructuring charges. Finally, net earnings of $192.6 million or $3.50 per diluted share increased $55.4 million, or $1.01 per share from 2020 levels representing a 40.6% increase in diluted earnings per share. Additionally, net earnings increased $14.7 million or $0.34 per share from 2019 levels representing a 10.8% increase in diluted earnings per share. Net earnings in 2020 included restructuring charges of $6 million after tax, or $0.11 per diluted share and net earnings in 2019 included a benefit of $8.7 million after tax or $0.15 per diluted share from a legal settlement. Excluding these items, diluted earnings per share of 350 in 2021, increased 34.6% from 2020 and 16.3% from 2019 levels. Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I group on Slide 7, sales of $345.7 million increase 15.3% from $299.9 million last year, reflecting a 9.5% organic sales gain, $7.3 million of acquisition related sales and $9.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain includes double digit increases in the segment's European based hand tools business and the Asia Pacific operations, as well as a mid single digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries. Improvements in year-over-year sales growth were widely seen across Europe as well as in most emerging markets. Additionally, within critical industries, strong sales gains were achieved in aviation, heavy duty and technical education. While year-over-year declines in the natural resources sector improved from those experienced in the fourth quarter of 2020, but continue to lag pre-pandemic sales levels. As a further comparison, net sales in the period increased 7.2% from 2019 levels, representing a 3.1% organic sales gain, $8 million of acquisition related sales and $5.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Gross Margin of 38.7% improved 190 basis points from 36.8% in the first quarter of 2020, which included 150 basis points from restructuring charges. Aside from the improvements resulting from the lower restructuring cost, contributions from higher sales volumes were partially offset by 70 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 24% improved 230 basis points as compared to last year, primarily as a result of the higher volumes and savings from cost containment actions. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $50.7 million, including $1.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $31.5 million last year, the operating margin of 14.7% compared to 10.5% a year ago. Turning now to Slide 8, sales in the Snap-on tools group of $478.3 million, increased 27.2% from $375.9 million in 2020 reflecting a 25% organic sales gain and $6.7 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increased reflects double digit gains in both our US and international operations. Net sales in the period increased 16.6% from $410.2 million in the first quarter of 2019, reflecting a 15.1% organic sales gain, and $5.2 million a favorable foreign currency translation. Gross Margin of 45.9% in the quarter improved 320 basis points from last year, primarily due to the higher sales volumes and benefits from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 25.2%, improved from 29.8% last year, primarily due to the higher sales volumes and savings from cost containment action. Operating earnings for the Snap-on tools group of $98.9 million, compared to $48.6 million last year. The operating margin of 20.7% compared to 12.9% a year ago an increase of 780 basis points. Turning to the RS&I group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $347.6 million compared to $314.6 million a year ago, reflecting a 7.6% organic sales gain, $4 million of acquisition related sales and $4.8 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase includes the double-digit gain and sales of undercar equipment, mid single digit increases in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers and a low single digit gain and activity with OEM dealerships. As compared to 2019 levels, net sales increased 6% reflecting a 3.1% organic sales gain, $7.3 million of acquisition related sales and $2.3 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Gross Margin of 46% declined from 47.9% last year, primarily due to the impact of higher sales and lower gross margin businesses and 70 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. As a reminder undercar equipment as well as facilitation program related activity, both of which had healthy sales increases in the quarter typically have a gross margin rate that is below the RS&I segments average. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales 22.6% improved 70 basis points from 23.3% last year, which included 80 basis points of restructuring costs. Excluding the effects of restructuring benefits from the higher sales volumes were more than offset by 80 basis points of operating expenses related to acquisitions. Operating earnings for the RS&I group of $81.4 million compared to $77.3 million last year. The operating margin of 23.4% compared to 24.6% a year ago. Now turning to Slide 10, revenue from financial services of $88.6 million, compared to $85.9 million last year. Financial services operating earnings of $65.3 million, compared to $56.9 million in 2020. Financial services expenses of $23.3 million decreased to $5.7 million from 2020 levels, primarily due to lower provisions for credit losses, resulting from $2.4 million of lower year-over-year net loan charge offs and the absence of the previously mentioned first quarter 2020 $2.6 million charge. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1.1% and 1.4% in the first quarters of 2021 and 2020 respectively. In the first quarter the average yield on finance receivables of 17.6% in 2021, compared to 17.7% in 2020. The respective average yield on contract receivables was 8.4% and 9.0%. The lower yield on contract receivables in 2021 includes the impact of lower interest business operations support loans for our franchisees. These loans were offered during the second quarter of 2020 to help accommodate franchisee operations and dealing with the COVID-19 environment. As of the end of the first quarter, approximately $11 million of these business operating support loans remained outstanding. Total loan originations of $261.8 million in the first quarter increased $6.2 million or 2.4% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 1.7% increase in originations and finance receivables. While originations of contract receivables were up 5.7%. Moving to Slide 11, our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our US operation. Our worldwide gross financial services portfolio decreased $25.8 million in the first quarter, primarily due to an increase in net collections. The 60 day plus delinquency rate of 1.6% for the United States extended credit is down 10 basis points from the first quarter last year and down 20 basis points as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. We believe this reflects the typical seasonal delinquency pattern that customarily results in a decline in the first quarter, followed by increases later in the year, usually peaking in the fourth quarter, where we compete with the technicians' holiday related discretionary spending. As it relates to extending credit, or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $43.9 million represented 2.55% of outstandings at quarter end, down seven basis points sequentially, and down 44 basis points as compared to the same period last year. Now turning to Slide 12, cash provided by operating activities of $319.3 million in the quarter increased $105.9 million from comparable 2020 levels, primarily reflecting the higher net earnings and net changes in operating assets and liabilities including a $32.1 million decrease in inventory. Net cash used by investing activities of $207.2 million included $200 million for the acquisition of Dealer-FX and capital expenditures of $19.3 million partially offset by net collections of finance receivables of $12.1 million. Free cash flow during the quarter of $312.1 million was 158% in relation to net earnings. Net cash used by financing activities of $131 million, included cash dividends of 66.7 million and the repurchase of 722,000 shares of common stock for $151.9 million under our existing share repurchase programs, partially offset by proceeds from stock purchase and option plans of $93 million. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $268.7 million of common stock under existing authorizations. Turning to Slide 13, trade and other accounts receivable increased $10.1 million from 2020 year end. Days sales outstanding of 62 days compared to 64 days a 2020 year end. Inventories decreased $16.4 million from 2020 year end and on a trailing 12 month basis inventory turned to 2.6 compared to 2.4 at year end 2020. Our quarter end cash position of $904.6 million, compared to $923.4 million at year end 2020. Our net debt to capital ratio of 12.4% compared to 12.1% at year end 2020. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million of available credit facilities. As of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few of the guidance for 2021. We anticipate the capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. We currently anticipate that absence of any changes at the US tax legislation, our full year 2021 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?\nNick Pinchuk: Thanks Aldo. Well, that's our first quarter, another encouraging period, resilient markets through the shock and on the way to psychological recovery, the third straight quarter of upward trajectory, clear year-over-year achievement, and the third straight quarter of results exceeding the pre-pandemic levels of 2019. RS&I sales continuing upward with a wide margins of 23.4% attenuated, but still strong. CNI, ongoing sequential growth across the world. And OI margins 14.7% up nicely, even from 2019. And then the tools group, sales up organically 25% versus 2020 up in all product lines and in all geographies, volume up 15.1% versus 2019 and an OI margin of 20.7%. Finally, financial services in the midst of the greatest stress test profits up delinquencies down, rock solid, and they all came together with Snap-on sales rising organically 16.3% versus 2020 and 8.1% versus '19. OI margin 19.6% up significantly despite the virus, the unfavorable currency and the acquisition impacts and the EPS $3.50 a substantial rise versus both 2020 and 2019. We do believe that Snap-on has abundant opportunity as the COVID recedes and the world shifts away from the cities and away from shared transportation and as new vehicle technologies make the car park more complex. And we further believe that we are stronger today than when we entered the storm. Our advantages of product, brand and people are even greater. And we're in a favorable position to wield those strengths, realize the opportunities and continue our positive trajectory throughout 2021 and beyond. Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. Many are listening. I want you to know that your work in this weathering has made a difference to our company and to our society. For your efforts in keeping our world and its critical mobility intact, you have my admiration. For your contribution to our progress in this first quarter, you have my congratulations. And for your unfailing dedication to our team in both smooth and turbulent times, you have my thanks. Now we'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Please go ahead, sir.\nGary Prestopino: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nNick Pinchuk: Good morning Gary,\nGary Prestopino: Couple of questions here Nick, we haven't really seen this kind of growth in the tools group since probably earlier part of last decade, a lot of that was dealing with tool storage. And I don't think it's the same issues now. I mean, if you could cite three or four things that are different in the growth metrics now what you're seeing, especially over the last couple of quarters versus what you saw, maybe when tool storage was really rubbing up on an earlier period last decade.\nNick Pinchuk: Yeah, I think there's a couple of things, I think one, this isn't a tool storage and that it was a much more focused growth. We introduced the - certainly the first thing is when we had that rise, we introduced the Rock N' Roll Cabs and the Techno's, which really focused on more or less a particular product line. This was a - this is a broader thing, much more rooted in kind of agnostic process from a product point of view of expanding the capabilities of the tools - of the franchisees. We harness social media better, we're training them better to get the elevator pitch down, and we RCI their vans, or we worked on this for quarters before maybe even in 2019. And we worked really hard in the COVID, because we had time to focus on it. And that's really paying off. It's showing that these franchisees can hit this 20%. The other thing is, I think we got some good products, particularly around hand tools. We package the hand tools, so we're selling not only individual tools, but also kits aimed at a particular problem, and they're becoming pretty profitable, popular. We didn't talk about them on the call. I mean things like putting together a set of sockets that are for particular applications in foam. They're wildly popular. And then the other products we have in terms of tool storage and diagnostics. They're really baffled and that's driving that that broad appeal. And then the final thing, I think you could think, look, there's a lot of this condition, you could - people might say this is recovery, but the sales off the van over last year exceeded the sales to the van, so you wouldn't think there'd be recovery in that. Not so much recovery in that situation. It's going off the van at the same level. The whole year was up. And same things happening this quarter, sales up the van is the same as we're selling to them. So you look at this, you might say it's a stimulus and the stimulus could be helping us this way. We don't know, when you're talking to technicians and people in a practice stimulus seems to be always going into bank accounts or paying off debt. And the other thing about it is, by the way, we think it's product and process based because the international business, UK, Australia and Canada are up and a regional stimulus is there.\nGary Prestopino: Right, okay, that's good. And then in terms of I guess, it's Dealer-FX, a couple of questions on this one. What can you tell us in terms of their installed base across dealerships versus the amount of dealerships that you actually service? Can you give us some idea of just how much whitespace there is out there for this product?\nNick Pinchuk: Yeah, they tend to be - they're in I would say maybe in the double digit percentage of the dealerships, but they tend to be concentrated in a couple of OEMs. And so there's a lot of whitespace to grow in that situation. We see that tremendous opportunity. And the other thing about Dealer-FX, I think we talked about this in the acquisition, they're just now sort of rolling out this new - their updated system that was ready to go, but the COVID hit. So now they get the chance sight at the apple with full force. But again, these are things we knew when we acquired them. It's early days, we've only owned them for a couple months. So we're still getting on, but we're pretty confident we're in the right place at the right time like I said in my comments.\nGary Prestopino: Are they going to be - are their revenues booked in the RS&I segment?\nNick Pinchuk: Yeah, they're going to be in RS&I.\nGary Prestopino: In RS&I?\nNick Pinchuk: Yeah, because they're going to sell to dealers, we see them as sort of like the advanced warning net for us from a strategic point of view. You remember the old do line, I used to be across Canada, to make sure we figured out what the Russia bombers were doing when they're coming over the goal - over the North. So this is the same kind of thing.\nGary Prestopino: Okay and then you also just mentioned some new tools for the EV market. Could you maybe elaborate a little bit on that?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, those things are particular to a particular vehicle. We have a business. We call the EQS business that really is rooted in new technology. When new technologies roll out, or one of the people, the OEMs come to, to say, hey, put together a set of tools. Now in one of these, we have a 70 unit toolset that we provide that supports a certain new vehicle that's coming out. So I mean, that's, that's one of the things and so - and yet there's another one for another new vehicle. So as people roll out new vehicles, they commission these kinds of things to facilitate the dealerships to be ready to deal with it. And then everybody figures out what other things might happen and that shows up and we launched other tools to match that that the OEMs didn't even anticipate going forward. Those are the kinds of things. And we have a set of tools. We have a standard set of tools for electrics that are what we call insulating tools with glass infused nylon that allows us to - technician to use them safely against - and be approved against some pretty high voltages and so that's sockets and pliers and screwdrivers and kits to disconnect the electric vehicle safely and that kind of thing.\nGary Prestopino: Okay and just lastly real quick, I don't want to take up too much more time. I would assume some of these calibration tools for ADAS and things that you've got out there, these are also applicable to the EV market?\nNick Pinchuk: Yeah. Sure. They're rooted - they're pretty much agnostic to the power train. They're more or less having to do with the sensors - the neural net of the sensors around the vehicle.\nGary Prestopino: Thank you so much.\nNick Pinchuk: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead, sir.\nChristopher Glynn: Thanks. Good morning. Congratulations on the -\nNick Pinchuk: Good morning.\nChristopher Glynn: So picking up on your answer to one of Gary's questions you talked about coming out with new kits and follow-on tools as new platforms come out in EV and elsewhere. So it underscores your visibility. And then with the Dealer-FX group, you talked about how that extends your visibility. I'm just curious how that pairs with your already seeming copious visibility into the new platforms?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, the thing is that we have visibility into the new platforms. We are franchisees, which visit the dealers every day. So they tend to have a look at the, what I would call the more persnickety problems that arise all the time associated with vehicles that no one ever anticipated. The Dealer-FX is the repair shop management software. So you get to see what's happening in an aggregate kind of like databases to look at this kind of thing and say, okay, well, they're having a lot of problems here, they're having a lot of problems there. And you get to understand the difficulties associated with that. So it's not so much an observational thing it's a computational thing. Those are the kinds of things that help. So it just adds to our position. And then we also have a non-peril position in the repair shops afterwards, after vehicles age, and they end up in independent repair shops, which is what you're referring to. We're in more shops for more hours in days. And that's what drives our product line. So when new technologies show in whether you're talking about automated vehicles or electric vehicles, they're going to roll through this, we're going to see them via Deale-FX probably first, then we're going to see them via the franchisees that call on dealerships to understand the nuances of some smaller and more difficult problems that are harder to predict via just maybe the bigger problems, the 20,000 foot problems that the software might see. And then as they roll into the aftermarket, we have probably almost proprietary visibility on that. That's what generates our proprietary databases that I talked about 200 billion repair records.\nChristopher Glynn: Great and then on SOT, you talked a lot about the kind of throughput enhancements. Do these sales levels that you've seen the past few quarters represent pretty maximized realization of the newly availed bandwidth of the franchise channel into the addressable market?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, that I don't know. You know what I mean? I don't know that. All I know, is they can go that high. You know what I mean? We now approved, it's sort of like a stress test. We know they can go that high. And they're not complaining. I had a franchisee telling me, I asked him about something about his market. I asked him about what is the market like and so on? He says, I don't know, I'm too busy selling tools. So he's out there now. He didn't say he didn't have more capacity, because he was asking me for more units. So in other words, he was short of a particular product line. So he thought he could sell them more. So we think they probably have a little more upside. But in this kind of situation, Chris, you'd have to keep pounding. We'd say okay, we got to keep working on expanding the capabilities because no matter where they are, you want more when you go forward, right.\nChristopher Glynn: Right, so you feel you have further runway to continue to work on the throughput side of the equation?\nNick Pinchuk: Sure. What happens is - just one question. What happens is you observe what's happening at a certain throughput level and that reveals the pinch points and you work on that.\nChristopher Glynn: Great last one for me, finance receivable collections just exceeded additions. I don't recall many years seeing that - are you seeing more customers paying with cash?\nAldo Pagliari: Well, Chris, I think what you see is the technician base, they're employed. They got more money in their pocket, and they seem to be servicing their debt and buying tools to supplement their needs. So I guess it's just an overview I think provided earlier, people are servicing the debt in a more pragmatic way.\nChristopher Glynn: Sounds great, thanks, guys.\nAldo Pagliari: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Luke Junk with Baird. Please go ahead.\nLuke Junk: Good morning, guys.\nNick Pinchuk: Good morning.\nLuke Junk: Couple of questions, first a new term question, Nick, hoping you could just talk qualitatively about daily sales trends through the quarter, certainly? Looking at the 2019 comps for the tools group, especially help to frame the absolute level to be really well, but I just want to better understand the sequential momentum you saw in the first quarter.\nNick Pinchuk: Yeah, look, I think one of the things we're seeing is our third quarter - third month was higher in this period, but they're, they're almost always higher a little bit, if you look at this. So I would say, we would have said that adjusted for what we expect. The sales were about level through the quarter kind of constant. Generally we have our own sort of like, view of what's going to happen when you roll out of the beginning in first quarter for example, and so we have some view, but this generally seemed about we expected. We weren't surprised by any month in this quarter, I would say. So I think - we think it's kind of held strong each quarter. I don't see attenuation, if that's what you're asking.\nLuke Junk: It is, thanks for that.\nNick Pinchuk: Yeah, Nick. I don't - we didn't see any attenuation.\nLuke Junk: Okay and then a bigger picture question more on the strategy side. And it has come up already a couple of times this morning in terms of the big shifts that we've seen in the new car market the past, say six or nine months with respect to electrification, especially ADAS as well. And all these changes take a while, of course, to ultimately filter through to the aftermarket. Hoping you could just expand on how these changes are impacting your thinking around investment priorities today, both organically and M&A? And should we think that, for instance, they impacted the thinking around the Dealer-FX acquisition, for example?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, yes. I mean, the thing is sure. Look, we like change. Like we said, I think we've said the house come home, that changes our friend and we love to have it. And the earlier we can see change, the more we can, as you say, call in the air strikes about investment and so on. And so the Dealer-FX acquisition was about positioning ourselves at the forefront at the vanguard, if you will, of new technologies, not just electric vehicles, but new technologies that would impinge on the car park. So that's what we're doing. And so we'll continue to look at that in terms of, okay, what do we learn from that, how can we invest in other places to follow that change. But make no mistake about it. The revelations occur in each aging of the vehicle, so things change as you roll out. When the vehicle rolls in, people think this is what's needed. And then a couple of years go by and we see that these are what's needed. And some of it isn't even - this is what I was trying to say before is some of it isn't the fact that you have to repair, let's say, a particular item or you have to recalibrate the sensors. It might be revealed to us in the difficulty of doing those products - those processes, which everybody - first, you understand you got to do it and then you realize, wait a minute. On these particular vehicles, you need special tools just to do them because they're configured in an odd way. This is - and we learned that as it went through. And so basically, we see ourselves this electric vehicle, the EV, the new technologies. It's just the version of what's happened before, only maybe hopefully at a faster pace, which gives us more to sell. And so our activities will be to try to anticipate those changes more quickly, invest in them and then enjoy.\nLuke Junk: Good. I'll leave it there.\nNick Pinchuk: Okay.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Scott Stember with C.L. King. Please go ahead.\nScott Stember: Good morning, guys, and congrats on the strong results in the quarter.\nNick Pinchuk: Thank you.\nScott Stember: I think you - Aldo, you might have answered this question, but the growth in originations versus the tools organic sales. Obviously, there's a pretty big delta there. Is that entirely because more you're seeing more mechanics basically buy with cash, or is there something else - some other nuance that we just need to know about?\nAldo Pagliari: A couple of things, I think there's a little bit. I think there's more cash in the system. So that's probably - if anything, that's probably not negative, it's probably a positive. I think that, again, you're still at stages where your psychological recovery is not completely the same everywhere in the country. So I think people, broadly speaking, It's still a little bit more measured when they approach big ticket items as compared to hand tools, power tools, things of that nature. I still think there's that nuance. But when the tools group sells 25% organically, without having to dig deep into extend the credit, we feel that means there's borrowing capacity down the road that opens up future opportunities for them. So we kind of like the mix in that respect.\nScott Stember: Got it and in RS&I, the - on the car care, I mean, that was the first time we've seen a major increase like that in a while. So I'm wondering, is that being driven by stronger collision market demand? And if so, what are you hearing about miles driven? Because obviously, collision repair is based - a lot of it is based on the miles driven of the car.\nNick Pinchuk: Yeah. Look, I think - actually, it's not really - collision repair was better in the United States, not so good in Europe. I would say the big feature there for us was the undercar equipment, aligners in particular, but this ADAS stuff, stuff that really focuses on the neural network of the business. That's what drove that change. You're right. It was a really welcome change, double digits for the equipment. That was a turn of events that we really love. We haven't talked about a thing like that associated with equipment in a while. So that's part of the overhang that because it's a lower-margin business, that's part of the mix overhang on RS&I. But that turn, I think, based on the change in vehicle complexity now driven by the autonomy, these autonomous features, and therefore, undercar equipment was important. We're starting to see some recovery in collision in the US. Like I said, Europe seems to be dead as a door nail. The miles driven, we're seeing it start to come back. The curve looks just like other years. It's just came back from the shock of the virus. So it went down 30% year-over-year in the shock. And now it's according to BLS data - according to the data we see, it's staying around 10% below pre-COVID levels that it's inching back. I would expect, though, that as people - and that's not surprising every time you look you turn on TV, you see people feeding in from home. Once people go back, I think this all changes.\nScott Stember: Got it and just last question on flushing out the tools group, you said it was pretty much everything was up, but it sounds like hand tools and diagnostics probably led the way, if I heard correctly?\nNick Pinchuk: Yeah. Yes. Not pretty much, everything was up, but hand tools led the way. Diagnostics was strong. Power tools was nice as well. So smaller ticket items were - are ascended in this period. You can see our RI business, how the kind of sets because the guys are a little more - like I use the word, there's still an air of vigilance. They're positive. But they're a little more vigilant in this situation. So even the tool storage, they tend to be focused on the smaller purchases in the tool storage area. So that thing. But I would say that each of the - each of them, each product line had a pretty good quarter, maybe not up to the 25%, we're pretty satisfied with all the product lines, but the top one was hand tools.\nScott Stember: Got it. That's all I have. Thank you.\nNick Pinchuk: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Curtis Nagle with Bank of America. Please go ahead, sir.\nNick Pinchuk: Curt?\nCurtis Nagle: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks very much.\nNick Pinchuk: Good morning.\nCurtis Nagle: Good, how are you? Yeah, so Just a quick one on inflation, so I know you said this plenty of times that steel is only I don't know 85, 90 mil of COGS, but prices are up a good bit, pretty persistently. So anything in terms of potential price increases or rising costs relating to inputs that you would elaborate on?\nNick Pinchuk: Yeah. Look - yes, well, look, we've got material inflation in these numbers. We can't see them, can you, right. And so part of the thing is you got - you kind of got an interesting cocktail of reduced travel, controlled costs, material inflation floating through this. And the general managers in our businesses are balancing all these, like balls in the air. And so yeah, we might see some, but we're not - at the same time, we can also price. And I think the tools group has got another price increase going out. They just announced in April - early April, they announced the price increase, so they're going to have one coming up. And so we think we're the price leader and we can price for visible inflation, so you have that in the play too. So we might see some going forward where we think it's under control. I mean, this is - I think I said in another forum that this is kind of what they pay us for to manage this stuff.\nCurtis Nagle: Okay, fair enough. And then if I wasn't mistaken, did I hear that the education segment was up in 1Q?\nNick Pinchuk: Yeah.\nCurtis Nagle: So that sounds like a change. Yeah, what happened there?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, look, I think - yeah. I think everybody is anticipating the schools. I think there are some schools back. And then - but I would say the big factor, Curt is that the schools are starting to anticipate the return of the students. So they're starting to facilitate. So the education business is up principally because you're selling to the schools. And so we have a two-pronged view there. We sell to the students and the schools and we see a lot of students starting to warm up. And I think - I also think in this day and age, just starting to see, if I were sitting in a community college and I'd see the Biden administration rolling in there, and I don't think it's a political statement to reveal that he has a particular bent, given his wife's orientation and then things he said to community college technical training. And so I think that might be a positive view and created an area of optimism in the school. So I think that changed the dynamic some. It was - we're pretty pleased to see it. And in fact, again the critical industry businesses got back above the pre-COVID levels. I think that - I don't want people to miss that. We're above pre-COVID levels. And by the way, we're bearing the COVID at the same time. So I think that - and that's where C&I was. They've been going each quarter. They've been getting a little closer to 2019. This time they flipped above it. We view that as an incredibly positive event.\nCurtis Nagle: Got it, makes sense. All right, guys thanks very much. Good luck for the second quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Dave MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.\nDave MacGregor: Yes. Good morning, everyone and good morning, Nick. Congratulations - yeah, congratulations on the strong results.\nNick Pinchuk: Thanks.\nDave MacGregor: I guess first question, I'm still really struggling on this disparity between originations and the sell-through. You had indicated the sell-through was equivalent with the sell-in. So let's call it the sell-through up 25%, originations up 2.4%, which is one of the -\nNick Pinchuk: Well, wait a minute. Wait, hold it just a minute. The sell-through is equal absolute. It was a little bit better in the first quarter of last year. So when you're comparing those things, you start to get bollocks stuff a little bit. Last year wasn't as bad sell-through as it - as sell to the vans was in the first quarter. So we - but generally to come back and say - so I just want to stop you there. But in general, if you're talking about volume, the volume off the van is same as the volume on the van this quarter. Understand what I said?\nDave MacGregor: Yeah. I want to - what should we be using then as a sell-through number for this quarter?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, it's roughly the same.\nDave MacGregor: Same as the sell-in?\nNick Pinchuk: Right.\nDave MacGregor: Okay. It's a large disparity nonetheless, however you want to cut it. And I guess I'm really struggling with just kind of the nature of that given you also indicated that all the segments are up. And I guess the question just becomes given that originations generally revolve around extended credits and contract credits obviously as well, but it's bigger ticket. So I guess the question is just can you break out a big ticket for us and help us just understand what big ticket was on a year-over-year basis?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, here's what I'll tell you, is that the big-ticket items weren't up in - it weren't up like the 25%, but they were up nicely in the quarter. So they were up -\nDave MacGregor: Is it double digits?\nNick Pinchuk: No. They weren't up double digits in the quarter, but they were up. Again, when you look at the absolute numbers, they were reasonable in that situation. So we're pleased with those numbers. So you had that. And then within the big-ticket items, let's put diagnostics side, if you look at tool storage, the tool storage mix has been for a while, closer to the, let's say, carts and other things, and there's a lot more RA going on. So the franchisees are flushed with cash. So you're seeing some of those franchisees finance these items. That's really the factor. Now you could argue that - you could also argue, Dave, that we're - I think that's really what's going on. You could also see it's hard to tell this. You could see we're getting stimulus need to pay for some of those things instead of borrowing. But we kind of view that as great because as Aldo said you just got borrowing capacity out there in the future. So this is a really good thing for us. We love it when RA is up.\nDave MacGregor: Okay. Well, maybe I'll take that offline with Aldo and try and get through the math a little bit better. I wanted to ask you about - you'd indicated about just volumes on the quarter because you indicated that you'd announced in April a price increase, which I think is May 1. You've got kind of - you communicated to the franchisees that you're experiencing growing backlogs. I don't know if that's around tool steel or what may be responsible for that. But under those circumstances, my understanding is there's some pre-buy going on in the month of March. And I'm just wondering if you can quantify for us the extent to which you can just combine -\nNick Pinchuk: I think you are missing thoughts about that.\nDave MacGregor: I'm sorry?\nNick Pinchuk: I don't think that - we don't think that's true. First of all, the announcement goes out in April. So I don't think people are pre-buying. The people may be buying. Generally, what happens in these kinds of things are buying off the kickoff programs or the - even back to the kickoff program. So they're fundamentally buying off that. I'm talking to a bunch of franchisees so they keep telling me their inventories are low on this stuff. They can - they'd like to get more, but they don't get them. They don't have it. So I think this is - the idea of the pre-buy, we didn't see any of that. Now I'm not saying franchisees are what, 3,500 of them. So you can get windshield surveys on them and you can get different ones will have different views. I can probably get a hundred different opinions when I go out. But generally, we don't see that, Dave. We see the situation - they're not stock. In fact, we think we're confident that franchisees' inventories are actually down or flat at best. They're not up.\nDave MacGregor: Really? So -\nNick Pinchuk: And if you look back to the first quarter of last year, sales off the van exceeded sales to the van.\nDave MacGregor: Yeah. I find that a little surprising given everybody in the franchise world knows that there's stimulus money coming down the pipe and they want to be positioned for that. And then my understanding is you communicated to the franchisees that there was a backlog issue in March, and I would have presumed that guys would pre-buy on that. So I'm always surprised to hear that inventories on the truck are flat to slightly down, a little bit counterintuitive, I guess. And then last question for me is just on price elasticity -\nNick Pinchuk: I don't necessarily see it that way. But anyway, necessarily, they could order, but they might not have them.\nDave MacGregor: Yeah, okay.\nNick Pinchuk: Right.\nDave MacGregor: Can you just talk about -\nNick Pinchuk: So we wouldn't have a sale. What?\nDave MacGregor: Right. Okay. And then price elasticity around storage. I guess, it's - these are some pretty big increases we're seeing in steel prices right now. And as a consequence, I would expect some pretty big increases on price tags on some of the storage product at least and maybe in hand tools given what's going on with nickel alloy product. But can you just talk about how you expect that to play out over the balance of the year as you raise your prices? How vulnerable do you think that category is to higher prices given -\nNick Pinchuk: You know what, Dave? Sure. Look, I think it gets to be a complex question, David, because almost everything is - there's a lot of promotions floating through the system. So it's not just the list price increases. It's also what are your promotions and so on. So we've never had a problem, tool storage or otherwise in terms of getting or matching inflation. We've never seen that. So I can only tell you what is in history. And it's a complex cocktail. You raise the list price. You adjust your promotions. You have long-term promotions, you have drop in promotions. It's a dizzying array of those things. And what comes out the other end is a matching of the inflation. So generally, you feel we can do that on a macro basis. And you can't do that unless you do it until storage and hand tools.\nDave MacGregor: Great. I'm more focused around the mechanics capacity to purchase and their purchasing power and these products just maybe finding themselves a little bit of reach. You're not concerned about that right now? You're not getting an indication that -\nNick Pinchuk: All right. We don't see that being a problem right now and there was inflation in this period. So I mean the thing is we don't see that being a problem now. Of course, you can't say it'd go on forever. But I think the - look, I think the whole thing is this. The mechanics seem to love to buy tools. It's one of the top things on their priorities. I think that these kinds of changes don't necessarily make a difference. Now who's to say how the inflation would play out across the country in a lot of different commodities, but I think - I would tell you this, I think we would be going to be one of the last to be affected by it.\nDave MacGregor: Great, if I could, just for the model, two quick ones. What was the U.S. versus international in terms of growth and -\nNick Pinchuk: About the same, it's about the same.\nDave MacGregor: And, secondly, what percentage of trucks now are to associates and how has that changed year over year?\nNick Pinchuk: It's about the same. It's up a little bit. It's in the 20% to 25% range.\nDave MacGregor: Okay. Thanks very much, gentlemen.\nNick Pinchuk: Sure.\nOperator: And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. Ms. Verbsky, at this time, I would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.\nSara Verbsky: Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day.\nOperator: And this concludes today's call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Nick Pinchuk",
            "content": "Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I'll start the call by covering the highlights of our first quarter and along the way, I'll give you my perspective on our results, they are encouraging, on our markets they're standing firm and, on our progress, it's made us stronger than ever before. And we'll also speak about what it all means. We believe it means we're getting better and better position for more even while we're still in the midst of a once in a 100-year pandemic. After all that Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. We believe our first quarter is clear confirmation of Snap-on's ability to continue its trajectory of positive results, further accommodating to the virus environment, overcoming periods of period variations from business-to-business, dealing with macroeconomic headwinds and advancing along our runways for both growth and improvement. Our reported sales in the quarter of $1.246 billion were up 20.2%, including 19.2 million a favorable foreign exchange and 11.3 million of acquisition related sales. Organic sales growth was 16.3% gains in every group. It's our third straight, straight quarter of being above our pre-pandemic levels and ongoing contributions from our Strap-on value creation processes. The principles we use every day safety quality, customer connection, innovation, and rapid continuous improvement or RCI. They all combine to drive that progress, progress there was. OpCo operating income of 200.9 9 million was up 62 million from last year, which included 7.5 million of restructuring charges. OpCo operating margin was 19.6% up from the 2020 level of 16.3% or 17.2% as adjusted for restructuring. For financial services, operating income of 65.3 million increased 14.8% and the delinquencies were down even in the midst of a pandemic stress test during a commercial trial of what we would call extraordinary proportion. And that results combined with OpCo for a consolidated operating margin of 23.9% a 300 basis point improvement as reported and up 220 basis points as adjusted. First Quarter EPS was $3.50 up 40.6% from last year's 240 and exploding the 2020 restructuring charges EPS grew 34.6%. I said it before and I'll say it again. We believe Snap-on's stronger now than when we entered the great weathering. And we also believe that our first quarter results testify to just that, especially when we compare them to 2019 before the virus, so let's do that. Versus 2019, our sales in the past quarter grew 102.9 million or 11.2% that reflects 15.3 million of acquisition related sales, 11.6 million a favorable foreign currency and a $76 million or 8.1% economic gain. The 2021 OpCo operating margin of 19.6% was up 50 basis points from 2019 level as adjusted for a legal settlement in that earlier period. And that 50 point gain was achieved against 80 points of unfavorable currency and acquisition impacts, all while still absorbing the COVID. Now to our markets, auto repair remains quite resilient, the technicians are rolling. They know they've weathered the depths of the COVID shock and have learned to accommodate the virus environment and are moving to psychological recovery. There's still some air of vigilance. But their activities are robust. And they know they won't be shocked again by a spike. They're quite positive regarding the future of driving as people pivot from shared mobility to individual transportation. And it's - vehicle repair with the technicians is a strong and resilient market. You can hear it, you can hear it in our franchisees voices, and you can see it written clearly across our double-digit numbers. Also on auto repair, there are shop owners and managers. There are signs that the auto business is rising. Demand for new cars is high but dealership repair and maintenance and warranty is still attenuated. So there is a gradual gain, and we're positioned to take advantage with a broader and stronger product line with innovations like our TRITON-D10 diagnostics and new acquisitions like Dealer-FX, putting us deeper into dealerships than ever before, and providing us a clearer view of the future repair trends, new technologies and evolving vehicle platforms. Dealer-FX puts us at the right place at the right time as thing change. Finally, let's talk about critical industries, where Snap-on rules out of the garage solving tasks of consequence. This is where C&I operates the most international of our operations and these are the customers that have been most impacted by the virus. They're slower to accommodate and to recover, but they have been recovering. And in the quarter the results showed that trend, despite some significant headwinds, including the continuing impact of the virus, the February freeze in Texas, some challenged business sectors like oil and gas, and troubled geographies, like Southeast Asia. Despite that variation, we did see growth in critical industries, improvement in a number of areas in aviation, in education, in heavy duty fleet. They all combined to overcome the continuing turbulence in natural resources. Also in C&I, SNA Europe, another quarter of double-digit growth, with broad strength across the geographies in places like France, Spain, Italy, Germany, and the Nordic Region and from our Asia Pacific division, up double digits as well with solid increases in key countries like China and India and Japan. So overall, I describe our C&I markets is improving and representing clear opportunity, and coupled with our auto repair related businesses, we believe there's clear overall progress along our runways for growth, enhancing the van network, expanding to repair shop owners and managers, extended critical industries and building in emerging markets, leveraging our broadening product line, wielding or strengthening brand, and deploying the increasing understanding of the work that is the hallmark of Snap-on people, even in the throes of the pandemic shock. About a year ago as we entered the virus, we recognized the resilience of our markets and the strength of our model, projecting a B recovery. And that's how it played out. You can see it in the results. So now let's turn to the segments and discuss those results. In the C&I group on a reported basis, including 9.2 million favorable foreign currency translation, and 7.3 million of acquisition related sales, first Quarter volume rose 15.3% compared to last year. Organic sales were up 9.5%. Double digit growth in our European hand tool business and a mid-single digit rise in critical industries led the way. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income of 50.7 million including 1.4 million of unfavorable currency represents a rise of 19.2 million compared to the 31.5 million registered in 2020, which included 4.4 million of restructuring. That all means on an adjusted basis an adjusted increase of over 40% and as adjusted increase of over 40% and the operating margin was 14.7% and as reported increase of 420 basis points, and 290 as adjusted. Now, when compared with 2019, the pandemic free measuring stick sales were up 7.2% and that includes 10 million or 3.1% organic gain, 8 million of acquisitions and 5.2 million for favorable foreign currency. Once again C&I demonstrated sequential improvement. If you go back and look at those numbers, they keep getting closer and closer and now they're above pre-pandemic levels. Despite the ongoing uncertainty, it's one of the things I think we want to remember the virus isn't gone and was still bearing it and we didn't have it in 2019 and C&I is above that level. As part of the trend, we remain committed to extending in critical industries. That's the C&I sweet spot. So we'll keep strengthening our position to capture those opportunities as they arise. And enabling that attempt intent is our expanding lineup of innovative new products developed specially to make critical work easier. One example is our CT9010 3 inches drive 18 volt brushless impact wrench, the newest member of our MonsterLithium family, aimed at tight spaces, sustained power, rugged durability, and precise control. The 9010 features 320 pound feet of bolt break-away torque and 240 pound feet of working torque all the power of technician needs when they're working in confirmed quarters. It offers a variable speed trigger and three speed selections in forward and reverse. That means greater control adaptable to any applications and no over torquing important. The 9010 advanced design also reduces motor temperature rise to delivering higher durability and great power to weight ratio. It's managed fitted with a 100 lumen headlight that helps technicians work in dark environments. Just what's needed for those close jobs. And the 18volt battery with the five amp hours ensures consistent output and extended run time, which translates to less charging and more efficient work day. And all this comes and this is the best part I think, all of this comes in an extremely compact size or only six and three quarter inches in overall length that will fit into the tightest of work space. The ct 9010 is a great tool. It's had strong demand, and it's already one of our $1 million hit products. I don't want to leave C&I without mentioning SNA Europe. Double digit sales growth again, progress by the overall tool management system, expanding product customization to the needs of the task, driving progress across - against the twin headwinds of a difficult COVID environment. Europe is not so easy these days and the uncertainty of Brexit, no small feat. Well that's C&I, continuing the sequential improvement and position for more. Now onto the tools group, sales a 478.3 million up 102.4 million including 6.7 million of favorable currency and a 95.7 million or 25% organic gain, double digit growth both in the US in the international operations, the operating margin was 20.7%. Yes, 20.7% up 780 basis points, compared with pre-virus to 2019, tools group sales grew 68.1 million, 16.6% including 5.2 million favorable currency translation and 62.9 million or 15.1% organic gain. And this year's 20.7 operating margin was up 430 basis points compared with pre-pandemic 2019. The tools group is responding to the challenges of the day, increasing its product advantage, fortifying its brands and further enabling its franchisees and the results show it. We do believe our runway for coherent growth enhancing the franchise. Franchise network represents a continuing opportunity and there's evidence that we're realizing some of that potential across the van channel in our franchisee metrics, the financial and physical indicators that we monitor closely. Again this quarter they remain clearly favorable. And based on those metrics, we believe the franchisees have never been stronger. And they say so in our direct interactions at events like this past January's kickoff meeting held this year at a distance. It was a great affair. Well attended strong orders, visible commitment to our brand, watch parties all over the country. I zoomed into several myself and they were brimming with enthusiasm and optimism. Our franchisees, entrepreneurs and professionals all are pumped, confident and reaching higher. The tools group quarter, that's a strong advantage for us. The tools group quarter was also marked with Snap-on value creation, customer connection and innovation. Offering new products sometimes just an improvement on an established line, but clearly making work easier solving problems, delivering productivity gains. All of these are born out of observing the changing work in shops on an everyday basis. We're in those shops every day. We watch the work. We offer the products. One such add is our KERN681, 7-Drawer Single Bank EPIQ Series Roll Cab, configured entirely with extra wide 62 inch drawers, greater flexibility and capacity and a standard footprint making the most of limited shop space. Our franchisees are already calling it uninterrupted storage. It's the first large capacity roll cab paired with a full complement of extra wide drawers in the industry. To me Algona, Iowa plant I saw some of being made there just last month and the local team is proud of them. It comes with two swivel and two rigid casters located right on the corners of the box, doesn't seem like much of a change. But that's a clever innovation that provides mobility and tight spaces while also greatly enhancing box stability. That's a very important feature for a high capacity unit. The KERN681 epic strength, styling and styling 8000 pounds of low capacity and more than 45,000 cubic inches of storage space. The franchisees are saying it's been a clear hit and they're right. We spent some time over several quarters working to expand franchisees selling capacity, harnessing social media, improving product training, and RCI and van operations. So that's paid off, selling capacity is up, and you can see it clearly in the three straight gangbusters quarters for our tools group. I don't need to say any more about them. Now let's speak about RS&I, first quarter organic sales rose 7.6% with varying gains across the board. Undercar equipment coming back delivering double digit rise, diagnostics and information products, independent repair shops growing at mid single digits and the business focused on OEM dealerships, advancing low single digits. Operating earnings of 81.4 million, including 1.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased 4.1 million from 2020, which included 3.1 million of restructuring costs. Compared with 2019 sales grew 19.7 million or 6% including 10 million or 3.1% organic gain, 7.3 million from acquisitions and 2.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency. We clearly see the potential and a runway for growth in the RS&I group expanding Snap-on's presence in the garage with coherent acquisitions and a growing line of powerful products. RSI's organic growth in the quarter was broad based, but the double digit rise in undercar equipment was especially welcome turn and was led by innovative products like our newly introduced Tru-Point ADAS calibration system. Advanced driver assistance systems or ADAS are active and passive aids to keep vehicle passengers safe, things like collision avoidance, lane departure warnings, automatic parking and crosswind stabilization. These new features are great. But what's really music to our ears is that they require periodic calibrations to make sure they're working with precision and calibrations can be complicated. Sensors and cameras vary considerably across vehicle makes and models and if you get a faulty recalibration, it leads to rework and it's not good for safety. So our new John Bean 2.8 ADAS calibration system is the fix, making sure the vehicle is physically aligned correctly, guiding calibration of the sensors and documenting that the procedure was performed - formed appropriately. And it does so for the multitude of makes and models seen regularly in OEM and aftermarket shops. The new Tru-Point is easy to use. It requires minimal training. It compensates for the floor regularities that are so common in garages and big devils alignment and calibration is quick and efficient. And it's OEM compliance. It's a powerful product right in the crosshairs of automated vehicle technology that's so prominent today. Progress in diagnostics and information with independent repair shop owners and managers was also clearly evident in our diagnostics business and our RS&I activity. And in this quarter, the launch of the new Triton d 10 hand belt helped both of that positive. The new TRITON is ultra fast, a two second boot up and it has a best in class 10 inch touchscreen. It's geared to the more capable technician offering a one touch full diagnostic code scan, scope capabilities for performance display, and guided testing of suspect components that you may want to replace. But you want to make sure that there's a problem. It's loaded with our Fast-Track Intelligent Diagnostics rooted in our proprietary database of over 200 billion vehicle events a Snap-on only feature that enables quick and accurate diagnosis of even the most difficult and unusual repairs, ensuring an efficient and effective solution for those very, very time-consuming problems. Just what the capable and senior technician needs. Now, as I've said before, we've spent considerable effort working to help franchisees sell the complex tools of today efficiently and it's paying off with TTITON. Each of our franchisees received a demonstration unit, facilitating the hands-on training guided by the video presentations that were a prominent part of our networks February sales meetings. Following that initial instructions, a demo unit could then be put immediately in the hands of a technician to physically showcase the great benefits of our powerful new tool and it worked. The launch has been a success. Our franchisees are comfortable selling new and complex tool and many are now calling the TRITON-D10 the best diagnostic unit ever. Finally, RS&I got a nice boost in the quarter. As often is the case by the new tech - by new technologies and OEM dealerships helped by some significant essential tools and equipment programs supporting the new electric vehicle launches. We're quite positive about RS&I's future repair shop owners and managers as the vehicle industry evolves. It plays to our strength. So that's the highlights of the quarter, continued and strong progress. Our third straight period exceeding pre-pandemic levels, C&I, sequential improvement, sequential advancement, RS&I solid, the tools group strong and prompt, organic sales rising 16.3%, OpCo operating margin 19.6%, EPS $3.50 a big rise and most important. Most important, more testimony that Snap-on has emerged from the turbulence much stronger than when we entered. It was an encouraging quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Thanks Aldo. Well, that's our first quarter, another encouraging period, resilient markets through the shock and on the way to psychological recovery, the third straight quarter of upward trajectory, clear year-over-year achievement, and the third straight quarter of results exceeding the pre-pandemic levels of 2019. RS&I sales continuing upward with a wide margins of 23.4% attenuated, but still strong. CNI, ongoing sequential growth across the world. And OI margins 14.7% up nicely, even from 2019. And then the tools group, sales up organically 25% versus 2020 up in all product lines and in all geographies, volume up 15.1% versus 2019 and an OI margin of 20.7%. Finally, financial services in the midst of the greatest stress test profits up delinquencies down, rock solid, and they all came together with Snap-on sales rising organically 16.3% versus 2020 and 8.1% versus '19. OI margin 19.6% up significantly despite the virus, the unfavorable currency and the acquisition impacts and the EPS $3.50 a substantial rise versus both 2020 and 2019. We do believe that Snap-on has abundant opportunity as the COVID recedes and the world shifts away from the cities and away from shared transportation and as new vehicle technologies make the car park more complex. And we further believe that we are stronger today than when we entered the storm. Our advantages of product, brand and people are even greater. And we're in a favorable position to wield those strengths, realize the opportunities and continue our positive trajectory throughout 2021 and beyond. Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. Many are listening. I want you to know that your work in this weathering has made a difference to our company and to our society. For your efforts in keeping our world and its critical mobility intact, you have my admiration. For your contribution to our progress in this first quarter, you have my congratulations. And for your unfailing dedication to our team in both smooth and turbulent times, you have my thanks. Now we'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Good morning Gary, Yeah, I think there's a couple of things, I think one, this isn't a tool storage and that it was a much more focused growth. We introduced the - certainly the first thing is when we had that rise, we introduced the Rock N' Roll Cabs and the Techno's, which really focused on more or less a particular product line. This was a - this is a broader thing, much more rooted in kind of agnostic process from a product point of view of expanding the capabilities of the tools - of the franchisees. We harness social media better, we're training them better to get the elevator pitch down, and we RCI their vans, or we worked on this for quarters before maybe even in 2019. And we worked really hard in the COVID, because we had time to focus on it. And that's really paying off. It's showing that these franchisees can hit this 20%. The other thing is, I think we got some good products, particularly around hand tools. We package the hand tools, so we're selling not only individual tools, but also kits aimed at a particular problem, and they're becoming pretty profitable, popular. We didn't talk about them on the call. I mean things like putting together a set of sockets that are for particular applications in foam. They're wildly popular. And then the other products we have in terms of tool storage and diagnostics. They're really baffled and that's driving that that broad appeal. And then the final thing, I think you could think, look, there's a lot of this condition, you could - people might say this is recovery, but the sales off the van over last year exceeded the sales to the van, so you wouldn't think there'd be recovery in that. Not so much recovery in that situation. It's going off the van at the same level. The whole year was up. And same things happening this quarter, sales up the van is the same as we're selling to them. So you look at this, you might say it's a stimulus and the stimulus could be helping us this way. We don't know, when you're talking to technicians and people in a practice stimulus seems to be always going into bank accounts or paying off debt. And the other thing about it is, by the way, we think it's product and process based because the international business, UK, Australia and Canada are up and a regional stimulus is there. Yeah, they tend to be - they're in I would say maybe in the double digit percentage of the dealerships, but they tend to be concentrated in a couple of OEMs. And so there's a lot of whitespace to grow in that situation. We see that tremendous opportunity. And the other thing about Dealer-FX, I think we talked about this in the acquisition, they're just now sort of rolling out this new - their updated system that was ready to go, but the COVID hit. So now they get the chance sight at the apple with full force. But again, these are things we knew when we acquired them. It's early days, we've only owned them for a couple months. So we're still getting on, but we're pretty confident we're in the right place at the right time like I said in my comments. Yeah, they're going to be in RS&I. Yeah, because they're going to sell to dealers, we see them as sort of like the advanced warning net for us from a strategic point of view. You remember the old do line, I used to be across Canada, to make sure we figured out what the Russia bombers were doing when they're coming over the goal - over the North. So this is the same kind of thing. Well, those things are particular to a particular vehicle. We have a business. We call the EQS business that really is rooted in new technology. When new technologies roll out, or one of the people, the OEMs come to, to say, hey, put together a set of tools. Now in one of these, we have a 70 unit toolset that we provide that supports a certain new vehicle that's coming out. So I mean, that's, that's one of the things and so - and yet there's another one for another new vehicle. So as people roll out new vehicles, they commission these kinds of things to facilitate the dealerships to be ready to deal with it. And then everybody figures out what other things might happen and that shows up and we launched other tools to match that that the OEMs didn't even anticipate going forward. Those are the kinds of things. And we have a set of tools. We have a standard set of tools for electrics that are what we call insulating tools with glass infused nylon that allows us to - technician to use them safely against - and be approved against some pretty high voltages and so that's sockets and pliers and screwdrivers and kits to disconnect the electric vehicle safely and that kind of thing. Yeah. Sure. They're rooted - they're pretty much agnostic to the power train. They're more or less having to do with the sensors - the neural net of the sensors around the vehicle. Sure. Good morning. Well, the thing is that we have visibility into the new platforms. We are franchisees, which visit the dealers every day. So they tend to have a look at the, what I would call the more persnickety problems that arise all the time associated with vehicles that no one ever anticipated. The Dealer-FX is the repair shop management software. So you get to see what's happening in an aggregate kind of like databases to look at this kind of thing and say, okay, well, they're having a lot of problems here, they're having a lot of problems there. And you get to understand the difficulties associated with that. So it's not so much an observational thing it's a computational thing. Those are the kinds of things that help. So it just adds to our position. And then we also have a non-peril position in the repair shops afterwards, after vehicles age, and they end up in independent repair shops, which is what you're referring to. We're in more shops for more hours in days. And that's what drives our product line. So when new technologies show in whether you're talking about automated vehicles or electric vehicles, they're going to roll through this, we're going to see them via Deale-FX probably first, then we're going to see them via the franchisees that call on dealerships to understand the nuances of some smaller and more difficult problems that are harder to predict via just maybe the bigger problems, the 20,000 foot problems that the software might see. And then as they roll into the aftermarket, we have probably almost proprietary visibility on that. That's what generates our proprietary databases that I talked about 200 billion repair records. Well, that I don't know. You know what I mean? I don't know that. All I know, is they can go that high. You know what I mean? We now approved, it's sort of like a stress test. We know they can go that high. And they're not complaining. I had a franchisee telling me, I asked him about something about his market. I asked him about what is the market like and so on? He says, I don't know, I'm too busy selling tools. So he's out there now. He didn't say he didn't have more capacity, because he was asking me for more units. So in other words, he was short of a particular product line. So he thought he could sell them more. So we think they probably have a little more upside. But in this kind of situation, Chris, you'd have to keep pounding. We'd say okay, we got to keep working on expanding the capabilities because no matter where they are, you want more when you go forward, right. Sure. What happens is - just one question. What happens is you observe what's happening at a certain throughput level and that reveals the pinch points and you work on that. Good morning. Yeah, look, I think one of the things we're seeing is our third quarter - third month was higher in this period, but they're, they're almost always higher a little bit, if you look at this. So I would say, we would have said that adjusted for what we expect. The sales were about level through the quarter kind of constant. Generally we have our own sort of like, view of what's going to happen when you roll out of the beginning in first quarter for example, and so we have some view, but this generally seemed about we expected. We weren't surprised by any month in this quarter, I would say. So I think - we think it's kind of held strong each quarter. I don't see attenuation, if that's what you're asking. Yeah, Nick. I don't - we didn't see any attenuation. Well, yes. I mean, the thing is sure. Look, we like change. Like we said, I think we've said the house come home, that changes our friend and we love to have it. And the earlier we can see change, the more we can, as you say, call in the air strikes about investment and so on. And so the Dealer-FX acquisition was about positioning ourselves at the forefront at the vanguard, if you will, of new technologies, not just electric vehicles, but new technologies that would impinge on the car park. So that's what we're doing. And so we'll continue to look at that in terms of, okay, what do we learn from that, how can we invest in other places to follow that change. But make no mistake about it. The revelations occur in each aging of the vehicle, so things change as you roll out. When the vehicle rolls in, people think this is what's needed. And then a couple of years go by and we see that these are what's needed. And some of it isn't even - this is what I was trying to say before is some of it isn't the fact that you have to repair, let's say, a particular item or you have to recalibrate the sensors. It might be revealed to us in the difficulty of doing those products - those processes, which everybody - first, you understand you got to do it and then you realize, wait a minute. On these particular vehicles, you need special tools just to do them because they're configured in an odd way. This is - and we learned that as it went through. And so basically, we see ourselves this electric vehicle, the EV, the new technologies. It's just the version of what's happened before, only maybe hopefully at a faster pace, which gives us more to sell. And so our activities will be to try to anticipate those changes more quickly, invest in them and then enjoy. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Look, I think - actually, it's not really - collision repair was better in the United States, not so good in Europe. I would say the big feature there for us was the undercar equipment, aligners in particular, but this ADAS stuff, stuff that really focuses on the neural network of the business. That's what drove that change. You're right. It was a really welcome change, double digits for the equipment. That was a turn of events that we really love. We haven't talked about a thing like that associated with equipment in a while. So that's part of the overhang that because it's a lower-margin business, that's part of the mix overhang on RS&I. But that turn, I think, based on the change in vehicle complexity now driven by the autonomy, these autonomous features, and therefore, undercar equipment was important. We're starting to see some recovery in collision in the US. Like I said, Europe seems to be dead as a door nail. The miles driven, we're seeing it start to come back. The curve looks just like other years. It's just came back from the shock of the virus. So it went down 30% year-over-year in the shock. And now it's according to BLS data - according to the data we see, it's staying around 10% below pre-COVID levels that it's inching back. I would expect, though, that as people - and that's not surprising every time you look you turn on TV, you see people feeding in from home. Once people go back, I think this all changes. Yeah. Yes. Not pretty much, everything was up, but hand tools led the way. Diagnostics was strong. Power tools was nice as well. So smaller ticket items were - are ascended in this period. You can see our RI business, how the kind of sets because the guys are a little more - like I use the word, there's still an air of vigilance. They're positive. But they're a little more vigilant in this situation. So even the tool storage, they tend to be focused on the smaller purchases in the tool storage area. So that thing. But I would say that each of the - each of them, each product line had a pretty good quarter, maybe not up to the 25%, we're pretty satisfied with all the product lines, but the top one was hand tools. Okay, thank you. Curt? Good morning. Yeah. Look - yes, well, look, we've got material inflation in these numbers. We can't see them, can you, right. And so part of the thing is you got - you kind of got an interesting cocktail of reduced travel, controlled costs, material inflation floating through this. And the general managers in our businesses are balancing all these, like balls in the air. And so yeah, we might see some, but we're not - at the same time, we can also price. And I think the tools group has got another price increase going out. They just announced in April - early April, they announced the price increase, so they're going to have one coming up. And so we think we're the price leader and we can price for visible inflation, so you have that in the play too. So we might see some going forward where we think it's under control. I mean, this is - I think I said in another forum that this is kind of what they pay us for to manage this stuff. Yeah. Well, look, I think - yeah. I think everybody is anticipating the schools. I think there are some schools back. And then - but I would say the big factor, Curt is that the schools are starting to anticipate the return of the students. So they're starting to facilitate. So the education business is up principally because you're selling to the schools. And so we have a two-pronged view there. We sell to the students and the schools and we see a lot of students starting to warm up. And I think - I also think in this day and age, just starting to see, if I were sitting in a community college and I'd see the Biden administration rolling in there, and I don't think it's a political statement to reveal that he has a particular bent, given his wife's orientation and then things he said to community college technical training. And so I think that might be a positive view and created an area of optimism in the school. So I think that changed the dynamic some. It was - we're pretty pleased to see it. And in fact, again the critical industry businesses got back above the pre-COVID levels. I think that - I don't want people to miss that. We're above pre-COVID levels. And by the way, we're bearing the COVID at the same time. So I think that - and that's where C&I was. They've been going each quarter. They've been getting a little closer to 2019. This time they flipped above it. We view that as an incredibly positive event. Thanks. Well, wait a minute. Wait, hold it just a minute. The sell-through is equal absolute. It was a little bit better in the first quarter of last year. So when you're comparing those things, you start to get bollocks stuff a little bit. Last year wasn't as bad sell-through as it - as sell to the vans was in the first quarter. So we - but generally to come back and say - so I just want to stop you there. But in general, if you're talking about volume, the volume off the van is same as the volume on the van this quarter. Understand what I said? Well, it's roughly the same. Right. Well, here's what I'll tell you, is that the big-ticket items weren't up in - it weren't up like the 25%, but they were up nicely in the quarter. So they were up - No. They weren't up double digits in the quarter, but they were up. Again, when you look at the absolute numbers, they were reasonable in that situation. So we're pleased with those numbers. So you had that. And then within the big-ticket items, let's put diagnostics side, if you look at tool storage, the tool storage mix has been for a while, closer to the, let's say, carts and other things, and there's a lot more RA going on. So the franchisees are flushed with cash. So you're seeing some of those franchisees finance these items. That's really the factor. Now you could argue that - you could also argue, Dave, that we're - I think that's really what's going on. You could also see it's hard to tell this. You could see we're getting stimulus need to pay for some of those things instead of borrowing. But we kind of view that as great because as Aldo said you just got borrowing capacity out there in the future. So this is a really good thing for us. We love it when RA is up. I think you are missing thoughts about that. I don't think that - we don't think that's true. First of all, the announcement goes out in April. So I don't think people are pre-buying. The people may be buying. Generally, what happens in these kinds of things are buying off the kickoff programs or the - even back to the kickoff program. So they're fundamentally buying off that. I'm talking to a bunch of franchisees so they keep telling me their inventories are low on this stuff. They can - they'd like to get more, but they don't get them. They don't have it. So I think this is - the idea of the pre-buy, we didn't see any of that. Now I'm not saying franchisees are what, 3,500 of them. So you can get windshield surveys on them and you can get different ones will have different views. I can probably get a hundred different opinions when I go out. But generally, we don't see that, Dave. We see the situation - they're not stock. In fact, we think we're confident that franchisees' inventories are actually down or flat at best. They're not up. And if you look back to the first quarter of last year, sales off the van exceeded sales to the van. I don't necessarily see it that way. But anyway, necessarily, they could order, but they might not have them. Right. So we wouldn't have a sale. What? You know what, Dave? Sure. Look, I think it gets to be a complex question, David, because almost everything is - there's a lot of promotions floating through the system. So it's not just the list price increases. It's also what are your promotions and so on. So we've never had a problem, tool storage or otherwise in terms of getting or matching inflation. We've never seen that. So I can only tell you what is in history. And it's a complex cocktail. You raise the list price. You adjust your promotions. You have long-term promotions, you have drop in promotions. It's a dizzying array of those things. And what comes out the other end is a matching of the inflation. So generally, you feel we can do that on a macro basis. And you can't do that unless you do it until storage and hand tools. All right. We don't see that being a problem right now and there was inflation in this period. So I mean the thing is we don't see that being a problem now. Of course, you can't say it'd go on forever. But I think the - look, I think the whole thing is this. The mechanics seem to love to buy tools. It's one of the top things on their priorities. I think that these kinds of changes don't necessarily make a difference. Now who's to say how the inflation would play out across the country in a lot of different commodities, but I think - I would tell you this, I think we would be going to be one of the last to be affected by it. About the same, it's about the same. It's about the same. It's up a little bit. It's in the 20% to 25% range. Sure."

            "content": "Thanks Nick. Our consolidated operating results is summarized on Slide 6. The first quarter of 2021 exhibited robust financial performance, particularly as compared to last year when we experienced initial shock of the virus. The quarter's results also compared favorably with the first quarter of 2019, which being a pre-pandemic time period may serve to be the more meaningful baseline. Net sales of $1.246 billion in the quarter increased 20.2% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 16.3% organic sales again, $11.3 million of acquisition related sales and $19.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Additionally, net sales in the period increased 11.2% from $921.7 million in the first quarter of 2019, including an 8.1% organic gain, $15.3 million of acquisition related sales and $11.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation Consolidated gross margin of 50.1% compared to 49.5% last year, which included 60 basis points from restructuring costs. The gross margin contributions from the higher sales volumes of benefit from the company's RCI initiatives were offset by 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 30.5% improved 270 basis points from 33.2% last year, which included 30 basis points from restructuring costs. The improvements primarily reflect the impact of higher sales and cost containment actions, partially offset by higher stock-based cost and 30 basis points of operating expenses related to acquisitions. Operating earnings before financial services of $200.9 million, compared to $138.9 million in 2020, reflecting a 44.6% year-over-year improvement. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 19.6% improved 330 basis points from 16.3% last year, which included 90 basis points for restructuring costs. Financial services revenues of $88.6 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to $85.9 million last year, while operating earnings of $65.3 million increased $8.4 million from 2020 levels, principally due to the higher revenue as well as lower provisions for credit losses. Last year's provisions included a $2.6 million charge for higher reserves resulting from the economic uncertainty caused by COVID-19. Consolidated operating earnings of $266.2 million increased 36% from $195.8 billion last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 23.9% compared to 20.9% in 2020, which included 80 basis points from restructuring costs. Excluding the restructuring costs operating earnings margin in 2021 increased 220 basis points from last year. Our first quarter effective income tax rate is 23.5% compared to 24.2% last year, which included a 10 basis point increase related to the prior year quarter's restructuring charges. Finally, net earnings of $192.6 million or $3.50 per diluted share increased $55.4 million, or $1.01 per share from 2020 levels representing a 40.6% increase in diluted earnings per share. Additionally, net earnings increased $14.7 million or $0.34 per share from 2019 levels representing a 10.8% increase in diluted earnings per share. Net earnings in 2020 included restructuring charges of $6 million after tax, or $0.11 per diluted share and net earnings in 2019 included a benefit of $8.7 million after tax or $0.15 per diluted share from a legal settlement. Excluding these items, diluted earnings per share of 350 in 2021, increased 34.6% from 2020 and 16.3% from 2019 levels. Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I group on Slide 7, sales of $345.7 million increase 15.3% from $299.9 million last year, reflecting a 9.5% organic sales gain, $7.3 million of acquisition related sales and $9.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain includes double digit increases in the segment's European based hand tools business and the Asia Pacific operations, as well as a mid single digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries. Improvements in year-over-year sales growth were widely seen across Europe as well as in most emerging markets. Additionally, within critical industries, strong sales gains were achieved in aviation, heavy duty and technical education. While year-over-year declines in the natural resources sector improved from those experienced in the fourth quarter of 2020, but continue to lag pre-pandemic sales levels. As a further comparison, net sales in the period increased 7.2% from 2019 levels, representing a 3.1% organic sales gain, $8 million of acquisition related sales and $5.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Gross Margin of 38.7% improved 190 basis points from 36.8% in the first quarter of 2020, which included 150 basis points from restructuring charges. Aside from the improvements resulting from the lower restructuring cost, contributions from higher sales volumes were partially offset by 70 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 24% improved 230 basis points as compared to last year, primarily as a result of the higher volumes and savings from cost containment actions. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $50.7 million, including $1.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $31.5 million last year, the operating margin of 14.7% compared to 10.5% a year ago. Turning now to Slide 8, sales in the Snap-on tools group of $478.3 million, increased 27.2% from $375.9 million in 2020 reflecting a 25% organic sales gain and $6.7 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increased reflects double digit gains in both our US and international operations. Net sales in the period increased 16.6% from $410.2 million in the first quarter of 2019, reflecting a 15.1% organic sales gain, and $5.2 million a favorable foreign currency translation. Gross Margin of 45.9% in the quarter improved 320 basis points from last year, primarily due to the higher sales volumes and benefits from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 25.2%, improved from 29.8% last year, primarily due to the higher sales volumes and savings from cost containment action. Operating earnings for the Snap-on tools group of $98.9 million, compared to $48.6 million last year. The operating margin of 20.7% compared to 12.9% a year ago an increase of 780 basis points. Turning to the RS&I group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $347.6 million compared to $314.6 million a year ago, reflecting a 7.6% organic sales gain, $4 million of acquisition related sales and $4.8 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase includes the double-digit gain and sales of undercar equipment, mid single digit increases in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers and a low single digit gain and activity with OEM dealerships. As compared to 2019 levels, net sales increased 6% reflecting a 3.1% organic sales gain, $7.3 million of acquisition related sales and $2.3 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Gross Margin of 46% declined from 47.9% last year, primarily due to the impact of higher sales and lower gross margin businesses and 70 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. As a reminder undercar equipment as well as facilitation program related activity, both of which had healthy sales increases in the quarter typically have a gross margin rate that is below the RS&I segments average. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales 22.6% improved 70 basis points from 23.3% last year, which included 80 basis points of restructuring costs. Excluding the effects of restructuring benefits from the higher sales volumes were more than offset by 80 basis points of operating expenses related to acquisitions. Operating earnings for the RS&I group of $81.4 million compared to $77.3 million last year. The operating margin of 23.4% compared to 24.6% a year ago. Now turning to Slide 10, revenue from financial services of $88.6 million, compared to $85.9 million last year. Financial services operating earnings of $65.3 million, compared to $56.9 million in 2020. Financial services expenses of $23.3 million decreased to $5.7 million from 2020 levels, primarily due to lower provisions for credit losses, resulting from $2.4 million of lower year-over-year net loan charge offs and the absence of the previously mentioned first quarter 2020 $2.6 million charge. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1.1% and 1.4% in the first quarters of 2021 and 2020 respectively. In the first quarter the average yield on finance receivables of 17.6% in 2021, compared to 17.7% in 2020. The respective average yield on contract receivables was 8.4% and 9.0%. The lower yield on contract receivables in 2021 includes the impact of lower interest business operations support loans for our franchisees. These loans were offered during the second quarter of 2020 to help accommodate franchisee operations and dealing with the COVID-19 environment. As of the end of the first quarter, approximately $11 million of these business operating support loans remained outstanding. Total loan originations of $261.8 million in the first quarter increased $6.2 million or 2.4% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 1.7% increase in originations and finance receivables. While originations of contract receivables were up 5.7%. Moving to Slide 11, our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our US operation. Our worldwide gross financial services portfolio decreased $25.8 million in the first quarter, primarily due to an increase in net collections. The 60 day plus delinquency rate of 1.6% for the United States extended credit is down 10 basis points from the first quarter last year and down 20 basis points as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. We believe this reflects the typical seasonal delinquency pattern that customarily results in a decline in the first quarter, followed by increases later in the year, usually peaking in the fourth quarter, where we compete with the technicians' holiday related discretionary spending. As it relates to extending credit, or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $43.9 million represented 2.55% of outstandings at quarter end, down seven basis points sequentially, and down 44 basis points as compared to the same period last year. Now turning to Slide 12, cash provided by operating activities of $319.3 million in the quarter increased $105.9 million from comparable 2020 levels, primarily reflecting the higher net earnings and net changes in operating assets and liabilities including a $32.1 million decrease in inventory. Net cash used by investing activities of $207.2 million included $200 million for the acquisition of Dealer-FX and capital expenditures of $19.3 million partially offset by net collections of finance receivables of $12.1 million. Free cash flow during the quarter of $312.1 million was 158% in relation to net earnings. Net cash used by financing activities of $131 million, included cash dividends of 66.7 million and the repurchase of 722,000 shares of common stock for $151.9 million under our existing share repurchase programs, partially offset by proceeds from stock purchase and option plans of $93 million. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $268.7 million of common stock under existing authorizations. Turning to Slide 13, trade and other accounts receivable increased $10.1 million from 2020 year end. Days sales outstanding of 62 days compared to 64 days a 2020 year end. Inventories decreased $16.4 million from 2020 year end and on a trailing 12 month basis inventory turned to 2.6 compared to 2.4 at year end 2020. Our quarter end cash position of $904.6 million, compared to $923.4 million at year end 2020. Our net debt to capital ratio of 12.4% compared to 12.1% at year end 2020. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million of available credit facilities. As of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few of the guidance for 2021. We anticipate the capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. We currently anticipate that absence of any changes at the US tax legislation, our full year 2021 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Well, Chris, I think what you see is the technician base, they're employed. They got more money in their pocket, and they seem to be servicing their debt and buying tools to supplement their needs. So I guess it's just an overview I think provided earlier, people are servicing the debt in a more pragmatic way. Sure. A couple of things, I think there's a little bit. I think there's more cash in the system. So that's probably - if anything, that's probably not negative, it's probably a positive. I think that, again, you're still at stages where your psychological recovery is not completely the same everywhere in the country. So I think people, broadly speaking, It's still a little bit more measured when they approach big ticket items as compared to hand tools, power tools, things of that nature. I still think there's that nuance. But when the tools group sells 25% organically, without having to dig deep into extend the credit, we feel that means there's borrowing capacity down the road that opens up future opportunities for them. So we kind of like the mix in that respect."

Additional information regarding these measures is included in our earnings release issued today, which can be found on our website.  With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?\nNicholas Pinchuk: Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. Wow, it's been some year and quite a quarter. China knee jerking from Zero COVID and strict lockdowns to living with COVID in unprecedented virus explosion, diminished but still continuing spikes in the supply chain, the ongoing Ukraine war, the emergence of -- the reemergence of Brexit and now the rising shadow of the recession, echoing in almost daily public pronouncements. And thru it all, Snap-on delivered another in a long line of encouraging performances.  We'll go through it. Starting with the highlights of the quarter and the year, I'll give you my perspective on the results, the market environment and our progress. And after that, Aldo will move into -- as usual, Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials.  The fourth quarter was encouraging. We believe it emphatically demonstrates the continuing resilience of our markets and the capability of our operations to achieve in the face of difficulty, wielding the power of our product our brand, our people and our strategic position. It all combines to serve as clear evidence of what we already know. Snap-on is a unique and extraordinary operation. The results for the fourth quarter serve as more testimony to that fact, and they are an unmistakable demonstration of our continuing momentum. Of course, we did with the differences from group to group and within the operations, but we believe the overall results are compelling.  Fourth quarter sales of $1.159 billion as reported, up 4.3% from 2021 included a substantial impact from unfavorable foreign currency of $37.7 million a 370 basis point headwind, and an organic sales increase of 8% over last year, and that represented a 22.7% rise over 2019. This now represents the corporation's tenth consecutive quarter above prepandemic levels. It's a trend of, I think, some significance in uncertain times like these. From an earnings perspective, our opco operating income for the quarter, including the impact from unfavorable foreign currency was $248 million, up 6.8% compared to 2021 and 44.7% above the 2019 pre-pandemic level. The OI margin for the quarter, it was 21.5%, improving by 50 basis points over last year and 360 basis points over 2019. It's the same resiliency that's been demonstrated over the years as we paid dividends every quarter since 1939 without a single interruption or reduction. In fact, in November, our dividend was raised by 14.1%, marking the 13th straight year of increases. It's more a testimony of Snap-on's consistent performance through varying environments. This is just another one of them.  For Financial Services, operating income of $63.9 million was down from 67 point -- $63.9 million was down from the $67.2 million in 2021. That decrease reflected the forecasted -- our forecast to return to more historical provision levels, but all the while keeping delinquencies flat to last year. And our overall quarterly EPS reached $4.42, $0.32 or 7.8% above 2021 and up 43.5% compared with 2019. Well, those are the numbers.  Now to the markets. We believe that automotive repair remains very favorable. It makes sense. The average age of vehicles continue to increase. The complexity of repairs is rising steeply as new platforms enter the vehicle park, and enter they have, starting in dealerships. And we have seen a resurgence in dealership projects despite a still recovering supply chain. Changes in internal combustion, the rise of electric vehicles and the expansion of vehicle autonomy have made dealerships eager for new equipment to support complex repair test of the evolving vehicle park, and we see it.  Projects and powertrains aside, dealerships continue to see healthy demand in repair and maintenance and in warranty, driving the need for shop expansion and more technicians. You can see it in the macros. Repair spending, technician numbers, technician wages, all up. Our dealership segment is expanding. And for independent repair shops, confidence remains sky high across the board. Shop owners and managers confirm that demand for repairs for technicians over complex skills are all rising, and our sales growth in that sector mirrors that enthusiasm. We believe we're moving into what we can be called the golden age of vehicle repair, and our Tools Group and RS&I group are uniquely positioned with the product, the brand and the people to take full advantage, even in the midst of turbulence. You can see it.  Now for the critical industries, where our Commercial & Industrial Group, or C&I operates. We continue to see progress but the group spans wide jurisdictions. And as such, various headwinds across the geographies and the industries have attenuated some of those gains. For geographies, Europe with the war and the reemergence of Brexit and China impacted by the COVID chaos were a stark contrast to relatively strong North American markets, a lot of variation. And the range in variability among sectors also continue to be a challenge. Natural resources, heavy-duty fleets, general industries and international aviations were robust, but the military area remain challenged. Overall, however, order demand for most of the critical industries has been strong, and we believe that's a great signal for C&I's future. So C&I does have challenges across geographies and the segments, but we have made advancements, and we see opportunities for tomorrow.  Going forward, we believe we'll keep moving down our runways for growth, our wide runways for growth. And as we proceed, we're also fortified, as all of you have heard before, by our Snap-on Value Creation processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI. They're the core processes that drive our ongoing progress, especially customer connection and innovation, growing our product line. You see, our franchisees and our direct sales force puts us in a strategic advantage, standing face-to-face with professional techs, understanding their individual challenges, showcasing the solutions created by our powerful product and demonstrating their use.  Our resilient markets do represent a significant opportunity, and we are there to take advantage up close and personal, like no one else, right where the jobs are done. And it's working. 2022 was a year of substantial headwinds, but our team prevailed with the year achieving new heights. Sales up $4 billion, $492.8 million, up 5.7%, reflecting an organic gain of 8.7% compared to 2021 and a 20.2% organic increase versus 2019. The opco margin for the year was 20.9%, up 90 basis points from '21 and exceeding the prepandemic margins by 170 basis points. As reported, earnings per share for the year were $16.82, up 12.7% from '21 and represented a rise of 35.5% from 2019. It's all evidence of the decisive and ongoing momentum that marked the year and the quarter.  Now the operating groups. Let's start with C&I. Fourth quarter sales of million for the group were down $15.5 million versus last year, including $21.2 million in unfavorable currency and a 1.7% organic gain. Our Specialty Tools division was a clear positive with double-digit gains. Precision is becoming essential every day, and our toric products are putting us right in the middle of that rise. Our critical industries also showed strength, especially in North America, propelled by growth in natural resources, general and heavy duty, partially attenuated by lower military activity.  Outside North America, it was a different story. SNA Europe was down and China was diminished. OI for C&I was $47.9 million, down $2.2 million primarily from the $2.3 million in unfavorable foreign currency. The group's operating margin was 14%. It was flat to last year, but still represented an advance of 120 basis points over the pre-pandemic level in 2019, and that was against 50 basis points of negative currency and acquisition dilution. The specialty torque business within C&I really is making significant strides. Torque is hot, and Snap-on is a widening array of new offerings to prominently participate in that trend. Products like our new series of digital torque checkers. It's from our Norbar engineering team. You might remember we acquired Norbar a few years ago. Our Norbar engineering team in England, more compact and easier to use, it helps technicians validate the accuracy of torque instruments close to the workplace, saving a lot of time.  Our new checkers accommodate torque measurements from 5-inch pounds to 1,500 foot pounds and rent is from a quarter inch to 1-inch covering jobs from precision fasteners and a jet cockpit to a heavy-duty bolt on a giant oil rig, a wide range of applications. And it's compact steel how they easily mount in a variety -- this is compact steel housing easily mounts in a variety of convenient locations at the point of issuing or in the pathway of the workflow, like tool cribs, aviation hangars and manufacturing cells, making torque checking an easy exercise.  With an accuracy of plus or minus 1%, our new checker increases process quality without work interruption, raises consistency in assembly activity and, with a streamlined documentation feature, greatly improves the management of fastening in any application. The initial launch was well received by any operation that relies on precision torque, and there are a lot of them. And as you can imagine, the new checker is right on track to be a Snap-on hit product with sales of $1 million in the first year. So it looks like it's a pretty strong product for us. C&I, mixed progress, challenged with headwinds, but it did have significant areas of improvement paving the way for future growth.  Now on to the Tools Group. Quarterly sales of $542.7 million, up $37.9 million, including 9.5% in unfavorable currency and a 9.6% organic increase, gains in the U.S. operation and continued expansion in the international networks. And it was all led by big ticket items, tool storage and diagnostics both with double-digit gains. Operating earnings for the Tools Group were $116.1 million in the quarter, $5.6 million above 2021, and that included $4.5 million in unfavorable currency. The operating margin was 21.4%, 50 basis points below last year, but that was impacted by currency and by product mix, but it was still a result of considerable strength.  Tools Group again represents the ongoing power and market leadership of our van network. It's written across the financials. And that positivity is clearly an boldly echoed in the voices of our franchisees. I can tell you, I was just at one of our annual kickoff. It's unmistakable that they're pumped enthusiastic and confidence. They know they are growing. And they firmly believe there's more to be had. And our franchisee health metrics confirm all of that to be true. The quantitative trajectory delays in that data supports every bit of the positivity -- of the positive attitude. And the franchisees expressed their excitement in more formal ways. During the quarter, we were recognized by the Franchise Business Review, which surveys franchisee satisfaction. And it's the latest ranking that publication, once again, latest annual ranking -- that publication once again listed Snap-on as a top 50 franchise, marking the 16th consecutive year we received that award. And internationally, Snap-on was ranked #1, #1 in Elite Franchisees Magazine's Top U.K. Franchises for 2023, finishing not only above the U.K.-only franchise systems, but also coming in ahead of the very popular global brand -- a number of very popular global brands. Now that type of recognition reflects, I think, fundamental strength of our brand business, and it would not have been achieved without a continuous stream of innovative new products.  As part of that, Snap-on continues to lead the industry with great tool storage innovations designed to improve productivity and allow techs to personalize their workspace. We're the first to market with the LED power top, rightly lighting the greening Snap-on tools like special jewels as each store is accessed. It's quite a sight. It enables the techs to show the pride in their work. And building on that feature, in December, we started shipping the first of our new IRIS tool storage units. It's a 68-inch special edition epic roll cap, which allows the technician to adjust the draw lighting with an infinite array of color selections. It is an eye-catcher coated and great paint paired with red trim, and it also features -- besides its appearance, it also features for the first time a specially lit Snap-on logo nameplate. It's innovative, striking. And as for all epic boxes, all of them, it streams functionality. The power top and the power door provides 10 electrical outlets and 4 USB ports throughout the road that ensures that all the cordless tools, the lights, the accessories are charged and at the ready. It also features our unique speed drawer for smart customizable tool organization. It's a very popular and productive feature in the shops. Convenience, productivity and distinction, the IRIS received an overwhelming reception, helping to drive the landmark tool storage we had just in the fourth quarter -- landmark full storage quarter we had just recently. It shows that pride really is a powerful salesman. You show that every day.  Well, that's our Tools Group, booming in the U.S. progressing internationally, continuing the stream of new products, building the brand, enhancing the brand channel and moving forward with momentum.  Now for RS&I. In the fourth quarter, our RS&I Group results confirmed what we've been saying all along. Snap-on is well positioned for the ongoing rise in vehicle repair. RS&I sales in the quarter of $437.9 million increased 11.6%, including $9.5 million in unfavorable currency and a 14.3% organic gain, 14.3%, boom shakalaka. That rise was authored by -- it was a great performance, and that rise was authored by double-digit increase in OEM dealerships as manufacturers continue to release new models, invest in new equipment and implement essential tool programs. But our business in the independent garages also expanded nicely with double-digit growth in our undercar equipment and in our diagnostics and repair information products, twin pillars of strength. Shop owners need upgrades to follow the changing car park, and they now have confidence regarding their futures to act on that imperative and Snap-on is ready to help.  RS&I operating earnings for the quarter were $110.6 million, up 13.8%. And again, and the operating margin, it was 25.3%, rising 50 basis points over 2021, exhibiting our team's ability to navigate the turbulence, welding Snap-on value creation, connecting with customers, launching innovation executing RCI and doing what they're expected to do: keep raising profitability.  One example is our diagnostic business, double-digit growth, led by new products. Last quarter, we mentioned the launch of our game-changing handheld diligent diagnostic unit, the . Well, it's selling at a record pace. It's in hardware and in software subscriptions. It's a great unit that again raises the bar for an advanced repair, providing technicians with a powerful health and troubleshooting and diagnostic the most complex of vehicle repairs. Zeus Plus makes those special challenges take up so much shop time appear quick and easy, and the techs are noticing. RS&I, the repair shops are confident seeing a great future, and RS&I has the products to pave their way.  Well, that's our fourth quarter. Opco organic sales rising 8%, 10 quarters of consecutive growth from pre-pandemic levels. Tools Group, demonstrating strength. Organic sales up 9.6% over last year, rising 33.2% from prepandemic levels. RS&I products to meet the needs of the vehicles of today and of tomorrow, activity up 14.3% organically, gains in both OEM dealerships and independent shops, C&I showing potential for growth despite international headwinds, strong momentum in the critical industries with much more to go. And it all drove a 21.5% operating margin for the overall enterprise, rising 50 basis points from last year and an EPS of $4.42 up over every comparison. It was another encouraging quarter.  Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?\nAldo Pagliari: Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $1.559 billion in the quarter increased 4.3% from 2021 levels, reflecting an 8% organic sales gain, partially offset by $37.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase this quarter reflects double-digit gains in the Repair Systems & Information Group, high single-digit growth in the Snap-on Tools Group and low single-digit gains in the Commercial and Industrial group.  From a geographic perspective, double-digit sales growth in both North and South America more than offset weaker demand in Europe. Consolidated gross margin of 48.5% improved 40 basis points from 48.1% last year. Contributions from the increased sales volumes and pricing actions, 40 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects and benefits from the company's RCI initiatives more than offset higher material and other costs. Again, this quarter, we believe the corporation through pricing and RCI actions continue to navigate effectively the cost and other supply chain dynamics of the current environment.  Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 27% improved 10 basis points from 27.1% last year. Operating earnings before financial services of $248 million in the quarter compared to $232.2 million in 2021 as a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 21.5% improved 50 basis points from last year's fourth quarter.  Financial services revenue of $88.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $86.9 million last year. Operating earnings of $63.9 million decreased to $3.3 million from 2021 levels and included a return to what we believe to be a more normal level of provisions for credit losses than those recorded last year. Consolidated operating earnings of $311.9 million in the quarter compared to $299.4 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, operating earnings margin of 25.1% was unchanged from last year.  Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 22% compared to 22.3% last year. Net earnings of $238.9 million or $4.42 per diluted share increased $15.2 million or $0.32 per share from last year levels, representing a 7.8% increase in diluted earnings per share.  Now let's turn to our segment results for the quarter. Starting with C&I group on Slide 7. Sales of $343.2 million decreased from $358.7 million last year, reflecting a $5.7 million or 1.7% organic sales gain, which was more than offset by $21.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic growth primarily reflects double-digit gains in the segment specialty torque business as well as a low single-digit increase in sales to customers in critical industries. These gains were partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in the segment's European-based hand tools business. With respect to critical industries, gains in sales to heavy-duty fleets, mining and general industry more than offset lower activity with the military.  Gross margin of 37.7% improved 120 basis points from 36.5% in the fourth quarter of 2021. This was primarily due to increased sales volumes and pricing actions, benefits from RCI initiatives and 20 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by higher material and other input costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 23.7% in the quarter increased 120 basis points from 22.5% in 2021, mostly due to reduced sales and lower expense businesses. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $47.9 million compared to $50.1 million last year. The operating margin of 14% was unchanged from last year.  Turning to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $542.7 million compared to $504.8 million a year ago, reflecting a 9.6% organic sales gain, partially offset by $9.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales growth reflects a double-digit gain in our U.S. business and a low single-digit increase in our international operations. The quarter benefited from robust demand for our recently launched diagnostic platform as well as our tool storage product line. Gross margin of 43.2% in the quarter declined 70 basis points from 43.9% last year. The year-over-year decrease is primarily due to 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased sales of lower gross margin products and higher material and other costs. These declines were partially offset by benefits from the higher sales volume and pricing actions. As a reminder, the Snap-on Tools Group serves as a distributor for products such as diagnostics, which is made by our RS&I Group. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 21.8% improved 20 basis points from 22% last year. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $116.1 million compared to $110.5 million last year. The operating margin of 21.4% compared to 21.9% in 2021.  Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $437.9 million increased 11.6% from $392.5 million in 2021, reflecting a 14.3% organic sales gain, partially offset by $9.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain is comprised of double-digit increases in sales of undercar and collision repair equipment in activity with OEM dealerships and in sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers, including those diagnostic sales affected by the Snap-on Tools Group.  Gross margin of 45% declined 110 basis points from 46.1% last year, primarily due to a higher material and other input costs and increased sales in lower gross margin businesses. These declines were partially offset by benefits from pricing actions and savings from RCI initiatives as well as 80 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 19.7% improved 160 basis points from 21.3% last year, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage, higher activity and lower expense businesses and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating earnings for the RS&I group of $110.6 million compared to $97.2 million last year. The operating margin of 25.3% improved 50 basis points from 24.8% reported a year ago.  Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from Financial Services of $88.3 million, including a $1.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation compared to $86.9 million last year. Financial Services operating earnings of $63.9 million, including $900,000 of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $67.2 million in 2021. Financial Services expenses of $24.4 million were up $4.7 million from 2021 levels, mostly due to $4.8 million of higher provisions for credit losses. While provisions have increased versus the historically lower provision rate experienced last year, we believe that the loan portfolio trends remain stable.  For reference, provisions for finance receivable losses in the current quarter were $12.8 million as compared to $8.4 million in the fourth quarter last year, yet lower than the $14.1 million and the $16 million recorded in the fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. As a percentage of the average portfolio, Financial Services expenses were 1.1% and 0.9% in the fourth quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2022 and 2021, the respective average yield on finance receivables were 17.6% and 17.7%. In the fourth quarter of 2022 and 2021, the average yield on contract receivables were 8.6% and 8.5%, respectively. The blended yield for the portfolio was 15.7% in the fourth quarter of 2022, which is the same as last year.  Total loan originations of $299.7 million in the fourth quarter increased $43.4 million or 16.9% from 2021 levels, reflecting a 17% increase in originations of finance receivables, a 16.7% increase in originations of contract receivables. The increase in finance receivable originations reflects the continued strong sales of big-ticket items by our franchisees during the work.  Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.3 billion of gross financing receivables, including $2 billion from our U.S. operation. The total global gross portfolio is up 3.4% year-over-year. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.6% for U.S. extended credit was the same as in 2021 and compared to 1.8% in the pre-pandemic period of 2019. On a sequential basis, the rate is up 10 basis points, reflecting the seasonal trend we typically experience between the third and fourth quarters. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $43.8 million represented 2.4% of of outstandings at year-end. While this was up 6 basis points from a year ago, it is 47 basis points lower than year-end 2019.  Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $210.6 million in the quarter compared to $222.7 million last year. The decrease from the fourth quarter of 2021 primarily reflects a 36.5% -- $36.5 million increase in working investment, partially offset by improved net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $67.9 million included net additions to finance receivables of $47.3 million and capital expenditures of $22.7 million.  Net cash used by financing activities of $145.8 million included cash dividends of $86 million and the repurchase of 284,000 shares of common stock for $65.3 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of year-end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $362.4 million of common stock under existing authorizations.  Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $79.4 million from 2021 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 61 days compared to 58 days at 2021 year-end and to 67 days as of the pre-pandemic year end of 2019. Inventories increased $229.3 million from 2021 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.5 compared to 2.8 at year-end 2021 and the 2.6x as of year-end 2019. The growth in inventory primarily reflects higher demand, including inventories to support new products. Additionally, given the dynamics of the current supply chain situation, our level of safety stocks and in-transit parts, components and raw materials are up, as our year-over-year costs associated with finished goods.  Our year-end cash position of $757.2 million compared to $780 million at year-end 2021. Our net debt to capital ratio of 9% compared to 9.1% at year-end 2021. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million available under our credit facilities. As of year-end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding.  That concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2023. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. In addition, we currently anticipate, absent any changes to the U.S. tax legislation, that our full year 2023 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 23% to 24%.   I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?\nNicholas Pinchuk: Thanks, Aldo. Well, that's our quarter and our year. I would say we can characterize particularly the fourth quarter as a period where the hits just kept on coming: sporadic supply shortages, war, Brexit, lockdowns, virus explosion and a constant drumbeat of recession warnings that served up bad news for breakfast every day. You can also describe the recent path of the time when Snap-on clearly demonstrated the resilience of its markets and the power of its businesses. C&I. engaging the full range of challenges across sectors and geographies but overcoming, growing 1.7% organically, registering an OI margin of 14%, flat to last year, reflecting the turbulence of the moment but up 120 basis points from pre-pandemic levels. The Tools Group, big ticket items surging, organic sales growing 9.6% overall, OI margin at 21.4%, up big from pre-pandemic levels, down from last year but primarily due to 40 points of negative currency and a similar impact from less favorable product mix. Still strong. RS&I, success in both OEM dealerships and independent shops, sales of 14.3% organically and an OI margin of 25.3%, up 50 basis points from last year. We said we're well positioned for the comeback and repair shops, and RS&I is showing just that.  And the credit company, OI down, but finance originations growing a strong 17%, and all of it authored strong numbers for the corporation. Organic sales up 8% versus last year, 22.7% versus pre-pandemic levels. OI margin of 21.5%, 21.5%, up 50 basis points compared with 2021 and 360 basis points over 2019. Full year organic sales were up the OI margin for the year was 20.9%, a rise of 90 basis points. And finally, EPS for the quarter of $4.42, up 7.8% versus last year and 43.5% versus prepandemic levels.  The hits did just keep coming, but Snap-on overcame. We exited the year stronger than when we entered, and we left the quarter in December with greater position and strength than we had in early October. We do have momentum, and you can see it in the numbers. We believe our markets will remain resilient, offer ongoing and abundant opportunities, and with our inherent advantages, the breadth and quality of our products. the unique and aspirational nature of our brands and the considerable capabilities of our experienced team, we believe we will maintain the momentum and extend our ongoing positive trajectory throughout 2023 and well beyond.  Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I want to speak directly to our franchisees and associates. I know that many of you are listening. You are the people of work, the individuals whose contributions collectively fostered these results. As I look back over the quarter, over 2022 and, in fact, over the past 3 years, it's clear your efforts, as you met the justifiable fear with extraordinary vigilance, helped keep our society and our company from disintegrating while we engaged and prevailed against the COVID. We often say that Snap-on people are unique, special and consistently make a difference. The past 3 years have clearly proved its so. For your ongoing achievement in the past quarter and many others, you have my congratulations. For your continued dedication in enabling the work of our society, you have my admiration. And for your confident commitment to Snap-on and its future, you have my thanks.  Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question today will come from Luke Junk with Baird. .\nLuke Junk: I apologize if any of this has been covered in the prepared remarks, joining the call a little bit late this morning. First question...\nNicholas Pinchuk: It was good.\nLuke Junk: That's helpful summary. I'll dive margin-related question to start with. And what I'm wondering is, now we've got several commodities, including steel that are off of their highs that we saw in 2022, and can you just help us understand how that might start to flow into your P&L this year, especially in the Tools Group? I know that typically, there's at least a couple quarter time lag that's associated with that? Is that still a good way to think about it? And at the same time, still broader inflationary pressures out there. If you could also comment on your approach to pricing as we begin 2023.\nNicholas Pinchuk: Yes, I think -- I'll answer the last question first. I think our approach to pricing as we see the situation when we meet the individual timing, like the individual quarters, I think you're going to see a mixed result. You said it correctly that things work its way and some kind of lag into your P&L as you go forward in terms of the pricing. If you look back, you do see a mixed review and, say, steel, for example. Hand tool steel is down some, it's not down to pre-pandemic levels, but tool storage steel is down closer to pre-pandemic levels. So you see some variation in that. And it doesn't look like they're going to go back up. It looks like you're going to -- I would expect to see them -- if they go to prepandemic levels, maybe that's equilibrium. But if you're above that, we kind of expect it to kind of go downwards. The thing that -- and you'll see that work its way through and give us some relief going forward. But the timing of that is a little uncertain based on what you said, associated with the lag. The big impact from the supply chain for us has been the availability of certain items. And so sometimes, even today, even as the supply chain is regularized, you can't find certain things, and you have to go out and spot market and get it. This particularly bedevils C&I., Tools Group less so, but it's impacted some of the RS&I things from time to time. So supply chain, I would say, in terms of a negative factor is abating but not disappearing as we go forward. That's what I see. So it's taken some pressure off. It's hard for me to predict, though, about certain supplies that could come up at any time. So you see that kind of situation.\nLuke Junk: My follow-up question is around credit. So if you look at credit performance, I mean, it's been very good if we look at delinquency rates in the back half of the year versus normal seasonality that's in the context of what's becoming clearly more -- just more macro risk, generally speaking, originations trending higher. How do you balance credit in 2023 between managing the risk side and pushing on what does seem like it could still be an incremental growth driver for the Tools Group given where we're coming from?\nNicholas Pinchuk: Well, look, I think this -- we don't change our policies in terms of risk based on the externals so much. We don't raise or drop our -- the credit standards associated with do we need sales or not. We pretty much focus on the same customer and look at it in the same way going forward. I think what you're seeing in rise of originations, it has nothing to do with the credit -- necessarily the credits to the customers. I think everybody says that professional technicians have a pretty -- had a pretty strong balance sheet for some time. I think what you've seen is a combination of compelling product and our technicians seeing the great opportunities they have, numbers of -- demand for technicians up, wages up and the repair systems up. You can see it in the macro sort of getting more confident to invest in big ticket items. I think to the extent you see originations, that's not driven by any credit policy, that's driven by the big ticket items. And whether we use credit or not will be dependent on how well the products are selling in the marketplace. Now right now, the thing about it is, is that if you have big ticket items leading the way in a robust quarter, and they were up double digits, , I think, baffle was the word I said. I think that says a lot for confidence because what my experience is, and I've been here a while, my experience is that when people -- when things start to look gloomy a little bit in professional technicians, the need doesn't go away but they tend to shift more to shorter payback items, not big ticket items. That's what happened in the great financial recession. So the fact that we had a big ticket boom, I think, gives me a lot of great confidence in our future.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America.\nElizabeth Suzuki: So the -- I mean, the automotive repair industry has arguably had some benefit from the surge in used vehicle values that caused some older vehicles to stay on the road for longer and vehicle owners to invest in maintenance. So I guess as used vehicle values are falling and potentially some more new vehicles start to get on the road and get into dealerships, I mean is Snap-on agnostic to that shift in vehicle aging?\nNicholas Pinchuk: Yes, really I mean, I think as we serve the dealerships just as well. I mean, you could argue that older cars have more repairs and maybe be entitled to that. But in reality, it's a long wave of event, Liz. The fact that new cars are becoming -- the fact that used cars were being held longer, we don't really think that makes that much a difference. We followed it for years. And when you look at a year or a quarter when, let's say, scrappage is up or scrappage is down, it doesn't seem to affect the numbers at all. So for us, I think if you said, okay, the car park is going to get younger over time, then that would be some pressure on repair. But the car park has gotten older every year since 1980. So I don't think that's going to change very much. And we -- I would not put the shift to used cars as much of a factor in the strength of the automotive repair market from our perspective. So I think any change from that is not going to make a difference, really. And we do serve the dealers. We actually get -- our revenues in the Tools Group is about the dealership -- revenue from the dealerships in the Tools Group actually almost dead on reflects the amount of repair that they have as a percentage of the total repair done in the country. So we're kind of agnostic between dealerships and independent repair shops.\nElizabeth Suzuki: Got it. Okay. That makes sense. And then just a question on capital allocation. And I'm curious to get your thoughts on the company's current appetite for M&A and which segments you feel are potentially more fragmented and where Snap-on could continue to roll up smaller businesses and what the pipeline might look like currently.\nNicholas Pinchuk: Well, look, I think we have a pipeline. We have a number of prospects we always look at, but we have -- what we do is we look to say we have runways for growth, enhance the van channel, expand with repair shop owners and managers, extend the critical industries and build in emerging markets. And we're always looking for something that's operating in the critical task space, where the penalties for failure are high, in other words, not DIY, but professional space. That can advance our position along one of those runways. There isn't much in the Tools Group because the Tools Group is already in a strong position there and it doesn't need too much. But if you look at -- and in emerging markets -- maybe in emerging markets now that's going to start opening up with all the turbulence that's been floating around there. But our 2 sweet spots in this have been in expand repair shop owners and managers, that's a junk RS&I or extend the critical industry.  And when we look there is give us a product that gives us more to sell to those customers or a new technology that's important to the customers or gives us a presence with customers. So for example, I mentioned Norbar. Norbar is an acquisition, which got us bigger in torque. It's critical. It's a technology we could use some help in at the top end. So we acquired it and it was a great success story. You can see the same kind of thing in RS&I with the acquisitions of Dealer-FX, where we wanted to beef up our software position in dealerships, one, because it's a profitable situation; but two, because it gives you a strategic advantage in terms of the visibility of new products that are going to enter the market just as you talked about, the new products, you get a better view of it. So that's the kind of thing.  So things that will advance us down those runways for growth are things we have money for, and we have no shyness about acquiring things. big or small. But we're careful. We take care of our money. So we don't transform the company. We're looking for coherent acquisitions. And there are a bunch of those. But sometimes when we look at something that isn't -- it's only 30% what we do or sometimes it isn't what we thought -- where we thought it was and we decided we don't want to have it, other times we do. In case of Norbar, Dealer-FX, we thought positively.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Scott Stember with MKM Partners. .\nUnidentified Analyst: And Nick, you talked about the big ticket items really driving the show for the Tools Group, but how did the hand tools perform in the quarter?\nNicholas Pinchuk: Hand tools were flat. So hands tools have been booming. They were like going wild in the last year and the first part of this year, and they are the high -- actually, believe it or not, they're the highest margin business in the hand tools. And so they're great. But when they back down a little bit, that puts a little margin pressure on them in the Tools Group. Flat is okay, though because they're really still strong. But tool storage is a great margin business, and that was up strong double-digit, fact, best tool storage ever. In fact, I had a guy telling me, I was out talking to the sales guy, he told me he could sell every tool storage unit I could build for him. Our backlog is exploding in tool storage. So we can sell a lot of them. And then -- so -- and that doesn't have much effect on margin. The real margin -- the source of the margin comment here was diagnostics. Diagnostics makes a lot of money for the corporation, but the Tools Group shares the margin with RS&I. Remember, RS&I makes it and sells it to the Tools Group. So from a pure Tools Group or when you're looking at diagnostics, that margin is a lower one for them. And so the flatness of hand tools and the rise in diagnostics created that margin pressure that moved it down somewhat in this period. But we thought this is great. It's one of the reasons why we have 21.5%, one of the reasons why RS&I was up 50 basis points, you see, because of diagnostics sells well for them. So that's sort of the way.  The other thing, as I said before, I want to emphasize, boy, I think it's a good sign for the future that big ticket is strong. Now you might argue, okay, diagnostics had a special case because we launched the Zeus, and it's the best thing since [indiscernible] and everybody loves it. But the fact that tool storage is selling well really indicates an underlying confidence in the customer base, which speaks well for our situation.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. And then just last question. What's the relationship of sell-in versus sell-through of the event?\nNicholas Pinchuk: Yes. Look, we look at these things. They're about in the range where we like to see it, about sort of equal. So when you look back from sell-in to sell-out, we see that being about balance. Now it always goes up and down a little bit every quarter, but this is kind of in the range. I think this quarter, it's about equal. .\nOperator: And our next question will come from David McGregor with Longbow Research.\nDavid MacGregor: Nick, you're continuing to expand the lexicon of the contemporary CEO. Boom shakalaka, that's... .\nNicholas Pinchuk: Gee, [indiscernible] special.\nDavid MacGregor: Listen, let me ask you about your balance sheet. Your working capital investment continues to grow. I can appreciate you've got more inventory in transit and safety stock. But can you talk about your plans to harvest that cash? And is the inventory accumulation concentrated within specific lines of business or specific products? And how much of that's tool segment versus the other 2 segments?\nNicholas Pinchuk: I'm -- I like our inventory because we have a lot of faith in the future, but I'll let -- Aldo has got to answer a question. I'll let him say something here. Aldo, why don't you say something?\nAldo Pagliari: Well, David, if you're looking year-over-year, yes, the Tools Group makes a major portion of it, but it's not all of it. But actually, the Tools Group has their inventories kind of reflective of the fact that they've had very consistent organic growth. And therefore, I think it's suitable. If you look at some of the other areas where we're investing, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it's not insignificant the amount of money that's tied up in in-transit inventory and safety stocks. Again, Snap-on has made a strategic decision to err on the side of availability. So that is priority #1. So a long answer to your question, we think the inventory is appropriate given the opportunities we see in front of us and the fact that we don't want to miss on the opportunities that present themselves as we go forward and not have disruption from the supply chain.  Now again, Snap-on is blessed, for lack of a better word, with we're not a typical consumer retail-oriented company, and therefore, we're not subject to the fashion sense, I like to say, many other companies have to be concerned about. So our product doesn't really obsolesce on the shelf, so to speak. I mean, yes, you have to update the algorithms in a diagnostic unit or an alignment machine, but pretty much we feel pretty confident that making an investment in inventory is going to pay off and being able to capture sales in projects or programs that manifest themselves as we go forward.\nDavid MacGregor: I can appreciate that you need that inventory to support the sales activity, but it continues to grow. And I guess the question is, at some point, do you have enough? And at what point if any, is there an opportunity to harvest that cash? Or is this kind of a structural step-up?\nAldo Pagliari: There's probably opportunities to harvest that, David, you're absolutely right, but I wouldn't model it that way. In other words, I just told you what our strategic decision is. And trust me, you have even more inventory. You will never have exactly the right thing at the right time. So you have to be prepared to have a flexible factory and a flexible distribution center because of 80,000 different SKUs, impossible to forecast what the accuracy you would like. And then you multiply the statistical probability of having them when you have to put arrays of SKUs that could have 100 to 200 pieces together, and you can see what drives the need for a lot of products. And then on top of it, you have spare part requirements sometimes imposed by regulations. So if you're going to sell machines that have a life of 10-plus years such as lifts and linear machines, tire changes, wheel balances, there's obligations behind the scenes to keep ample supplies of spare parts on hand. So you put that all together, and again, we will err in favor of availability. There could be opportunities to harvest. In just saying that we don't model ourselves cash flow growth from reduction in inventories, even though that certainly is theoretically possible.\nDavid MacGregor: Good. Let me ask you about growth, and you mentioned the improving supply channels. How much of the growth in each segment would you estimate is driven by shipping from backlog orders rather than new orders?\nNicholas Pinchuk: Well, look, certainly isn't much say in the critical industries. So our backlog just keeps growing there. That's because they keep being bedeviled by the supply chain disruption. That's sort of the thing I was saying. Our backlog is really strong there. And I don't think much is in the Tools Group. Our backlog in tool storage at all-time high, and we're actually expanding 2 of the plants in the Tools Group this year to try to keep up with this whole situation. You can look at different places like you'd be entitled to the idea that, geez, I think Europe is a little bit under the weather. So you see that kind of thing there, but the U.S. seems to be booming to me. So I don't know. You can -- it seems to me as though I think you can look at it that way. U.S. is pretty strong. And we're trying to -- look, we have real confidence in the future. That's why we're expanding our capabilities here. If I could expand the more tool storage, I would tomorrow. I told you -- I think I said before, the guy said he could -- one of the guys -- one of the top sales guys said he could sell everything I could give him. So I think we're sitting on some pretty good strength in that situation. So I think you called it book-to-bill last time. I think that's pretty healthy in the U.S., a little more turbulence in Europe.\nDavid MacGregor: Last question. Okay. Yes. Nick, last question for me. Just the 10-Q is not out yet, so, Aldo, maybe if you could just give us the finance receivable charge-offs. And then just how were overwrites this quarter?\nAldo Pagliari: Overrides are not as dynamic as what they've been in the past. Again, that decision is made with the franchisee. They've been a little bit more conservative compared to the 2016 to 2019 window. We still think personally that it's a good bet because we have a lot of metrics behind in process that kind of gives a higher sense of collectibility on things like that as compared to other companies that might be more upstart, so to speak, when it comes to lending to the credit profile of mechanics. But to directly answer your question, our returns are not as high as what they've been in the pre-pandemic world. And the charge-offs, I think I made a remark in my prepared remarks. The charge-offs, if you look at the provisions, they're actually narrower. I think we're about 4-point, what was it, $4.4 million difference in the rate of provision. The differential between charge-offs is actually less than that. What drove the provision up a little higher is actually with the significant increase in originations. We, from experience, have to book extra reserve provisions because of that because while everything starts out well, you know there's going to be a need for some reserves. So the fact that you high originations in the quarter actually drives a higher provision as well. So probably the increase year-over-year is about $1.1 million or so of higher provisions just associated with higher originations. .\nDavid MacGregor: Right. You provisioned pretty aggressively back in 2020, which was to your credit, but you've been working that down with charge-offs exceeding provisions for 8 of the 9 last quarters. So kind of getting back now to prepandemic level.\nAldo Pagliari: No, no, that's what makes the comparison tougher now, David. Exactly right. Probably by the end of Q1 of 2022, the reserve was probably reduced because of the -- we finally realized we didn't need as much as what we had provided for in 2020, 2021. And that's why I like to use the expression, we're returning to a more normalized rate of provision, and that's what you kind of see now.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. .\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Patrick Buckley on for Bret Jordan. In the C&I business, are there any other areas internationally to highlight? You've spoken about a bit here with the European hand tools. But is the weaker economic environment, the main drag there? Or is something else driving that?\nNicholas Pinchuk: It's the weaker economics. The U.K. has got a whole bunch of problems, the revolving door prime ministers and so on and that kind of thing. And it tends to be more organized around the Northern parts of that business. I think driven in the fourth quarter pretty much by a lot of banks that was in Europe in the fourth quarter over the fuel situation, and that weighed heavily on the people. And I think the whole idea that the recession is coming, the recession is coming there has kind of hit them. You got China who is like -- it's chaos in China. I mean, those guys went from being 6 weeks in their apartments to all of a sudden, let everything go, come to work with COVID. And 3/4 Quite population, some people say, got COVID. So I think things kind of went stand still because of the lockdowns in various cities and standstill because everybody is getting it. So that thing has been afflicted. So I'm not sure how quickly it comes back. So you have that. The other international markets like other parts of Asia, like Southeast Asia seen pretty good in that situation. So I think it's just COVID in Asia, particularly China, and the general sort of combination of recession is coming, fuel angst in England, reemergence of now we're out of COVID, the Brexit problems reemerge and the whole idea of the war is there kind of cast a pall over Europe. Although lately, I just heard some data that said that GDP is going to grow in Europe higher than other places, I don't know. I'm from Missouri on that one. I think Europe is a little weaker than maybe has been reflected in that. . That's what -- and then one other thing you do see is that we have -- I think I said this before, we have a strong demand in the critical industries. If we could source a little better, if we didn't have the varying disruptions of what's in supply, we could -- we would have been much stronger in this quarter and in past quarters. So one of the things that drives both the maybe some of the -- cast an overhang on the sales and put some -- hang on the margins because of you have to pay for the spot buys and it will always come in. And that's really in the critical industries where if you don't realize, there is our custom kits with maybe 200 or 300 items in them, and they must be shipped complete. So if you don't have 1 or 2 of them, we can't ship.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe could you talk a bit more on the subscription side of the RSI business? How sizable is that today? And how does the growth outlook there compared to [indiscernible]?\nNicholas Pinchuk: The growth outlook is pretty good. the subscriptions are going up. I mean, they're going up through the roof. But the thing is, remember that you probably -- you may or may not realize this, but that the other -- the former version, and still we do some of this is, we would sell what we call not subscriptions, but titles. So every 6 months, we come out with a new software addition, and technicians could buy it for their diagnostic unit or not. And we're transitioning from that sort of every 6 months or every year pop to, okay, pay me every month. And so there's some balance in that. But software is growing in the situation, and we can see we can see some positivity in that regard. And so that's one of the things that is starting to help out software in the -- help out the RS&I margins. In fact, I think we want to make sure we focus more on that going forward. So I think that's one of our great opportunities. We see a lot of opportunity in things like dealership software and independent repair shop software. And the Mitchell 1 business, which we didn't mention in this, is still growing like clockwork. It's growing nicely and its profitability is strong. It's just not up in the double-digit range, but the subscription business is growing nicely.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Ivan Feinseth with Tigress Financial Partners.\nIvan Feinseth: Congratulations again on another great year and a great quarter.\nNicholas Pinchuk: Thank you.\nIvan Feinseth: So just 2 questions. One, as far as new product development, where do you see going with -- as car onboard ADAS systems continue to grow of increasing diagnostic and calibration capabilities inside, let's say, Apollo and Zeus. And then also the CEO of General Motors has said many times she envisions $50 billion in revenue coming from software and subscriptions, especially as cars become increasingly -- have increasing software-defined functionality. And though the dealerships will have to kind of become an increasing part of that equation. So how do you see that benefiting dealer...\nNicholas Pinchuk: No, that's going to -- well, I think it benefits us greatly because look, if you want to -- sort of like it isn't a $50 billion example, but we do have examples associated with just what you said, ADAS, the advanced driver assistance systems, and the calibrations associated with that. That's behind -- that's sold enabled both through our diagnostics, like you said, like Zeus and Apollo in those, and it's enabled through our undercar equipment business. And those are the 2 businesses that taste the RS&I group, they were both up nice double digits. And really the software and the physicals associated with calibration have been helping drive the situation in undercar equipment and the input around ADAS systems in Mitchell 1 and in the diagnostic systems has helped drive their attractiveness.  And as more of that goes in, those products are going to get more and more essential to the technician. You see, what you're saying, I think another way to talk about this, Ivan, is this, is that right now, let's say, if you look at the total car park, like maybe 45% of the repairs require a diagnostic unit. But if you look at new units, it's like 80%. And as software starts to rise, more and more of the places where we have leadership in terms of repair information and in the software that's going to wheel that information and the calibration will be important for us. And that's all making money for us now. And the wider it gets, the more we're going to have in that situation.  So we're developing products along that line. One of the things that you don't even think about is in collision. I think you know this very well. But the thing is right now, new cars are like a neural network of sensors. And if they get dinged, you get your bumper dinged. It's a major operation to recalibrate it and reset the sensors and so on. And that's making -- that's driving a lot of the underneath car -- the undercar activity in RS&I. So we're already seeing that. And so we're focusing on that stuff as well. A big portion of our business now -- or development now is associated with software. And you're going to see that we're going to focus on it more and more as we go forward. .\nIvan Feinseth: I believe software sales is going to be an increasing opportunity for you, so I'm excited for it.\nNicholas Pinchuk: Yes. We're going to make sure we get big focus on it. But I think we already have a pretty good position in it. We just see as it develops, these are going to create opportunities that are going to lay out there in front of you. .\nIvan Feinseth: Congratulations again.\nNicholas Pinchuk: Thanks a lot. Take care. .\nOperator: And this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Sara Verbsky for any closing remarks. .\nSara Verbsky: Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Nicholas Pinchuk",
            "content": "Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. Wow, it's been some year and quite a quarter. China knee jerking from Zero COVID and strict lockdowns to living with COVID in unprecedented virus explosion, diminished but still continuing spikes in the supply chain, the ongoing Ukraine war, the emergence of -- the reemergence of Brexit and now the rising shadow of the recession, echoing in almost daily public pronouncements. And thru it all, Snap-on delivered another in a long line of encouraging performances.  We'll go through it. Starting with the highlights of the quarter and the year, I'll give you my perspective on the results, the market environment and our progress. And after that, Aldo will move into -- as usual, Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials.  The fourth quarter was encouraging. We believe it emphatically demonstrates the continuing resilience of our markets and the capability of our operations to achieve in the face of difficulty, wielding the power of our product our brand, our people and our strategic position. It all combines to serve as clear evidence of what we already know. Snap-on is a unique and extraordinary operation. The results for the fourth quarter serve as more testimony to that fact, and they are an unmistakable demonstration of our continuing momentum. Of course, we did with the differences from group to group and within the operations, but we believe the overall results are compelling.  Fourth quarter sales of $1.159 billion as reported, up 4.3% from 2021 included a substantial impact from unfavorable foreign currency of $37.7 million a 370 basis point headwind, and an organic sales increase of 8% over last year, and that represented a 22.7% rise over 2019. This now represents the corporation's tenth consecutive quarter above prepandemic levels. It's a trend of, I think, some significance in uncertain times like these. From an earnings perspective, our opco operating income for the quarter, including the impact from unfavorable foreign currency was $248 million, up 6.8% compared to 2021 and 44.7% above the 2019 pre-pandemic level. The OI margin for the quarter, it was 21.5%, improving by 50 basis points over last year and 360 basis points over 2019. It's the same resiliency that's been demonstrated over the years as we paid dividends every quarter since 1939 without a single interruption or reduction. In fact, in November, our dividend was raised by 14.1%, marking the 13th straight year of increases. It's more a testimony of Snap-on's consistent performance through varying environments. This is just another one of them.  For Financial Services, operating income of $63.9 million was down from 67 point -- $63.9 million was down from the $67.2 million in 2021. That decrease reflected the forecasted -- our forecast to return to more historical provision levels, but all the while keeping delinquencies flat to last year. And our overall quarterly EPS reached $4.42, $0.32 or 7.8% above 2021 and up 43.5% compared with 2019. Well, those are the numbers.  Now to the markets. We believe that automotive repair remains very favorable. It makes sense. The average age of vehicles continue to increase. The complexity of repairs is rising steeply as new platforms enter the vehicle park, and enter they have, starting in dealerships. And we have seen a resurgence in dealership projects despite a still recovering supply chain. Changes in internal combustion, the rise of electric vehicles and the expansion of vehicle autonomy have made dealerships eager for new equipment to support complex repair test of the evolving vehicle park, and we see it.  Projects and powertrains aside, dealerships continue to see healthy demand in repair and maintenance and in warranty, driving the need for shop expansion and more technicians. You can see it in the macros. Repair spending, technician numbers, technician wages, all up. Our dealership segment is expanding. And for independent repair shops, confidence remains sky high across the board. Shop owners and managers confirm that demand for repairs for technicians over complex skills are all rising, and our sales growth in that sector mirrors that enthusiasm. We believe we're moving into what we can be called the golden age of vehicle repair, and our Tools Group and RS&I group are uniquely positioned with the product, the brand and the people to take full advantage, even in the midst of turbulence. You can see it.  Now for the critical industries, where our Commercial & Industrial Group, or C&I operates. We continue to see progress but the group spans wide jurisdictions. And as such, various headwinds across the geographies and the industries have attenuated some of those gains. For geographies, Europe with the war and the reemergence of Brexit and China impacted by the COVID chaos were a stark contrast to relatively strong North American markets, a lot of variation. And the range in variability among sectors also continue to be a challenge. Natural resources, heavy-duty fleets, general industries and international aviations were robust, but the military area remain challenged. Overall, however, order demand for most of the critical industries has been strong, and we believe that's a great signal for C&I's future. So C&I does have challenges across geographies and the segments, but we have made advancements, and we see opportunities for tomorrow.  Going forward, we believe we'll keep moving down our runways for growth, our wide runways for growth. And as we proceed, we're also fortified, as all of you have heard before, by our Snap-on Value Creation processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI. They're the core processes that drive our ongoing progress, especially customer connection and innovation, growing our product line. You see, our franchisees and our direct sales force puts us in a strategic advantage, standing face-to-face with professional techs, understanding their individual challenges, showcasing the solutions created by our powerful product and demonstrating their use.  Our resilient markets do represent a significant opportunity, and we are there to take advantage up close and personal, like no one else, right where the jobs are done. And it's working. 2022 was a year of substantial headwinds, but our team prevailed with the year achieving new heights. Sales up $4 billion, $492.8 million, up 5.7%, reflecting an organic gain of 8.7% compared to 2021 and a 20.2% organic increase versus 2019. The opco margin for the year was 20.9%, up 90 basis points from '21 and exceeding the prepandemic margins by 170 basis points. As reported, earnings per share for the year were $16.82, up 12.7% from '21 and represented a rise of 35.5% from 2019. It's all evidence of the decisive and ongoing momentum that marked the year and the quarter.  Now the operating groups. Let's start with C&I. Fourth quarter sales of million for the group were down $15.5 million versus last year, including $21.2 million in unfavorable currency and a 1.7% organic gain. Our Specialty Tools division was a clear positive with double-digit gains. Precision is becoming essential every day, and our toric products are putting us right in the middle of that rise. Our critical industries also showed strength, especially in North America, propelled by growth in natural resources, general and heavy duty, partially attenuated by lower military activity.  Outside North America, it was a different story. SNA Europe was down and China was diminished. OI for C&I was $47.9 million, down $2.2 million primarily from the $2.3 million in unfavorable foreign currency. The group's operating margin was 14%. It was flat to last year, but still represented an advance of 120 basis points over the pre-pandemic level in 2019, and that was against 50 basis points of negative currency and acquisition dilution. The specialty torque business within C&I really is making significant strides. Torque is hot, and Snap-on is a widening array of new offerings to prominently participate in that trend. Products like our new series of digital torque checkers. It's from our Norbar engineering team. You might remember we acquired Norbar a few years ago. Our Norbar engineering team in England, more compact and easier to use, it helps technicians validate the accuracy of torque instruments close to the workplace, saving a lot of time.  Our new checkers accommodate torque measurements from 5-inch pounds to 1,500 foot pounds and rent is from a quarter inch to 1-inch covering jobs from precision fasteners and a jet cockpit to a heavy-duty bolt on a giant oil rig, a wide range of applications. And it's compact steel how they easily mount in a variety -- this is compact steel housing easily mounts in a variety of convenient locations at the point of issuing or in the pathway of the workflow, like tool cribs, aviation hangars and manufacturing cells, making torque checking an easy exercise.  With an accuracy of plus or minus 1%, our new checker increases process quality without work interruption, raises consistency in assembly activity and, with a streamlined documentation feature, greatly improves the management of fastening in any application. The initial launch was well received by any operation that relies on precision torque, and there are a lot of them. And as you can imagine, the new checker is right on track to be a Snap-on hit product with sales of $1 million in the first year. So it looks like it's a pretty strong product for us. C&I, mixed progress, challenged with headwinds, but it did have significant areas of improvement paving the way for future growth.  Now on to the Tools Group. Quarterly sales of $542.7 million, up $37.9 million, including 9.5% in unfavorable currency and a 9.6% organic increase, gains in the U.S. operation and continued expansion in the international networks. And it was all led by big ticket items, tool storage and diagnostics both with double-digit gains. Operating earnings for the Tools Group were $116.1 million in the quarter, $5.6 million above 2021, and that included $4.5 million in unfavorable currency. The operating margin was 21.4%, 50 basis points below last year, but that was impacted by currency and by product mix, but it was still a result of considerable strength.  Tools Group again represents the ongoing power and market leadership of our van network. It's written across the financials. And that positivity is clearly an boldly echoed in the voices of our franchisees. I can tell you, I was just at one of our annual kickoff. It's unmistakable that they're pumped enthusiastic and confidence. They know they are growing. And they firmly believe there's more to be had. And our franchisee health metrics confirm all of that to be true. The quantitative trajectory delays in that data supports every bit of the positivity -- of the positive attitude. And the franchisees expressed their excitement in more formal ways. During the quarter, we were recognized by the Franchise Business Review, which surveys franchisee satisfaction. And it's the latest ranking that publication, once again, latest annual ranking -- that publication once again listed Snap-on as a top 50 franchise, marking the 16th consecutive year we received that award. And internationally, Snap-on was ranked #1, #1 in Elite Franchisees Magazine's Top U.K. Franchises for 2023, finishing not only above the U.K.-only franchise systems, but also coming in ahead of the very popular global brand -- a number of very popular global brands. Now that type of recognition reflects, I think, fundamental strength of our brand business, and it would not have been achieved without a continuous stream of innovative new products.  As part of that, Snap-on continues to lead the industry with great tool storage innovations designed to improve productivity and allow techs to personalize their workspace. We're the first to market with the LED power top, rightly lighting the greening Snap-on tools like special jewels as each store is accessed. It's quite a sight. It enables the techs to show the pride in their work. And building on that feature, in December, we started shipping the first of our new IRIS tool storage units. It's a 68-inch special edition epic roll cap, which allows the technician to adjust the draw lighting with an infinite array of color selections. It is an eye-catcher coated and great paint paired with red trim, and it also features -- besides its appearance, it also features for the first time a specially lit Snap-on logo nameplate. It's innovative, striking. And as for all epic boxes, all of them, it streams functionality. The power top and the power door provides 10 electrical outlets and 4 USB ports throughout the road that ensures that all the cordless tools, the lights, the accessories are charged and at the ready. It also features our unique speed drawer for smart customizable tool organization. It's a very popular and productive feature in the shops. Convenience, productivity and distinction, the IRIS received an overwhelming reception, helping to drive the landmark tool storage we had just in the fourth quarter -- landmark full storage quarter we had just recently. It shows that pride really is a powerful salesman. You show that every day.  Well, that's our Tools Group, booming in the U.S. progressing internationally, continuing the stream of new products, building the brand, enhancing the brand channel and moving forward with momentum.  Now for RS&I. In the fourth quarter, our RS&I Group results confirmed what we've been saying all along. Snap-on is well positioned for the ongoing rise in vehicle repair. RS&I sales in the quarter of $437.9 million increased 11.6%, including $9.5 million in unfavorable currency and a 14.3% organic gain, 14.3%, boom shakalaka. That rise was authored by -- it was a great performance, and that rise was authored by double-digit increase in OEM dealerships as manufacturers continue to release new models, invest in new equipment and implement essential tool programs. But our business in the independent garages also expanded nicely with double-digit growth in our undercar equipment and in our diagnostics and repair information products, twin pillars of strength. Shop owners need upgrades to follow the changing car park, and they now have confidence regarding their futures to act on that imperative and Snap-on is ready to help.  RS&I operating earnings for the quarter were $110.6 million, up 13.8%. And again, and the operating margin, it was 25.3%, rising 50 basis points over 2021, exhibiting our team's ability to navigate the turbulence, welding Snap-on value creation, connecting with customers, launching innovation executing RCI and doing what they're expected to do: keep raising profitability.  One example is our diagnostic business, double-digit growth, led by new products. Last quarter, we mentioned the launch of our game-changing handheld diligent diagnostic unit, the . Well, it's selling at a record pace. It's in hardware and in software subscriptions. It's a great unit that again raises the bar for an advanced repair, providing technicians with a powerful health and troubleshooting and diagnostic the most complex of vehicle repairs. Zeus Plus makes those special challenges take up so much shop time appear quick and easy, and the techs are noticing. RS&I, the repair shops are confident seeing a great future, and RS&I has the products to pave their way.  Well, that's our fourth quarter. Opco organic sales rising 8%, 10 quarters of consecutive growth from pre-pandemic levels. Tools Group, demonstrating strength. Organic sales up 9.6% over last year, rising 33.2% from prepandemic levels. RS&I products to meet the needs of the vehicles of today and of tomorrow, activity up 14.3% organically, gains in both OEM dealerships and independent shops, C&I showing potential for growth despite international headwinds, strong momentum in the critical industries with much more to go. And it all drove a 21.5% operating margin for the overall enterprise, rising 50 basis points from last year and an EPS of $4.42 up over every comparison. It was another encouraging quarter.  Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Thanks, Aldo. Well, that's our quarter and our year. I would say we can characterize particularly the fourth quarter as a period where the hits just kept on coming: sporadic supply shortages, war, Brexit, lockdowns, virus explosion and a constant drumbeat of recession warnings that served up bad news for breakfast every day. You can also describe the recent path of the time when Snap-on clearly demonstrated the resilience of its markets and the power of its businesses. C&I. engaging the full range of challenges across sectors and geographies but overcoming, growing 1.7% organically, registering an OI margin of 14%, flat to last year, reflecting the turbulence of the moment but up 120 basis points from pre-pandemic levels. The Tools Group, big ticket items surging, organic sales growing 9.6% overall, OI margin at 21.4%, up big from pre-pandemic levels, down from last year but primarily due to 40 points of negative currency and a similar impact from less favorable product mix. Still strong. RS&I, success in both OEM dealerships and independent shops, sales of 14.3% organically and an OI margin of 25.3%, up 50 basis points from last year. We said we're well positioned for the comeback and repair shops, and RS&I is showing just that.  And the credit company, OI down, but finance originations growing a strong 17%, and all of it authored strong numbers for the corporation. Organic sales up 8% versus last year, 22.7% versus pre-pandemic levels. OI margin of 21.5%, 21.5%, up 50 basis points compared with 2021 and 360 basis points over 2019. Full year organic sales were up the OI margin for the year was 20.9%, a rise of 90 basis points. And finally, EPS for the quarter of $4.42, up 7.8% versus last year and 43.5% versus prepandemic levels.  The hits did just keep coming, but Snap-on overcame. We exited the year stronger than when we entered, and we left the quarter in December with greater position and strength than we had in early October. We do have momentum, and you can see it in the numbers. We believe our markets will remain resilient, offer ongoing and abundant opportunities, and with our inherent advantages, the breadth and quality of our products. the unique and aspirational nature of our brands and the considerable capabilities of our experienced team, we believe we will maintain the momentum and extend our ongoing positive trajectory throughout 2023 and well beyond.  Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I want to speak directly to our franchisees and associates. I know that many of you are listening. You are the people of work, the individuals whose contributions collectively fostered these results. As I look back over the quarter, over 2022 and, in fact, over the past 3 years, it's clear your efforts, as you met the justifiable fear with extraordinary vigilance, helped keep our society and our company from disintegrating while we engaged and prevailed against the COVID. We often say that Snap-on people are unique, special and consistently make a difference. The past 3 years have clearly proved its so. For your ongoing achievement in the past quarter and many others, you have my congratulations. For your continued dedication in enabling the work of our society, you have my admiration. And for your confident commitment to Snap-on and its future, you have my thanks.  Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? It was good. Yes, I think -- I'll answer the last question first. I think our approach to pricing as we see the situation when we meet the individual timing, like the individual quarters, I think you're going to see a mixed result. You said it correctly that things work its way and some kind of lag into your P&L as you go forward in terms of the pricing. If you look back, you do see a mixed review and, say, steel, for example. Hand tool steel is down some, it's not down to pre-pandemic levels, but tool storage steel is down closer to pre-pandemic levels. So you see some variation in that. And it doesn't look like they're going to go back up. It looks like you're going to -- I would expect to see them -- if they go to prepandemic levels, maybe that's equilibrium. But if you're above that, we kind of expect it to kind of go downwards. The thing that -- and you'll see that work its way through and give us some relief going forward. But the timing of that is a little uncertain based on what you said, associated with the lag. The big impact from the supply chain for us has been the availability of certain items. And so sometimes, even today, even as the supply chain is regularized, you can't find certain things, and you have to go out and spot market and get it. This particularly bedevils C&I., Tools Group less so, but it's impacted some of the RS&I things from time to time. So supply chain, I would say, in terms of a negative factor is abating but not disappearing as we go forward. That's what I see. So it's taken some pressure off. It's hard for me to predict, though, about certain supplies that could come up at any time. So you see that kind of situation. Well, look, I think this -- we don't change our policies in terms of risk based on the externals so much. We don't raise or drop our -- the credit standards associated with do we need sales or not. We pretty much focus on the same customer and look at it in the same way going forward. I think what you're seeing in rise of originations, it has nothing to do with the credit -- necessarily the credits to the customers. I think everybody says that professional technicians have a pretty -- had a pretty strong balance sheet for some time. I think what you've seen is a combination of compelling product and our technicians seeing the great opportunities they have, numbers of -- demand for technicians up, wages up and the repair systems up. You can see it in the macro sort of getting more confident to invest in big ticket items. I think to the extent you see originations, that's not driven by any credit policy, that's driven by the big ticket items. And whether we use credit or not will be dependent on how well the products are selling in the marketplace. Now right now, the thing about it is, is that if you have big ticket items leading the way in a robust quarter, and they were up double digits, , I think, baffle was the word I said. I think that says a lot for confidence because what my experience is, and I've been here a while, my experience is that when people -- when things start to look gloomy a little bit in professional technicians, the need doesn't go away but they tend to shift more to shorter payback items, not big ticket items. That's what happened in the great financial recession. So the fact that we had a big ticket boom, I think, gives me a lot of great confidence in our future. Yes, really I mean, I think as we serve the dealerships just as well. I mean, you could argue that older cars have more repairs and maybe be entitled to that. But in reality, it's a long wave of event, Liz. The fact that new cars are becoming -- the fact that used cars were being held longer, we don't really think that makes that much a difference. We followed it for years. And when you look at a year or a quarter when, let's say, scrappage is up or scrappage is down, it doesn't seem to affect the numbers at all. So for us, I think if you said, okay, the car park is going to get younger over time, then that would be some pressure on repair. But the car park has gotten older every year since 1980. So I don't think that's going to change very much. And we -- I would not put the shift to used cars as much of a factor in the strength of the automotive repair market from our perspective. So I think any change from that is not going to make a difference, really. And we do serve the dealers. We actually get -- our revenues in the Tools Group is about the dealership -- revenue from the dealerships in the Tools Group actually almost dead on reflects the amount of repair that they have as a percentage of the total repair done in the country. So we're kind of agnostic between dealerships and independent repair shops. Well, look, I think we have a pipeline. We have a number of prospects we always look at, but we have -- what we do is we look to say we have runways for growth, enhance the van channel, expand with repair shop owners and managers, extend the critical industries and build in emerging markets. And we're always looking for something that's operating in the critical task space, where the penalties for failure are high, in other words, not DIY, but professional space. That can advance our position along one of those runways. There isn't much in the Tools Group because the Tools Group is already in a strong position there and it doesn't need too much. But if you look at -- and in emerging markets -- maybe in emerging markets now that's going to start opening up with all the turbulence that's been floating around there. But our 2 sweet spots in this have been in expand repair shop owners and managers, that's a junk RS&I or extend the critical industry.  And when we look there is give us a product that gives us more to sell to those customers or a new technology that's important to the customers or gives us a presence with customers. So for example, I mentioned Norbar. Norbar is an acquisition, which got us bigger in torque. It's critical. It's a technology we could use some help in at the top end. So we acquired it and it was a great success story. You can see the same kind of thing in RS&I with the acquisitions of Dealer-FX, where we wanted to beef up our software position in dealerships, one, because it's a profitable situation; but two, because it gives you a strategic advantage in terms of the visibility of new products that are going to enter the market just as you talked about, the new products, you get a better view of it. So that's the kind of thing.  So things that will advance us down those runways for growth are things we have money for, and we have no shyness about acquiring things. big or small. But we're careful. We take care of our money. So we don't transform the company. We're looking for coherent acquisitions. And there are a bunch of those. But sometimes when we look at something that isn't -- it's only 30% what we do or sometimes it isn't what we thought -- where we thought it was and we decided we don't want to have it, other times we do. In case of Norbar, Dealer-FX, we thought positively. Hand tools were flat. So hands tools have been booming. They were like going wild in the last year and the first part of this year, and they are the high -- actually, believe it or not, they're the highest margin business in the hand tools. And so they're great. But when they back down a little bit, that puts a little margin pressure on them in the Tools Group. Flat is okay, though because they're really still strong. But tool storage is a great margin business, and that was up strong double-digit, fact, best tool storage ever. In fact, I had a guy telling me, I was out talking to the sales guy, he told me he could sell every tool storage unit I could build for him. Our backlog is exploding in tool storage. So we can sell a lot of them. And then -- so -- and that doesn't have much effect on margin. The real margin -- the source of the margin comment here was diagnostics. Diagnostics makes a lot of money for the corporation, but the Tools Group shares the margin with RS&I. Remember, RS&I makes it and sells it to the Tools Group. So from a pure Tools Group or when you're looking at diagnostics, that margin is a lower one for them. And so the flatness of hand tools and the rise in diagnostics created that margin pressure that moved it down somewhat in this period. But we thought this is great. It's one of the reasons why we have 21.5%, one of the reasons why RS&I was up 50 basis points, you see, because of diagnostics sells well for them. So that's sort of the way.  The other thing, as I said before, I want to emphasize, boy, I think it's a good sign for the future that big ticket is strong. Now you might argue, okay, diagnostics had a special case because we launched the Zeus, and it's the best thing since [indiscernible] and everybody loves it. But the fact that tool storage is selling well really indicates an underlying confidence in the customer base, which speaks well for our situation. Yes. Look, we look at these things. They're about in the range where we like to see it, about sort of equal. So when you look back from sell-in to sell-out, we see that being about balance. Now it always goes up and down a little bit every quarter, but this is kind of in the range. I think this quarter, it's about equal. . Gee, [indiscernible] special. I'm -- I like our inventory because we have a lot of faith in the future, but I'll let -- Aldo has got to answer a question. I'll let him say something here. Aldo, why don't you say something? Well, look, certainly isn't much say in the critical industries. So our backlog just keeps growing there. That's because they keep being bedeviled by the supply chain disruption. That's sort of the thing I was saying. Our backlog is really strong there. And I don't think much is in the Tools Group. Our backlog in tool storage at all-time high, and we're actually expanding 2 of the plants in the Tools Group this year to try to keep up with this whole situation. You can look at different places like you'd be entitled to the idea that, geez, I think Europe is a little bit under the weather. So you see that kind of thing there, but the U.S. seems to be booming to me. So I don't know. You can -- it seems to me as though I think you can look at it that way. U.S. is pretty strong. And we're trying to -- look, we have real confidence in the future. That's why we're expanding our capabilities here. If I could expand the more tool storage, I would tomorrow. I told you -- I think I said before, the guy said he could -- one of the guys -- one of the top sales guys said he could sell everything I could give him. So I think we're sitting on some pretty good strength in that situation. So I think you called it book-to-bill last time. I think that's pretty healthy in the U.S., a little more turbulence in Europe. It's the weaker economics. The U.K. has got a whole bunch of problems, the revolving door prime ministers and so on and that kind of thing. And it tends to be more organized around the Northern parts of that business. I think driven in the fourth quarter pretty much by a lot of banks that was in Europe in the fourth quarter over the fuel situation, and that weighed heavily on the people. And I think the whole idea that the recession is coming, the recession is coming there has kind of hit them. You got China who is like -- it's chaos in China. I mean, those guys went from being 6 weeks in their apartments to all of a sudden, let everything go, come to work with COVID. And 3/4 Quite population, some people say, got COVID. So I think things kind of went stand still because of the lockdowns in various cities and standstill because everybody is getting it. So that thing has been afflicted. So I'm not sure how quickly it comes back. So you have that. The other international markets like other parts of Asia, like Southeast Asia seen pretty good in that situation. So I think it's just COVID in Asia, particularly China, and the general sort of combination of recession is coming, fuel angst in England, reemergence of now we're out of COVID, the Brexit problems reemerge and the whole idea of the war is there kind of cast a pall over Europe. Although lately, I just heard some data that said that GDP is going to grow in Europe higher than other places, I don't know. I'm from Missouri on that one. I think Europe is a little weaker than maybe has been reflected in that. . That's what -- and then one other thing you do see is that we have -- I think I said this before, we have a strong demand in the critical industries. If we could source a little better, if we didn't have the varying disruptions of what's in supply, we could -- we would have been much stronger in this quarter and in past quarters. So one of the things that drives both the maybe some of the -- cast an overhang on the sales and put some -- hang on the margins because of you have to pay for the spot buys and it will always come in. And that's really in the critical industries where if you don't realize, there is our custom kits with maybe 200 or 300 items in them, and they must be shipped complete. So if you don't have 1 or 2 of them, we can't ship. The growth outlook is pretty good. the subscriptions are going up. I mean, they're going up through the roof. But the thing is, remember that you probably -- you may or may not realize this, but that the other -- the former version, and still we do some of this is, we would sell what we call not subscriptions, but titles. So every 6 months, we come out with a new software addition, and technicians could buy it for their diagnostic unit or not. And we're transitioning from that sort of every 6 months or every year pop to, okay, pay me every month. And so there's some balance in that. But software is growing in the situation, and we can see we can see some positivity in that regard. And so that's one of the things that is starting to help out software in the -- help out the RS&I margins. In fact, I think we want to make sure we focus more on that going forward. So I think that's one of our great opportunities. We see a lot of opportunity in things like dealership software and independent repair shop software. And the Mitchell 1 business, which we didn't mention in this, is still growing like clockwork. It's growing nicely and its profitability is strong. It's just not up in the double-digit range, but the subscription business is growing nicely. Thank you. No, that's going to -- well, I think it benefits us greatly because look, if you want to -- sort of like it isn't a $50 billion example, but we do have examples associated with just what you said, ADAS, the advanced driver assistance systems, and the calibrations associated with that. That's behind -- that's sold enabled both through our diagnostics, like you said, like Zeus and Apollo in those, and it's enabled through our undercar equipment business. And those are the 2 businesses that taste the RS&I group, they were both up nice double digits. And really the software and the physicals associated with calibration have been helping drive the situation in undercar equipment and the input around ADAS systems in Mitchell 1 and in the diagnostic systems has helped drive their attractiveness.  And as more of that goes in, those products are going to get more and more essential to the technician. You see, what you're saying, I think another way to talk about this, Ivan, is this, is that right now, let's say, if you look at the total car park, like maybe 45% of the repairs require a diagnostic unit. But if you look at new units, it's like 80%. And as software starts to rise, more and more of the places where we have leadership in terms of repair information and in the software that's going to wheel that information and the calibration will be important for us. And that's all making money for us now. And the wider it gets, the more we're going to have in that situation.  So we're developing products along that line. One of the things that you don't even think about is in collision. I think you know this very well. But the thing is right now, new cars are like a neural network of sensors. And if they get dinged, you get your bumper dinged. It's a major operation to recalibrate it and reset the sensors and so on. And that's making -- that's driving a lot of the underneath car -- the undercar activity in RS&I. So we're already seeing that. And so we're focusing on that stuff as well. A big portion of our business now -- or development now is associated with software. And you're going to see that we're going to focus on it more and more as we go forward. . Yes. We're going to make sure we get big focus on it. But I think we already have a pretty good position in it. We just see as it develops, these are going to create opportunities that are going to lay out there in front of you. . Thanks a lot. Take care. ."

            "content": "Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $1.559 billion in the quarter increased 4.3% from 2021 levels, reflecting an 8% organic sales gain, partially offset by $37.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase this quarter reflects double-digit gains in the Repair Systems & Information Group, high single-digit growth in the Snap-on Tools Group and low single-digit gains in the Commercial and Industrial group.  From a geographic perspective, double-digit sales growth in both North and South America more than offset weaker demand in Europe. Consolidated gross margin of 48.5% improved 40 basis points from 48.1% last year. Contributions from the increased sales volumes and pricing actions, 40 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects and benefits from the company's RCI initiatives more than offset higher material and other costs. Again, this quarter, we believe the corporation through pricing and RCI actions continue to navigate effectively the cost and other supply chain dynamics of the current environment.  Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 27% improved 10 basis points from 27.1% last year. Operating earnings before financial services of $248 million in the quarter compared to $232.2 million in 2021 as a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 21.5% improved 50 basis points from last year's fourth quarter.  Financial services revenue of $88.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $86.9 million last year. Operating earnings of $63.9 million decreased to $3.3 million from 2021 levels and included a return to what we believe to be a more normal level of provisions for credit losses than those recorded last year. Consolidated operating earnings of $311.9 million in the quarter compared to $299.4 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, operating earnings margin of 25.1% was unchanged from last year.  Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 22% compared to 22.3% last year. Net earnings of $238.9 million or $4.42 per diluted share increased $15.2 million or $0.32 per share from last year levels, representing a 7.8% increase in diluted earnings per share.  Now let's turn to our segment results for the quarter. Starting with C&I group on Slide 7. Sales of $343.2 million decreased from $358.7 million last year, reflecting a $5.7 million or 1.7% organic sales gain, which was more than offset by $21.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic growth primarily reflects double-digit gains in the segment specialty torque business as well as a low single-digit increase in sales to customers in critical industries. These gains were partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in the segment's European-based hand tools business. With respect to critical industries, gains in sales to heavy-duty fleets, mining and general industry more than offset lower activity with the military.  Gross margin of 37.7% improved 120 basis points from 36.5% in the fourth quarter of 2021. This was primarily due to increased sales volumes and pricing actions, benefits from RCI initiatives and 20 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by higher material and other input costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 23.7% in the quarter increased 120 basis points from 22.5% in 2021, mostly due to reduced sales and lower expense businesses. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $47.9 million compared to $50.1 million last year. The operating margin of 14% was unchanged from last year.  Turning to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $542.7 million compared to $504.8 million a year ago, reflecting a 9.6% organic sales gain, partially offset by $9.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales growth reflects a double-digit gain in our U.S. business and a low single-digit increase in our international operations. The quarter benefited from robust demand for our recently launched diagnostic platform as well as our tool storage product line. Gross margin of 43.2% in the quarter declined 70 basis points from 43.9% last year. The year-over-year decrease is primarily due to 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased sales of lower gross margin products and higher material and other costs. These declines were partially offset by benefits from the higher sales volume and pricing actions. As a reminder, the Snap-on Tools Group serves as a distributor for products such as diagnostics, which is made by our RS&I Group. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 21.8% improved 20 basis points from 22% last year. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $116.1 million compared to $110.5 million last year. The operating margin of 21.4% compared to 21.9% in 2021.  Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $437.9 million increased 11.6% from $392.5 million in 2021, reflecting a 14.3% organic sales gain, partially offset by $9.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain is comprised of double-digit increases in sales of undercar and collision repair equipment in activity with OEM dealerships and in sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers, including those diagnostic sales affected by the Snap-on Tools Group.  Gross margin of 45% declined 110 basis points from 46.1% last year, primarily due to a higher material and other input costs and increased sales in lower gross margin businesses. These declines were partially offset by benefits from pricing actions and savings from RCI initiatives as well as 80 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 19.7% improved 160 basis points from 21.3% last year, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage, higher activity and lower expense businesses and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating earnings for the RS&I group of $110.6 million compared to $97.2 million last year. The operating margin of 25.3% improved 50 basis points from 24.8% reported a year ago.  Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from Financial Services of $88.3 million, including a $1.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation compared to $86.9 million last year. Financial Services operating earnings of $63.9 million, including $900,000 of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $67.2 million in 2021. Financial Services expenses of $24.4 million were up $4.7 million from 2021 levels, mostly due to $4.8 million of higher provisions for credit losses. While provisions have increased versus the historically lower provision rate experienced last year, we believe that the loan portfolio trends remain stable.  For reference, provisions for finance receivable losses in the current quarter were $12.8 million as compared to $8.4 million in the fourth quarter last year, yet lower than the $14.1 million and the $16 million recorded in the fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. As a percentage of the average portfolio, Financial Services expenses were 1.1% and 0.9% in the fourth quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2022 and 2021, the respective average yield on finance receivables were 17.6% and 17.7%. In the fourth quarter of 2022 and 2021, the average yield on contract receivables were 8.6% and 8.5%, respectively. The blended yield for the portfolio was 15.7% in the fourth quarter of 2022, which is the same as last year.  Total loan originations of $299.7 million in the fourth quarter increased $43.4 million or 16.9% from 2021 levels, reflecting a 17% increase in originations of finance receivables, a 16.7% increase in originations of contract receivables. The increase in finance receivable originations reflects the continued strong sales of big-ticket items by our franchisees during the work.  Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.3 billion of gross financing receivables, including $2 billion from our U.S. operation. The total global gross portfolio is up 3.4% year-over-year. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.6% for U.S. extended credit was the same as in 2021 and compared to 1.8% in the pre-pandemic period of 2019. On a sequential basis, the rate is up 10 basis points, reflecting the seasonal trend we typically experience between the third and fourth quarters. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $43.8 million represented 2.4% of of outstandings at year-end. While this was up 6 basis points from a year ago, it is 47 basis points lower than year-end 2019.  Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $210.6 million in the quarter compared to $222.7 million last year. The decrease from the fourth quarter of 2021 primarily reflects a 36.5% -- $36.5 million increase in working investment, partially offset by improved net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $67.9 million included net additions to finance receivables of $47.3 million and capital expenditures of $22.7 million.  Net cash used by financing activities of $145.8 million included cash dividends of $86 million and the repurchase of 284,000 shares of common stock for $65.3 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of year-end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $362.4 million of common stock under existing authorizations.  Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $79.4 million from 2021 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 61 days compared to 58 days at 2021 year-end and to 67 days as of the pre-pandemic year end of 2019. Inventories increased $229.3 million from 2021 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.5 compared to 2.8 at year-end 2021 and the 2.6x as of year-end 2019. The growth in inventory primarily reflects higher demand, including inventories to support new products. Additionally, given the dynamics of the current supply chain situation, our level of safety stocks and in-transit parts, components and raw materials are up, as our year-over-year costs associated with finished goods.  Our year-end cash position of $757.2 million compared to $780 million at year-end 2021. Our net debt to capital ratio of 9% compared to 9.1% at year-end 2021. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million available under our credit facilities. As of year-end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding.  That concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2023. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. In addition, we currently anticipate, absent any changes to the U.S. tax legislation, that our full year 2023 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 23% to 24%.   I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Well, David, if you're looking year-over-year, yes, the Tools Group makes a major portion of it, but it's not all of it. But actually, the Tools Group has their inventories kind of reflective of the fact that they've had very consistent organic growth. And therefore, I think it's suitable. If you look at some of the other areas where we're investing, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it's not insignificant the amount of money that's tied up in in-transit inventory and safety stocks. Again, Snap-on has made a strategic decision to err on the side of availability. So that is priority #1. So a long answer to your question, we think the inventory is appropriate given the opportunities we see in front of us and the fact that we don't want to miss on the opportunities that present themselves as we go forward and not have disruption from the supply chain.  Now again, Snap-on is blessed, for lack of a better word, with we're not a typical consumer retail-oriented company, and therefore, we're not subject to the fashion sense, I like to say, many other companies have to be concerned about. So our product doesn't really obsolesce on the shelf, so to speak. I mean, yes, you have to update the algorithms in a diagnostic unit or an alignment machine, but pretty much we feel pretty confident that making an investment in inventory is going to pay off and being able to capture sales in projects or programs that manifest themselves as we go forward. There's probably opportunities to harvest that, David, you're absolutely right, but I wouldn't model it that way. In other words, I just told you what our strategic decision is. And trust me, you have even more inventory. You will never have exactly the right thing at the right time. So you have to be prepared to have a flexible factory and a flexible distribution center because of 80,000 different SKUs, impossible to forecast what the accuracy you would like. And then you multiply the statistical probability of having them when you have to put arrays of SKUs that could have 100 to 200 pieces together, and you can see what drives the need for a lot of products. And then on top of it, you have spare part requirements sometimes imposed by regulations. So if you're going to sell machines that have a life of 10-plus years such as lifts and linear machines, tire changes, wheel balances, there's obligations behind the scenes to keep ample supplies of spare parts on hand. So you put that all together, and again, we will err in favor of availability. There could be opportunities to harvest. In just saying that we don't model ourselves cash flow growth from reduction in inventories, even though that certainly is theoretically possible. Overrides are not as dynamic as what they've been in the past. Again, that decision is made with the franchisee. They've been a little bit more conservative compared to the 2016 to 2019 window. We still think personally that it's a good bet because we have a lot of metrics behind in process that kind of gives a higher sense of collectibility on things like that as compared to other companies that might be more upstart, so to speak, when it comes to lending to the credit profile of mechanics. But to directly answer your question, our returns are not as high as what they've been in the pre-pandemic world. And the charge-offs, I think I made a remark in my prepared remarks. The charge-offs, if you look at the provisions, they're actually narrower. I think we're about 4-point, what was it, $4.4 million difference in the rate of provision. The differential between charge-offs is actually less than that. What drove the provision up a little higher is actually with the significant increase in originations. We, from experience, have to book extra reserve provisions because of that because while everything starts out well, you know there's going to be a need for some reserves. So the fact that you high originations in the quarter actually drives a higher provision as well. So probably the increase year-over-year is about $1.1 million or so of higher provisions just associated with higher originations. . No, no, that's what makes the comparison tougher now, David. Exactly right. Probably by the end of Q1 of 2022, the reserve was probably reduced because of the -- we finally realized we didn't need as much as what we had provided for in 2020, 2021. And that's why I like to use the expression, we're returning to a more normalized rate of provision, and that's what you kind of see now."

With that said, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?\nNick Pinchuk: Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I\u2019ll start the call by covering the highlights of the third quarter. I\u2019ll give you an update on the environment and the trends we see. I'll take you through some of the turbulence we've encountered, thinking about our performance. Aldo will provide a more detailed [Technical Difficulty] The story of the Snap-on -- apparently we have some cross talk we\u2019re hearing here. But the story of the Snap-on quarter is momentum overcoming challenges. Momentum rooted in the resilience of our market, the capability of our great team and the tactical and strategic advantage in our product, our brand and our models, all coming together to create considerable and ongoing strength. In effect, the third quarter once again demonstrated our ability to continue a trajectory of positive results despite the headwinds, and the numbers, they say it so. Our reported sales in the quarter of $1.125 billion were up $64.8 million or 6.2% versus last year, including $39.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency. Organic sales grew 10.4%, with gains in every group, our ninth straight quarter of year-over-year expansion. And if you compare it to the pre-pandemic levels of 2029 -- 2019, you see a clear and unmistakable upward drive, versus 2019 sales we're up 3% as reported and 2.8% organically, continuing our positive trend and accelerating our expansion, demonstrating that we're only getting stronger every day. I did say momentum. Quarter also bears the mark of Snap-on value creation processes, safety, a lot of the customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement or RCI. Once again, they all combine to offer significant progress. And progress to what, Opco operating income of $223.5 million increased $22.2 million from last year, and the Opco operating margin was 20.3%, up 90 basis points from last year and rising 170 basis points over 2019. For financial services, operating income of $66.4 million compared to the $70.6 million of last year, a decrease reflecting the forecasted return to more usual provision levels. And that result, combined with Opco for a consolidated margin of 24.4%, up 20 basis points from last year and 120 basis point improvement from 2019. The quarterly EPS, it was $4.14, rising 16% over the $3.57 from a year ago and 39.9% over the $2.96 days recorded in 2019, a significant gain. I said it before, and I'll say it again. We believe Snap-on is stronger now than when we entered this great withering, and the third quarter results are an unmistakable confirmation of that fact. Well, those are the numbers. Now let's speak about the markets. Auto repair continues to remain strong. The key metrics are all favorable, spending on vehicle maintenance repair, the vehicle technician and technician wage is up, up and up again. And so wonder, it's no wonder the repair industry is resilient. Repair spending is rising. The cars are more complex. They need more repairs, and it costs more. The technician count is at its highest point in three decades, and shop owners keep telling me they need more, many more. Wages continue to grow, and they simply reflect the increased demand for the skills that are now necessary to complete critical repair tasks. It's never been more evident that repairing a modern vehicle with the new technology is difficult. It's an exercise of extraordinary skill. And the salaries are rising to show it. Auto repair is resilient. When I meet up with the people at the shop, as I often do, our franchisees and our technician customers, you can feel their exception in the now and their confidence in the future. And they're making sure they can participate in that future by being ready with the tools they need. Vehicle repair, it's a space filled with opportunity. You can hear it in the optimism in the voices of the shop, and you can see it clearly confirmed in Snap-on's performance. But it's not just the text, shop owners are also a big -- shop owners and managers are also big players in the horizon repair. And our Repair Systems and Information group are RS&I is positioned to take advantage. Everybody knows that cars are scarce. New and used. But for Snap-on, that doesn't matter. Repair and collision shops are busy. It's a tool we like very much. And it's evident in the rising sales of our undercar equipment and collision businesses, both strong. You have a repair shop today, you see a bright future with changing technologies, and you want to be ready, new vehicles are being released with a greater variety of drivetrains than ever from internal combustion engines to hybrid to plug-in electric to full electric. And the range of options is growing: more driver assist, more vehicle automation, increasing vehicle complexity, and we're ready to help the repair shops keep pace with powerful products like a range of fast track intelligence diagnostics, the Zeus, the Triton, the Apollo Handheld, enabling repair at all levels, like our celebrated Mitchell 1 ProDemand repair information, our award-winning Tru-Point advanced driver assistant calibration system and our 3D alignment systems like the new Hofmann Geoliner, all representing new technologies, and all wheeled big databases deployed to make work easier in the shop. Vehicle repair looks more promising than ever and Snap-On's position to capitalize. Now let's talk about the critical industries where the Snap-On rolls -- the Snap-On brand rolls out of the garage solving tasks of consequence. This is where commercial industrial C&I operates with our broadest region into international markets, and with the locations impacted the most by the challenges of the day. I mean C&I is headwind headquarters, supply chain disruption rising -- rises in commodity costs, uncertain fuel supply, currency fluctuations, continuing COVID lockdowns, troubled economies and war in Ukraine, well, C&I had it all. But it rolls to the occasion. And in the quarter, the group took some lumps in Europe, but over came with strong gains in North America and in Asia, despite the difficulties. And while the military sector is still down, C&I's critical industries -- the other C&I critical industries are all showing life. So I describe our C&I markets as challenged in certain geographies but demonstrating continuing gains and having strong and ongoing possibilities going forward. And coupled with our auto repair related businesses, we believe there is clear and compelling opportunity along our runways for growth, enhancing the band network, expanding with repair shop owners and managers, extending the critical industries and building in emerging markets. And in this quarter, we've seen that potential pay off nicely. At the same time, it's clear that we have ongoing possibilities on our runways for improvement. The Snap-On Value Creation processes. They've never been more important, helping to counter the turbulence of the day. Especially important is with customer connection, understanding the work of professional technicians and innovation, matching that insight with technology, driving new products. And just this quarter, Snap-On was prominently recognized with five PTEN, Professional Tool & Equipment News innovation awards. And we were also honored with two MOTOR Magazine Top Tool awards. An essential driver of our growth is innovative products that make work easier, and the awards, hard one. Our testimony that great Snap-On products just keep coming, matching the growing complexity of the task becoming more essential to technicians and driving our positive results. Now let's turn to the segments. In the C&I group. Sales in the quarter of $356.8 million were up 1.5% or $5.4 million as reported versus 2021, including a $26.2 million or 7.9% organic uplift, operating progress across all divisions, which was offset partially by $20.8 million in unfavorable foreign currency. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income of $52.3 million, including $2.1 million of unfavorable currency represents a decrease of $1.3 million compared to 2021. The effects of volume gains were more than offset by the substantial impact of currency and by supply chain inefficiencies. The OI margin was 14.7%, down from last year, but still representing the highest level since the rise of the significant supply turbulence. Compared with the pre-pandemic level, sales were up 7.7% organically, and the OI margin of 14.7% was up 30 basis points despite a 60 basis point negative impact of acquisitions, and unfavorable currency. Now we remain committed to extending in critical industries, the C&I sweet spot, and we'll keep strengthening our position to capture those opportunities as they arise and enabling that intent is our expanding C&I lineup of innovative products, designed specifically to make critical work easy. One example is our brushless CT9015 18-volt drill. It's newest member of our Monster, the lithium family aimed at industrial manufacturing and repair professionals, enabling work with the toughest materials, 470-inch pounds of torque, enough to handle even hardened alloys, 2,000 RPMs, speed to get the job done quickly. And with heavy duty \u2013 with the heavy-duty gearing and the enhanced cooling, this tool is rugged, durable, even in extreme use. The 9015 also offers an 18-speed clutch, a variable speed trigger, a two-speed gearbox, all for precise control, a feature that's essential for serious drilling, for professional drilling. And the 18-volt battery with 5 watt-hour ensures consistent output and extended run time in effect, less charging for a more efficient workday. Tools also fitted with a 100 lumen head light, helping technician work \u2013 helping technicians work in dark environments just what's needed for those coal sub jobs. The CT9015 has got power, speed, precision and durability. It's a great tool and a text know it. They've already made the new drill one of our $1 million hit products. So that's C&I., continued progress against the turbulence. Now on to the Tools Group. The team just keeps driving upward, leaving the pre-pandemic levels behind by a wider distance every quarter. Sales of $496.6 million were up $25.2 million or 5.3% over 2021. Organic growth of $34.1 million, or 7.4%, partially offset by $8.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency. The operating margin was 20.6%, down slightly, 20 basis points, but overcoming a 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency. Compared with pre-virus 2019, sales were $111.4 million or 28.9%, including a $113 million or 29.5% organic gain, and this quarter's 20.6% operating margin was up 680 basis points versus 2019, coming out of the pandemic stronger indeed. The Tools Group is responding to the challenges of the day, increasing its product advantage, fortifying its brands, further enabling the franchisees, guiding them to more selling capacity, and it's all working. You can witness it in any time you meet the franchisees. One big opportunity for that is our annual Snap-on Franchisee Conference, or SFC, held this year at the Gaylord Texan Hotel in Dallas. The theme was breaking barriers. It's a reminder of our record franchisee performance driving ever upward over the last nine quarters, and it's a recognition of the clear opportunity to reach even greater heights going forward, almost \u2013 yes, almost 8,000 individuals attended. And I can tell you, they were pumped, excited by the products more than three football fields of our latest offerings were on display, all available for viewing, handling and ordering in order they did, setting new records that we can also offer a variety of training seminars, where franchisees were able to sharpen and expand their skills to selling the full range of our complex and broad product line. It's an important movement. We say we're working to expand the selling capacities are advance, the SFC is a big part of that effort, and Dallas was another great step forward to that end. You can bet. You can bet on it. Our entire team departed this year's get together and Dallas educated, energized and eager to extend the Snap-on difference, reaching new individual and collective levels of success throughout the base to come. They left excited and strong. The Dallas SFC will lead to breaking barriers. The franchisees' enthusiasm for their businesses and their confidence in their future will make it so. During the SFC, the Tools Group presented the newest addition to the Snap-on ratchet lineup, our FLLF80, a three-inch drive extra-long locking flex-head ratchet. This new innovation provides easy access to superior turning power. Our patented duality technology makes it stronger. And the 20-inch length, the longest in the category, provides even greater -- provides great ability to reach deeper in a crowded spaces, extending reach and increasing leverages. It's a great addition to any toolbox. And as an added bonus, the new patent-pending, self-cleaning feature vanishes dirt and grind ensuring that the flex-head locks firmly in place at even -- at any angle even under high-stress applications. The X80 is a special offering, access, leverage and stability in one rachet. The initial launch exceeded $1 million is to hit product and sales. And volume continues to move forward upward on a steep trajectory beyond product. We spend time working to expand the franchisee selling capacity, harnessing social media, improving product training, RCI and the van operations. It's been effective. So capacity is clearly on the rise. And you can see it in the results. The Tools Group is on a very positive trend, ascending and leaving pre-pandemic levels well behind. And as we said in the SFC, it's breaking new barriers right now, and we believe it will all continue. Now on to RS&I. Sales were sales of $414 million, were up $14.9 [ph] million or 13.6%, including $60.8 million or 17.2% organic uplift. Growth was weighted toward undercar equipment and sales for the OEM dealerships, but our information and diagnostics businesses were also players in the year-over-year improvement. RCI, RS&I operating earnings were $95.4 million, representing a $12.1 million increase versus 2021, and the operating margin was up 10 basis points from last year to 23%. Compared with 2019, sales grew $91.3 million or $0.82, including an $86 million or 27.2% organic gain. Operating margin was down 20 [ph] basis points versus 2019, primarily reflecting the business mix and the acquisitions. But at 23%, it was still strong. We see significant potential in our size runways for growth, expanding Snap-on's presence in garage with coherent acquisitions and with a broad array of powerful products, and the industry experts feel the same. In fact, our TRITON D10, Fast Track intelligence diagnostic units was just selected for amazing top two award and rightly so. The trend is ideal deal for shop owners and for general technicians, it provides a comprehensive system verification to identify troubled areas, and to diagnostic testing to pinpoint repair actions and a powerful lab scope to confirm component level functionality, all in one package. The D10 advanced scoping -- the D10's advanced scoping capability helps users dig deep into the vehicle systems and evaluate performance with the comparative data, and it's Fast Track intelligent diagnostics, greatly shortcut the work and streamlines the repair processes, making shops more productive, more profitable. Unit also offers a rugged hardware explicitly designed for -- you expect this from Snap-on. The unit also offers rugged hardware explicitly designed for shop environments -- tough shop environment, a super-fast, two-second boot-up, and a 10-inch touchscreen. It all comes together for unprecedented reliability and speed and ease of use. It's a -- I'm telling you, the technicians will tell you, it's a [indiscernible] product. And with the selection of the TRITON motor magazine -- and with the selection of the TRITON, motor magazines, now recognized Snap-on diagnostic units in 22 of the last 23 years. 22 of the last 23 years, we believe it's more testimony that RS&I is stronger than ever in shops and dealerships. Well, that's the highlights for our quarter. Tools Group, strong progress. C&I recording a positive performance and an upward trajectory against the variations across industries and geographies. And RS&I, expanding profitable volume with repair shop owners and managers, staff on overall sales rising again, 10.4% and 22.8% organically versus last year and the pre-pandemic level, respectively, continuing clear and positive growth. OpCo operating margins, a robust 20.3% rising again this quarter, up 90 basis points. EPS, $4.14 up versus last year and accelerated well beyond pre-pandemic levels. It was another encouraging quarter. Now, I'll turn the call over to Al. Aldo?\nAldo Pagliari: Thanks Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on slide six. Net sales of $1.125 billion in the quarter increased 6.2% from 2021 levels, reflecting the 10.4% organic sales gain, partially offset by $39.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales gain this quarter reflects high single-digit growth in both the Snap-on Tools Group and the Commercial Industrial Group and double-digit gains in the repair systems and information group. This growth compares to the 8.4% year-over-year organic increase recorded last quarter. From a geographic perspective, continued sales strength in the United States and several emerging markets more than offset weaker demand in Europe. Consolidated gross margin of 48.3% declined 190 basis points from 50.2% last year. Higher material and other costs were partially offset by contributions from the increased sales volumes and pricing actions as well as benefits from the company's RCI initiatives, and 30 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects. Again, this quarter, we believe the corporation through pricing, and RCI actions continue to navigate effectively the cost and other supply chain dynamics of the current environment. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 28%, improved 280 basis points from 30.8% last year. The improvement is primarily due to sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating earnings from -- before financial services of $223.5 million in the quarter compared to $201.3 million in 2021. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 20.3% improved 90 basis points from last year. Financial services revenue of $87.3 million in the third quarter of 2022 was unchanged from last year. Operating earnings of $66.4 million decreased $4.2 million from 2021 levels, primarily as a result of higher provisions for credit losses than those recorded last year. Consolidated operating earnings of $289.9 million compared to $271.9 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 24.4%, compared to 24.2% in 2021. Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 21.6%, compared to 23.7% last year. The lower rate in the quarter was primarily due to tax benefits realized from the favorable settlements of income tax audits. Net earnings of $223.9 million or $4.14 per diluted share increased $27.7 million or $0.57 per share from last year's levels, representing a 16% increase in diluted earnings per share. Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with C&I group on Slide 7. Sales of $356.8 million increased from $351.4 million last year, reflecting a $26.2 million or 7.9% organic sales gain, partially offset by $20.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic growth primarily reflects double-digit gains in the segment to Asia Pacific operations and specialty torque business as well as a low single-digit increase in sales to customers in critical industries. Lower activity with the military was more than offset by gains in aviation, mining, power generation as well as in oil and gas. Gross margin of 36.9% declined 130 basis points from 38.2% in the third quarter of 2021. This is primarily due to increased material and other input costs, partially offset by benefits from the higher sales volumes and pricing actions and 20 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22.2% in the quarter improved 70 basis points from 22.9% in 2021, primarily due to the effects of sales volume leverage. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $52.3 million, compared to $53.6 million last year, the operating margin of 14.7%, compared to 15.3% a year ago. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $496.6 million increased 5.3% from $471.4 million in 2021, reflecting a 7.4% organic sales gain, partially offset by $8.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales growth reflects a high single-digit gain in our US business, which was partially offset by a low single-digit decrease in our international operations, the latter largely reflecting weakness in the United Kingdom. Gross margin of 44.9% in the quarter declined 90 basis points from 45.8% last year. The year-over-year decrease is primarily due to higher material and other costs, and 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by benefits from increased sales volumes and the pricing actions. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 24.3% improved 70 basis points from 25% last year, reflecting the benefits from higher sales volumes and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $102.2 million compared to $98.2 million last year. The operating margin of 20.6% compared to 20.8% in 2021 and to 13.8% in the pre-pandemic third quarter of 2019. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on slide nine. Sales of $414 million compared to $364.4 million a year ago, reflecting a 17.2% organic sales gain, partially offset by $11.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain is comprised of double-digit increases in activity with OEM dealerships, and in sales of undercar and collision repair equipment, and a low single-digit gain sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers. Gross margin of 42.9% declined 390 basis points from 46.8% last year. This is primarily due to higher material and other input costs and increased sales and lower gross margin businesses. These declines were partially offset by benefits from pricing actions and savings from RCI initiatives as well as 40 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 19.9% improved 400 basis points from 23.9% last year, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage, higher activity and lower expense businesses and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $95.4 million compared to $83.3 million last year. The operating margin of 23% improved 10 basis points from 22.9% reported a year ago. Now turning to slide 10. Revenue from financial services of $87.3 million, including $1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation was unchanged from last year. Financial services operating earnings of $66.4 million, including $800,000 of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $70.6 million in 2021. Financial services expenses of $20.9 million were up $4.2 million from 2021 levels, mostly due to $3.7 million of increased provisions for credit losses. While provisions have increased versus the historically lower provision rate experienced last year, we believe that loan portfolio trends remain stable. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 0.9% and 0.8% in the third quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively. In the third quarters of 2022 and 2021, respective average yields on finance receivables were 17.7% and 17.8%. In the third quarters of 2022 and 2021, the average yields on contract receivables were 8.6% and 8.5%, respectively. The blended yield for the portfolio was 15.8% in the third quarter of 2022, which is the same as last year. Total loan originations of $300.2 million in the third quarter increased to $30.9 million or 11.5% from 2021 levels, reflecting a 12.5% increase in originations of finance receivables and an 8% increase in originations of contract receivables. Moving to slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $2 billion from our US operation. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.5% for the United States extended credit compared to 1.4% in 2021 and 1.7% in the pre-pandemic period of 2019. On a sequential basis, the rate is up 10 basis points, reflecting the seasonal trend we typically experience between the second and third quarters. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $42.2 million represented 2.41% of outstandings at quarter end, and were down 7 basis points as compared to the same period last year. Now turning to slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $129.9 million in the quarter, compared to $186.4 million last year. The decrease from the third quarter of 2021 primarily reflects a $63.5 million increase in working investment. The change in working investment dollars is largely driven by greater demand, resulting in increased receivables and higher levels of inventory this year. In addition to demand-based requirements, the inventory increase also reflects higher in-transit inventory amounts as well as incremental buffer stocks associated with the supply chain dynamics in the current macro environment. Net cash used by investing activities of $57.9 million included net additions to finance receivables of $38.2 million and capital expenditures of $20 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $120.7 million included cash dividends of $75.7 million and the repurchase of 228,000 shares of common stock for $50.2 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $396 million of common stock under existing authorizations. Turning to slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $56.7 million from 2021 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 60 days compared to 58 days at 2021 year-end. Inventories increased $151.3 million from 2021 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.6 compared to 2.8 at year-end 2021 and 2.6 as of the pre-pandemic third quarter of 2019. Our quarter end cash position of $759.3 million compared to $380 million at year-end 2021. Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 9.3% compared to 9.1% at year-end 2021. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million available under our credit facilities. As of quarter end, there were no outstanding amounts under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for the remainder of 2022. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. In addition, we currently anticipate, absent any changes to US tax legislation, that our full year 2022 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%. I'll turn the call back over to Nick now for his closing thoughts. Nick?\nNick Pinchuk: Thanks, Aldo. Well, it was quite a quarter. A staggering number of media pieces have exhaustively documented the modern-day hydro turbulence that marks this period. So we all know the challenges are many, and they're substantial. But despite the headwinds, Snap-on stayed on the train, and that momentum shines through in the quarter across all our groups, all of them. C&I, growing 7.9% organically, extending its position in the critical with robust gains in North America and Asia Pacific, overcoming the variations in Europe, registering an OI margin of 14.7%, the strongest since the supply chain disruptions began in earnest, demonstrating continuing progress. The Tools Group. We believe the franchise network is stronger and more capable than ever. Sales up 7.4% organically. OI margins 20.6%, down 20 points, but against 40 basis points of unfavorable currency and representing a rise of 680 basis points above 2019. RS&I aggressively expanding with repair shop owners and managers, growing organically 17.2% over last year and 27.2% over the pre-virus era. And the OI margin was a strong 23%, and it all ends up to ongoing and ongoing upward trend for the corporation. Activity rising 10.4% organically versus last year and up 22.8%, compared with 2019. OI margin for the corporation was 20.2%, up 90 basis points from last year and 170 basis points above the pre-pandemic level. And one final testimony you know, straight. The EPS was $4.14, a significant gain of 16% versus 2021 and 39.9% over 2019. It was an encouraging quarter, and we are convinced it's an extremely promising future. You see, we believe that the resilience of our markets, co-authored by critical tasks and changing technologies will drive opportunity against the win. We believe that our strength in customer connection and innovative products and in the special power of our brand, will position Snap-on to fully participate in those possibilities. We believe that the considerable capability of our experienced team can navigate to any turbulence, and we believe that these are unique advantages that will maintain our substantial momentum, breaking barrier after barrier, reaching new highs through the remainder of this year on into 2023 and well beyond. Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. As always, I know many of you are listening in. The encouraging performance, we detailed here today, was made possible only by your individual and your efforts and your collective actions for your extraordinary success in authoring another strong Snap-on quarter, you have my congratulations. For the unique skills and capabilities you're display and overcoming the challenges of these days, you have my aberration, and for your unwavering confidence in our future and your continuing commitment to our team, you have my thanks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?\nSara Verbsky: Caroline, can we take our first question?\nOperator: Yes. Sure. So we will take the first question from line of Gary from Barrington. The line is open now. Please go ahead.\nGary Prestopino: Hi, good morning, everyone. Hey, a couple of things here. Could you, first of all, quantify how much currency impacted EPS this quarter?\nAldo Pagliari: It was $0.09, Gary.\nNick Pinchuk: $0.09. $0.09.\nGary Prestopino: Okay. Thank you. And then Nick, you mentioned that there was some pretty good robust order flow out of the conference that you had this year. Can you maybe give us a quantifiable range of what that was year-over-year? And then where was there really particular interest in the part of the franchisees and specific Tool Groups? Was it storage, diagnostic, just general households, whatever.\nNick Pinchuk: I'll tell you that I had heard like somebody mentioned double-digits versus last year. But look, I want to quickly say, these are orders. They're not sales, people order. And so we had a pretty robust number. And I don't like to say the real amount here, the exact number, it was pretty good. It's dangerous to extrapolate because they are orders. But orders of that level are better than the point eye with a sharp stick, I'll tell you that. So, we feel pretty good about this. Where it was ordered, I think tool storage was terrific in this quarter. Hand tools were very strong. And the big packs did pretty well. Big packs are kind of a comprehensive thing that people order. So, we saw in those categories. I think everything did pretty well, but the big ticket items were kind of good in this particular quarter. -- SFC as they were in the quarter, big ticket items were strong enough.\nGary Prestopino: Okay. And then you're kind of breaking up there, but I think--\nNick Pinchuk: I'll say it again. Big orders. They were big order, something like double-digit, they are order. And secondly, generally, I think if you ask me to make a couple -- I think the big ticket items were pretty strong for us. And -- but generally, we have these things, Gary, called big packs where franchisees order comprehensive arrays of tools, hand tools and so on and so they were also pretty strong. So, hand tools are pretty good.\nGary Prestopino: Okay. And then just one last one, if I may. In terms of diagnostics, your diagnostic tools at this point, fairly drive train agnostic, or do you actually have a specialized diagnostic product that is just systemic to electric vehicles.\nNick Pinchuk: No, no, no. We would probably not do that. We would probably have -- we would put them in -- we would put all types of drivetrains in one tool. We wouldn't necessarily have one because you do it now. You have hybrids and you have -- you'd have -- you have anything in the product. The beauty of the diagnostic unit is you can repair anything. So, part of the idea is you plug it in, no matter what the car is, the model, the make, the type of thing. And so you try to have that in terms of comprehension around, in that situation. And we have the best -- we are the best, certainly in terms of comprehensive data. Coverage is--\nGary Prestopino: Okay. Thank you.\nNick Pinchuk: Yes, sure.\nGary Prestopino: Thank you so much.\nNick Pinchuk: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take the next question from line of Bret Jordan from Jefferies. The line is open now, please go ahead.\nBret Jordan: Hey good morning guys.\nNick Pinchuk: Good morning.\nBret Jordan: Nick, you talked about RCI opportunities at the van level, I think, in the prepared remarks. Could you talk about maybe in greater detail what you're doing there?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, there's a couple of things. I mean one of the things we're getting better at applying social media. So, the idea behind social media, it's a big RCI opportunity because of the better we can pre-brief the customers. So, when we enter the shops, the customer kind of knows the product, he knows the -- and we have a lot of promotions. So, he knows the promotion. So, the franchisee can spend his limited time with that particular individual, customizing why those characteristics mean a lot to them, and he can use them. And so that is really one huge thing. It's one of the things that we're getting better at day-by-day, but it has driven some of our capabilities in those kinds of situations. There's other things in terms of collections, in terms of taking inventories on the vans in terms of adjusting the computer system. So, it's easier to use and quicker those kinds of things in ways in which they can status their orders, which is a big deal these days because you've got a lot of people clamoring for product, and they're looking for it. So those are the kinds of things.\nBret Jordan: Okay. And then, Aldo, a quick question on the financial services. You've mentioned sort of higher provisions. Could you talk about maybe what you're seeing and a cadence of what you're seeing as far as the credit books, are the mechanics -- I mean, obviously, the wage growth has been great, but is there sort of broader pressure on the credit side.\nAldo Pagliari: Bret, good question. We actually saw exceptionally strong performance in 2020, 2021. You read about it from other people as well that people service their debt in a more aggressive fashion, bringing it down and people were more current than ever in servicing debt. So we had unusually low provisions in 2021 and in 2020, in the back half of 2020. What you see now is kind of a return to a more normal pace. And even in the quarter, based on comparing it to 2017, 2018, 2019, the rate of provision is still less than that era. So in the quarter, they're performing well. I mean, it's a very typical performance that we're seeing. And all the leading indicators still give rise to the fact that we think we'll do okay in the credit company.\nBret Jordan: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take the next question from the line of Scott Stember from MKM Partners. The line is open now, please go ahead.\nScott Stember: Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Can you talk about sell-in to the channel, the van channel versus sell-out? Is it fair to assume that things are pretty much one for one, or was there any coming\u2026\nNick Pinchuk: Yeah. In each quarter, it varies from time to time, but this quarter was sort of right on, pretty much the same. Maybe even, yeah, I'd say, right on, maybe even a little better, but not -- for government work, you can say, sell-in and sell-out was about the same.\nScott Stember: All right. And then, RS&I, you talked about undercar equipment. Can you maybe give a little more granularity? Was that related to collision repair, or was that just everything?\nNick Pinchuk: Actually, everything is sell-in for undercar. It's one of the things that derive -- the collision repair is a star in this era. I think it's driven by the idea that collision, the cars now has that neural network of sensors. So every time -- if you just dent bumper, it's thousands of dollars of repair, because you've got to recalibrate everything and so on. So collision shops got to upgrade to take advantage of that to be actually be able to effectively, not only restore shape but put things back into operating performance. But also, the other businesses we're selling via the other products like lifts, just basic lifts, which you would think would be the most vanilla of products in the situation are selling quite well. So I think it's on collisions shops, as the situation, but also repair shops in general are seeing the future, and they are pumped about this. Like I said, I think even the dealerships are starting to get over the idea, they don't have cars to sell and are turning to repair.\nScott Stember: Got it. And just last question. Obviously, you guys have put up some stellar results the last couple of years, but the uncertainty for next year with a recession. Could you just give us an idea of what we should look out for a potential canary in the coal mine that we need to look at that will give us an early warning sign?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, first of all, I have to say, though, I think when you walk in the garage, you don't hear a recession. It's like when you watch the -- when you watch the programs like Score Box [ph] in the morning, every 10 words are recession -- every 10th word is for recession. You don't hear that in the factories of the -- among the people of work. You just don't hear it. They're really robust about this. But -- if you're talking about canary in the coal mine, if you looked at the last -- each one is different. But certainly, the last ordinary recession that wasn't open. You would see a reduction maybe in bigger ticket items perhaps, because of the confidence in the future. Generally, repair needs to go on. It's essentially doing it, but people might be packing to shorter payback items and longer payback items when they're a little more uncertain about the future. That happens in the financial recession. Now as it turns out in the quarter, our big ticket items were robust.\nScott Stember: Got it. That\u2019s all I have. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take the next question from line of Luke Junk from Baird. The line is open now. Please go ahead.\nLuke Junk: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First, Nick, just curious to get your perspective on investment in posture of the company given the macro backdrop, thinking, especially with regards to maintaining the momentum that you've got in the Tools Group right now. And as we look outside the Tools Group as well, it's just some of the key considerations around investment if we do get into a choppier macro in RS&I and C&I as well?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, look, I don't think, and I now have been -- I've been through two big downturns; one, the financial recession, and two, the COVID, if you can call it. And I don't remember restricting our investment in the business. I do not remember that. If we wanted to do it, if we thought it was important for the future, if these was efficacious for our customers, we were able to do it. Because Snap-on, maybe you get a little -- you're off the bubble a little bit, but we've never really been restricted in a recession. And those are two big ones, two big wins. And so I don't anticipate doing that. I anticipate our ability to keep investing in the business. We might tighten our belt in terms of travel and things, other things people do. But if you're talking about investing in a business, we said last time, we kept going, we kept investing in product and brand and people. We didn't lay anybody off. And that's what we did. And that's why we came out of the reception stronger. So we do the same thing.\nLuke Junk: Okay. Thanks for that. Really a question around margins and profitability going into next year. And the question is around recovering price cost, clearly, we can see the impacts of higher material prices and other costs in the quarter here in 3Q. And I'm just wondering, as we turn the page to next year, especially in C&I, where I know your ability to recover cost real time is limited just given the nature of the customers and the contracts, how you're positioning going into those conversations next year. And then also in the Tools Group, of course, just how much price elasticity do you think there is in that business today?\nNick Pinchuk: I think we certainly -- let me take the Tools Group first. I think there's -- and Tools Group, I said many times, we control the customer interface. We believe we can price for visible inflation. We were pretty satisfied, we were pretty encouraged by this quarter. Third quarter -- I've said this like in 15 third quarters that I've been on this call, it's always squarely. So the idea is -- I thought the Tools Group had a great -- a very encouraging third quarter, especially against the currency, and being up over 2019. If you come to C&I, yes, it's a little bit more viscous in terms of pricing. But if you look at C&I, I think we thought 7.9% up organically. It's pretty good. It's starting to break out of the problem and the 14.7% OI margin, while down year-over-year is the highest since we actually started getting this turbulence. So we see -- when we step back on it, we see C&I fighting against these turbulences, both geographically and sector-wise. But we see them winning the war and moving forward, and we would consider that to happen. If you look at cost overall, generally, there's a lot of variation in this, but steel cost -- for example, some steel costs are down now. So you're going to start seeing that versus last year. Others are down versus the peak, but not down versus last year. So you're going to see variation going forward, but it's got to be an easing of the situation, at least a more positive situation. The worry about C&I is the ability of getting things and getting them delivered when you have those hundred tool -- 100-unit complex kits to deliver, and you have to have them all in place before you send out the kit. And so that can be devil C&I. That's the major battle for them. But I feel pretty confident about the situation. I think things are getting better.\nLuke Junk: Thanks to that. And then if I can sneak it in, just a quick question for Aldo, on the credit business. And what I'm hoping -- I already got a question on this, but I just want to ask it a little bit differently in terms of parsing out decrease in credit income, especially the provision-related impacts on a year-over-year basis. Can you just help us understand the moving pieces there between mechanical moving pieces as things normalize post COVID, and separately changes in your assumptions around underlying credit that's driving the change? Just trying to square that with what are clearly still very low delinquency rates. Thank you.\nAldo Pagliari: I would just say at the highest level -- look, I'd say a way to look back that. When the world broke into the era of COVID, there was a lot of trepidation as to what does that mean. And looking backwards, you probably have a period, including Snap-on, where we over reserved and the provisions were probably higher than that was necessary. And as a result of that, when you actually see the proof as it played out, that you didn't require those, you had been a need for lower provisions in 2021. And now you're starting to get back to what I call a more normal pace of activity. And if you look at the portfolio itself, it's got a little bit better credit characteristics. What I mean by that is maybe $1 of conservatism on the part of who we granted credit to, so it's less high-risk candidates in the pool. And people's FICA scores have improved marginally. So again, at a macro 30,000-foot level, there's probably a slightly less amount of credit risk in the portfolio. And therefore, as you go forward in these trends, I think it's kind of getting back to norm for lack of a better word, with that macro backdrop that Nick just described.\nLuke Junk: Okay. Great. Thank you for that following-up.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take the last question from David MacGregor. The line is open now. Please go ahead.\nDavid MacGregor: Yes. Good morning, everyone. Can you hear me, okay?\nNick Pinchuk: Yes, I can hear you.\nDavid MacGregor: All right, wonderful. Hi, Nick.\nNick Pinchuk: Hi. How are you doing?\nDavid MacGregor: I guess -- I am doing well, thanks. I hope you are as well.\nNick Pinchuk: Yes, we are doing okay.\nDavid MacGregor: Good stuff. I wanted to just build on that last question. And a question with respect to the tools segment. And you reported 7.4% growth. And to the extent that you are sort of maintaining pace with inflation, that would suggest that the bulk of that was pricing, and volume might have been up kind of low single-digit kind of numbers. And so I guess...\nNick Pinchuk: That's not \u2013 but okay. Go ahead.\nDavid MacGregor: But we'll start with that. Yes, go ahead. Go ahead.\nNick Pinchuk: No. I -- we don't think -- we think pricing ends up being around -- we do a list price, but the list prices don't all flow, and then we've got the -- it doesn't all hold. And then we've got the promotions, which go out and some of them are leaner and some of them are more rich. And so you have that. And then you've got new products that are rolling through the system and they get repriced. So when we look -- we all said and done, we would say that tools may be getting half of that in price or maybe a little bit less. That's the way we see it. It doesn't -- you can't really just look at the list price because it gets so complicated in looking at that. But our best guess is that it's around that number. So okay, you see -- okay. Yes, it's not 7.4% volume growth, but it's certainly not zero.\nDavid MacGregor: Sure. No, I understand. So, if we assume maybe prices is maybe 300 basis points and you got 400 basis points --\nNick Pinchuk: Maybe.\nDavid MacGregor: Yes, sounds like it. And then you got 400 basis points of volume growth. And it sounds like from what you said earlier in the call that inventory on the trucks was pretty stable, but it was pretty even growth between the wholesale and the retail I guess I'm just trying to reconcile the 11% originations growth, which suggests that big ticket was up very, very large. And the implication of that would be that maybe smaller ticket or hand tools was mathematically a negative number, but maybe I'm misunderstanding that.\nNick Pinchuk: David, yes, that's cool, but that's not true. The thing is that remember, you got pricing also rolling through those things year-over-year, the same way you did that calculation on the overall number, you got some of that. But tool storage was strong. But you've got other small ticket items. You've got power tools, you got, what we call shop-in tech, which is a myriad of other things that we might sell like lights and pressure gauges and things like that. And so you have a lot of things that go to that. But if you want to pinpoint on hand tools, I'll tell you hand tools is good in the quarter, up double-digits again. So, generally, the core products were okay. The things that are normal. That's what happened in that situation.\nDavid MacGregor: Okay. Thanks for addressing that. Sorry, go ahead.\nNick Pinchuk: No. No, no. Go ahead. Go ahead. I'm trying to answer your question. Go ahead.\nDavid MacGregor: Sure. I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of -- within your credit business, I don't think there's ever really many serious questions about the quality of credit in this portfolio. You guys have always done a fantastic job of managing that, and I expect that will be the case going forward. Could you foresee any circumstances whatsoever where you would consider lowering what you charge on extended credit from that 17%, 18% yield to something that's maybe a little more a little more accessible for service for all these...\nNick Pinchuk: We always think about these things, David. We review it all the time. But in reality, we've kind of held there, and it's worked for us for a long time. And so I think we are -- we think it's appropriate for the credit profile of the people we deal with. And so we haven't changed anything in that macro in a long time. So, when you look back and you look at the performance of the credit company, it really isn't marked by major changes in the core model. It's generally been the same. Now, it isn't that we don't review it or anything, but I don't think we're seeing ourselves do that right now anyway.\nDavid MacGregor: Yes, good. Thanks for addressing my questions. Appreciate it.\nNick Pinchuk: Sure. Okay.\nEnd of Q&A:\nSara Verbsky: And that was our final question. Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-On. Good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Nick Pinchuk",
            "content": "Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I'll start the call by covering the highlights of the third quarter. I'll give you an update on the environment and the trends we see. I'll take you through some of the turbulence we've encountered, thinking about our performance. Aldo will provide a more detailed [Technical Difficulty] The story of the Snap-on -- apparently we have some cross talk we're hearing here. But the story of the Snap-on quarter is momentum overcoming challenges. Momentum rooted in the resilience of our market, the capability of our great team and the tactical and strategic advantage in our product, our brand and our models, all coming together to create considerable and ongoing strength. In effect, the third quarter once again demonstrated our ability to continue a trajectory of positive results despite the headwinds, and the numbers, they say it so. Our reported sales in the quarter of $1.125 billion were up $64.8 million or 6.2% versus last year, including $39.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency. Organic sales grew 10.4%, with gains in every group, our ninth straight quarter of year-over-year expansion. And if you compare it to the pre-pandemic levels of 2029 -- 2019, you see a clear and unmistakable upward drive, versus 2019 sales we're up 3% as reported and 2.8% organically, continuing our positive trend and accelerating our expansion, demonstrating that we're only getting stronger every day. I did say momentum. Quarter also bears the mark of Snap-on value creation processes, safety, a lot of the customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement or RCI. Once again, they all combine to offer significant progress. And progress to what, Opco operating income of $223.5 million increased $22.2 million from last year, and the Opco operating margin was 20.3%, up 90 basis points from last year and rising 170 basis points over 2019. For financial services, operating income of $66.4 million compared to the $70.6 million of last year, a decrease reflecting the forecasted return to more usual provision levels. And that result, combined with Opco for a consolidated margin of 24.4%, up 20 basis points from last year and 120 basis point improvement from 2019. The quarterly EPS, it was $4.14, rising 16% over the $3.57 from a year ago and 39.9% over the $2.96 days recorded in 2019, a significant gain. I said it before, and I'll say it again. We believe Snap-on is stronger now than when we entered this great withering, and the third quarter results are an unmistakable confirmation of that fact. Well, those are the numbers. Now let's speak about the markets. Auto repair continues to remain strong. The key metrics are all favorable, spending on vehicle maintenance repair, the vehicle technician and technician wage is up, up and up again. And so wonder, it's no wonder the repair industry is resilient. Repair spending is rising. The cars are more complex. They need more repairs, and it costs more. The technician count is at its highest point in three decades, and shop owners keep telling me they need more, many more. Wages continue to grow, and they simply reflect the increased demand for the skills that are now necessary to complete critical repair tasks. It's never been more evident that repairing a modern vehicle with the new technology is difficult. It's an exercise of extraordinary skill. And the salaries are rising to show it. Auto repair is resilient. When I meet up with the people at the shop, as I often do, our franchisees and our technician customers, you can feel their exception in the now and their confidence in the future. And they're making sure they can participate in that future by being ready with the tools they need. Vehicle repair, it's a space filled with opportunity. You can hear it in the optimism in the voices of the shop, and you can see it clearly confirmed in Snap-on's performance. But it's not just the text, shop owners are also a big -- shop owners and managers are also big players in the horizon repair. And our Repair Systems and Information group are RS&I is positioned to take advantage. Everybody knows that cars are scarce. New and used. But for Snap-on, that doesn't matter. Repair and collision shops are busy. It's a tool we like very much. And it's evident in the rising sales of our undercar equipment and collision businesses, both strong. You have a repair shop today, you see a bright future with changing technologies, and you want to be ready, new vehicles are being released with a greater variety of drivetrains than ever from internal combustion engines to hybrid to plug-in electric to full electric. And the range of options is growing: more driver assist, more vehicle automation, increasing vehicle complexity, and we're ready to help the repair shops keep pace with powerful products like a range of fast track intelligence diagnostics, the Zeus, the Triton, the Apollo Handheld, enabling repair at all levels, like our celebrated Mitchell 1 ProDemand repair information, our award-winning Tru-Point advanced driver assistant calibration system and our 3D alignment systems like the new Hofmann Geoliner, all representing new technologies, and all wheeled big databases deployed to make work easier in the shop. Vehicle repair looks more promising than ever and Snap-On's position to capitalize. Now let's talk about the critical industries where the Snap-On rolls -- the Snap-On brand rolls out of the garage solving tasks of consequence. This is where commercial industrial C&I operates with our broadest region into international markets, and with the locations impacted the most by the challenges of the day. I mean C&I is headwind headquarters, supply chain disruption rising -- rises in commodity costs, uncertain fuel supply, currency fluctuations, continuing COVID lockdowns, troubled economies and war in Ukraine, well, C&I had it all. But it rolls to the occasion. And in the quarter, the group took some lumps in Europe, but over came with strong gains in North America and in Asia, despite the difficulties. And while the military sector is still down, C&I's critical industries -- the other C&I critical industries are all showing life. So I describe our C&I markets as challenged in certain geographies but demonstrating continuing gains and having strong and ongoing possibilities going forward. And coupled with our auto repair related businesses, we believe there is clear and compelling opportunity along our runways for growth, enhancing the band network, expanding with repair shop owners and managers, extending the critical industries and building in emerging markets. And in this quarter, we've seen that potential pay off nicely. At the same time, it's clear that we have ongoing possibilities on our runways for improvement. The Snap-On Value Creation processes. They've never been more important, helping to counter the turbulence of the day. Especially important is with customer connection, understanding the work of professional technicians and innovation, matching that insight with technology, driving new products. And just this quarter, Snap-On was prominently recognized with five PTEN, Professional Tool & Equipment News innovation awards. And we were also honored with two MOTOR Magazine Top Tool awards. An essential driver of our growth is innovative products that make work easier, and the awards, hard one. Our testimony that great Snap-On products just keep coming, matching the growing complexity of the task becoming more essential to technicians and driving our positive results. Now let's turn to the segments. In the C&I group. Sales in the quarter of $356.8 million were up 1.5% or $5.4 million as reported versus 2021, including a $26.2 million or 7.9% organic uplift, operating progress across all divisions, which was offset partially by $20.8 million in unfavorable foreign currency. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income of $52.3 million, including $2.1 million of unfavorable currency represents a decrease of $1.3 million compared to 2021. The effects of volume gains were more than offset by the substantial impact of currency and by supply chain inefficiencies. The OI margin was 14.7%, down from last year, but still representing the highest level since the rise of the significant supply turbulence. Compared with the pre-pandemic level, sales were up 7.7% organically, and the OI margin of 14.7% was up 30 basis points despite a 60 basis point negative impact of acquisitions, and unfavorable currency. Now we remain committed to extending in critical industries, the C&I sweet spot, and we'll keep strengthening our position to capture those opportunities as they arise and enabling that intent is our expanding C&I lineup of innovative products, designed specifically to make critical work easy. One example is our brushless CT9015 18-volt drill. It's newest member of our Monster, the lithium family aimed at industrial manufacturing and repair professionals, enabling work with the toughest materials, 470-inch pounds of torque, enough to handle even hardened alloys, 2,000 RPMs, speed to get the job done quickly. And with heavy duty \u2013 with the heavy-duty gearing and the enhanced cooling, this tool is rugged, durable, even in extreme use. The 9015 also offers an 18-speed clutch, a variable speed trigger, a two-speed gearbox, all for precise control, a feature that's essential for serious drilling, for professional drilling. And the 18-volt battery with 5 watt-hour ensures consistent output and extended run time in effect, less charging for a more efficient workday. Tools also fitted with a 100 lumen head light, helping technician work \u2013 helping technicians work in dark environments just what's needed for those coal sub jobs. The CT9015 has got power, speed, precision and durability. It's a great tool and a text know it. They've already made the new drill one of our $1 million hit products. So that's C&I., continued progress against the turbulence. Now on to the Tools Group. The team just keeps driving upward, leaving the pre-pandemic levels behind by a wider distance every quarter. Sales of $496.6 million were up $25.2 million or 5.3% over 2021. Organic growth of $34.1 million, or 7.4%, partially offset by $8.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency. The operating margin was 20.6%, down slightly, 20 basis points, but overcoming a 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency. Compared with pre-virus 2019, sales were $111.4 million or 28.9%, including a $113 million or 29.5% organic gain, and this quarter's 20.6% operating margin was up 680 basis points versus 2019, coming out of the pandemic stronger indeed. The Tools Group is responding to the challenges of the day, increasing its product advantage, fortifying its brands, further enabling the franchisees, guiding them to more selling capacity, and it's all working. You can witness it in any time you meet the franchisees. One big opportunity for that is our annual Snap-on Franchisee Conference, or SFC, held this year at the Gaylord Texan Hotel in Dallas. The theme was breaking barriers. It's a reminder of our record franchisee performance driving ever upward over the last nine quarters, and it's a recognition of the clear opportunity to reach even greater heights going forward, almost \u2013 yes, almost 8,000 individuals attended. And I can tell you, they were pumped, excited by the products more than three football fields of our latest offerings were on display, all available for viewing, handling and ordering in order they did, setting new records that we can also offer a variety of training seminars, where franchisees were able to sharpen and expand their skills to selling the full range of our complex and broad product line. It's an important movement. We say we're working to expand the selling capacities are advance, the SFC is a big part of that effort, and Dallas was another great step forward to that end. You can bet. You can bet on it. Our entire team departed this year's get together and Dallas educated, energized and eager to extend the Snap-on difference, reaching new individual and collective levels of success throughout the base to come. They left excited and strong. The Dallas SFC will lead to breaking barriers. The franchisees' enthusiasm for their businesses and their confidence in their future will make it so. During the SFC, the Tools Group presented the newest addition to the Snap-on ratchet lineup, our FLLF80, a three-inch drive extra-long locking flex-head ratchet. This new innovation provides easy access to superior turning power. Our patented duality technology makes it stronger. And the 20-inch length, the longest in the category, provides even greater -- provides great ability to reach deeper in a crowded spaces, extending reach and increasing leverages. It's a great addition to any toolbox. And as an added bonus, the new patent-pending, self-cleaning feature vanishes dirt and grind ensuring that the flex-head locks firmly in place at even -- at any angle even under high-stress applications. The X80 is a special offering, access, leverage and stability in one rachet. The initial launch exceeded $1 million is to hit product and sales. And volume continues to move forward upward on a steep trajectory beyond product. We spend time working to expand the franchisee selling capacity, harnessing social media, improving product training, RCI and the van operations. It's been effective. So capacity is clearly on the rise. And you can see it in the results. The Tools Group is on a very positive trend, ascending and leaving pre-pandemic levels well behind. And as we said in the SFC, it's breaking new barriers right now, and we believe it will all continue. Now on to RS&I. Sales were sales of $414 million, were up $14.9 [ph] million or 13.6%, including $60.8 million or 17.2% organic uplift. Growth was weighted toward undercar equipment and sales for the OEM dealerships, but our information and diagnostics businesses were also players in the year-over-year improvement. RCI, RS&I operating earnings were $95.4 million, representing a $12.1 million increase versus 2021, and the operating margin was up 10 basis points from last year to 23%. Compared with 2019, sales grew $91.3 million or $0.82, including an $86 million or 27.2% organic gain. Operating margin was down 20 [ph] basis points versus 2019, primarily reflecting the business mix and the acquisitions. But at 23%, it was still strong. We see significant potential in our size runways for growth, expanding Snap-on's presence in garage with coherent acquisitions and with a broad array of powerful products, and the industry experts feel the same. In fact, our TRITON D10, Fast Track intelligence diagnostic units was just selected for amazing top two award and rightly so. The trend is ideal deal for shop owners and for general technicians, it provides a comprehensive system verification to identify troubled areas, and to diagnostic testing to pinpoint repair actions and a powerful lab scope to confirm component level functionality, all in one package. The D10 advanced scoping -- the D10's advanced scoping capability helps users dig deep into the vehicle systems and evaluate performance with the comparative data, and it's Fast Track intelligent diagnostics, greatly shortcut the work and streamlines the repair processes, making shops more productive, more profitable. Unit also offers a rugged hardware explicitly designed for -- you expect this from Snap-on. The unit also offers rugged hardware explicitly designed for shop environments -- tough shop environment, a super-fast, two-second boot-up, and a 10-inch touchscreen. It all comes together for unprecedented reliability and speed and ease of use. It's a -- I'm telling you, the technicians will tell you, it's a [indiscernible] product. And with the selection of the TRITON motor magazine -- and with the selection of the TRITON, motor magazines, now recognized Snap-on diagnostic units in 22 of the last 23 years. 22 of the last 23 years, we believe it's more testimony that RS&I is stronger than ever in shops and dealerships. Well, that's the highlights for our quarter. Tools Group, strong progress. C&I recording a positive performance and an upward trajectory against the variations across industries and geographies. And RS&I, expanding profitable volume with repair shop owners and managers, staff on overall sales rising again, 10.4% and 22.8% organically versus last year and the pre-pandemic level, respectively, continuing clear and positive growth. OpCo operating margins, a robust 20.3% rising again this quarter, up 90 basis points. EPS, $4.14 up versus last year and accelerated well beyond pre-pandemic levels. It was another encouraging quarter. Now, I'll turn the call over to Al. Aldo? Thanks, Aldo. Well, it was quite a quarter. A staggering number of media pieces have exhaustively documented the modern-day hydro turbulence that marks this period. So we all know the challenges are many, and they're substantial. But despite the headwinds, Snap-on stayed on the train, and that momentum shines through in the quarter across all our groups, all of them. C&I, growing 7.9% organically, extending its position in the critical with robust gains in North America and Asia Pacific, overcoming the variations in Europe, registering an OI margin of 14.7%, the strongest since the supply chain disruptions began in earnest, demonstrating continuing progress. The Tools Group. We believe the franchise network is stronger and more capable than ever. Sales up 7.4% organically. OI margins 20.6%, down 20 points, but against 40 basis points of unfavorable currency and representing a rise of 680 basis points above 2019. RS&I aggressively expanding with repair shop owners and managers, growing organically 17.2% over last year and 27.2% over the pre-virus era. And the OI margin was a strong 23%, and it all ends up to ongoing and ongoing upward trend for the corporation. Activity rising 10.4% organically versus last year and up 22.8%, compared with 2019. OI margin for the corporation was 20.2%, up 90 basis points from last year and 170 basis points above the pre-pandemic level. And one final testimony you know, straight. The EPS was $4.14, a significant gain of 16% versus 2021 and 39.9% over 2019. It was an encouraging quarter, and we are convinced it's an extremely promising future. You see, we believe that the resilience of our markets, co-authored by critical tasks and changing technologies will drive opportunity against the win. We believe that our strength in customer connection and innovative products and in the special power of our brand, will position Snap-on to fully participate in those possibilities. We believe that the considerable capability of our experienced team can navigate to any turbulence, and we believe that these are unique advantages that will maintain our substantial momentum, breaking barrier after barrier, reaching new highs through the remainder of this year on into 2023 and well beyond. Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. As always, I know many of you are listening in. The encouraging performance, we detailed here today, was made possible only by your individual and your efforts and your collective actions for your extraordinary success in authoring another strong Snap-on quarter, you have my congratulations. For the unique skills and capabilities you're display and overcoming the challenges of these days, you have my aberration, and for your unwavering confidence in our future and your continuing commitment to our team, you have my thanks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? $0.09. $0.09. I'll tell you that I had heard like somebody mentioned double-digits versus last year. But look, I want to quickly say, these are orders. They're not sales, people order. And so we had a pretty robust number. And I don't like to say the real amount here, the exact number, it was pretty good. It's dangerous to extrapolate because they are orders. But orders of that level are better than the point eye with a sharp stick, I'll tell you that. So, we feel pretty good about this. Where it was ordered, I think tool storage was terrific in this quarter. Hand tools were very strong. And the big packs did pretty well. Big packs are kind of a comprehensive thing that people order. So, we saw in those categories. I think everything did pretty well, but the big ticket items were kind of good in this particular quarter. -- SFC as they were in the quarter, big ticket items were strong enough. I'll say it again. Big orders. They were big order, something like double-digit, they are order. And secondly, generally, I think if you ask me to make a couple -- I think the big ticket items were pretty strong for us. And -- but generally, we have these things, Gary, called big packs where franchisees order comprehensive arrays of tools, hand tools and so on and so they were also pretty strong. So, hand tools are pretty good. No, no, no. We would probably not do that. We would probably have -- we would put them in -- we would put all types of drivetrains in one tool. We wouldn't necessarily have one because you do it now. You have hybrids and you have -- you'd have -- you have anything in the product. The beauty of the diagnostic unit is you can repair anything. So, part of the idea is you plug it in, no matter what the car is, the model, the make, the type of thing. And so you try to have that in terms of comprehension around, in that situation. And we have the best -- we are the best, certainly in terms of comprehensive data. Coverage is-- Yes, sure. Sure. Good morning. Well, there's a couple of things. I mean one of the things we're getting better at applying social media. So, the idea behind social media, it's a big RCI opportunity because of the better we can pre-brief the customers. So, when we enter the shops, the customer kind of knows the product, he knows the -- and we have a lot of promotions. So, he knows the promotion. So, the franchisee can spend his limited time with that particular individual, customizing why those characteristics mean a lot to them, and he can use them. And so that is really one huge thing. It's one of the things that we're getting better at day-by-day, but it has driven some of our capabilities in those kinds of situations. There's other things in terms of collections, in terms of taking inventories on the vans in terms of adjusting the computer system. So, it's easier to use and quicker those kinds of things in ways in which they can status their orders, which is a big deal these days because you've got a lot of people clamoring for product, and they're looking for it. So those are the kinds of things. Yeah. In each quarter, it varies from time to time, but this quarter was sort of right on, pretty much the same. Maybe even, yeah, I'd say, right on, maybe even a little better, but not -- for government work, you can say, sell-in and sell-out was about the same. Actually, everything is sell-in for undercar. It's one of the things that derive -- the collision repair is a star in this era. I think it's driven by the idea that collision, the cars now has that neural network of sensors. So every time -- if you just dent bumper, it's thousands of dollars of repair, because you've got to recalibrate everything and so on. So collision shops got to upgrade to take advantage of that to be actually be able to effectively, not only restore shape but put things back into operating performance. But also, the other businesses we're selling via the other products like lifts, just basic lifts, which you would think would be the most vanilla of products in the situation are selling quite well. So I think it's on collisions shops, as the situation, but also repair shops in general are seeing the future, and they are pumped about this. Like I said, I think even the dealerships are starting to get over the idea, they don't have cars to sell and are turning to repair. Well, first of all, I have to say, though, I think when you walk in the garage, you don't hear a recession. It's like when you watch the -- when you watch the programs like Score Box [ph] in the morning, every 10 words are recession -- every 10th word is for recession. You don't hear that in the factories of the -- among the people of work. You just don't hear it. They're really robust about this. But -- if you're talking about canary in the coal mine, if you looked at the last -- each one is different. But certainly, the last ordinary recession that wasn't open. You would see a reduction maybe in bigger ticket items perhaps, because of the confidence in the future. Generally, repair needs to go on. It's essentially doing it, but people might be packing to shorter payback items and longer payback items when they're a little more uncertain about the future. That happens in the financial recession. Now as it turns out in the quarter, our big ticket items were robust. Well, look, I don't think, and I now have been -- I've been through two big downturns; one, the financial recession, and two, the COVID, if you can call it. And I don't remember restricting our investment in the business. I do not remember that. If we wanted to do it, if we thought it was important for the future, if these was efficacious for our customers, we were able to do it. Because Snap-on, maybe you get a little -- you're off the bubble a little bit, but we've never really been restricted in a recession. And those are two big ones, two big wins. And so I don't anticipate doing that. I anticipate our ability to keep investing in the business. We might tighten our belt in terms of travel and things, other things people do. But if you're talking about investing in a business, we said last time, we kept going, we kept investing in product and brand and people. We didn't lay anybody off. And that's what we did. And that's why we came out of the reception stronger. So we do the same thing. I think we certainly -- let me take the Tools Group first. I think there's -- and Tools Group, I said many times, we control the customer interface. We believe we can price for visible inflation. We were pretty satisfied, we were pretty encouraged by this quarter. Third quarter -- I've said this like in 15 third quarters that I've been on this call, it's always squarely. So the idea is -- I thought the Tools Group had a great -- a very encouraging third quarter, especially against the currency, and being up over 2019. If you come to C&I, yes, it's a little bit more viscous in terms of pricing. But if you look at C&I, I think we thought 7.9% up organically. It's pretty good. It's starting to break out of the problem and the 14.7% OI margin, while down year-over-year is the highest since we actually started getting this turbulence. So we see -- when we step back on it, we see C&I fighting against these turbulences, both geographically and sector-wise. But we see them winning the war and moving forward, and we would consider that to happen. If you look at cost overall, generally, there's a lot of variation in this, but steel cost -- for example, some steel costs are down now. So you're going to start seeing that versus last year. Others are down versus the peak, but not down versus last year. So you're going to see variation going forward, but it's got to be an easing of the situation, at least a more positive situation. The worry about C&I is the ability of getting things and getting them delivered when you have those hundred tool -- 100-unit complex kits to deliver, and you have to have them all in place before you send out the kit. And so that can be devil C&I. That's the major battle for them. But I feel pretty confident about the situation. I think things are getting better. Yes, I can hear you. Hi. How are you doing? Yes, we are doing okay. That's not \u2013 but okay. Go ahead. No. I -- we don't think -- we think pricing ends up being around -- we do a list price, but the list prices don't all flow, and then we've got the -- it doesn't all hold. And then we've got the promotions, which go out and some of them are leaner and some of them are more rich. And so you have that. And then you've got new products that are rolling through the system and they get repriced. So when we look -- we all said and done, we would say that tools may be getting half of that in price or maybe a little bit less. That's the way we see it. It doesn't -- you can't really just look at the list price because it gets so complicated in looking at that. But our best guess is that it's around that number. So okay, you see -- okay. Yes, it's not 7.4% volume growth, but it's certainly not zero. Maybe. David, yes, that's cool, but that's not true. The thing is that remember, you got pricing also rolling through those things year-over-year, the same way you did that calculation on the overall number, you got some of that. But tool storage was strong. But you've got other small ticket items. You've got power tools, you got, what we call shop-in tech, which is a myriad of other things that we might sell like lights and pressure gauges and things like that. And so you have a lot of things that go to that. But if you want to pinpoint on hand tools, I'll tell you hand tools is good in the quarter, up double-digits again. So, generally, the core products were okay. The things that are normal. That's what happened in that situation. No. No, no. Go ahead. Go ahead. I'm trying to answer your question. Go ahead. We always think about these things, David. We review it all the time. But in reality, we've kind of held there, and it's worked for us for a long time. And so I think we are -- we think it's appropriate for the credit profile of the people we deal with. And so we haven't changed anything in that macro in a long time. So, when you look back and you look at the performance of the credit company, it really isn't marked by major changes in the core model. It's generally been the same. Now, it isn't that we don't review it or anything, but I don't think we're seeing ourselves do that right now anyway. Sure. Okay."

            "content": "Thanks Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on slide six. Net sales of $1.125 billion in the quarter increased 6.2% from 2021 levels, reflecting the 10.4% organic sales gain, partially offset by $39.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales gain this quarter reflects high single-digit growth in both the Snap-on Tools Group and the Commercial Industrial Group and double-digit gains in the repair systems and information group. This growth compares to the 8.4% year-over-year organic increase recorded last quarter. From a geographic perspective, continued sales strength in the United States and several emerging markets more than offset weaker demand in Europe. Consolidated gross margin of 48.3% declined 190 basis points from 50.2% last year. Higher material and other costs were partially offset by contributions from the increased sales volumes and pricing actions as well as benefits from the company's RCI initiatives, and 30 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects. Again, this quarter, we believe the corporation through pricing, and RCI actions continue to navigate effectively the cost and other supply chain dynamics of the current environment. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 28%, improved 280 basis points from 30.8% last year. The improvement is primarily due to sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating earnings from -- before financial services of $223.5 million in the quarter compared to $201.3 million in 2021. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 20.3% improved 90 basis points from last year. Financial services revenue of $87.3 million in the third quarter of 2022 was unchanged from last year. Operating earnings of $66.4 million decreased $4.2 million from 2021 levels, primarily as a result of higher provisions for credit losses than those recorded last year. Consolidated operating earnings of $289.9 million compared to $271.9 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 24.4%, compared to 24.2% in 2021. Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 21.6%, compared to 23.7% last year. The lower rate in the quarter was primarily due to tax benefits realized from the favorable settlements of income tax audits. Net earnings of $223.9 million or $4.14 per diluted share increased $27.7 million or $0.57 per share from last year's levels, representing a 16% increase in diluted earnings per share. Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with C&I group on Slide 7. Sales of $356.8 million increased from $351.4 million last year, reflecting a $26.2 million or 7.9% organic sales gain, partially offset by $20.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic growth primarily reflects double-digit gains in the segment to Asia Pacific operations and specialty torque business as well as a low single-digit increase in sales to customers in critical industries. Lower activity with the military was more than offset by gains in aviation, mining, power generation as well as in oil and gas. Gross margin of 36.9% declined 130 basis points from 38.2% in the third quarter of 2021. This is primarily due to increased material and other input costs, partially offset by benefits from the higher sales volumes and pricing actions and 20 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22.2% in the quarter improved 70 basis points from 22.9% in 2021, primarily due to the effects of sales volume leverage. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $52.3 million, compared to $53.6 million last year, the operating margin of 14.7%, compared to 15.3% a year ago. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $496.6 million increased 5.3% from $471.4 million in 2021, reflecting a 7.4% organic sales gain, partially offset by $8.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales growth reflects a high single-digit gain in our US business, which was partially offset by a low single-digit decrease in our international operations, the latter largely reflecting weakness in the United Kingdom. Gross margin of 44.9% in the quarter declined 90 basis points from 45.8% last year. The year-over-year decrease is primarily due to higher material and other costs, and 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by benefits from increased sales volumes and the pricing actions. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 24.3% improved 70 basis points from 25% last year, reflecting the benefits from higher sales volumes and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $102.2 million compared to $98.2 million last year. The operating margin of 20.6% compared to 20.8% in 2021 and to 13.8% in the pre-pandemic third quarter of 2019. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on slide nine. Sales of $414 million compared to $364.4 million a year ago, reflecting a 17.2% organic sales gain, partially offset by $11.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain is comprised of double-digit increases in activity with OEM dealerships, and in sales of undercar and collision repair equipment, and a low single-digit gain sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers. Gross margin of 42.9% declined 390 basis points from 46.8% last year. This is primarily due to higher material and other input costs and increased sales and lower gross margin businesses. These declines were partially offset by benefits from pricing actions and savings from RCI initiatives as well as 40 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 19.9% improved 400 basis points from 23.9% last year, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage, higher activity and lower expense businesses and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $95.4 million compared to $83.3 million last year. The operating margin of 23% improved 10 basis points from 22.9% reported a year ago. Now turning to slide 10. Revenue from financial services of $87.3 million, including $1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation was unchanged from last year. Financial services operating earnings of $66.4 million, including $800,000 of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $70.6 million in 2021. Financial services expenses of $20.9 million were up $4.2 million from 2021 levels, mostly due to $3.7 million of increased provisions for credit losses. While provisions have increased versus the historically lower provision rate experienced last year, we believe that loan portfolio trends remain stable. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 0.9% and 0.8% in the third quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively. In the third quarters of 2022 and 2021, respective average yields on finance receivables were 17.7% and 17.8%. In the third quarters of 2022 and 2021, the average yields on contract receivables were 8.6% and 8.5%, respectively. The blended yield for the portfolio was 15.8% in the third quarter of 2022, which is the same as last year. Total loan originations of $300.2 million in the third quarter increased to $30.9 million or 11.5% from 2021 levels, reflecting a 12.5% increase in originations of finance receivables and an 8% increase in originations of contract receivables. Moving to slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $2 billion from our US operation. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.5% for the United States extended credit compared to 1.4% in 2021 and 1.7% in the pre-pandemic period of 2019. On a sequential basis, the rate is up 10 basis points, reflecting the seasonal trend we typically experience between the second and third quarters. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $42.2 million represented 2.41% of outstandings at quarter end, and were down 7 basis points as compared to the same period last year. Now turning to slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $129.9 million in the quarter, compared to $186.4 million last year. The decrease from the third quarter of 2021 primarily reflects a $63.5 million increase in working investment. The change in working investment dollars is largely driven by greater demand, resulting in increased receivables and higher levels of inventory this year. In addition to demand-based requirements, the inventory increase also reflects higher in-transit inventory amounts as well as incremental buffer stocks associated with the supply chain dynamics in the current macro environment. Net cash used by investing activities of $57.9 million included net additions to finance receivables of $38.2 million and capital expenditures of $20 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $120.7 million included cash dividends of $75.7 million and the repurchase of 228,000 shares of common stock for $50.2 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $396 million of common stock under existing authorizations. Turning to slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $56.7 million from 2021 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 60 days compared to 58 days at 2021 year-end. Inventories increased $151.3 million from 2021 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.6 compared to 2.8 at year-end 2021 and 2.6 as of the pre-pandemic third quarter of 2019. Our quarter end cash position of $759.3 million compared to $380 million at year-end 2021. Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 9.3% compared to 9.1% at year-end 2021. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million available under our credit facilities. As of quarter end, there were no outstanding amounts under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for the remainder of 2022. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. In addition, we currently anticipate, absent any changes to US tax legislation, that our full year 2022 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%. I'll turn the call back over to Nick now for his closing thoughts. Nick? It was $0.09, Gary. Bret, good question. We actually saw exceptionally strong performance in 2020, 2021. You read about it from other people as well that people service their debt in a more aggressive fashion, bringing it down and people were more current than ever in servicing debt. So we had unusually low provisions in 2021 and in 2020, in the back half of 2020. What you see now is kind of a return to a more normal pace. And even in the quarter, based on comparing it to 2017, 2018, 2019, the rate of provision is still less than that era. So in the quarter, they're performing well. I mean, it's a very typical performance that we're seeing. And all the leading indicators still give rise to the fact that we think we'll do okay in the credit company. I would just say at the highest level -- look, I'd say a way to look back that. When the world broke into the era of COVID, there was a lot of trepidation as to what does that mean. And looking backwards, you probably have a period, including Snap-on, where we over reserved and the provisions were probably higher than that was necessary. And as a result of that, when you actually see the proof as it played out, that you didn't require those, you had been a need for lower provisions in 2021. And now you're starting to get back to what I call a more normal pace of activity. And if you look at the portfolio itself, it's got a little bit better credit characteristics. What I mean by that is maybe $1 of conservatism on the part of who we granted credit to, so it's less high-risk candidates in the pool. And people's FICA scores have improved marginally. So again, at a macro 30,000-foot level, there's probably a slightly less amount of credit risk in the portfolio. And therefore, as you go forward in these trends, I think it's kind of getting back to norm for lack of a better word, with that macro backdrop that Nick just described."

With that said, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?\nNick Pinchuk: Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I will start the call by covering the highlights of our second quarter. Along the way, I will give you my perspective on our results, once again they are encouraging. And our market, the robust, resilient and promising and I will talk about our progress. We believe we are now stronger than ever and we will also speak about what it all means and we believe it means that we are better positioned for more, a lot more. Then Aldo will go into a more detailed review of the financials. All you have to do is follow the news and you know that we live today in the midst of turmoil, inflation, variants supply, continuing unpredictable outbreak, precipitous lockdowns and a war in the Ukraine and Snap-on has shown through it all, wielding our advantages in product and brand, and in people, progressing down our runways for growth, engaging our Snap-on value creation, driving improvement, making the most of our resilient markets and extending our positive trajectory, piercing the turbulence. The story of our second quarter is simply one of rising momentum. We have been meeting the challenges quarter after quarter and we are simply getting even better at overcoming the difficulties, and going forward, we are confident of our capabilities continue to advance and here are the numbers that say we should be confident. Our reported sales in the quarter were $1 billion, $136.6 million, up versus last year by $55.2 million or 5.1%, including $32.4 million or 330 basis points of unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales growth was 8.4% with gains in every Group. And compared to the pre-pandemic levels of 2019, our upward drive is clear as a bell versus 2019 Sales in the quarter rose 19.5% as reported and 18.7% organically. This is now eight straight quarters of being above pre-pandemic levels. We believe we are continuing an ongoing trend of accelerating expansion and are building momentum with emphasis, increasing higher and higher, demonstrating that we are only getting stronger every day. The Opco operating income of $246.6 million, was up $29.5 million and the operating margin, it was 21.7%, up 160 basis points from last year and 170 basis points from 2019. For financial services operating income of $65.3 million, compared to the $68.9 million of last year and that result combined with Opco for a consolidated operating margin of 25.5%, up 100 basis points from last year and 130 from 2019. And EPS was $4.27, up 13.6% from last year and 32.6% above the comparable pre-pandemic level recorded in 2019, up $3.22. I have been saying this since the third quarter of 2020, I will say it again, we believe is Snap-on the stronger now than when we entered this great withering and the second quarter numbers say it so. Now let\u2019s talk about the markets. Auto repair remains positive. Most if, not all -- most, if not all of our key indicators are quite favorable spending on vehicle maintenance and spending on vehicle maintenance and repair, up, number of techs, up, mechanic wages, up. The techs are optimistic about their prospects and about the greater need for the skills as new technologies, new complexities advanced across the car park and we saw a confirmation of in that broadly held believe, for several quarters now is a number of automotive repair technicians continue expanding upward period-after-period, higher now than any of the last three decades. And when I speak with shop owners or managers, as I often do, it\u2019s clear that there is a need for more, many more and that Snap-on we love it. Vehicle repair is a strong and resilient market, a feeling that\u2019s also reinforced by our franchisees. You can see it in our numbers. You can hear it in their voices. We believe they are more prosperous than ever. Besides franchisees and technicians, there\u2019s vehicle repair shop owners and managers, this is RS&I arena. Demand for new and used cars is high, but supplies are limited, it\u2019s a well known Story. The pandemic has impacted the auto supply chain, sure. But it doesn\u2019t matter. Lots of new cars or scarcity of new vehicles, the car park is large, ageing, getting more complex and demand for repair remains strong, come back to high water and the shops are seeing this clearly and starting to invest to meet the currently need and get ready for the future. The variety of drivetrains is expanding, internal combustion, hybrid, plug-in electric, full electric and every day there\u2019s more driver assistance and more vehicle automation, increasing vehicle complexity. Shops now have a greater need for new and upgraded equipment and they are becoming more and more rely on service and repair information to guide them through the galaxy of new requirements and procedures, it\u2019s all music to our ears actually. Snap-on makes great tools and equipment and it\u2019s clearly repair and information headquarters. RS&I has taken advantage of that trend, creating new equipment offered and advanced database solutions. We now have a strong array of products in that vital areas. Mitchell 1 repair information software and shop management software, SPX, electronic parts catalog, our dealer shop management technologies, electric vehicle health check solutions and our heavy-duty and fast track intelligent diagnostics hardware. These are big databases and getting more powerful and easier to use, helping the shop to fix it right the first time and efficiently. The repair shop is changing, rising in complexity and ours -- and I has the products to match it. Finally, let\u2019s talk about critical industries. At Snap-on, we say Snap-on rolls out of the garage solving tasks of consequence and we do. This is C&I territory, our most international operation and it\u2019s where we see the most continuing impact of the pandemic and it\u2019s in children like supply chain inflation and supply chain disruption and inflation, where customers have been slower to accommodate, where headwinds are still persisting and where our multi-SKU product offerings are particularly impacted by supply chain challenges. I suppose everybody knows about the two-month lockdown in Shanghai, that area is a significant C&I business center and it\u2019s also key transportation hub for our China factory, so the lockdown was an obstacle. And beyond that focused event, C&I is particularly challenged by its considerable geographic reach, adjusting with the varying impacts and protocols and economic turbulence from countries with a varying virus impacts and protocols and the economic turbulence from country-to-country. But I would say, if you look at the quarter, the C&I team rose to the occasion, and in the quarter, we won gains in North America, in Europe and in Asia, despite the difficulties. So I\u2019d describe our C&I markets as representing continuing opportunity and coupled with automotive repair, we believe our overall markets are robust right now and there is considerably more opportunity ahead as we move along our runways for growth. And I can leave this section about robust progress in abundant possibilities without once again speaking of our -- of the engine of our advanced Snap-on value creation, particularly in customer connection and innovation, developing new products and solution born of the observation gathered right in the workplace, insights that create great new offerings, and at the same time, help guide the expansion of our franchisee selling capacity with better processes, more effective training and more powerful communication, all of that helped drive our progress, overcoming the difficulties, accommodating the virus, taking full advantage of the market opportunities, starting a continuing positive trend moving forward and we are going to keep it going. Well, that\u2019s the overview now, let\u2019s move to the segments. In the C&I Group, sales in the quarter were up 2.5% as reported or 8.6 million versus 2021 and that includes $25.3 million or 6 point -- 7 point, that includes a $25.3 million or 7.6% organic gain driven by progress across all our divisions. From an earnings perspective, C&I income was 51.7%, a decrease of $3.8 million compared to 2021, $2 million of that was unfavorable foreign currency and the rest represents the impact of supply chain turbulence on the multi-SKU C&I products. The OI margin was 14.4%, down 140 basis points from 2021, but did represent progress and then it\u2019s a 100 basis -- 100 point sequential improvement from the last quarter, when compared with the pre-pandemic 2019 periods, sales were up 7.4% organically and the OI margin of 14.4% was down 20 basis points, but that included an 80-point impact from acquisitions and unfavorable currency. Now continuing bright spot in C&I this quarter and again this quarter was SNA Europe, it did deliver yet another quarter growth, expanding double-digit year-over-year and well beyond pre-pandemic levels, all against the wins in Europe with innovative solutions of our Bahco Erle tool management system leading the way, tailoring product specific to customer needs. Europe is a varied market and SNA Europe is making increasing gains by matching the products to the specific tasks. And that positive SNA Europe was joined in C&I, quite valuable contribution from recovering areas in critical industries like aerospace, in general industry and from countries, in Asia-Pacific, like, India, Japan and South Korea. All combines overcome the decline and slower to recover sectors like the military and natural resources. We do remain confident and committed to extending in critical industries and that commitment is confirmed with great new products. Speaking of product, last quarter to help solve crucial tasks across both critical industries and automotive repair, we strengthened our 14.4 Volt MicroLithium power tool lineup with the new Snap-on CT761 3/8-inch Impact Wrench. It\u2019s a very attractive, but it\u2019s also quite functional. Featuring a compact design to reach tight spaces, a nylon-based housing for rugged durability and a special toggle switch trigger for precise control. The new unit also includes a try being headlight for broad illumination entire work area and now that\u2019s a feature that makes complex multi-point jobs much easier in the low-light conditions that often occur in the workshop or enrolled repair. You can imagine it. The Impact Wrench also delivers a robust 225 foot pounds of breakaway torque and it\u2019s controlled by a variable speed drive. So the operator can apply just the right torque for each job and the 14 volt battery with its 2.5 amp hours ensure it\u2019s consistent output and an extended run time which makes for a lot more efficient workday. The CT361 began shipping early in the quarter and it was right on target, quickly becoming a million hit product and it\u2019s sold out and what seem like a blink of an eye. Great product. Well, that\u2019s C&I, a promising quarter, volume up nicely, starting to overcome the turbulence, moving down it\u2019s runways for growth. Now for the Tools Group, sales of $520.6 million, up $36.5 million, including $7.7 million of unfavorable currency and a 9.3% organic gains and the operating margin 23.9%, up 250 basis points compared with pre-virus 2019 sales grew $114.8 million, including a 28% -- 28.1% organic gain and this quarter is 23.9% operating margin was up 630 basis points compared with those pre-virus numbers, coming out of the pandemic stronger indeed. Another positive quarter for the Tools Group with growth across all product lines and beyond as we see further indications of continuing strength. Other data like the franchisee health metrics, which we monitor every quarter, they remain quite favorable and on a clearly positive trend. We do believe our van network remains quite strong and it\u2019s not just the numbers. Just a few weeks ago, I spent time with a couple of dozen franchisees representing the regions on our U.S. and Canadian national franchisee advisory councils, and they were motivated and prosperous, enthusiastic about the current performance, positive about the trajectories of the other vans and various areas that they represent and very optimistic about the prospects for even more going forward. They believe in their opportunities and they are confident about their future. The Tools Group, strong quantitatively and qualitatively and that positivity was not just internal. Once again this quarter, it was reinforced by the external view. Snap-on was recognized again this year among the top 50 in the franchise industry by Entrepreneur Magazine. And once again in that ranking, we rated in the top of the Tools Distribution category, a place we have for some time and this type of recognition reflects fundamental, contemporary strength of our franchisees and of our overall mobile van network. It is a powerhouse business and that momentum would not have been achieved without a continuous stream of unique new products. And one of those that helped drive our hand tools up again this quarter, again this quarter was our new Long Nose Slip Joint Pliers. It\u2019s a special tool with our patented 3-Position joint precisely machine for effortless switch -- for effortless switching and control, allowing the pliers to -- it allows the pliers to keep the jaws parallel increasing the contact with the work piece, with its indicated -- it\u2019s got a relocated joint, optimized handle shape and unique Talon Grip-serrated jaws. With all of that our new pliers provide over 50% more pulling power. The machined and hardened teeth are sharp and strong and present three different gripping geometries, from heavy serrations at the base to fine grooves at the tip, great variability for multiple applications. You can apply different parts of the jaw. They are manufactured right here in our Milwaukee factory and they are manufactured from special cold forged allied steel for greater durability and strength. These players were launched at the beginning of the past quarter and they have been very well received. When I talk to the franchisees of the NFAC, they said are flying off the truck, and they are right. The sales have already made a hit product strategy just in one quarter. Our new offerings are in fact making a difference in the Tools Group, you can\u2019t miss it in the numbers, eight straight quarters above pre-pandemic levels. The Tools Group is moving onward and upward with eye-catching momentum and if you look at the numbers or spend any time with the team, you believe it\u2019s all systems go and it is. Now on to RS&I, sales were up 4.6% or $18.2 million versus last year, including $27.4 million or 7% organic uplift with double-digit growth in undercar equipment with diagnostics and information advancing and with the dealership activity flat from an earnings perspective RS&I operating income of $95.7 million, represents a rise of $9 million or 10.4% and the operating margin was 23%, up 120 basis points in the last year. Compared with 2019, sales were up 19.5% as reported and the organic growth was $58 million or 16.8% with strong advances in undercar equipment and diagnostics and information products. For profitability, the OI margin of 23% was down 240 basis points versus 2019, pretty much reflecting 110 point impact just from acquisitions and the effect of the margin dilutions from the higher sales of undercar equipment that we have been seeing. We believe RS&I has great opportunities and we are fortifying its way forward with new products like our Hofmann 609 aligner, specifically designed for independent or general repair shops, where alignment is -- it\u2019s not currently a primary focus and the space is short. The new offering allows those all-purpose garage to keep the low volume alignment business in-house with its compact footprint and portability kit enabling easy storage when not in use and efficient deployment when alignment is actually need. It saves a lot of space, but it gets the job done. With our latest 3D system authoring OEM approved accuracy, the 609 enables the handling of even the most complex alignment systems by those general repair shops. It generates a high return on the investment, doesn\u2019t occupy space needed for other repairs -- often needed for other repairs and it fortifies the garage\u2019s reputation for technical capability. It\u2019s a great value for the general repair shops and they are noticing. Our equipment business has been on a roll with strong double-digit equipment growth for double-digit quarters for some time and the Hofmann 609 aligner is a big player in that mix. RS&I, approving its position with repair shop owners and managers, growth in undercar equipment and diagnostics and information projects, products and an array of innovative new products and product lines to lead the way. Well, those are the highlights of our quarter, Tools Group, strong progress everywhere, unmistakable strength. C&I, recording a positive performance against the variation across industries and geographies and RS&I, expanding profitable volume with repair shop owners and managers. Snap-on overall sales rising markedly, both versus last year up 8.4% organically and up 18.7% organically compared with pre-pandemic levels continuing clear positive trajectory. Opco operating margin are strong 21.7%, rising again in this quarter rising again this quarter, up 160 basis points. EPS $4.27, up versus last year, up versus last quarter and up versus pre-pandemic levels. It was an encouraging quarter. Now I will turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?\nAldo Pagliari: Nick, thanks. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on slide six. Net sales of $1,136.6 million in the quarter increased 5.1% from 2021 levels, reflecting an 8.4% organic sales gain, partially offset by $32.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales gain this quarter reflects high single-digit growth in each of the company\u2019s segments and compares to an 8% year-over-year organic increase recorded last quarter. Consolidated gross margin of 48.7%, remained the same as last quarter, but declined 150 basis points from 50.2% last year. Higher material and other costs were partially offset by contributions from the increased sales volumes and pricing actions, as well as from benefits from the company\u2019s RCI initiatives and 30 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects. Again this quarter, we believe the corporation through pricing and RCI actions continue to navigate effectively the costs and other supply chain dynamics of the current environment. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 27% improved 310 basis points from 30.1% last year. The improvement is primarily due to higher sales volumes, savings from RCI initiatives and lower cost associated with stock-based expenses, operating earnings from financial services of $246.6 million in the quarter, compared to $217.1 million in 2021. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 21.7%, improved 160 basis points from last year and was up 140 basis points sequentially. Financial services revenue of $86.4 million in the second quarter of 2022, compared to $86.9 million last year. Operating earnings of $65.3 million, a decrease $3.6 million from 2021 levels, primarily as a result of higher provisions for credit losses and those recorded last year. Consolidated operating earnings of $311.9 million, compared to $286 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 25.5%, improved 100 basis points from 24.5% in 2021. Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 23.8%, compared to 23.3% last year. Net earnings of $231.5 million or $4.27 per diluted share increased $23.5 million or $0.51 per share from last year\u2019s levels, representing a 13.6% increase in diluted earnings per share. Now, let\u2019s turn to our segment results, starting with the C&I Group on slide seven. Sales of $359.1 million increased from $350.5 million last year, reflecting a $25.3 million or 7.6% organic sales gain, partially offset by $16.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. The organic growth primarily reflects double-digit gains in the segments European based hand tools business and Asia-Pacific operations, as well as a mid single-digit increase in sales to customers in critical industries. Within critical industries, solid gains in general industry and international aviation more than offset lower sales to the military. Gross margin of 37.3%, although improving sequentially, declined 220 basis points from 39.5% in the second quarter of 2021. This is primarily due to higher material and other input costs being partially offset by the benefits from higher sales volumes and pricing actions and savings from the segment\u2019s RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22.9% in the quarter, improved 80 basis points from 23.7% in 2021, primarily due to the effects of higher sales volumes. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $51.7 million, compared to $55.5 million last year. The operating margin of 14.4%, compared to 15.8% a year ago. Turning now to slide eight, sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $520.6 million, increased 7.5% from $484.1 million in 2021, reflecting a 9.3% organic sales gain, partially offset by $7.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. The organic sales growth reflects a double-digit gain in our U.S. business and a low single-digit increase in our international operations. In the U.S., sales were up across all product lines and include a particularly robust sales of full-storage in the quarter. Gross margin of 46% in the quarter, compared to 45.5% in the first quarter of this year, but declined 80 basis points from 46.8% last year. The year-over-year decline is primarily due to higher material and other costs, and 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by benefits from higher sales volumes and pricing actions. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales 22.1%, improved 330 basis points from 25.4% last year, reflecting the benefits from higher sales volumes and savings from RCI initiatives, and including the effects of lower expenses associated with the company\u2019s franchisees stock purchase program. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $124.4 million, compared to $103.5 million last year. The operating margin of 23.9% improved 250 basis points from 21.4% a year ago. Turning to RS&I Group, shown on slide nine, sales of $416.8 million, compared to $398.6 million a year ago, reflecting a 7% organic sales gain, partially offset by $9.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain is comprised of a double-digit increase in sales of undercar equipment and a low single-digit gain in the sale of diagnostics and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers. Activity with OEM dealerships was essentially flat. Gross margin of 43.2%, declined 150 basis points from 44.7% last year. This is primarily due to higher material and other input costs and increased sales in lower gross margin businesses. These declines were partially offset by benefits from pricing actions and savings from RCI initiatives, as well as from 50 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 20.2%, improved 270 basis points from 22.9% last year, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage, including higher activity and lower expense businesses and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating earnings from the RS&I Group of $95.7 million, compared to $86.7 million last year. The operating margin 23%, improved 120 basis points from 21.8% reported a year ago. Now turning to slide 10, revenue from financial services of $86.4 million, including $800,000 of unfavorable currency translation, compared to $86.9 million last year. Financial services operating earnings of $65.3 million, compared to $68.9 million in 2021. Financial services expenses of $21.1 million were up $3.1 million from 2021 levels, mostly due to $2.4 million of increased provisions for credit losses. While provisions have increased versus a historically lower provision rate experienced last year, loan portfolio trends remain stable. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1% and eight-tenths of 1% in the second quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively. In both the second quarters of 2022 and 2021, the average yield on finance and contract receivables were 17.5% and 8.5%, respectively. Total loan originations of $307.6 million in the second quarter increased $21.8 million or 7.6% from 2021 levels, reflecting an 11% increase in originations of finance receivables, partially offset by decrease in the origination of contract receivables. Moving to slide 11, our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our U.S. operations. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.4% for the U.S. extended credit is the same as comparable pre-pandemic period of 2019 and reflects the seasonal improvement we typically experience in the second quarter. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, the trailing 12-month net losses of $40.4 million represented 2.33% of outstandings at quarter end, which is down slightly from the 2.34% reported at the end of last quarter. Now turning to slide 12, cash provided by operating activities of $140.8 million in the quarter, compared to $238.2 million last year. The decrease in the second quarter of 2021 primarily reflects an $87.7 million increase in working investment. The change in working investment dollars is largely driven by greater demand, including increases in receivables and higher levels of inventory this year. In addition to demand base requirements, the inventory increase also reflects higher in-transit inventory amounts, as well as incremental buffer stocks associated with the supply chain dynamics in the current macro environment. Net cash used by investing activities of $73.8 million, included net additions to finance receivables of $53.5 million and capital expenditures of $21.3 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $112.2 million, included cash dividends of $75.7 million and the repurchase of $251,000 shares of common stock for $53.8 million under our existing share repurchase program. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $420.8 million of common stock under existing authorizations. Turning to slide 13, trade and other accounts receivable increased $46.8 million from 2021 year end. Days sales outstanding of 60 days, compared to 58 days at 2021 year end. Inventories increased $89.5 million from 2021 year end and on a trailing 12-month basis inventory turns of 2.7 compared to 2.8 at year end 2021. Our quarter end cash position of $812.9 million, compared to $780 million at year end 2021. Our net debt to capital ratio of 8.3% compared to 9.1% at year end 2021. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million available under our credit facilities and as of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. I will now briefly review a few outlook items for 2022. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. In addition, we currently anticipate absent any changes to U.S. tax legislation that our full year 2022 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%. I will now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?\nNick Pinchuk: Thanks, Aldo. Well, that\u2019s our second quarter. Markets that are resilient and getting more robust by the day. These are interesting times in the pandemic, inflation, supply interruptions, a war, and pop-up lockdowns, but Snap-on brings to this turbulence considerable advantage in product, in brand and in people. It\u2019s enabled our team to cut through the turbulence, continuing a positive trajectory and you can see it in the performance. C&I on a growth path again, with a 7.6% organic increase, despite being our most impacted business. RS&I, gains with repair shop owners and managers, driven by hardware and its expanding information portfolio, sales up 7% organically and NOI margin of 22%, up 120 basis points from last year. And the Tools Group, gangbusters results, sales up 9.3% organically versus last year and up 28.1% versus 2019, eight straight quarters above pre-pandemic levels and NOI margin of 23.9%. And it all came together for overall Snap-on organic growth of 8.4%, NOI margin of 21.7% and an EPS of $4.27, all high watermarks despite the turbulence. It was an encouraging quarter and we emerge from that period with rising momentum. It is a turbulent time, but Snap-on is driven by attractive markets, by unique strengths and by an experienced and capable team that\u2019s achieved clear and consistent performance and period-by-period has become stronger and stronger in navigating the issues of the day. And we believe these inherent advantages will continue to prevail as we go forward on a clear an upward trajectory through the remainder of this year and well beyond. Before I turn the call over to the, Operator, I will speak directly to our franchisees and associates. I know they listen in. The corporation is an organization where people come together to create a benefit for themselves and others that they could not alter individually. You have done just that again this quarter. For your success in that endeavor you have my congratulations. For the energy and the skill you bring to our efforts, you have my admiration and for the commitment you unfailingly demonstrate to our team, you have my thanks. Now I will turn the call over to the operator. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We can take our first question now from Scott Stember of MKM Partners. Please go ahead.\nScott Stember: Good morning and congrats on the very strong results.\nNick Pinchuk: Thanks, Scott.\nScott Stember: Can we talk about Tools? You mentioned that, everything was up, and it sounded like Tool storage had another very strong quarter. Was that related to the new mobile cart and maybe just try to size up how big tools storage was in the quarter and trying to figure out...\nNick Pinchuk: Now, I don\u2019t like to give you -- I don\u2019t, I think, it\u2019s -- you start worrying too much of our quarter-to-quarter, Scott, Scott you go hikidi, bikidi, boo [ph] around here about, because things change depending on the models you bring up. But I will say that Tool storage was the leader, it was double digits, a nice quarter and it came -- and targets were in a factor, what happened at this time is, we started to get more of the bigger boxes out, the EPIQ and the Master Series. We had some great new offerings. Our Supernova Masters Series with the electric blue and the copper trim, that seemed very popular. So it was a great quarter. Carts were continued to be strong, but EPIQ, the bigger boxes, the regular tool storage box, we could call Roll Cabs or not made the difference. So it was a pretty good quarter. The Tools Group really, I mean, I think, it did have a great quarter. By the way, did I mention that the Tools Group NOI margin was 23.9% in the quarter? I think, I have mentioned that. That was -- I think that says it all. I will tell you. And by the way, in the quarter hand tools were already -- were also up and also -- that\u2019s a nice factor for us, up strongly. But the big impact in the quarter...\nScott Stember: And then\u2026\nNick Pinchuk: Yeah.\nScott Stember: Go ahead. I am sorry.\nNick Pinchuk: Go ahead. Go ahead.\nScott Stember: I was going to ask about the selling to the van and off of the van the inventory situation right now on the van?\nNick Pinchuk: Yeah. Look, the inventories are up, the guys are crying for more inventory, when they go out there and their inventory turns are substantially below pre-pandemic levels. So the inventory turns are higher at this time and not below pre-pandemic levels, they are above pre-pandemic levels. So they are substantially higher at this time. And the sell-through was better this quarter than it was last quarter. When you look at it overall, it seems to be right in line with our overall sales. So we think it\u2019s moving along nicely. I do believe our guys want more inventory. I do believe they want more. And I would say in our business, there\u2019s still, we got a little better at delivering, but we still like, we still have a pretty good backlog. People are clamoring for our products still.\nScott Stember: Got it. And then lastly in RS&I, you talked about undercar doing really well. Is that related to the collision part of the business or is that just across the board?\nNick Pinchuk: Yeah. Well, it\u2019s across the Board, but the collision business has been a star in this situation. We acquired Car-O-Liner a few years ago and we anticipated that collision with the deployment of the neural network around the sensors, around the sort of driver assist systems would make collision a very lucrative area and it seems to have played out. So collision is among the top four undercar equipment, but generally it\u2019s all roll pretty well. The independent repair shops are optimistic. They are seeing the, well, I said it in my call, investment up, spending up, technicians up, wages up, they can see it all come in through. So they are white hot in terms of their optimism, in terms of the situation. So it get them to invest more. That\u2019s what you are seeing in undercar equipment.\nScott Stember: Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.\nNick Pinchuk: Sure. Thanks.\nOperator: We can now take our next question from Luke Junk of Baird. Please go ahead.\nLuke Junk: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First I wanted to ask about originations is on positive this quarter up nicely both year-on-year and up really strong sequentially following some fits and starts recently. Can you just give us a peek under the hood there in terms of what\u2019s driving that? Do you think it\u2019s sustainable and what if any impacted last quarter system breach have on the numbers this quarter?\nNick Pinchuk: Last quarter, I don\u2019t think had any impact on this quarter. But it was mostly in the last quarter where you saw, it might have had some impact on originations, because last quarter you -- from a sales point of view, there was a skewing towards the back end of the quarter, because the breach was in the early parts of the quarter, so you saw that going out. And as I said, last time we thought we had pretty robust sales in some of the big ticket items, but they hadn\u2019t made their way through the vans yet necessarily and that probably worked out this quarter. I think the big driver though, Luke, is the product. I think the optimism of the technicians and the product itself. I think, what does drive originations is the view of people saying, wow. I really like these EPIQ boxes I got and we had a more available now. We are getting better at delivering them. During the pandemic we had some fits and starts, so we are pushing a little more carts and now we have a little bit more of the basic roll cabs. So I think that\u2019s what drove the higher originations in this time. We still see pretty good RA, the finance by the franchisees seemed pretty solid. That wasn\u2019t down in the course. So that was pretty strong. As I said, hand tools were up. So I think it\u2019s pretty much product driven. What you see in the Tools Group, I mean, the Tools Group is on a pretty big momentum. If you look back over the pre-pandemic levels, they were up 9%, and what was that, Q4 2020 then 15%, then17%, then 21%, then 22%, then 24% and 28% this quarter. And by the way, they came through the quarter, they exited the quarter stronger. They are on the mail train. They have got momentum rolling. And so I feel pretty good about that and that\u2019s playing out in some of the now broader product lines in Tool Storage. We did, as I said in the last call, that doesn\u2019t mean that carts were down any, they were still strong in the quarter just that the low cash got bigger.\nLuke Junk: That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks for that, Nick. And then second question within RS&I, I will ask on undercar equipment again. It\u2019s been an area of consistent strength in that business going all the way back to the start of 2021, we count six straight quarters of double-digit growth overall. Where do you think we are in the investment cycle there, realizing that growth has been weighing on RS&I gross margins and looking forward to some point when that starts to normalize? How quickly would you anticipate higher software margins starting to come through at that point as well?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, I think, look, I think, higher software margins are, you are going to see it, one of the things you are seeing in our -- remember we said, we are pivoting away from titles where we sold updates, we call it titles, but they are basically updates on software every six months, we are pivoting to a subscription business. So that tends to stretch out your revenue was a little bit -- it effects revenues in the quarter. And so, but our subscriptions are up deep, our subscribers are up deep double digits in this quarter year-over-year. So that seems to be working for us. So we are pretty pumped about the possibilities in that, but you know you have some, I guess, I would say, recognition questions as you go through this period. So you don\u2019t quite see it coming through, but I can see it coming through in the future. And as I said, with the array of electronic products we have around software, from the diagnostic software to the Mitchell 1 software, to Dealer-FX to electronic parts catalogs to vehicle checks. We feel we are repair, information headquarters and it\u2019s going to become bigger and we are going to see it roll through that business earlier. Now if you ask me to expect to see the equipment business attenuate, I hope not. I am not hoping for it, just because it\u2019s low margin, it doesn\u2019t seem, it doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t want the profits, I do. So and I could see that go, that was down -- you might remember, it was down, it was pretty much flat on its back for a couple of quarters, couple of three quarters earlier and it\u2019s bouncing back from that. We have seen a lot in independent repair shops and I would figure after the dealerships start to get used to the situation, I think, they will discombobulated by the low supply and what are they doing associated with this sort of a little bit -- little more reluctant in situation. When they come online, I think, that will be even greater.\nLuke Junk: Then if I could just sneak one more in, maybe this one would be\u2026\nNick Pinchuk: Yeah.\nLuke Junk: \u2026 good for Aldo to tackle? Could you just remind us of how rising interest rates affect the credit company, both in terms of funding, if at all, in the rates that you charge and in particular, I am just wondering if there is anything that you think is miss perceived that you would want to address about a rising interest rate environment? Thanks.\nAldo Pagliari: Thanks for the question, Luke. Actually it has a little affect if anything it might create a more favorable environment. And why do I say that? Again, we fund long. So if you look at Snap-On\u2019s balance sheet, we don\u2019t fund day-to-day. So the rising interest rates do not have a foreseeable immediate impact on our borrowing capability, because as you could see there\u2019s plenty of cash on the balance sheet and there is nothing that\u2019s coming due for quite some time. So we are stable in terms of the cost of our funds going into that business. Our stated rates have been pretty consistent really for decade plus. So and they are not the lowest rate out there, but they are lower than what might be available to people that are on a credit card format and things of that nature. So we think our rates are appropriate for the credit profile of the customers that we serve, we think that they -- those types of customers recognize that. So we are the kind of the lender of choice if they do decide to engage in any type of lending activity. And I think because we provide that stability, it gives a little bit a form of reassurance, so as interest rates go up competitors rates, if they were ever considering them, and when I say competitors, I am thinking of things like credit cards. So as interest rates are going to be going up for people that are in the subprime category. So we are going to be pretty stable and our approach is going to be pretty consistent. Yeah, I think the competitions rates might be going up, which you could argue maybe creates a slightly more favorable environment.\nLuke Junk: Okay. I will leave it there. Thank you for all the color this morning.\nOperator: We can now take our next question from Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nBret Jordan: Hey. Good morning, guys.\nNick Pinchuk: Good morning.\nBret Jordan: When you think about the organic growth, and obviously, it\u2019s pretty inflationary environment, could you talk about sort of with the contribution from units are versus the contribution from price and then, I guess, as a follow-up, I think, well, I will ask that first then I have a follow-up.\nNick Pinchuk: Go ahead. Go ahead. Ask the follow-up one.\nBret Jordan: The follow-up, I think you called out, I think, in C&I and RS&I sort of inflation in some of the cost of goods. And could you sort of talk about where you are seeing, is it metals, labor, where are you seeing inflation, what you can do to sort of pass that through and the timing of that?\nNick Pinchuk: And by the way, just, Bret, before the Tools Group will execute -- Tools Group guys will execute be if I leave this conference call, not saying that it also have inflationary impacts on it and price is going up. So it\u2019s not just RS&I and C&I. They also have to deal with that and I got to give them credit for that. But look, here is the thing, it\u2019s hard for us to determine, because we know we have some pricing, but it isn\u2019t the majority of it. Looking at our factories, we know we have products in demand. There is rolling off there and our guys are up to their eyeballs in demand. So we know that\u2019s a positive situation. The other thing is it\u2019s hard, because you know we have list prices. But the list prices don\u2019t -- are very from product to product and they come out on an average, you might say your raising sales 3.5% or something like that but products. And then overlaying on top of that we have a lot of new tools, we keep roll in new tool. In fact, million dollar tools we have dozens a quarter rolling out and then, across the network. And then we have promotions that occur week to week and they can be lean or rich and taken up the big effect. So it\u2019s hard for us to say. I would say the minority of the increases in pricing and the majority is in volume for us. We think that\u2019s the situation in this situation in our environment. Now, that varies from Group to Group and so on. Now if you talk about where we are getting the biggest impact, our biggest inflationary impact, Bret, is trying to buy on the spot market, because we have said we want to deliver the best we can. We have demand. We want to deliver. We are not keeping up with all the demand, but so we are buying like chips on the spot market. And I can go -- that can fluctuate wildly. We buy components for power tools and other things on a spot market, that can move wildly. If you look at commodities, I would say, look, we buy several, many grades of steel, but if you look at steel for tool storage and steel for, let\u2019s say, lifts, hot rolled and cold rolled, there both coming off a little bit. They are getting a little better. They are coming down. If you look at steel for hand tools, it\u2019s at its top and now they are still not back to the steady state levels but they backed off a little bit. The steel for hand tools, which we call rod steel, that\u2019s pretty much reached the top level and it\u2019s flattened out but it hasn\u2019t abated for us yet and we are not seeing too much abatements in freight, you see those kinds of things flowing through. I would expect this stuff, as I believe that as the COVID turbulent start the micro viscosity start -- stop happening, you are going to see the stuff start to drift downwards, because you are not going to have the interruptions in supply and therefore it\u2019s going to get more regular and therefore the prices are going to come down. But I don\u2019t have a crystal ball on that. That\u2019s sort of our view of the situation.\nBret Jordan: Okay. If you were to think about your price inflation, your sticker price inflation year-to-date, I guess, how would you -- is it up, mid-low, mid-single digits on pricing?\nNick Pinchuk: It\u2019s hard for me to say because it changes. It\u2019s all over the map depending on where you are. In the Tools Group, you have a list price and the other places, you are pricing product-by-product and it depends on the size of the product and a lot of different things. So, all I am saying is, I think, if you wanted to step back and you look at our pricing, it\u2019s the minority of our growth.\nBret Jordan: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nNick Pinchuk: Hopefully get share, get volume out of it, Bret. Okay.\nOperator: And we can now take our next question from Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Glynn: Hey. Thanks. Good morning.\nNick Pinchuk: Hi, Chris.\nChristopher Glynn: So, Nick, some -- hey. Some pretty strong comments on the momentum and the tenure across the Tools Group. I did want to drill down into that in terms of, we -- the relative contributions of market penetration and overall kind of advancing into technicians not traditionally served versus a revenue per technician type of equation.\nNick Pinchuk: Yeah. We don\u2019t have -- it\u2019s hard for us to get a handle on all of that, because you tend to start out with people at lower levels. But we are adding technicians. I can\u2019t parse that thing for you. We are certainly aiming at that and it\u2019s been successful, but we are also selling more to the existing technicians because their wages are going up, they are getting more optimistic. And also it\u2019s not a situation where we see static activities. I will say the number of technicians we have on the books are going up and that includes some new people. So that\u2019s about all I can give you on that. I think there are both things in play at least, because of the...\nChristopher Glynn: Okay.\nNick Pinchuk: And it makes sense. I just want to add this, because it makes sense, because we believe it\u2019s great for us to get new technicians and that\u2019s a one component of growth that I have talked about for a dog\u2019s age here. But it\u2019s also in this environment clear that existing technicians, young or old are going to need new products. And they are actually going to need more a greater array of these products as you get more and different powertrain, as you get more of these automated features in the system. So we anticipate both effects being lucrative forward motion, it would be wrong to think that either one was maybe -- to think that they weren\u2019t both good avenues for growth.\nChristopher Glynn: That makes sense. Yeah. It was kind of meant to particularly drill into the expanding the technical...\nNick Pinchuk: Sure.\nChristopher Glynn: That\u2019s great. And then on C&I, clearly a stronger quarter year-over-year and sequentially versus kind of the trends we have seen in the past few quarters, a little more kind of stable, steady. So wondering if your sense of things getting rolling there versus you kind of got a bit more out the door of this quarter?\nNick Pinchuk: No. I don\u2019t, well, we like to think we got bit more out the door. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s it. I think, look, I think we are making a little bit of penetration. As I tried to say in our remarks, we are getting better at handling the turbulence. I\u2019d like to say we are not as dumb as we look and a lot of people would say that would be impossible. But we are kind of learning quarter by quarter and C&I has the longest learning curve, because they have the most impact of all this stuff that\u2019s happened. I mean, C&I in Shanghai, there is that one thing -- by the way, we were up in Asia in C&I, so they did pretty well in that regard. So what we are seeing is, we are seeing our ability to manage the turbulence better. We are also seeing some warming, like in this quarter, one of the things that was very encouraged by is that the military wasn\u2019t down as much in the quarter. The military is kind of coming back. It\u2019s still down. You know what I mean, I am still -- I don\u2019t like it, but it\u2019s still -- it\u2019s coming back. So it wasn\u2019t as big of a hole this quarter, as it has been in the past. And also general industry, I don\u2019t know if you saw that comment, general industry was up and aviation in total was up, particularly international aviation believe it or not. So, general industry which implies the widest category for us, in terms of that, that has so many different segments and that was up strongly. So I kind of think the critical industries are coming, getting stronger, recovering from the impact. So we feel pretty good about that. In our business are looking better. Now, that\u2019s why we were particularly pleased about this 7.6% growth organically in C&I. That made us -- that gave us great encouragement. And in reality, the 14.4%, yeah, it was down 140 basis points year-over-year, but 14.4% aren\u2019t chop liver for C&I, it\u2019s not so bad. And was up 100 basis points versus last quarter and down 2020 versus 2019 against the pretty severe impact of acquisitions and currency, I think, it was 80 basis points. So those -- they are points were pretty good for us, we were encouraged by it.\nChristopher Glynn: Great. Thanks for the color.\nNick Pinchuk: Sure.\nOperator: We can now take our next question from Gary Prestopino of Barrington Research. Please go ahead.\nGary Prestopino: Hey. Good morning, everyone.\nNick Pinchuk: Gary, how are you?\nGary Prestopino: Oh! I am just fine. Thanks. Hey, Nick, just a question, as it evolves with all the hybrids and electric vehicles that are starting to come into the car park or a bit in the car park for years now. With your product set there, right now are you seeing demand from technicians for specific hand tools or more diagnostic and calibration tools in the repair of these kinds of vehicles?\nNick Pinchuk: I think you see more demand for the diagnostic, but you also see the hand tools. I think, if you look at the -- they are in the car park, but they are -- if you look at -- it\u2019s one thing to look at it versus the sales. If you look at them in the car park, it gets to be pretty thin. You are not seeing -- not that many garages are seeing a lot of them. So the guys are talking to us about this and we sell hand tools and we sell some diagnostics that you have -- it\u2019s not a special diagnostic form, but it\u2019s a diagnostic that would have the capabilities to deal with those things. So you are not seeing -- they are still pretty thinly distributed across unless maybe you are in Southern California or something like that or maybe New York City or some, you might see some of those garages, but we are not seeing huge demand. Mostly we are getting ready for what we think will be the demand going forward. We think this is going to be a tidal wave. And so that\u2019s one of the reasons why we acquired Dealer-FX to get a look at these things.\nGary Prestopino: Okay. Thank you.\nNick Pinchuk: Sure.\nOperator: We can now take our next question from Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners. Please go ahead.\nIvan Feinseth: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Congratulations on another great quarter and the great results.\nNick Pinchuk: Thanks, Ivan.\nIvan Feinseth: When you were talking about like you bring on a new tool and it sold out pretty quickly, how fast can you ramp up? Is it because you didn\u2019t anticipate the demand would be so strong or you are seeing still dealing with shortages and how quickly can you ramp up for another production run?\nNick Pinchuk: I would say, we didn\u2019t expect it to be that big. This one -- the couple -- of course, this is an earnings call, so I pick some of the ringer as you know and I put them on. But the thing is that, those guys blew out the doors and we didn\u2019t anticipate it be that good, otherwise we would have done a bigger run to begin with. So that\u2019s the situation. Just the demand was really high. Now, on top of that, I will tell you that we believe we need more capacity, because we have demand, so we are looking at that situation wise and we will have to go back and try to schedule another run in the handful plants, which is already over scheduled, but we will try to put that in and roll out with some more. Obviously though, if you are do that, I mean, the reason why we are running a hand tool plants, they got a lot of demand. So we see ourselves that sitting on some further opportunities if we can just rollout more product and we are working on it. In terms of expanding the plant we have an expansion plan for our Milwaukee hand tool plants, where this plans was built.\nIvan Feinseth: And then as your franchisees interact with OEM mechanics, what kind of feedback or discussions are they having about preparing to ramp up for new tools to handle the EVs that are at some point going to explain...\nNick Pinchuk: Yeah. Look, I think, they are having talks about that, but generally you are talking about insulated tool, some of the obvious stuff like some diagnostics stuff, some insulated tools, some lift tables for the batteries, those kinds of things. And then what will happen, Ivan, is the mechanics don\u2019t know yet what they don\u2019t know, you know what I mean, about preparing the tool.\nIvan Feinseth: Yeah.\nNick Pinchuk: Those new cars get into the dealerships and the mechanics will discover where they need new tools to deal with it. That\u2019s a whole other level of array. So we are talking right now about the common things that you might -- you observe from early days from the -- you hear from the OEMs, are you see the very, very -- very early days in the OEM garages and those are the things that I just talked about like insulated tools and some diagnostics some analysis routines and also some lift tables and other stuff around electric vehicles and then you are going to hear as a guys start repair them, let\u2019s say, geez, these particular vehicles are different, I need a special tool to do this and that\u2019s where we start rolling out our activity we start building more tools to match. That\u2019s a whole other array and that\u2019s one of the thing really takes off for us.\nIvan Feinseth: And then I assume you are going to need some kind of new types of lifts to handle the access or battery swapping because of the way is\u2026\nNick Pinchuk: It\u2019s also true -- so true\u2026\nIvan Feinseth: Yeah. It\u2026\nNick Pinchuk: Also true. I didn\u2019t mention that, but that\u2019s right\u2026\nIvan Feinseth: And the same thing\u2026\nNick Pinchuk: That\u2019s -- reason I have mentioned is handled by another division. But that\u2019s also true. A lot of this stuff is going to -- the equipment -- the whole equipment line that doesn\u2019t go through the vans is a whole other issue that\u2019s going to need new stuff, because these things are heavy, as you know being a car expert.\nIvan Feinseth: Okay. Well, then, I guess, then the same thing is going to hold true for undercarriage and collision, because the way the EVs are structured and the way you have to repair them around the battery and the whole structure eventually is going to be a huge upgrade cycle for undercarriage and collision, right?\nNick Pinchuk: Correct. Correct. You got it. That\u2019s right. I mean the batteries are, before I -- I think most people don\u2019t realize, how heavy these batteries are actually. There\u2019s a lot of weight underneath that -- under that chassis. So it\u2019s going to be an issue. It\u2019s going to revolutionize garage I believe as things go out. And again, I want to point out that, the OEMs will figure this out early, but then there will be a lot of unforeseen complications that change it again after your first wave of change. So we are pretty pumped. That\u2019s why I say we are entering the golden age of car repair.\nIvan Feinseth: Yeah. Very exciting. Congratulations again and look forward to ongoing success.\nNick Pinchuk: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes the Q&A session. I would now like to hand the call back to Sara Verbsky for closing remarks.\nSara Verbsky: Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Nick Pinchuk",
            "content": "Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I will start the call by covering the highlights of our second quarter. Along the way, I will give you my perspective on our results, once again they are encouraging. And our market, the robust, resilient and promising and I will talk about our progress. We believe we are now stronger than ever and we will also speak about what it all means and we believe it means that we are better positioned for more, a lot more. Then Aldo will go into a more detailed review of the financials. All you have to do is follow the news and you know that we live today in the midst of turmoil, inflation, variants supply, continuing unpredictable outbreak, precipitous lockdowns and a war in the Ukraine and Snap-on has shown through it all, wielding our advantages in product and brand, and in people, progressing down our runways for growth, engaging our Snap-on value creation, driving improvement, making the most of our resilient markets and extending our positive trajectory, piercing the turbulence. The story of our second quarter is simply one of rising momentum. We have been meeting the challenges quarter after quarter and we are simply getting even better at overcoming the difficulties, and going forward, we are confident of our capabilities continue to advance and here are the numbers that say we should be confident. Our reported sales in the quarter were $1 billion, $136.6 million, up versus last year by $55.2 million or 5.1%, including $32.4 million or 330 basis points of unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales growth was 8.4% with gains in every Group. And compared to the pre-pandemic levels of 2019, our upward drive is clear as a bell versus 2019 Sales in the quarter rose 19.5% as reported and 18.7% organically. This is now eight straight quarters of being above pre-pandemic levels. We believe we are continuing an ongoing trend of accelerating expansion and are building momentum with emphasis, increasing higher and higher, demonstrating that we are only getting stronger every day. The Opco operating income of $246.6 million, was up $29.5 million and the operating margin, it was 21.7%, up 160 basis points from last year and 170 basis points from 2019. For financial services operating income of $65.3 million, compared to the $68.9 million of last year and that result combined with Opco for a consolidated operating margin of 25.5%, up 100 basis points from last year and 130 from 2019. And EPS was $4.27, up 13.6% from last year and 32.6% above the comparable pre-pandemic level recorded in 2019, up $3.22. I have been saying this since the third quarter of 2020, I will say it again, we believe is Snap-on the stronger now than when we entered this great withering and the second quarter numbers say it so. Now let's talk about the markets. Auto repair remains positive. Most if, not all -- most, if not all of our key indicators are quite favorable spending on vehicle maintenance and spending on vehicle maintenance and repair, up, number of techs, up, mechanic wages, up. The techs are optimistic about their prospects and about the greater need for the skills as new technologies, new complexities advanced across the car park and we saw a confirmation of in that broadly held believe, for several quarters now is a number of automotive repair technicians continue expanding upward period-after-period, higher now than any of the last three decades. And when I speak with shop owners or managers, as I often do, it's clear that there is a need for more, many more and that Snap-on we love it. Vehicle repair is a strong and resilient market, a feeling that's also reinforced by our franchisees. You can see it in our numbers. You can hear it in their voices. We believe they are more prosperous than ever. Besides franchisees and technicians, there's vehicle repair shop owners and managers, this is RS&I arena. Demand for new and used cars is high, but supplies are limited, it's a well known Story. The pandemic has impacted the auto supply chain, sure. But it doesn't matter. Lots of new cars or scarcity of new vehicles, the car park is large, ageing, getting more complex and demand for repair remains strong, come back to high water and the shops are seeing this clearly and starting to invest to meet the currently need and get ready for the future. The variety of drivetrains is expanding, internal combustion, hybrid, plug-in electric, full electric and every day there's more driver assistance and more vehicle automation, increasing vehicle complexity. Shops now have a greater need for new and upgraded equipment and they are becoming more and more rely on service and repair information to guide them through the galaxy of new requirements and procedures, it's all music to our ears actually. Snap-on makes great tools and equipment and it's clearly repair and information headquarters. RS&I has taken advantage of that trend, creating new equipment offered and advanced database solutions. We now have a strong array of products in that vital areas. Mitchell 1 repair information software and shop management software, SPX, electronic parts catalog, our dealer shop management technologies, electric vehicle health check solutions and our heavy-duty and fast track intelligent diagnostics hardware. These are big databases and getting more powerful and easier to use, helping the shop to fix it right the first time and efficiently. The repair shop is changing, rising in complexity and ours -- and I has the products to match it. Finally, let's talk about critical industries. At Snap-on, we say Snap-on rolls out of the garage solving tasks of consequence and we do. This is C&I territory, our most international operation and it's where we see the most continuing impact of the pandemic and it's in children like supply chain inflation and supply chain disruption and inflation, where customers have been slower to accommodate, where headwinds are still persisting and where our multi-SKU product offerings are particularly impacted by supply chain challenges. I suppose everybody knows about the two-month lockdown in Shanghai, that area is a significant C&I business center and it's also key transportation hub for our China factory, so the lockdown was an obstacle. And beyond that focused event, C&I is particularly challenged by its considerable geographic reach, adjusting with the varying impacts and protocols and economic turbulence from countries with a varying virus impacts and protocols and the economic turbulence from country-to-country. But I would say, if you look at the quarter, the C&I team rose to the occasion, and in the quarter, we won gains in North America, in Europe and in Asia, despite the difficulties. So I'd describe our C&I markets as representing continuing opportunity and coupled with automotive repair, we believe our overall markets are robust right now and there is considerably more opportunity ahead as we move along our runways for growth. And I can leave this section about robust progress in abundant possibilities without once again speaking of our -- of the engine of our advanced Snap-on value creation, particularly in customer connection and innovation, developing new products and solution born of the observation gathered right in the workplace, insights that create great new offerings, and at the same time, help guide the expansion of our franchisee selling capacity with better processes, more effective training and more powerful communication, all of that helped drive our progress, overcoming the difficulties, accommodating the virus, taking full advantage of the market opportunities, starting a continuing positive trend moving forward and we are going to keep it going. Well, that's the overview now, let's move to the segments. In the C&I Group, sales in the quarter were up 2.5% as reported or 8.6 million versus 2021 and that includes $25.3 million or 6 point -- 7 point, that includes a $25.3 million or 7.6% organic gain driven by progress across all our divisions. From an earnings perspective, C&I income was 51.7%, a decrease of $3.8 million compared to 2021, $2 million of that was unfavorable foreign currency and the rest represents the impact of supply chain turbulence on the multi-SKU C&I products. The OI margin was 14.4%, down 140 basis points from 2021, but did represent progress and then it's a 100 basis -- 100 point sequential improvement from the last quarter, when compared with the pre-pandemic 2019 periods, sales were up 7.4% organically and the OI margin of 14.4% was down 20 basis points, but that included an 80-point impact from acquisitions and unfavorable currency. Now continuing bright spot in C&I this quarter and again this quarter was SNA Europe, it did deliver yet another quarter growth, expanding double-digit year-over-year and well beyond pre-pandemic levels, all against the wins in Europe with innovative solutions of our Bahco Erle tool management system leading the way, tailoring product specific to customer needs. Europe is a varied market and SNA Europe is making increasing gains by matching the products to the specific tasks. And that positive SNA Europe was joined in C&I, quite valuable contribution from recovering areas in critical industries like aerospace, in general industry and from countries, in Asia-Pacific, like, India, Japan and South Korea. All combines overcome the decline and slower to recover sectors like the military and natural resources. We do remain confident and committed to extending in critical industries and that commitment is confirmed with great new products. Speaking of product, last quarter to help solve crucial tasks across both critical industries and automotive repair, we strengthened our 14.4 Volt MicroLithium power tool lineup with the new Snap-on CT761 3/8-inch Impact Wrench. It's a very attractive, but it's also quite functional. Featuring a compact design to reach tight spaces, a nylon-based housing for rugged durability and a special toggle switch trigger for precise control. The new unit also includes a try being headlight for broad illumination entire work area and now that's a feature that makes complex multi-point jobs much easier in the low-light conditions that often occur in the workshop or enrolled repair. You can imagine it. The Impact Wrench also delivers a robust 225 foot pounds of breakaway torque and it's controlled by a variable speed drive. So the operator can apply just the right torque for each job and the 14 volt battery with its 2.5 amp hours ensure it's consistent output and an extended run time which makes for a lot more efficient workday. The CT361 began shipping early in the quarter and it was right on target, quickly becoming a million hit product and it's sold out and what seem like a blink of an eye. Great product. Well, that's C&I, a promising quarter, volume up nicely, starting to overcome the turbulence, moving down it's runways for growth. Now for the Tools Group, sales of $520.6 million, up $36.5 million, including $7.7 million of unfavorable currency and a 9.3% organic gains and the operating margin 23.9%, up 250 basis points compared with pre-virus 2019 sales grew $114.8 million, including a 28% -- 28.1% organic gain and this quarter is 23.9% operating margin was up 630 basis points compared with those pre-virus numbers, coming out of the pandemic stronger indeed. Another positive quarter for the Tools Group with growth across all product lines and beyond as we see further indications of continuing strength. Other data like the franchisee health metrics, which we monitor every quarter, they remain quite favorable and on a clearly positive trend. We do believe our van network remains quite strong and it's not just the numbers. Just a few weeks ago, I spent time with a couple of dozen franchisees representing the regions on our U.S. and Canadian national franchisee advisory councils, and they were motivated and prosperous, enthusiastic about the current performance, positive about the trajectories of the other vans and various areas that they represent and very optimistic about the prospects for even more going forward. They believe in their opportunities and they are confident about their future. The Tools Group, strong quantitatively and qualitatively and that positivity was not just internal. Once again this quarter, it was reinforced by the external view. Snap-on was recognized again this year among the top 50 in the franchise industry by Entrepreneur Magazine. And once again in that ranking, we rated in the top of the Tools Distribution category, a place we have for some time and this type of recognition reflects fundamental, contemporary strength of our franchisees and of our overall mobile van network. It is a powerhouse business and that momentum would not have been achieved without a continuous stream of unique new products. And one of those that helped drive our hand tools up again this quarter, again this quarter was our new Long Nose Slip Joint Pliers. It's a special tool with our patented 3-Position joint precisely machine for effortless switch -- for effortless switching and control, allowing the pliers to -- it allows the pliers to keep the jaws parallel increasing the contact with the work piece, with its indicated -- it's got a relocated joint, optimized handle shape and unique Talon Grip-serrated jaws. With all of that our new pliers provide over 50% more pulling power. The machined and hardened teeth are sharp and strong and present three different gripping geometries, from heavy serrations at the base to fine grooves at the tip, great variability for multiple applications. You can apply different parts of the jaw. They are manufactured right here in our Milwaukee factory and they are manufactured from special cold forged allied steel for greater durability and strength. These players were launched at the beginning of the past quarter and they have been very well received. When I talk to the franchisees of the NFAC, they said are flying off the truck, and they are right. The sales have already made a hit product strategy just in one quarter. Our new offerings are in fact making a difference in the Tools Group, you can't miss it in the numbers, eight straight quarters above pre-pandemic levels. The Tools Group is moving onward and upward with eye-catching momentum and if you look at the numbers or spend any time with the team, you believe it's all systems go and it is. Now on to RS&I, sales were up 4.6% or $18.2 million versus last year, including $27.4 million or 7% organic uplift with double-digit growth in undercar equipment with diagnostics and information advancing and with the dealership activity flat from an earnings perspective RS&I operating income of $95.7 million, represents a rise of $9 million or 10.4% and the operating margin was 23%, up 120 basis points in the last year. Compared with 2019, sales were up 19.5% as reported and the organic growth was $58 million or 16.8% with strong advances in undercar equipment and diagnostics and information products. For profitability, the OI margin of 23% was down 240 basis points versus 2019, pretty much reflecting 110 point impact just from acquisitions and the effect of the margin dilutions from the higher sales of undercar equipment that we have been seeing. We believe RS&I has great opportunities and we are fortifying its way forward with new products like our Hofmann 609 aligner, specifically designed for independent or general repair shops, where alignment is -- it's not currently a primary focus and the space is short. The new offering allows those all-purpose garage to keep the low volume alignment business in-house with its compact footprint and portability kit enabling easy storage when not in use and efficient deployment when alignment is actually need. It saves a lot of space, but it gets the job done. With our latest 3D system authoring OEM approved accuracy, the 609 enables the handling of even the most complex alignment systems by those general repair shops. It generates a high return on the investment, doesn't occupy space needed for other repairs -- often needed for other repairs and it fortifies the garage's reputation for technical capability. It's a great value for the general repair shops and they are noticing. Our equipment business has been on a roll with strong double-digit equipment growth for double-digit quarters for some time and the Hofmann 609 aligner is a big player in that mix. RS&I, approving its position with repair shop owners and managers, growth in undercar equipment and diagnostics and information projects, products and an array of innovative new products and product lines to lead the way. Well, those are the highlights of our quarter, Tools Group, strong progress everywhere, unmistakable strength. C&I, recording a positive performance against the variation across industries and geographies and RS&I, expanding profitable volume with repair shop owners and managers. Snap-on overall sales rising markedly, both versus last year up 8.4% organically and up 18.7% organically compared with pre-pandemic levels continuing clear positive trajectory. Opco operating margin are strong 21.7%, rising again in this quarter rising again this quarter, up 160 basis points. EPS $4.27, up versus last year, up versus last quarter and up versus pre-pandemic levels. It was an encouraging quarter. Now I will turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Thanks, Aldo. Well, that's our second quarter. Markets that are resilient and getting more robust by the day. These are interesting times in the pandemic, inflation, supply interruptions, a war, and pop-up lockdowns, but Snap-on brings to this turbulence considerable advantage in product, in brand and in people. It's enabled our team to cut through the turbulence, continuing a positive trajectory and you can see it in the performance. C&I on a growth path again, with a 7.6% organic increase, despite being our most impacted business. RS&I, gains with repair shop owners and managers, driven by hardware and its expanding information portfolio, sales up 7% organically and NOI margin of 22%, up 120 basis points from last year. And the Tools Group, gangbusters results, sales up 9.3% organically versus last year and up 28.1% versus 2019, eight straight quarters above pre-pandemic levels and NOI margin of 23.9%. And it all came together for overall Snap-on organic growth of 8.4%, NOI margin of 21.7% and an EPS of $4.27, all high watermarks despite the turbulence. It was an encouraging quarter and we emerge from that period with rising momentum. It is a turbulent time, but Snap-on is driven by attractive markets, by unique strengths and by an experienced and capable team that's achieved clear and consistent performance and period-by-period has become stronger and stronger in navigating the issues of the day. And we believe these inherent advantages will continue to prevail as we go forward on a clear an upward trajectory through the remainder of this year and well beyond. Before I turn the call over to the, Operator, I will speak directly to our franchisees and associates. I know they listen in. The corporation is an organization where people come together to create a benefit for themselves and others that they could not alter individually. You have done just that again this quarter. For your success in that endeavor you have my congratulations. For the energy and the skill you bring to our efforts, you have my admiration and for the commitment you unfailingly demonstrate to our team, you have my thanks. Now I will turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Thanks, Scott. Now, I don't like to give you -- I don't, I think, it's -- you start worrying too much of our quarter-to-quarter, Scott, Scott you go hikidi, bikidi, boo [ph] around here about, because things change depending on the models you bring up. But I will say that Tool storage was the leader, it was double digits, a nice quarter and it came -- and targets were in a factor, what happened at this time is, we started to get more of the bigger boxes out, the EPIQ and the Master Series. We had some great new offerings. Our Supernova Masters Series with the electric blue and the copper trim, that seemed very popular. So it was a great quarter. Carts were continued to be strong, but EPIQ, the bigger boxes, the regular tool storage box, we could call Roll Cabs or not made the difference. So it was a pretty good quarter. The Tools Group really, I mean, I think, it did have a great quarter. By the way, did I mention that the Tools Group NOI margin was 23.9% in the quarter? I think, I have mentioned that. That was -- I think that says it all. I will tell you. And by the way, in the quarter hand tools were already -- were also up and also -- that's a nice factor for us, up strongly. But the big impact in the quarter... Yeah. Go ahead. Go ahead. Yeah. Look, the inventories are up, the guys are crying for more inventory, when they go out there and their inventory turns are substantially below pre-pandemic levels. So the inventory turns are higher at this time and not below pre-pandemic levels, they are above pre-pandemic levels. So they are substantially higher at this time. And the sell-through was better this quarter than it was last quarter. When you look at it overall, it seems to be right in line with our overall sales. So we think it's moving along nicely. I do believe our guys want more inventory. I do believe they want more. And I would say in our business, there's still, we got a little better at delivering, but we still like, we still have a pretty good backlog. People are clamoring for our products still. Yeah. Well, it's across the Board, but the collision business has been a star in this situation. We acquired Car-O-Liner a few years ago and we anticipated that collision with the deployment of the neural network around the sensors, around the sort of driver assist systems would make collision a very lucrative area and it seems to have played out. So collision is among the top four undercar equipment, but generally it's all roll pretty well. The independent repair shops are optimistic. They are seeing the, well, I said it in my call, investment up, spending up, technicians up, wages up, they can see it all come in through. So they are white hot in terms of their optimism, in terms of the situation. So it get them to invest more. That's what you are seeing in undercar equipment. Sure. Thanks. Last quarter, I don't think had any impact on this quarter. But it was mostly in the last quarter where you saw, it might have had some impact on originations, because last quarter you -- from a sales point of view, there was a skewing towards the back end of the quarter, because the breach was in the early parts of the quarter, so you saw that going out. And as I said, last time we thought we had pretty robust sales in some of the big ticket items, but they hadn't made their way through the vans yet necessarily and that probably worked out this quarter. I think the big driver though, Luke, is the product. I think the optimism of the technicians and the product itself. I think, what does drive originations is the view of people saying, wow. I really like these EPIQ boxes I got and we had a more available now. We are getting better at delivering them. During the pandemic we had some fits and starts, so we are pushing a little more carts and now we have a little bit more of the basic roll cabs. So I think that's what drove the higher originations in this time. We still see pretty good RA, the finance by the franchisees seemed pretty solid. That wasn't down in the course. So that was pretty strong. As I said, hand tools were up. So I think it's pretty much product driven. What you see in the Tools Group, I mean, the Tools Group is on a pretty big momentum. If you look back over the pre-pandemic levels, they were up 9%, and what was that, Q4 2020 then 15%, then17%, then 21%, then 22%, then 24% and 28% this quarter. And by the way, they came through the quarter, they exited the quarter stronger. They are on the mail train. They have got momentum rolling. And so I feel pretty good about that and that's playing out in some of the now broader product lines in Tool Storage. We did, as I said in the last call, that doesn't mean that carts were down any, they were still strong in the quarter just that the low cash got bigger. Well, I think, look, I think, higher software margins are, you are going to see it, one of the things you are seeing in our -- remember we said, we are pivoting away from titles where we sold updates, we call it titles, but they are basically updates on software every six months, we are pivoting to a subscription business. So that tends to stretch out your revenue was a little bit -- it effects revenues in the quarter. And so, but our subscriptions are up deep, our subscribers are up deep double digits in this quarter year-over-year. So that seems to be working for us. So we are pretty pumped about the possibilities in that, but you know you have some, I guess, I would say, recognition questions as you go through this period. So you don't quite see it coming through, but I can see it coming through in the future. And as I said, with the array of electronic products we have around software, from the diagnostic software to the Mitchell 1 software, to Dealer-FX to electronic parts catalogs to vehicle checks. We feel we are repair, information headquarters and it's going to become bigger and we are going to see it roll through that business earlier. Now if you ask me to expect to see the equipment business attenuate, I hope not. I am not hoping for it, just because it's low margin, it doesn't seem, it doesn't mean I don't want the profits, I do. So and I could see that go, that was down -- you might remember, it was down, it was pretty much flat on its back for a couple of quarters, couple of three quarters earlier and it's bouncing back from that. We have seen a lot in independent repair shops and I would figure after the dealerships start to get used to the situation, I think, they will discombobulated by the low supply and what are they doing associated with this sort of a little bit -- little more reluctant in situation. When they come online, I think, that will be even greater. Yeah. Good morning. Go ahead. Go ahead. Ask the follow-up one. And by the way, just, Bret, before the Tools Group will execute -- Tools Group guys will execute be if I leave this conference call, not saying that it also have inflationary impacts on it and price is going up. So it's not just RS&I and C&I. They also have to deal with that and I got to give them credit for that. But look, here is the thing, it's hard for us to determine, because we know we have some pricing, but it isn't the majority of it. Looking at our factories, we know we have products in demand. There is rolling off there and our guys are up to their eyeballs in demand. So we know that's a positive situation. The other thing is it's hard, because you know we have list prices. But the list prices don't -- are very from product to product and they come out on an average, you might say your raising sales 3.5% or something like that but products. And then overlaying on top of that we have a lot of new tools, we keep roll in new tool. In fact, million dollar tools we have dozens a quarter rolling out and then, across the network. And then we have promotions that occur week to week and they can be lean or rich and taken up the big effect. So it's hard for us to say. I would say the minority of the increases in pricing and the majority is in volume for us. We think that's the situation in this situation in our environment. Now, that varies from Group to Group and so on. Now if you talk about where we are getting the biggest impact, our biggest inflationary impact, Bret, is trying to buy on the spot market, because we have said we want to deliver the best we can. We have demand. We want to deliver. We are not keeping up with all the demand, but so we are buying like chips on the spot market. And I can go -- that can fluctuate wildly. We buy components for power tools and other things on a spot market, that can move wildly. If you look at commodities, I would say, look, we buy several, many grades of steel, but if you look at steel for tool storage and steel for, let's say, lifts, hot rolled and cold rolled, there both coming off a little bit. They are getting a little better. They are coming down. If you look at steel for hand tools, it's at its top and now they are still not back to the steady state levels but they backed off a little bit. The steel for hand tools, which we call rod steel, that's pretty much reached the top level and it's flattened out but it hasn't abated for us yet and we are not seeing too much abatements in freight, you see those kinds of things flowing through. I would expect this stuff, as I believe that as the COVID turbulent start the micro viscosity start -- stop happening, you are going to see the stuff start to drift downwards, because you are not going to have the interruptions in supply and therefore it's going to get more regular and therefore the prices are going to come down. But I don't have a crystal ball on that. That's sort of our view of the situation. It's hard for me to say because it changes. It's all over the map depending on where you are. In the Tools Group, you have a list price and the other places, you are pricing product-by-product and it depends on the size of the product and a lot of different things. So, all I am saying is, I think, if you wanted to step back and you look at our pricing, it's the minority of our growth. Hopefully get share, get volume out of it, Bret. Okay. Hi, Chris. Yeah. We don't have -- it's hard for us to get a handle on all of that, because you tend to start out with people at lower levels. But we are adding technicians. I can't parse that thing for you. We are certainly aiming at that and it's been successful, but we are also selling more to the existing technicians because their wages are going up, they are getting more optimistic. And also it's not a situation where we see static activities. I will say the number of technicians we have on the books are going up and that includes some new people. So that's about all I can give you on that. I think there are both things in play at least, because of the... And it makes sense. I just want to add this, because it makes sense, because we believe it's great for us to get new technicians and that's a one component of growth that I have talked about for a dog's age here. But it's also in this environment clear that existing technicians, young or old are going to need new products. And they are actually going to need more a greater array of these products as you get more and different powertrain, as you get more of these automated features in the system. So we anticipate both effects being lucrative forward motion, it would be wrong to think that either one was maybe -- to think that they weren't both good avenues for growth. Sure. No. I don't, well, we like to think we got bit more out the door. But I don't think that's it. I think, look, I think we are making a little bit of penetration. As I tried to say in our remarks, we are getting better at handling the turbulence. I'd like to say we are not as dumb as we look and a lot of people would say that would be impossible. But we are kind of learning quarter by quarter and C&I has the longest learning curve, because they have the most impact of all this stuff that's happened. I mean, C&I in Shanghai, there is that one thing -- by the way, we were up in Asia in C&I, so they did pretty well in that regard. So what we are seeing is, we are seeing our ability to manage the turbulence better. We are also seeing some warming, like in this quarter, one of the things that was very encouraged by is that the military wasn't down as much in the quarter. The military is kind of coming back. It's still down. You know what I mean, I am still -- I don't like it, but it's still -- it's coming back. So it wasn't as big of a hole this quarter, as it has been in the past. And also general industry, I don't know if you saw that comment, general industry was up and aviation in total was up, particularly international aviation believe it or not. So, general industry which implies the widest category for us, in terms of that, that has so many different segments and that was up strongly. So I kind of think the critical industries are coming, getting stronger, recovering from the impact. So we feel pretty good about that. In our business are looking better. Now, that's why we were particularly pleased about this 7.6% growth organically in C&I. That made us -- that gave us great encouragement. And in reality, the 14.4%, yeah, it was down 140 basis points year-over-year, but 14.4% aren't chop liver for C&I, it's not so bad. And was up 100 basis points versus last quarter and down 2020 versus 2019 against the pretty severe impact of acquisitions and currency, I think, it was 80 basis points. So those -- they are points were pretty good for us, we were encouraged by it. Sure. Gary, how are you? I think you see more demand for the diagnostic, but you also see the hand tools. I think, if you look at the -- they are in the car park, but they are -- if you look at -- it's one thing to look at it versus the sales. If you look at them in the car park, it gets to be pretty thin. You are not seeing -- not that many garages are seeing a lot of them. So the guys are talking to us about this and we sell hand tools and we sell some diagnostics that you have -- it's not a special diagnostic form, but it's a diagnostic that would have the capabilities to deal with those things. So you are not seeing -- they are still pretty thinly distributed across unless maybe you are in Southern California or something like that or maybe New York City or some, you might see some of those garages, but we are not seeing huge demand. Mostly we are getting ready for what we think will be the demand going forward. We think this is going to be a tidal wave. And so that's one of the reasons why we acquired Dealer-FX to get a look at these things. Sure. Thanks, Ivan. I would say, we didn't expect it to be that big. This one -- the couple -- of course, this is an earnings call, so I pick some of the ringer as you know and I put them on. But the thing is that, those guys blew out the doors and we didn't anticipate it be that good, otherwise we would have done a bigger run to begin with. So that's the situation. Just the demand was really high. Now, on top of that, I will tell you that we believe we need more capacity, because we have demand, so we are looking at that situation wise and we will have to go back and try to schedule another run in the handful plants, which is already over scheduled, but we will try to put that in and roll out with some more. Obviously though, if you are do that, I mean, the reason why we are running a hand tool plants, they got a lot of demand. So we see ourselves that sitting on some further opportunities if we can just rollout more product and we are working on it. In terms of expanding the plant we have an expansion plan for our Milwaukee hand tool plants, where this plans was built. Yeah. Look, I think, they are having talks about that, but generally you are talking about insulated tool, some of the obvious stuff like some diagnostics stuff, some insulated tools, some lift tables for the batteries, those kinds of things. And then what will happen, Ivan, is the mechanics don't know yet what they don't know, you know what I mean, about preparing the tool. Those new cars get into the dealerships and the mechanics will discover where they need new tools to deal with it. That's a whole other level of array. So we are talking right now about the common things that you might -- you observe from early days from the -- you hear from the OEMs, are you see the very, very -- very early days in the OEM garages and those are the things that I just talked about like insulated tools and some diagnostics some analysis routines and also some lift tables and other stuff around electric vehicles and then you are going to hear as a guys start repair them, let's say, geez, these particular vehicles are different, I need a special tool to do this and that's where we start rolling out our activity we start building more tools to match. That's a whole other array and that's one of the thing really takes off for us. It's also true -- so true... Also true. I didn't mention that, but that's right... That's -- reason I have mentioned is handled by another division. But that's also true. A lot of this stuff is going to -- the equipment -- the whole equipment line that doesn't go through the vans is a whole other issue that's going to need new stuff, because these things are heavy, as you know being a car expert. Correct. Correct. You got it. That's right. I mean the batteries are, before I -- I think most people don't realize, how heavy these batteries are actually. There's a lot of weight underneath that -- under that chassis. So it's going to be an issue. It's going to revolutionize garage I believe as things go out. And again, I want to point out that, the OEMs will figure this out early, but then there will be a lot of unforeseen complications that change it again after your first wave of change. So we are pretty pumped. That's why I say we are entering the golden age of car repair. Okay. Thank you."

            "content": "Nick, thanks. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on slide six. Net sales of $1,136.6 million in the quarter increased 5.1% from 2021 levels, reflecting an 8.4% organic sales gain, partially offset by $32.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales gain this quarter reflects high single-digit growth in each of the company's segments and compares to an 8% year-over-year organic increase recorded last quarter. Consolidated gross margin of 48.7%, remained the same as last quarter, but declined 150 basis points from 50.2% last year. Higher material and other costs were partially offset by contributions from the increased sales volumes and pricing actions, as well as from benefits from the company's RCI initiatives and 30 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects. Again this quarter, we believe the corporation through pricing and RCI actions continue to navigate effectively the costs and other supply chain dynamics of the current environment. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 27% improved 310 basis points from 30.1% last year. The improvement is primarily due to higher sales volumes, savings from RCI initiatives and lower cost associated with stock-based expenses, operating earnings from financial services of $246.6 million in the quarter, compared to $217.1 million in 2021. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 21.7%, improved 160 basis points from last year and was up 140 basis points sequentially. Financial services revenue of $86.4 million in the second quarter of 2022, compared to $86.9 million last year. Operating earnings of $65.3 million, a decrease $3.6 million from 2021 levels, primarily as a result of higher provisions for credit losses and those recorded last year. Consolidated operating earnings of $311.9 million, compared to $286 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 25.5%, improved 100 basis points from 24.5% in 2021. Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 23.8%, compared to 23.3% last year. Net earnings of $231.5 million or $4.27 per diluted share increased $23.5 million or $0.51 per share from last year's levels, representing a 13.6% increase in diluted earnings per share. Now, let's turn to our segment results, starting with the C&I Group on slide seven. Sales of $359.1 million increased from $350.5 million last year, reflecting a $25.3 million or 7.6% organic sales gain, partially offset by $16.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. The organic growth primarily reflects double-digit gains in the segments European based hand tools business and Asia-Pacific operations, as well as a mid single-digit increase in sales to customers in critical industries. Within critical industries, solid gains in general industry and international aviation more than offset lower sales to the military. Gross margin of 37.3%, although improving sequentially, declined 220 basis points from 39.5% in the second quarter of 2021. This is primarily due to higher material and other input costs being partially offset by the benefits from higher sales volumes and pricing actions and savings from the segment's RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22.9% in the quarter, improved 80 basis points from 23.7% in 2021, primarily due to the effects of higher sales volumes. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $51.7 million, compared to $55.5 million last year. The operating margin of 14.4%, compared to 15.8% a year ago. Turning now to slide eight, sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $520.6 million, increased 7.5% from $484.1 million in 2021, reflecting a 9.3% organic sales gain, partially offset by $7.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. The organic sales growth reflects a double-digit gain in our U.S. business and a low single-digit increase in our international operations. In the U.S., sales were up across all product lines and include a particularly robust sales of full-storage in the quarter. Gross margin of 46% in the quarter, compared to 45.5% in the first quarter of this year, but declined 80 basis points from 46.8% last year. The year-over-year decline is primarily due to higher material and other costs, and 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by benefits from higher sales volumes and pricing actions. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales 22.1%, improved 330 basis points from 25.4% last year, reflecting the benefits from higher sales volumes and savings from RCI initiatives, and including the effects of lower expenses associated with the company's franchisees stock purchase program. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $124.4 million, compared to $103.5 million last year. The operating margin of 23.9% improved 250 basis points from 21.4% a year ago. Turning to RS&I Group, shown on slide nine, sales of $416.8 million, compared to $398.6 million a year ago, reflecting a 7% organic sales gain, partially offset by $9.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain is comprised of a double-digit increase in sales of undercar equipment and a low single-digit gain in the sale of diagnostics and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers. Activity with OEM dealerships was essentially flat. Gross margin of 43.2%, declined 150 basis points from 44.7% last year. This is primarily due to higher material and other input costs and increased sales in lower gross margin businesses. These declines were partially offset by benefits from pricing actions and savings from RCI initiatives, as well as from 50 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 20.2%, improved 270 basis points from 22.9% last year, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage, including higher activity and lower expense businesses and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating earnings from the RS&I Group of $95.7 million, compared to $86.7 million last year. The operating margin 23%, improved 120 basis points from 21.8% reported a year ago. Now turning to slide 10, revenue from financial services of $86.4 million, including $800,000 of unfavorable currency translation, compared to $86.9 million last year. Financial services operating earnings of $65.3 million, compared to $68.9 million in 2021. Financial services expenses of $21.1 million were up $3.1 million from 2021 levels, mostly due to $2.4 million of increased provisions for credit losses. While provisions have increased versus a historically lower provision rate experienced last year, loan portfolio trends remain stable. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1% and eight-tenths of 1% in the second quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively. In both the second quarters of 2022 and 2021, the average yield on finance and contract receivables were 17.5% and 8.5%, respectively. Total loan originations of $307.6 million in the second quarter increased $21.8 million or 7.6% from 2021 levels, reflecting an 11% increase in originations of finance receivables, partially offset by decrease in the origination of contract receivables. Moving to slide 11, our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our U.S. operations. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.4% for the U.S. extended credit is the same as comparable pre-pandemic period of 2019 and reflects the seasonal improvement we typically experience in the second quarter. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, the trailing 12-month net losses of $40.4 million represented 2.33% of outstandings at quarter end, which is down slightly from the 2.34% reported at the end of last quarter. Now turning to slide 12, cash provided by operating activities of $140.8 million in the quarter, compared to $238.2 million last year. The decrease in the second quarter of 2021 primarily reflects an $87.7 million increase in working investment. The change in working investment dollars is largely driven by greater demand, including increases in receivables and higher levels of inventory this year. In addition to demand base requirements, the inventory increase also reflects higher in-transit inventory amounts, as well as incremental buffer stocks associated with the supply chain dynamics in the current macro environment. Net cash used by investing activities of $73.8 million, included net additions to finance receivables of $53.5 million and capital expenditures of $21.3 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $112.2 million, included cash dividends of $75.7 million and the repurchase of $251,000 shares of common stock for $53.8 million under our existing share repurchase program. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $420.8 million of common stock under existing authorizations. Turning to slide 13, trade and other accounts receivable increased $46.8 million from 2021 year end. Days sales outstanding of 60 days, compared to 58 days at 2021 year end. Inventories increased $89.5 million from 2021 year end and on a trailing 12-month basis inventory turns of 2.7 compared to 2.8 at year end 2021. Our quarter end cash position of $812.9 million, compared to $780 million at year end 2021. Our net debt to capital ratio of 8.3% compared to 9.1% at year end 2021. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million available under our credit facilities and as of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. I will now briefly review a few outlook items for 2022. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. In addition, we currently anticipate absent any changes to U.S. tax legislation that our full year 2022 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%. I will now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Thanks for the question, Luke. Actually it has a little affect if anything it might create a more favorable environment. And why do I say that? Again, we fund long. So if you look at Snap-On's balance sheet, we don't fund day-to-day. So the rising interest rates do not have a foreseeable immediate impact on our borrowing capability, because as you could see there's plenty of cash on the balance sheet and there is nothing that's coming due for quite some time. So we are stable in terms of the cost of our funds going into that business. Our stated rates have been pretty consistent really for decade plus. So and they are not the lowest rate out there, but they are lower than what might be available to people that are on a credit card format and things of that nature. So we think our rates are appropriate for the credit profile of the customers that we serve, we think that they -- those types of customers recognize that. So we are the kind of the lender of choice if they do decide to engage in any type of lending activity. And I think because we provide that stability, it gives a little bit a form of reassurance, so as interest rates go up competitors rates, if they were ever considering them, and when I say competitors, I am thinking of things like credit cards. So as interest rates are going to be going up for people that are in the subprime category. So we are going to be pretty stable and our approach is going to be pretty consistent. Yeah, I think the competitions rates might be going up, which you could argue maybe creates a slightly more favorable environment."

Additional information regarding those measures is included in our earnings release issued today, which can be found on our website. With that said, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?\nNick Pinchuk: Thanks Sara. Good morning everybody. As usual, I'll start the call by covering the highlights of our first quarter and along the way, I'll give you my perspective on our results, they are encouraging. In our market, so looking positive and our progress, we believe we're stronger than ever. We'll also speak about what it all means. We believe it means that we're positioned for more, much more. Then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. These are interesting times, filled with multiple axes of turbulence, but this isn't our first rodeo. We know it's always something. And it's our job to confront and to overcome with the resilience of our markets, the strength of our strategic and tactical advantages and the insight and energy of our consistent and capable team, and we've done just that. Here are the numbers that support that view. Our reported sales in the quarter of $1.0978 billion were up 7.1%, including $8.5 million in acquisition-related activity of $15.7 million of unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales growth was 8% with gains in every group. And compared to the pre-pandemic levels in 2019, our clear upward drive shines right through versus 2019 sales in this past quarter rose 19.1% as reported and 16.9% organically. In fact, it's our seventh straight quarter being above the pre-virus levels. We believe we're continuing an ongoing trend of accelerating expansion, momentum, increasing higher and higher, demonstrating that we're only getting stronger every day. And contributions from our Snap-on Value Creation processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, all combined to drive that progress, and progress there was. Opco operating income of $223.1 million increased $22.2 million from last year. The operating margin, it was 20.3%, up 70 basis points from last year and 120 basis points from 2019, as adjusted for the favorable legal settlement in that period. For financial services, operating income of $70.4 million increased 7.8% and credit losses were down, continuing the positive trends, despite the lingering effects of the pandemic. And that result combined with opco for a consolidated operating margin of 24.8%, a 90 basis improvement from last year and 120 basis points from the as adjusted 2019 result. First quarter EPS, it was $4, up 14.3% from last year's $3.50 and 32.9% above the as-adjusted $3.01 recorded in 2019. To risk repeating myself, we believe Snap-on is stronger now than when we entered this great withering and our first quarter results are solid testimony. Now let's talk about our markets. Auto repair remains quite resilient. I think, we'd say, spending on vehicle maintenance and repair is up and technicians are earning more than ever. They've been working, performing essential tasks, making a nice living. They're undaunted by the turbulence and they are optimistic about the future of their profession, about the outlook of individual transportation, and about the greater need for their skills as the vehicle part changes with new technology and all of that has led to an expansion in the ranks with the automotive repair technician count moving upward at its highest point for, I think, at least three decades. And as shopowners and managers will tell you, there's a need for many more. Vehicle repair strong -- is a strong and resilient market. You can hear it in our franchisees voices. You could feel it in a technician's wallet, and you can see it written across our numbers. Also in an auto repair, spanning right next to the tax, there are shop owners and managers, where our Repair Systems & Information Group, RS&I applies its trade. Demand for new and used cars is high, despite the limited supply, despite the limited supply. Dealership repair, maintenance and warranty is rebounding, and dealers are starting to invest again. New vehicles are being released with a greater variety of drivetrains, with a greater variety of drivetrains than ever, from internal combustion engines, from internal combustion to hybrid to plug-in electric, to full electric, and the range of options is growing, more driver assist, more vehicle automation, increasing vehicle complexity. To tell you, it's all music to our ears. And we've been able to take advantage with our lineup of intelligent diagnostic products, by including the ZEUS, the TRITON and the APOLLO handheld units, with our celebrated Mitchell1 ProDemand repair information, our award-winning Tru-Point Advanced Driver Assist calibration system, and our 3D alignment systems like the new Hofmann Geoliner, all representing new technologies and big data deployed to make work easier right in the shop. Vehicle repair looks more promising than ever and Snap-on is poised to capitalize. Finally, let's talk about critical industries. With Snap-on rolls out of the garage, solving tests of consequence. This is where C&I operates, the most international of our operations. And these are the customers that continue to be impacted hardest by the lingering virus, but they removed -- they've been recovering. And in the quarter, our results showed that trend. Despite some significant headwinds like supply chain disruption, commodity cost increases, some challenged business sectors like the military and international \u2013 international aviation or aerospace, and troubled geographies, conflict impacted countries and those more prone to business interruptions as a means to control the virus. Well, C&I had it all.  Despite the variation, though, we did see growth, improvement in a number of geographies, Asia and Europe and in a range of sectors like general industry, education and natural resources. They all combined to author organic growth against the continuing turbulence. So overall, I'd describe our C&I markets as challenged, but improving.  And looking forward, we believe they represent clear opportunity. Viewing on the overall picture, we believe there's been substantial progress along our runways for growth, enhancing the van network, expanding with repair shop owners and managers, extending to critical industries and building in emerging markets, leveraging our broadening product lines, wielding our strong brand and deploying the increasing understanding of the work that is the hallmark of Snap-On people, even in the throes of the pandemic shock.  Two years ago, as we entered the virus, you all remember this, two years ago when we entered the virus, we recognized the resilience of our market and the strength of our model and projected a V-shaped recovery and that's how it played out. You can see it in the trends.  Now let's turn to the segments. In the C&I Group, first quarter sales were $340.1 million, down $5.6 million due to $9.2 million of unfavorable currency, and $3.6 million or 1.1% -- and a $3.6 million or 1.1% organic growth. As we said, across C&I, results were mixed. But the period did see gains in Asia with Japan, India, South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, rising. And Europe was also up, with Sweden, Belgium, Poland and France leading the way.  C&I's operating income was $45.7 million, down $5 million, reflecting $2.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency, with the organic volume gains more than offset by supply chain inefficiencies. Now when compared with the pre-pandemic levels of 2019, sales were up 5.5%, including a 3.6% organic gain and the OI margin of 13.4% was down 100 basis points, but against 150 basis points impact of acquisitions and unfavorable currency.  C&I has simply been more affected by the difficulties, macroeconomic challenges, geopolitical uncertainty, varying COVID conditions. It makes sense. But the operation is spread over more countries and more industries. It's challenging, but we are making some headway and we're enthusiastic about the possibilities going forward. As part of that view, we remain committed to extending in Critical Industries, and we'll keep strengthening our position to capture opportunities as they arise and enabling that attempt is our expanding line of innovative new products, designed to match the demands of the industries, industries that we serve and to make critical work easier.  One example is our family of microelectronic torque wrenches. And I've been talking about Snap-On electronic torque products for some time. But these smaller versions of our flagship offerings are gaining particular strength in the critical markets. Our latest, the connected Bluetooth model offers customers a solution when they need torque certification data in real time. The Snap-On Control Tech Micro Bluetooth wrench fills that requirement and combines it with the benefits of reduced size and lower weight, shorter than 12 inches and less than one pound, better accessibility and reduced operator fatigue, all while allowing users to interface with a Snap-on app or directly with customers with the customer's operating system. The ControlTech Micro Bluetooth offers a wide range of torque, five to 240 inch pounds, an all steel body construction, progressive LEDs for an enhanced user guidance and a 72-inch quarter-inch drive enabling efficient operation in tight areas, all with a plus or minus 2% accuracy. It's a package well-suited to critical sectors like aviation. And in the first quarter, our customers' orders confirmed that belief emphatically. Well, that's C&I. Hard one progress against the turbulence. Now on to the Tools Group. Sales of $512.1 million, up $33.8 million, including $3 million of unfavorable currency, and $36.8 million or 7.7% organic gain, double digit growth in the U.S. being partially offset by challenges in the international operations. The operating margin was 22.7%, up 200 basis points from last year's historically high level -- high 20.7%. And compared with the pre-virus levels, sales grew 24.8%, and this year's 22.7% operating margin was up 630 basis points compared with 2019. The Tools Group is -- the Tools Group is responding to the challenges of the day, taking advantage of increasing vehicle complexity, increasing its product advantage, fortifying its brands, and further enabling its franchisees and the results show it. I keep saying that, but that's what's written across our performance this quarter. We do believe our runway for coherent growth, enhancing the franchise network, represents a resilient and expanding opportunity. And we're realizing some of that potential across the van channel. The evidence is unmistakable in our franchisee metrics. Again, this quarter, they remain clearly favorable. And based on those measurements, we believe the franchisees have never been stronger, and they say so themselves emphatically, pumped in time for more that's what they are. And in our direct interactions at events like the past January's kickoff, back again this year in person. It was a great affair, well-attended, strong orders, visible commitment to our brand. Our franchisees, entrepreneurs and professionals all are enabled by their increased selling capabilities, broadly and deeply confident in their prospects, in the company's prospects and eager to reach higher. That's an important factor. And there's a number of reasons for that optimism, but a big one is rooted in Snap-on value creation, customer connection and innovation, authoring new products, clearly making work easier, born out of observing changing work in shops on an everyday basis, just like the franchisees. And that's the reason our tool storage sales were up nicely in the quarter, driven in part by our -- they were driven in part by our exciting new line of mobile carts. Over the last several years, we've been enhancing our carts. One example is our KRSC range of mobile storage solutions, the only professional grade carts in the market, they're built in our Iowa plant. I just saw them running down, I was just there seeing those units roll down the line. The KRSC are designed for maximum strength and durability. They're constructed with a heavy gauge steel, to form a one piece, fully welded body with reinforced corners, and that's a significant and unique benefit in the mobile storage arena. These 30 parts make it easy to move even the heaviest tools from bay-to-bay. They come in an attractive range of colors and trims, just like they are full-sized Big Brother boxes. And they're offered in either a sliding split top, providing usable work surface, while allowing substantial access to the top drawer or a single piece flip flop, allowing quicker and broader access to the most frequently used tools. Our new cart also has -- also features full wide drawers for maximum flexibility and offer power options for charging cordless tools. The KRSC -- the KRSC, you can to say it in these three words, durability, versatility, and functionality. They're great for meeting -- they're great for newer mechanics, as an affordable way to own some serious Snap-on tool storage. And at the same time, they're attractive for veterans. They're attractive for veterans, giving them the opportunity to improve productivity by expanding their mobility around the shop. This quarter, as repair work and tech wages are on the rise, we received record orders, proving that when innovation meets a resilient market, demand follows. We said that vehicle repair was growing was growing, and it is. Complexity would accelerate the market upward and it has. And we're working hard to position our franchisees to take advantage. And you can see it in the Tools Group results, seven straight above pre-pandemic gangbuster's quarters. Now, let's speak of RS&I. First quarter sales rose 50.6% or -- $50.6 million or 14.6% with gains across the board. Organic growth was 13.3%, driven by undercar equipment and OEM dealership activity, delivering double-digit expansion. And by the diagnostics and information products, the independent shops advancing low single-digits. Compared with 2019 sales -- compared with 2019, sales grew $70.3 million, 21.4%, including 56.9% -- including $56.9 million or 17.4% organic gain, $15.2 million from acquisitions and $1.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency. Operating earnings of 91.6% increased $10.2 million from 2021 and the OI margin was 23%, down 40 basis points, but primarily due to acquisitions and the rise of lower-margin undercar equipment. We clearly see the potential of our runways for growth in the RS&I Group, expanding Snap-on's presence in the garage, which coherent acquisitions and a growing line of powerful products. The organic growth in the quarter was broad-based, but once again, undercar equipment expanded at double-digits and progress in one of our newest product groups, collision repair helped author that positive. And we're doubling down on the potential in that arena by utilizing the same broad database with deep content as used in our ProDemand vehicle repair solutions. Big data aimed specifically at the body shop, vehicle measurements to guide body work, repair information to aid in standard shop work, and calibrations to restore the sensor networks that support ADAS or advanced driver assistance systems. It's a combination that's increasingly essential for every collision shop. And we believe it is going to be a big seller. RS&I also got a nice boost from winning a number of significant essential tools and equipment programs for OEM dealerships. As we expected, we started to see new launches for both electric power and for internal combustion vehicles, and RS&I is right at the front. So we're quite positive about RS&I's expanding position with vehicle repair shop owners and managers and are very confident in the opportunities as the vehicle industry evolves. So that's the highlights of our quarter. Progress in the turbulence. C&I, growing despite the headwinds. The Tools Group, strong and confident. RS&I solid. Overall organic sales rising 8%. Opco operating margin, 20.3% and EPS $4, up significantly. And most importantly, more testimony that Snap-on has emerged from the turbulence much stronger than when it entered. It was an encouraging quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?\nAldo Pagliari: Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on slide six. Net sales of $197.8 million in the quarter increased 7.1% from 2021 levels, reflecting an 8% organic sales gain, an $8.5 million of acquisition-related sales, partially offset by $15.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales gain this quarter principally reflected double-digit growth in the Repair Systems & Information Group, and high single-digit growth in the Snap-on Tools Group. Consolidated gross margin of 48.7% declined 140 basis points from 50.1% last year. Higher material and other costs were partially offset by contributions from the higher sales volumes, pricing actions, benefits from the company's RCI initiatives and 30 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects. In the quarter, we believe the corporation through pricing and RCI actions continued to navigate effectively the cost and other supply chain dynamics of the current environment. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 28.4% improved 210 basis points from 30.5% last year. The improvement is primarily due to higher sales volumes, savings from RCI initiatives and lower costs associated with stock-based expenses. These improvements were partially offset by 40 basis points of unfavorable acquisition effects. Operating earnings before financial services of $223.1 million in the quarter compared to $200.9 million in 2021. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 20.3%, improved 70 basis points from last year. Financial services revenue of $87.7 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to $88.6 million last year. Operating earnings of $70.4 million increased $5.1 million from 2021 levels, primarily reflecting continued favorable portfolio performance, which resulted in lower provisions for credit losses. Consolidated operating earnings of $293.5 million compared to $266.2 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 24.8% improved 90 basis points from 23.9% in 2021. Our first quarter effective income tax rate of 23.7% compared to 23.5% last year. Net earnings of $217.4 million or $4 per diluted share, increased $24.8 million or $0.50 per share from last year's levels, representing a 14.3% increase in diluted earnings per share.  Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $340.1 million decreased from $345.7 million last year, reflecting a $3.6 million or 1.1% organic sales gain, which was more than offset by $9.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic growth primarily reflects a double-digit increase in sales in the segment's Asia Pacific operations, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in sales to customers in Critical Industries. Within Critical Industries, lower sales to the military more than offset solid gains in general industry and technical education. Gross margin of 36.4% declined 230 basis points from 38.7% in the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to the higher material and other input costs, partially offset by benefits from pricing actions and the segment's RCI initiatives.  Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 23% in the quarter improved 100 basis points from 24% in 2021, primarily reflecting savings from cost efficiencies. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $45.7 million compared to $50.7 million last year. The operating margin of 13.4% compared to 14.7% a year ago. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-On Tools Group of $512.1 million increased 7.1% from $478.3 million in 2021 reflecting a 7.7% organic sales gain, partially offset by $3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase reflects a double-digit gain in our US business, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in our international operations.  Sales in the United States were up over Q4, 2021 as well, reflecting strong sequential performance in power tools and tool storage. Gross margin of 45.5% in the quarter declined 40 basis points from last year, primarily due to higher material and other costs, which were more \u2013 mostly offset by the higher sales volumes, pricing actions and 30 basis points from favorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22.8% improved 240 basis points from 25.2% last year, primarily reflecting the higher sales, savings from RCI initiatives and lower stock-based expenses related to the company's franchisee stock plan. Operating earnings for the Snap-On Tools Group of $116 million compared to $98.9 million last year. The operating margin of 22.7% improved 200 basis points from 20.7% last year. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $398.2 million compared to $347.6 million a year ago, reflecting a 13.3% organic sales gain and $8.5 million of acquisition-related sales, partially offset by $3.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain is comprised of double-digit increases in sales of undercar equipment and in sales to OEM dealerships, as well as low single-digit gains in sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers.  Gross margin of 44.6% declined 140 basis points from 46% last year. This was primarily due to increased sales in lower gross margin businesses and higher material and other input costs, partially offset by benefits from pricing actions and 50 basis points from acquisitions, as well as from 30 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 21.6% improved 100 basis points from 22.6% last year, primarily due to the benefits from sales volume leverage, including higher volumes and lower expense businesses, and savings from RCI initiatives. These improvements were partially offset by 110 basis points of unfavorable acquisition effects. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $91.6 million, compared to $81.4 million last year. The operating margin of 23% compared to 23.4% a year ago. Now turning to slide 10. Revenue from financial services of $87.7 million decreased $900,000 from $88.6 million last year, primarily due to a decline in the size of the average financial services portfolio during the quarter as compared to last year. Financial services operating earnings of $70.4 million, compared to $65.3 million in 2021. Financial services expenses of $17.3 million were down $6 million from 2021 levels, primarily due to $5.6 million of decreased provisions for credit losses, resulting from favorable loan portfolio trends, including reduced year-over-year net charge-offs, which support lower forward-looking estimated reserve requirements. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 0.8% and 1.1% in the first quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively. In the first quarter of 2022 and 2021, the average yield on finance receivables was 17.6% in both years, while the average yield on contract receivables was 8.5% and 8.4%, respectively. Total loan originations of $245.6 million in the first quarter decreased $16.2 million or 6.2% from 2021 levels, reflecting a 5.1% decrease in origination to finance receivables and 11.5% decrease in originations of contract receivables. In the United States, finance receivable or extended credit originations were down low single digits. Moving to slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our US operation. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.6% for US extended credit remained the same as both the fourth quarter of 2021 and as in the first quarter of 2021. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $39.9 million represented 2.34% of outstandings at quarter end, down 21 basis points as compared to the same period last year. Now turning to slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $193.9 million in the quarter compared to $319.3 million last year. The decrease from the first quarter of 2021 primarily reflects a $106.7 million increase in working investment and higher payments for variable compensation, partially offset by increased net earnings. The change in working investment dollars is largely driven by greater demand, resulting in increased receivables and higher levels of inventory this year as compared to a reduction of inventory in 2021. In addition to demand-based requirements, the increase also reflects higher in-transit inventory amounts as well as incremental buffer stocks associated with the supply chain dynamics in the current macro environment. Inventory turns at the end of the first quarter of 2022 are unchanged sequentially. Net cash used by investing activities of $6.6 million included $20.2 million of capital expenditures and net collections of finance receivables of $10.1 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $106.3 million included cash dividends of $75.7 million and repurchase of 136,000 shares of common stock for $28.8 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of year-end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $442.2 million of common stock under existing authorizations. Turning to slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $49 million from 2021 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 61 days compared to 58 days at 2021 year-end. Inventories increased $60.3 million for 2021 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.8% were the same as year-end 2021 and compared to 2.6% at the end of the first quarter in 2021. Our quarter end cash position of $861.1 million compared to $270 million at year-end 2021. Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 7.4% compared to 9.1% at year-end 2021. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million under our credit facilities. As of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2022. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in a range of $90 million to $100 million. In addition, we currently anticipate, absent any changes to the US tax legislation, that our full year 2022 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?\nNick Pinchuk: Thanks, Aldo. Well, that's our first quarter. At some level, we could summarize the environment by these are interesting times and the hits they just keep on coming. But despite the challenges, the quarters are pretty much playing out as we said they would. The Snap-on team is prevailing against multiple axes of turbulence. Our markets are resilient, with their essential nature shining through, repair spending is up, tech numbers growing, wages rising, and the increasing complexity, electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids, improved internal combustion power plants and ADAS, it's all driving demand. And our continuing investments in product and brand and people, all through the pandemic is paying off. Our franchisees are selling more effectively and are prospering. And we've come out of this great withering stronger than when we entered. C&I, seeing the most turbulence, borne out of the multiple geographies, a range of industries and a wide product footprint, serious challenges, but still progressed, up 1.1% organically in the quarter. The Tools Group, prospering. Sales up 7.7% versus last year, rising 24.1% over 2019. OI margin, 22.7%, up 200 basis points from last year. RS&I, 13.3% growth, OI margin, 23%, down 40 basis points, but more than explained by acquisitions and business mix, the credit company, profits up, losses down, and it all came together for an overall organic growth of 8%. And opco OI margins of 20.3%, up 70 basis points year-over-year and rising 120 basis points compared with before the \u2013 before the pandemic as adjusted and an EPS of $4, up versus every comparison. It was an encouraging quarter. We have momentum. And looking forward, we are optimistic and confident. Confident in the special resilience and potential of our markets, confident in the power of our strategic and tactical advantages, and confident in the capability of our people and experienced team that sees progress against turbulence as fundamental to their expectations. And we believe that unique combination \u2013 that unique combination, turbulence tested, will propel us to -- to a consistent and ongoing positive trend throughout 2022, and well beyond that. Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates, many of you I know are listening. When we say we are encouraged, optimistic and confident, it's deeply rooted in your extraordinary capability and energy. For the part you've played in our success, you have my congratulations. For the skills you bring to our enterprise, you have my admiration. And for the commitment you unfailingly display to our team, you have my thanks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We'll move to our first question comes from Gary Prestopino of Barrington Research. Gary, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nGary Prestopino: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nNick Pinchuk: Good morning, Gary.\nGary Prestopino: Nick, could I just get \u2013 or from Aldo, a couple of \u2013 I couldn\u2019t write down fast enough on both the C&I and the RS&I business, what was the growth in organic sales versus Q1 2019 pre-pandemic levels?\nNick Pinchuk: For C&I, it was 3.6% and I think in RS& I, I believe, 17.4%.\nAldo Pagliari: Yeah. 17.4%, absolutely right.\nNick Pinchuk: Thank you.\nGary Prestopino: Okay. Okay. Thank you. Could you maybe just talk about how the cadence of your business trended in \u2013 on Continental Europe and the UK throughout the quarter? Did it start off strong and start to wane, because of the impacts of what was going on in Ukraine and the Russia sanctions?\nNick Pinchuk: No. Look, I don't think the Ukraine reached that far for us. We didn't see the conflict in Eastern Europe reaching that far. UK was soft in this quarter, pretty much a lot of different places. And what we see happening, I think, is our opinion is, the problems or the turbulence associated with the Brexit problems weren't solved during the pandemic, and they're starting to emerge a little bit more in that place. So I don't know. We don't really see that. It was pretty much off throughout the quarter. And it was down. I think it was kind of weaker last quarter too. I think the international business had some issues last quarter, particularly in the Tools Group. So that \u2013 we really didn't see any, I would say, landscaping by calendarization in this quarter.\nGary Prestopino: Okay. And then a couple of more questions here. On \u2013 in the Tools Group itself or really across all of your automotive-related segments, what kind of demand are you seeing for specialized tools? And if you could cite some things that deal with EVs, plug-in EVs, hybrids, things like that. I think they were about -- made up about 9% of all new car sales last year. So, they're starting to get to a bigger percentage of what's at least being produced.\nNick Pinchuk: They are. Those are new car sales, but they are relatively micro percentage of the car park itself. So, we -- our world reacts in it. They are -- new car sales, if you remember, are like what I think there were 14 and change last year, 15 and change this year, and 9% of that, but that's versus $283 million of total vehicle park. But where we see them is -- where we see the most, Gary, is and we're getting a lot of business in what I would call the early warning where the OEMs are seeing the idiosyncrasies associated with the electric vehicles, asking us to provide different kinds of tools for dealerships that aren't normally there to accommodate them as they come in, when they come in. And so that's what I mentioned in RS&I, that business actually was up strong -- that particular business, the project business was off strong double-digits in the quarter. And it led the way for ours. One of the things that drove it. And a big -- a portion of that was electric vehicles, like I said, we have things. Some people will ask us to do the hand tools and particular types of products to deal with the battery and other things that tend to be, as I said, specifically to electric vehicles and the OEMs figure that they wouldn't be available in the dealership. So, they have ask us to tie the dealership in those ways.\nGary Prestopino: Is there anything on the diagnostics side that you're seeing? There's a demand or need for that you supply to that segment of the market?\nNick Pinchuk: The diagnostic systems, although -- the category electric vehicles rolls right in that naturally. There isn't anything particularly about electric vehicles that are different for our diagnostic systems, except for the data you load on the diagnostics. And so those things are happening for us. But the same kind of bodies and so on will work, the same kind of approach in terms of diagnostics is just you have to expand that what do we have, like 2.5 billion repair records and 240 billion or 250 billion data points, and that just keeps growing to include electric vehicles, including plug-in hybrids. If you look at the plug-in hybrid volume and the hybrid volume, they exploded last year too in Europe.\nGary Prestopino: Okay. And then I'm sorry, Nick, I didn't mean to interrupt you. Just last question. Okay. Last question, I'll jump off. In terms of tool storage, years ago when tool store, which was really driving the boat in the tools segment. Has that come down as a percentage of sales overall and it's become a little bit more diversified on the growth side?\nNick Pinchuk: Actually, well, every quarter is a new story and you can't get excited about any quarter. But I would say the word to describe tool storage sales for us in this quarter is Boom Shaka Laka. The thing is it was up strong. It was one of our stronger categories. So, big ticket was up. The thing is you might ask why weren't originations up. And part of the reason is that when I was talking about tool carts are lower in terms of their per unit sales price. That's why they sweep in all these new technicians. So, via the carts we're getting new customers as well as selling some and raising our sales to old customers, because they're veterans and they want more mobility. But the new guys couldn't afford it, maybe I can't afford a Snap-On box for them. We're going to get a Snap-On quality professional cart that passes for a Snap-On box. That's partially why our tool storage went great in the quarter.\nGary Prestopino: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. \nChristopher Glynn: Yes. Thanks, good morning. So on SOT and this kind of growth that's been enabled here, seeing some of the administrative processes and driving front-end production and ease for the franchisees is part of the story. Curious your response to that and if there's any specific color and sense of headroom on that curve?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, the franchisees are telling me demand is off the charts. They're telling me they want more. I was just on a van down in Arkansas. And this guy tells me, he says, at the SFC, I ordered 45 full-size boxes, 45 boxes and you already see order at the SFC and they get delivered over the fall. He is out of them, and he wants more, because the guys are asking them. So, I'm telling you, I think this is why we try to emphasize this people are driving after the pandemic. And the new technology is driving demand, focusing on driving a need for people, who can handle the complexity, focusing on the importance of technicians and their wallets are burgeoning with higher wages and more work and they\u2019re looking for more of the stuff.  So our task is to be able to get our franchisees to deal with the higher sales, to be more efficient. And it seems like that's working. And to crank up the capacity to match that situation. That's what we're doing. And of course, you have to have new products. One of the great advantage that's why I talked about the carts, because we had that old segment that we were getting to, but we wanted to get to more in the carts hit them right in the bull's eye. And so that worked pretty well for us.  So those are the kinds of things that are happening there. I think we could have -- I think look, the Tools Group is leaving pre-pandemic levels behind. If you think about their numbers look, I think they are -- if you think about the last five quarters, they were 10, 15, 20, 21 and 24 versus pre-pandemic levels. They're just expanding and expanding their lead.  The second derivative is growing in the Tools Group. So \u2013 and that's driven by this resilient markets and our ability \u2013 our new ability to expand the franchisees' capabilities and our new products. We're running to try to keep up. \nChristopher Glynn: Great. Thank you for that color. And just a couple on price and the 8% organic any sense of what the mix split of volume and price was there? And...\nNick Pinchuk: Go ahead.\nChristopher Glynn: Yes. Okay. So yes, just any comment there. And also, curious if you're seeing any pockets within that where you're seeing area is elastic to price this area looks completely inelastic, will price more. So...\nNick Pinchuk: We don't see that at all. Snap-On sets the price. One of the things is we control the customer interface. So fundamentally, we're the price leader. And so, we can do that. I mean you have to keep -- there is a point of irritation, I suppose, but we're not seeing that in this situation. But the thing about it, Chris is we have three mechanisms for pricing and they aren't also straightforward to the customer or even easy to measure.  First, we do have list price increases, which we do, do. Then we have the idea, we roll out new products like these new products associated with new carts and newly enhanced carts. Well, I assure you in an inflationary time, we get our value for those new carts. And so that tends to give us nice margin. And then there's the idea of every week on a van, there are a couple of promotions, and those promotions can be rich or lean. Now the problem is the list price, there can be variations in discounts off the list price that happen. There can be take up on promotions that are high or low, depending on the individual promotion. And there can be variations around the margins and what do you call it, whether you say that price comes out of the fact that I've got the new power tool -- power bank option on a tool storage or just because I've pushed up the pricing, it's hard to measure those things. But what I will offer is whatever happens, we like it, because the margins in the Tools Group were 22.7%, all time high.\nChristopher Glynn: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll move next to David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nDavid MacGregor: Yes, good morning everyone. Nice quarter, Nick.\nNick Pinchuk: Hi there.\nDavid MacGregor: Yeah, nice quarter, remarkable given the 25% year ago growth and then the systems outage during the quarter. How much of this growth was due to the timing of shipments? I mean, responding to the previous question, you were talking about your guy down in Arkansas waiting for his boxes. I mean, how much of the growth was due to the timing of shipments that were delayed from 4Q when you reported US\u2026\nNick Pinchuk: No. Actually, you could ask that question in the same way. I mean the point is that I would say our calendarization of shipments were because of the interruption were pushed a little bit deeper into the quarter. So we might -- you might have argued we could have shipped more if we didn't have -- I think the way the interruption occurred, we kept -- pretty much kept selling in prior ways, but I would call nonstandard work in the terms of kaizen, and it could cause a little inefficiency. And our factories kept rolling pretty much, but the shipping was a little bit up and down in this period. So there was a little bit of back-end loading in this. So it didn't come out of the fourth quarter. It wasn't an overrun from the fourth quarter and diminishing if anything, things are getting higher. I think probably if you ask the franchisees. The franchisees, I talk to were all screaming, telling me, can you give me more. Do you have any influence in the factories, Nick Pinchuk? And so those kinds of things are those questions. Yeah, Aldo says, no. But that's really -- I don't think there's anything -- I don't think there's any story there actually, in that situation.\nDavid MacGregor: Nick, how much were off the truck sales up?\nNick Pinchuk: Off the truck sales were up not as high as our own sales. They go up and down in situations. But a lot of that -- some of that has to do with the calendarization of the deliveries that came off over there. But inventories are -- I think inventories are on a nice level. The inventory turnovers are up nicely from pre-pandemic levels. So we feel pretty good about that situation. You could argue whether we want large inventories on a truck or not. I'm more for a large inventory guy, and it's a little bit lower than I'd like it to be. But still, I think sales off the truck, we're moving along, not as high as the Tools Group though, in this quarter. But if you look back every year, it always evens out. Every quarter, there's some little story around it, but it always generally evens out. We wouldn't let it get out of whack.\nDavid MacGregor: Okay. And can you just talk about the systems outage during the quarter and the impact that might have had and other growth or profitability? And did that out to result in maybe a little bit of push forward into 2Q?\nNick Pinchuk: David, I don't know. You get one of these things, and it's like red alert. I remember, I stayed up all night on this situation, watching the effect, and we were -- credit to our team. They were really professional. We were back up able to do stuff right away. Now in a non-standard way, but part of it is it didn't really interrupt us very much. The big interruption, I think, was the calendarization of the shipping. And I would say, well, non-standard work is less efficient. That's why we call it standard work in terms of continuous improvement. So it's inefficient, but you still accomplish your goal. We said the number one priority was to deliver to our customers, and we generally did. Maybe we could have done a little more, I don't know. But the point is -- so I don't think -- if you step back and look at the numbers, you say, well, it doesn't look like, I can see a lot of effect there. But I assure you, there's extra cost in those numbers associated with this. I don't know if we've dimensioned it all, because it's hard to capture it all. When franchisees have to be serviced by the field, because their approach is non-standard, they're still servicing, they're still selling, but it's non-standard. Then what's that cost? It's hard to capture it. But we don't really spin our wheel thinking about that, because 20.7% OI margin.\nDavid MacGregor: Great. And just on those costs. I mean, your operating expenses and tools of 22.8%, you're down 240 basis points, which is pretty remarkable. But despite the systems outage and all the incremental costs you just referenced, you're saying, it would have actually been better?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, yes, I think there might have been some of that. I don't know. I don't want to comment on that. We're not giving guidance on what the OE margins will be. I may decide to spend -- we may decide to have a big party or something at some point. I don\u2019t know, but for the franchise, but look, I think we certainly, in the quarter, we don't manage -- David, we don't manage the gross margin or the OE -- OI -- OE. We manage the OI. That's how we measure it, because when you're in inflationary times, the price goes up, there's no real -- usually, when you have commodity price goes up, there's no real cost increase in your support. On top of that, we have -- we have, as you said, the interruption which would have cost us something. So there's a complex cocktail there. So we look at, boy, and our divisions look at, give me OE, give me OI.\nDavid MacGregor: Okay. Good. That's all I\u2019ve got. Thanks very much for taking my question.\nNick Pinchuk: Okay. Thanks David.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Luke Junk of Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nLuke Junk: Nick, Aldo, good morning.\nNick Pinchuk: Luke, good morning.\nLuke Junk: I wanted to start this morning with the market turbulence you're going through right now. And what I'm wondering is, to what extent does the fact that inflation is obviously very highly visible right now help you to manage through the current environment? And specifically, are there ways that you changed your approach to price cost in an environment where inflation is as top of mind as it is right now for franchisees and your customers?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, it makes it a lot easier. We've always said, for a dog's age, that we can price for visible inflation. So it helps. If everybody is getting up and looking at the paper or watching TV or looking at their iPhone and getting hearing, hey, the costs are going through the roof inflation going wow. So people tend to be more receptive to those kinds of things, and they tend to realize that that's a bargain even at a higher price. So we do that. The other thing is, as I said, this in our first rodeo. And one of the things I learned back in the Carter era, which I hate to say that even than I was senting during that period, they -- it's about urgency. It's about riding to the sound of guns. And we get right on. When we see costs going up, we're out there working on it right away, either's a continuous improvement, either redesigning. For example, we've done a lot of effort redesigning our products around chips that are available. It's not even the cost. Steel is starting to peak a little bit. But you can't get stuff, so you're out buying it on a stock market. So it's not the base cost of things, but its how you have to buy it. We tend to make sure we can deliver. So we buy on the stock market. So, for example, I just reviewed a bunch of new air conditioning units where we redesigned them all and redesigned particularly three -- or three or four, all the electronics inside to get chips that we could use. We're doing the same kind of thing in diagnostics and in our undercar equipment. So those are the kinds of things you got to do, but you got to do it with alacrity.\nLuke Junk: Okay. Thanks, Nick. Maybe a related question for Aldo. I'm wondering, if we look at outside of the Tools Group, to what extent does your ability to manage price costs differ by segment? If I look at some of the key considerations in C&I and RS&I relative to the dynamics in the Tools Group, are there any key differences that we should be thinking through either tactically or structurally?\nAldo Pagliari: Well, yes. I'd say, broadly speaking, Luke, is that RS&I and C&I, when they do have to entertain pricing actions, there is a lag basis. And the reason for that is, unless you're going to invoke force majeure, which you don't want to, if you don't have to. Sometimes you have one-year contracts in place with certain key customers, national accounts or certain large industrial customers. Oftentimes, we have distribution relationships, who have a requirement of a 60, 90-day advance notice. So you have to be more measured and because they don't use as exclusively the Snap-on brand. The Snap-on brand is a very powerful brand, which the Tools Group does enjoy. You make the case at C&I and RS&I a little bit more mortal when they walk around the immortality of the Tools Group. They have to be cognizant of what's happening in and around them, because they don't operate in a vacuum. There's some big competitors in and around them. So they can not make pricing decisions in a vacuum so to speak. As Nick mentioned earlier, you can argue Snap-on and the Tools Group is the price leader and it sets the umbrella for others. In the case of C&I and RS&I, I think they have to be cognizant that they're a major player and they are an influencer, but they do not walk alone.\nLuke Junk: Yes. Really appreciate that. All those super helpful color. Last question, I just want to ask something a little bigger picture. Nick, you had mentioned last quarter that you were taking a more refined approach to data mining as an area as it is right now. And just wondering if there's any color you can share there on specific areas where you see the opportunity to be, I guess, I'd call it smarter in the tools business or alternatively, any areas where you're already seeing traction ultimately? Just trying to get a feel of where you're leaning in with this initiative. Thanks.\nNick Pinchuk: Well, the whole purpose of that is to try to model the individual customer -- by individual to try to call in the air strikes of the selling approach for the van driver, so that his selling will be more efficient, and therefore, he can call and spend more times with tougher customers, reach more customers, and that is the principal focus of that. That's what I can share with you. And we're making progress in that regard, but I don't really have any palpable things to report. We've been a little busy this quarter. So -- but still, we're working on that, but I don't have anything to lay out, just about the principal focus. And we're kind of optimistic that it will work, because if anybody's got a database about people, about technicians. If anybody knows technicians, it's Snap-on.\nLuke Junk: Looking good. Well, interesting stuff. We will stay tuned. Thanks for that Nick.\nNick Pinchuk: Okay. Sure.\nOperator: We'll go next to Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nBret Jordan: Hey, good morning, guys.\nNick Pinchuk: Hi, Bret.\nBret Jordan: One more question, I guess, on pricing, trying to sort of distill it down some. Obviously, lots of labor and materials and supply chain expenses. And I get your point about sort of mix can change or you throw in a free \u2013 extra charger to enhance the value proposition. But, is there any sort of base way to look at like a like-for-like screw driver versus a screwdriver in the prior year period on price? I just sort of try to get a feeling for what that contribution was to organic.\nNick Pinchuk: And we've thought about that. I don't think I can help you. It's just too complex. I mean we raised, we raised the list price. But even the list price raise doesn't necessarily make it through. It tends to move it up in varying places depending on the product line. So it's hard to measure really. And the point about the individual promotions, they just vary all over the place. We simply manage on a macro basis, because when you got when you got trucks that have 4,000 SKUs on the truck and have a catalog of 40,000 SKUs, it's kind of a fool's errand to try to figure all this out, try to get macro out of the individual. We simply try to measure how we're doing and try to see what worked before and try to make sure that we get pricing along all those quarters, list, promotions and new products. And believe that it's going to get us in the right situation. And generally, so far, it has. Our own sales if you look at the sales for Snap-on in terms of growth \u2013 it was \u2013 I think our five quarters were 9%, 10%, 11%, 13% and now 16.9% above pre-pandemic levels. So somehow it's expanding growth. And not all of that is pricing because you can see the margins go up right in tune with it.\nBret Jordan: Okay. And then one big picture question. I guess, as you talk about the increasing vehicle complexity and sort of the shortage of technicians and the aging demographic. Are you seeing any sort of change in total shop rooftops? And are big groups getting bigger as they've got access to the diagnostics and the technology, or is it pretty even?\nNick Pinchuk: I would have said that maybe before the pandemic, but I'm not seeing it now so much. I don't know. But you might say, I do think \u2013 I will say to you, I think service doesn't scale so easily. It has \u2013 that's been a problem in many industries. So I'm not so sure. Collision scales because it's almost like manufacturing in a lot of ways. But the service is a little tougher to scale, I think. So I don't know how much of that we'll see unless you see like a specialized group. Now maybe we will, and we have those as our customers, too. We do see multiple shops, but they don't seem to be very, let's say, nationwide or anything like that. Sometimes, we're seeing some opportunities call, localized multi-location situations. Mitchell One has made a meal out of that with their ProDemand, and those things have worked there. But in terms of the franchisees, I don't think they report that so much.\nBret Jordan: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our final question from Sarah Park with Bank of America. Sarah, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nSarah Park: Hi. This is Sarah Park on for Liz Suzuki. I think you had mentioned this a little bit earlier, but I was just been wondering if you could speak to any kind of like material disruption in March from the security breach and network shutdown, if you have any more color on that? That would be helpful.\nNick Pinchuk: Well. No. Actually, I don't think \u2013 there were what I would call non-standard ways of operating and serving our customers for a matter of days, not weeks. And as I said before, it principally set back the shipping processes, whereby, the calendarization of the quarter shipments tended to coagulate around at the rear end. But generally, we did not -- we didn't have any -- we didn't really have real disruption and there's been a lot of speculation, but we were hacked, a ransomware company. We didn't pay ransom. We didn't have to pay a ransom in this situation. And so we felt we got out of this and managed it pretty well. So that's really the story there, inefficiencies more than disruption and recalendarization.\nSarah Park: Thank you.\nOperator: With no other questions holding, I will now turn the conference back to Ms. Verbsky for any additional or closing comments.\nSara Verbsky: Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect.",

            "name": "Nick Pinchuk",
            "content": "Thanks Sara. Good morning everybody. As usual, I'll start the call by covering the highlights of our first quarter and along the way, I'll give you my perspective on our results, they are encouraging. In our market, so looking positive and our progress, we believe we're stronger than ever. We'll also speak about what it all means. We believe it means that we're positioned for more, much more. Then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. These are interesting times, filled with multiple axes of turbulence, but this isn't our first rodeo. We know it's always something. And it's our job to confront and to overcome with the resilience of our markets, the strength of our strategic and tactical advantages and the insight and energy of our consistent and capable team, and we've done just that. Here are the numbers that support that view. Our reported sales in the quarter of $1.0978 billion were up 7.1%, including $8.5 million in acquisition-related activity of $15.7 million of unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales growth was 8% with gains in every group. And compared to the pre-pandemic levels in 2019, our clear upward drive shines right through versus 2019 sales in this past quarter rose 19.1% as reported and 16.9% organically. In fact, it's our seventh straight quarter being above the pre-virus levels. We believe we're continuing an ongoing trend of accelerating expansion, momentum, increasing higher and higher, demonstrating that we're only getting stronger every day. And contributions from our Snap-on Value Creation processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, all combined to drive that progress, and progress there was. Opco operating income of $223.1 million increased $22.2 million from last year. The operating margin, it was 20.3%, up 70 basis points from last year and 120 basis points from 2019, as adjusted for the favorable legal settlement in that period. For financial services, operating income of $70.4 million increased 7.8% and credit losses were down, continuing the positive trends, despite the lingering effects of the pandemic. And that result combined with opco for a consolidated operating margin of 24.8%, a 90 basis improvement from last year and 120 basis points from the as adjusted 2019 result. First quarter EPS, it was $4, up 14.3% from last year's $3.50 and 32.9% above the as-adjusted $3.01 recorded in 2019. To risk repeating myself, we believe Snap-on is stronger now than when we entered this great withering and our first quarter results are solid testimony. Now let's talk about our markets. Auto repair remains quite resilient. I think, we'd say, spending on vehicle maintenance and repair is up and technicians are earning more than ever. They've been working, performing essential tasks, making a nice living. They're undaunted by the turbulence and they are optimistic about the future of their profession, about the outlook of individual transportation, and about the greater need for their skills as the vehicle part changes with new technology and all of that has led to an expansion in the ranks with the automotive repair technician count moving upward at its highest point for, I think, at least three decades. And as shopowners and managers will tell you, there's a need for many more. Vehicle repair strong -- is a strong and resilient market. You can hear it in our franchisees voices. You could feel it in a technician's wallet, and you can see it written across our numbers. Also in an auto repair, spanning right next to the tax, there are shop owners and managers, where our Repair Systems & Information Group, RS&I applies its trade. Demand for new and used cars is high, despite the limited supply, despite the limited supply. Dealership repair, maintenance and warranty is rebounding, and dealers are starting to invest again. New vehicles are being released with a greater variety of drivetrains, with a greater variety of drivetrains than ever, from internal combustion engines, from internal combustion to hybrid to plug-in electric, to full electric, and the range of options is growing, more driver assist, more vehicle automation, increasing vehicle complexity. To tell you, it's all music to our ears. And we've been able to take advantage with our lineup of intelligent diagnostic products, by including the ZEUS, the TRITON and the APOLLO handheld units, with our celebrated Mitchell1 ProDemand repair information, our award-winning Tru-Point Advanced Driver Assist calibration system, and our 3D alignment systems like the new Hofmann Geoliner, all representing new technologies and big data deployed to make work easier right in the shop. Vehicle repair looks more promising than ever and Snap-on is poised to capitalize. Finally, let's talk about critical industries. With Snap-on rolls out of the garage, solving tests of consequence. This is where C&I operates, the most international of our operations. And these are the customers that continue to be impacted hardest by the lingering virus, but they removed -- they've been recovering. And in the quarter, our results showed that trend. Despite some significant headwinds like supply chain disruption, commodity cost increases, some challenged business sectors like the military and international \u2013 international aviation or aerospace, and troubled geographies, conflict impacted countries and those more prone to business interruptions as a means to control the virus. Well, C&I had it all.  Despite the variation, though, we did see growth, improvement in a number of geographies, Asia and Europe and in a range of sectors like general industry, education and natural resources. They all combined to author organic growth against the continuing turbulence. So overall, I'd describe our C&I markets as challenged, but improving.  And looking forward, we believe they represent clear opportunity. Viewing on the overall picture, we believe there's been substantial progress along our runways for growth, enhancing the van network, expanding with repair shop owners and managers, extending to critical industries and building in emerging markets, leveraging our broadening product lines, wielding our strong brand and deploying the increasing understanding of the work that is the hallmark of Snap-On people, even in the throes of the pandemic shock.  Two years ago, as we entered the virus, you all remember this, two years ago when we entered the virus, we recognized the resilience of our market and the strength of our model and projected a V-shaped recovery and that's how it played out. You can see it in the trends.  Now let's turn to the segments. In the C&I Group, first quarter sales were $340.1 million, down $5.6 million due to $9.2 million of unfavorable currency, and $3.6 million or 1.1% -- and a $3.6 million or 1.1% organic growth. As we said, across C&I, results were mixed. But the period did see gains in Asia with Japan, India, South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, rising. And Europe was also up, with Sweden, Belgium, Poland and France leading the way.  C&I's operating income was $45.7 million, down $5 million, reflecting $2.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency, with the organic volume gains more than offset by supply chain inefficiencies. Now when compared with the pre-pandemic levels of 2019, sales were up 5.5%, including a 3.6% organic gain and the OI margin of 13.4% was down 100 basis points, but against 150 basis points impact of acquisitions and unfavorable currency.  C&I has simply been more affected by the difficulties, macroeconomic challenges, geopolitical uncertainty, varying COVID conditions. It makes sense. But the operation is spread over more countries and more industries. It's challenging, but we are making some headway and we're enthusiastic about the possibilities going forward. As part of that view, we remain committed to extending in Critical Industries, and we'll keep strengthening our position to capture opportunities as they arise and enabling that attempt is our expanding line of innovative new products, designed to match the demands of the industries, industries that we serve and to make critical work easier.  One example is our family of microelectronic torque wrenches. And I've been talking about Snap-On electronic torque products for some time. But these smaller versions of our flagship offerings are gaining particular strength in the critical markets. Our latest, the connected Bluetooth model offers customers a solution when they need torque certification data in real time. The Snap-On Control Tech Micro Bluetooth wrench fills that requirement and combines it with the benefits of reduced size and lower weight, shorter than 12 inches and less than one pound, better accessibility and reduced operator fatigue, all while allowing users to interface with a Snap-on app or directly with customers with the customer's operating system. The ControlTech Micro Bluetooth offers a wide range of torque, five to 240 inch pounds, an all steel body construction, progressive LEDs for an enhanced user guidance and a 72-inch quarter-inch drive enabling efficient operation in tight areas, all with a plus or minus 2% accuracy. It's a package well-suited to critical sectors like aviation. And in the first quarter, our customers' orders confirmed that belief emphatically. Well, that's C&I. Hard one progress against the turbulence. Now on to the Tools Group. Sales of $512.1 million, up $33.8 million, including $3 million of unfavorable currency, and $36.8 million or 7.7% organic gain, double digit growth in the U.S. being partially offset by challenges in the international operations. The operating margin was 22.7%, up 200 basis points from last year's historically high level -- high 20.7%. And compared with the pre-virus levels, sales grew 24.8%, and this year's 22.7% operating margin was up 630 basis points compared with 2019. The Tools Group is -- the Tools Group is responding to the challenges of the day, taking advantage of increasing vehicle complexity, increasing its product advantage, fortifying its brands, and further enabling its franchisees and the results show it. I keep saying that, but that's what's written across our performance this quarter. We do believe our runway for coherent growth, enhancing the franchise network, represents a resilient and expanding opportunity. And we're realizing some of that potential across the van channel. The evidence is unmistakable in our franchisee metrics. Again, this quarter, they remain clearly favorable. And based on those measurements, we believe the franchisees have never been stronger, and they say so themselves emphatically, pumped in time for more that's what they are. And in our direct interactions at events like the past January's kickoff, back again this year in person. It was a great affair, well-attended, strong orders, visible commitment to our brand. Our franchisees, entrepreneurs and professionals all are enabled by their increased selling capabilities, broadly and deeply confident in their prospects, in the company's prospects and eager to reach higher. That's an important factor. And there's a number of reasons for that optimism, but a big one is rooted in Snap-on value creation, customer connection and innovation, authoring new products, clearly making work easier, born out of observing changing work in shops on an everyday basis, just like the franchisees. And that's the reason our tool storage sales were up nicely in the quarter, driven in part by our -- they were driven in part by our exciting new line of mobile carts. Over the last several years, we've been enhancing our carts. One example is our KRSC range of mobile storage solutions, the only professional grade carts in the market, they're built in our Iowa plant. I just saw them running down, I was just there seeing those units roll down the line. The KRSC are designed for maximum strength and durability. They're constructed with a heavy gauge steel, to form a one piece, fully welded body with reinforced corners, and that's a significant and unique benefit in the mobile storage arena. These 30 parts make it easy to move even the heaviest tools from bay-to-bay. They come in an attractive range of colors and trims, just like they are full-sized Big Brother boxes. And they're offered in either a sliding split top, providing usable work surface, while allowing substantial access to the top drawer or a single piece flip flop, allowing quicker and broader access to the most frequently used tools. Our new cart also has -- also features full wide drawers for maximum flexibility and offer power options for charging cordless tools. The KRSC -- the KRSC, you can to say it in these three words, durability, versatility, and functionality. They're great for meeting -- they're great for newer mechanics, as an affordable way to own some serious Snap-on tool storage. And at the same time, they're attractive for veterans. They're attractive for veterans, giving them the opportunity to improve productivity by expanding their mobility around the shop. This quarter, as repair work and tech wages are on the rise, we received record orders, proving that when innovation meets a resilient market, demand follows. We said that vehicle repair was growing was growing, and it is. Complexity would accelerate the market upward and it has. And we're working hard to position our franchisees to take advantage. And you can see it in the Tools Group results, seven straight above pre-pandemic gangbuster's quarters. Now, let's speak of RS&I. First quarter sales rose 50.6% or -- $50.6 million or 14.6% with gains across the board. Organic growth was 13.3%, driven by undercar equipment and OEM dealership activity, delivering double-digit expansion. And by the diagnostics and information products, the independent shops advancing low single-digits. Compared with 2019 sales -- compared with 2019, sales grew $70.3 million, 21.4%, including 56.9% -- including $56.9 million or 17.4% organic gain, $15.2 million from acquisitions and $1.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency. Operating earnings of 91.6% increased $10.2 million from 2021 and the OI margin was 23%, down 40 basis points, but primarily due to acquisitions and the rise of lower-margin undercar equipment. We clearly see the potential of our runways for growth in the RS&I Group, expanding Snap-on's presence in the garage, which coherent acquisitions and a growing line of powerful products. The organic growth in the quarter was broad-based, but once again, undercar equipment expanded at double-digits and progress in one of our newest product groups, collision repair helped author that positive. And we're doubling down on the potential in that arena by utilizing the same broad database with deep content as used in our ProDemand vehicle repair solutions. Big data aimed specifically at the body shop, vehicle measurements to guide body work, repair information to aid in standard shop work, and calibrations to restore the sensor networks that support ADAS or advanced driver assistance systems. It's a combination that's increasingly essential for every collision shop. And we believe it is going to be a big seller. RS&I also got a nice boost from winning a number of significant essential tools and equipment programs for OEM dealerships. As we expected, we started to see new launches for both electric power and for internal combustion vehicles, and RS&I is right at the front. So we're quite positive about RS&I's expanding position with vehicle repair shop owners and managers and are very confident in the opportunities as the vehicle industry evolves. So that's the highlights of our quarter. Progress in the turbulence. C&I, growing despite the headwinds. The Tools Group, strong and confident. RS&I solid. Overall organic sales rising 8%. Opco operating margin, 20.3% and EPS $4, up significantly. And most importantly, more testimony that Snap-on has emerged from the turbulence much stronger than when it entered. It was an encouraging quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Thanks, Aldo. Well, that's our first quarter. At some level, we could summarize the environment by these are interesting times and the hits they just keep on coming. But despite the challenges, the quarters are pretty much playing out as we said they would. The Snap-on team is prevailing against multiple axes of turbulence. Our markets are resilient, with their essential nature shining through, repair spending is up, tech numbers growing, wages rising, and the increasing complexity, electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids, improved internal combustion power plants and ADAS, it's all driving demand. And our continuing investments in product and brand and people, all through the pandemic is paying off. Our franchisees are selling more effectively and are prospering. And we've come out of this great withering stronger than when we entered. C&I, seeing the most turbulence, borne out of the multiple geographies, a range of industries and a wide product footprint, serious challenges, but still progressed, up 1.1% organically in the quarter. The Tools Group, prospering. Sales up 7.7% versus last year, rising 24.1% over 2019. OI margin, 22.7%, up 200 basis points from last year. RS&I, 13.3% growth, OI margin, 23%, down 40 basis points, but more than explained by acquisitions and business mix, the credit company, profits up, losses down, and it all came together for an overall organic growth of 8%. And opco OI margins of 20.3%, up 70 basis points year-over-year and rising 120 basis points compared with before the \u2013 before the pandemic as adjusted and an EPS of $4, up versus every comparison. It was an encouraging quarter. We have momentum. And looking forward, we are optimistic and confident. Confident in the special resilience and potential of our markets, confident in the power of our strategic and tactical advantages, and confident in the capability of our people and experienced team that sees progress against turbulence as fundamental to their expectations. And we believe that unique combination \u2013 that unique combination, turbulence tested, will propel us to -- to a consistent and ongoing positive trend throughout 2022, and well beyond that. Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates, many of you I know are listening. When we say we are encouraged, optimistic and confident, it's deeply rooted in your extraordinary capability and energy. For the part you've played in our success, you have my congratulations. For the skills you bring to our enterprise, you have my admiration. And for the commitment you unfailingly display to our team, you have my thanks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Good morning, Gary. For C&I, it was 3.6% and I think in RS& I, I believe, 17.4%. Thank you. No. Look, I don't think the Ukraine reached that far for us. We didn't see the conflict in Eastern Europe reaching that far. UK was soft in this quarter, pretty much a lot of different places. And what we see happening, I think, is our opinion is, the problems or the turbulence associated with the Brexit problems weren't solved during the pandemic, and they're starting to emerge a little bit more in that place. So I don't know. We don't really see that. It was pretty much off throughout the quarter. And it was down. I think it was kind of weaker last quarter too. I think the international business had some issues last quarter, particularly in the Tools Group. So that \u2013 we really didn't see any, I would say, landscaping by calendarization in this quarter. They are. Those are new car sales, but they are relatively micro percentage of the car park itself. So, we -- our world reacts in it. They are -- new car sales, if you remember, are like what I think there were 14 and change last year, 15 and change this year, and 9% of that, but that's versus $283 million of total vehicle park. But where we see them is -- where we see the most, Gary, is and we're getting a lot of business in what I would call the early warning where the OEMs are seeing the idiosyncrasies associated with the electric vehicles, asking us to provide different kinds of tools for dealerships that aren't normally there to accommodate them as they come in, when they come in. And so that's what I mentioned in RS&I, that business actually was up strong -- that particular business, the project business was off strong double-digits in the quarter. And it led the way for ours. One of the things that drove it. And a big -- a portion of that was electric vehicles, like I said, we have things. Some people will ask us to do the hand tools and particular types of products to deal with the battery and other things that tend to be, as I said, specifically to electric vehicles and the OEMs figure that they wouldn't be available in the dealership. So, they have ask us to tie the dealership in those ways. The diagnostic systems, although -- the category electric vehicles rolls right in that naturally. There isn't anything particularly about electric vehicles that are different for our diagnostic systems, except for the data you load on the diagnostics. And so those things are happening for us. But the same kind of bodies and so on will work, the same kind of approach in terms of diagnostics is just you have to expand that what do we have, like 2.5 billion repair records and 240 billion or 250 billion data points, and that just keeps growing to include electric vehicles, including plug-in hybrids. If you look at the plug-in hybrid volume and the hybrid volume, they exploded last year too in Europe. Actually, well, every quarter is a new story and you can't get excited about any quarter. But I would say the word to describe tool storage sales for us in this quarter is Boom Shaka Laka. The thing is it was up strong. It was one of our stronger categories. So, big ticket was up. The thing is you might ask why weren't originations up. And part of the reason is that when I was talking about tool carts are lower in terms of their per unit sales price. That's why they sweep in all these new technicians. So, via the carts we're getting new customers as well as selling some and raising our sales to old customers, because they're veterans and they want more mobility. But the new guys couldn't afford it, maybe I can't afford a Snap-On box for them. We're going to get a Snap-On quality professional cart that passes for a Snap-On box. That's partially why our tool storage went great in the quarter. Well, the franchisees are telling me demand is off the charts. They're telling me they want more. I was just on a van down in Arkansas. And this guy tells me, he says, at the SFC, I ordered 45 full-size boxes, 45 boxes and you already see order at the SFC and they get delivered over the fall. He is out of them, and he wants more, because the guys are asking them. So, I'm telling you, I think this is why we try to emphasize this people are driving after the pandemic. And the new technology is driving demand, focusing on driving a need for people, who can handle the complexity, focusing on the importance of technicians and their wallets are burgeoning with higher wages and more work and they're looking for more of the stuff.  So our task is to be able to get our franchisees to deal with the higher sales, to be more efficient. And it seems like that's working. And to crank up the capacity to match that situation. That's what we're doing. And of course, you have to have new products. One of the great advantage that's why I talked about the carts, because we had that old segment that we were getting to, but we wanted to get to more in the carts hit them right in the bull's eye. And so that worked pretty well for us.  So those are the kinds of things that are happening there. I think we could have -- I think look, the Tools Group is leaving pre-pandemic levels behind. If you think about their numbers look, I think they are -- if you think about the last five quarters, they were 10, 15, 20, 21 and 24 versus pre-pandemic levels. They're just expanding and expanding their lead.  The second derivative is growing in the Tools Group. So \u2013 and that's driven by this resilient markets and our ability \u2013 our new ability to expand the franchisees' capabilities and our new products. We're running to try to keep up. Go ahead. We don't see that at all. Snap-On sets the price. One of the things is we control the customer interface. So fundamentally, we're the price leader. And so, we can do that. I mean you have to keep -- there is a point of irritation, I suppose, but we're not seeing that in this situation. But the thing about it, Chris is we have three mechanisms for pricing and they aren't also straightforward to the customer or even easy to measure.  First, we do have list price increases, which we do, do. Then we have the idea, we roll out new products like these new products associated with new carts and newly enhanced carts. Well, I assure you in an inflationary time, we get our value for those new carts. And so that tends to give us nice margin. And then there's the idea of every week on a van, there are a couple of promotions, and those promotions can be rich or lean. Now the problem is the list price, there can be variations in discounts off the list price that happen. There can be take up on promotions that are high or low, depending on the individual promotion. And there can be variations around the margins and what do you call it, whether you say that price comes out of the fact that I've got the new power tool -- power bank option on a tool storage or just because I've pushed up the pricing, it's hard to measure those things. But what I will offer is whatever happens, we like it, because the margins in the Tools Group were 22.7%, all time high. Hi there. No. Actually, you could ask that question in the same way. I mean the point is that I would say our calendarization of shipments were because of the interruption were pushed a little bit deeper into the quarter. So we might -- you might have argued we could have shipped more if we didn't have -- I think the way the interruption occurred, we kept -- pretty much kept selling in prior ways, but I would call nonstandard work in the terms of kaizen, and it could cause a little inefficiency. And our factories kept rolling pretty much, but the shipping was a little bit up and down in this period. So there was a little bit of back-end loading in this. So it didn't come out of the fourth quarter. It wasn't an overrun from the fourth quarter and diminishing if anything, things are getting higher. I think probably if you ask the franchisees. The franchisees, I talk to were all screaming, telling me, can you give me more. Do you have any influence in the factories, Nick Pinchuk? And so those kinds of things are those questions. Yeah, Aldo says, no. But that's really -- I don't think there's anything -- I don't think there's any story there actually, in that situation. Off the truck sales were up not as high as our own sales. They go up and down in situations. But a lot of that -- some of that has to do with the calendarization of the deliveries that came off over there. But inventories are -- I think inventories are on a nice level. The inventory turnovers are up nicely from pre-pandemic levels. So we feel pretty good about that situation. You could argue whether we want large inventories on a truck or not. I'm more for a large inventory guy, and it's a little bit lower than I'd like it to be. But still, I think sales off the truck, we're moving along, not as high as the Tools Group though, in this quarter. But if you look back every year, it always evens out. Every quarter, there's some little story around it, but it always generally evens out. We wouldn't let it get out of whack. David, I don't know. You get one of these things, and it's like red alert. I remember, I stayed up all night on this situation, watching the effect, and we were -- credit to our team. They were really professional. We were back up able to do stuff right away. Now in a non-standard way, but part of it is it didn't really interrupt us very much. The big interruption, I think, was the calendarization of the shipping. And I would say, well, non-standard work is less efficient. That's why we call it standard work in terms of continuous improvement. So it's inefficient, but you still accomplish your goal. We said the number one priority was to deliver to our customers, and we generally did. Maybe we could have done a little more, I don't know. But the point is -- so I don't think -- if you step back and look at the numbers, you say, well, it doesn't look like, I can see a lot of effect there. But I assure you, there's extra cost in those numbers associated with this. I don't know if we've dimensioned it all, because it's hard to capture it all. When franchisees have to be serviced by the field, because their approach is non-standard, they're still servicing, they're still selling, but it's non-standard. Then what's that cost? It's hard to capture it. But we don't really spin our wheel thinking about that, because 20.7% OI margin. Well, yes, I think there might have been some of that. I don't know. I don't want to comment on that. We're not giving guidance on what the OE margins will be. I may decide to spend -- we may decide to have a big party or something at some point. I don't know, but for the franchise, but look, I think we certainly, in the quarter, we don't manage -- David, we don't manage the gross margin or the OE -- OI -- OE. We manage the OI. That's how we measure it, because when you're in inflationary times, the price goes up, there's no real -- usually, when you have commodity price goes up, there's no real cost increase in your support. On top of that, we have -- we have, as you said, the interruption which would have cost us something. So there's a complex cocktail there. So we look at, boy, and our divisions look at, give me OE, give me OI. Okay. Thanks David. Luke, good morning. Well, it makes it a lot easier. We've always said, for a dog's age, that we can price for visible inflation. So it helps. If everybody is getting up and looking at the paper or watching TV or looking at their iPhone and getting hearing, hey, the costs are going through the roof inflation going wow. So people tend to be more receptive to those kinds of things, and they tend to realize that that's a bargain even at a higher price. So we do that. The other thing is, as I said, this in our first rodeo. And one of the things I learned back in the Carter era, which I hate to say that even than I was senting during that period, they -- it's about urgency. It's about riding to the sound of guns. And we get right on. When we see costs going up, we're out there working on it right away, either's a continuous improvement, either redesigning. For example, we've done a lot of effort redesigning our products around chips that are available. It's not even the cost. Steel is starting to peak a little bit. But you can't get stuff, so you're out buying it on a stock market. So it's not the base cost of things, but its how you have to buy it. We tend to make sure we can deliver. So we buy on the stock market. So, for example, I just reviewed a bunch of new air conditioning units where we redesigned them all and redesigned particularly three -- or three or four, all the electronics inside to get chips that we could use. We're doing the same kind of thing in diagnostics and in our undercar equipment. So those are the kinds of things you got to do, but you got to do it with alacrity. Well, the whole purpose of that is to try to model the individual customer -- by individual to try to call in the air strikes of the selling approach for the van driver, so that his selling will be more efficient, and therefore, he can call and spend more times with tougher customers, reach more customers, and that is the principal focus of that. That's what I can share with you. And we're making progress in that regard, but I don't really have any palpable things to report. We've been a little busy this quarter. So -- but still, we're working on that, but I don't have anything to lay out, just about the principal focus. And we're kind of optimistic that it will work, because if anybody's got a database about people, about technicians. If anybody knows technicians, it's Snap-on. Okay. Sure. Hi, Bret. And we've thought about that. I don't think I can help you. It's just too complex. I mean we raised, we raised the list price. But even the list price raise doesn't necessarily make it through. It tends to move it up in varying places depending on the product line. So it's hard to measure really. And the point about the individual promotions, they just vary all over the place. We simply manage on a macro basis, because when you got when you got trucks that have 4,000 SKUs on the truck and have a catalog of 40,000 SKUs, it's kind of a fool's errand to try to figure all this out, try to get macro out of the individual. We simply try to measure how we're doing and try to see what worked before and try to make sure that we get pricing along all those quarters, list, promotions and new products. And believe that it's going to get us in the right situation. And generally, so far, it has. Our own sales if you look at the sales for Snap-on in terms of growth \u2013 it was \u2013 I think our five quarters were 9%, 10%, 11%, 13% and now 16.9% above pre-pandemic levels. So somehow it's expanding growth. And not all of that is pricing because you can see the margins go up right in tune with it. I would have said that maybe before the pandemic, but I'm not seeing it now so much. I don't know. But you might say, I do think \u2013 I will say to you, I think service doesn't scale so easily. It has \u2013 that's been a problem in many industries. So I'm not so sure. Collision scales because it's almost like manufacturing in a lot of ways. But the service is a little tougher to scale, I think. So I don't know how much of that we'll see unless you see like a specialized group. Now maybe we will, and we have those as our customers, too. We do see multiple shops, but they don't seem to be very, let's say, nationwide or anything like that. Sometimes, we're seeing some opportunities call, localized multi-location situations. Mitchell One has made a meal out of that with their ProDemand, and those things have worked there. But in terms of the franchisees, I don't think they report that so much. Well. No. Actually, I don't think \u2013 there were what I would call non-standard ways of operating and serving our customers for a matter of days, not weeks. And as I said before, it principally set back the shipping processes, whereby, the calendarization of the quarter shipments tended to coagulate around at the rear end. But generally, we did not -- we didn't have any -- we didn't really have real disruption and there's been a lot of speculation, but we were hacked, a ransomware company. We didn't pay ransom. We didn't have to pay a ransom in this situation. And so we felt we got out of this and managed it pretty well. So that's really the story there, inefficiencies more than disruption and recalendarization."

            "content": "Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on slide six. Net sales of $197.8 million in the quarter increased 7.1% from 2021 levels, reflecting an 8% organic sales gain, an $8.5 million of acquisition-related sales, partially offset by $15.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales gain this quarter principally reflected double-digit growth in the Repair Systems & Information Group, and high single-digit growth in the Snap-on Tools Group. Consolidated gross margin of 48.7% declined 140 basis points from 50.1% last year. Higher material and other costs were partially offset by contributions from the higher sales volumes, pricing actions, benefits from the company's RCI initiatives and 30 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects. In the quarter, we believe the corporation through pricing and RCI actions continued to navigate effectively the cost and other supply chain dynamics of the current environment. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 28.4% improved 210 basis points from 30.5% last year. The improvement is primarily due to higher sales volumes, savings from RCI initiatives and lower costs associated with stock-based expenses. These improvements were partially offset by 40 basis points of unfavorable acquisition effects. Operating earnings before financial services of $223.1 million in the quarter compared to $200.9 million in 2021. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 20.3%, improved 70 basis points from last year. Financial services revenue of $87.7 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to $88.6 million last year. Operating earnings of $70.4 million increased $5.1 million from 2021 levels, primarily reflecting continued favorable portfolio performance, which resulted in lower provisions for credit losses. Consolidated operating earnings of $293.5 million compared to $266.2 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 24.8% improved 90 basis points from 23.9% in 2021. Our first quarter effective income tax rate of 23.7% compared to 23.5% last year. Net earnings of $217.4 million or $4 per diluted share, increased $24.8 million or $0.50 per share from last year's levels, representing a 14.3% increase in diluted earnings per share.  Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $340.1 million decreased from $345.7 million last year, reflecting a $3.6 million or 1.1% organic sales gain, which was more than offset by $9.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic growth primarily reflects a double-digit increase in sales in the segment's Asia Pacific operations, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in sales to customers in Critical Industries. Within Critical Industries, lower sales to the military more than offset solid gains in general industry and technical education. Gross margin of 36.4% declined 230 basis points from 38.7% in the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to the higher material and other input costs, partially offset by benefits from pricing actions and the segment's RCI initiatives.  Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 23% in the quarter improved 100 basis points from 24% in 2021, primarily reflecting savings from cost efficiencies. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $45.7 million compared to $50.7 million last year. The operating margin of 13.4% compared to 14.7% a year ago. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-On Tools Group of $512.1 million increased 7.1% from $478.3 million in 2021 reflecting a 7.7% organic sales gain, partially offset by $3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase reflects a double-digit gain in our US business, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in our international operations.  Sales in the United States were up over Q4, 2021 as well, reflecting strong sequential performance in power tools and tool storage. Gross margin of 45.5% in the quarter declined 40 basis points from last year, primarily due to higher material and other costs, which were more \u2013 mostly offset by the higher sales volumes, pricing actions and 30 basis points from favorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22.8% improved 240 basis points from 25.2% last year, primarily reflecting the higher sales, savings from RCI initiatives and lower stock-based expenses related to the company's franchisee stock plan. Operating earnings for the Snap-On Tools Group of $116 million compared to $98.9 million last year. The operating margin of 22.7% improved 200 basis points from 20.7% last year. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $398.2 million compared to $347.6 million a year ago, reflecting a 13.3% organic sales gain and $8.5 million of acquisition-related sales, partially offset by $3.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain is comprised of double-digit increases in sales of undercar equipment and in sales to OEM dealerships, as well as low single-digit gains in sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers.  Gross margin of 44.6% declined 140 basis points from 46% last year. This was primarily due to increased sales in lower gross margin businesses and higher material and other input costs, partially offset by benefits from pricing actions and 50 basis points from acquisitions, as well as from 30 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 21.6% improved 100 basis points from 22.6% last year, primarily due to the benefits from sales volume leverage, including higher volumes and lower expense businesses, and savings from RCI initiatives. These improvements were partially offset by 110 basis points of unfavorable acquisition effects. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $91.6 million, compared to $81.4 million last year. The operating margin of 23% compared to 23.4% a year ago. Now turning to slide 10. Revenue from financial services of $87.7 million decreased $900,000 from $88.6 million last year, primarily due to a decline in the size of the average financial services portfolio during the quarter as compared to last year. Financial services operating earnings of $70.4 million, compared to $65.3 million in 2021. Financial services expenses of $17.3 million were down $6 million from 2021 levels, primarily due to $5.6 million of decreased provisions for credit losses, resulting from favorable loan portfolio trends, including reduced year-over-year net charge-offs, which support lower forward-looking estimated reserve requirements. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 0.8% and 1.1% in the first quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively. In the first quarter of 2022 and 2021, the average yield on finance receivables was 17.6% in both years, while the average yield on contract receivables was 8.5% and 8.4%, respectively. Total loan originations of $245.6 million in the first quarter decreased $16.2 million or 6.2% from 2021 levels, reflecting a 5.1% decrease in origination to finance receivables and 11.5% decrease in originations of contract receivables. In the United States, finance receivable or extended credit originations were down low single digits. Moving to slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our US operation. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.6% for US extended credit remained the same as both the fourth quarter of 2021 and as in the first quarter of 2021. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $39.9 million represented 2.34% of outstandings at quarter end, down 21 basis points as compared to the same period last year. Now turning to slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $193.9 million in the quarter compared to $319.3 million last year. The decrease from the first quarter of 2021 primarily reflects a $106.7 million increase in working investment and higher payments for variable compensation, partially offset by increased net earnings. The change in working investment dollars is largely driven by greater demand, resulting in increased receivables and higher levels of inventory this year as compared to a reduction of inventory in 2021. In addition to demand-based requirements, the increase also reflects higher in-transit inventory amounts as well as incremental buffer stocks associated with the supply chain dynamics in the current macro environment. Inventory turns at the end of the first quarter of 2022 are unchanged sequentially. Net cash used by investing activities of $6.6 million included $20.2 million of capital expenditures and net collections of finance receivables of $10.1 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $106.3 million included cash dividends of $75.7 million and repurchase of 136,000 shares of common stock for $28.8 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of year-end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $442.2 million of common stock under existing authorizations. Turning to slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $49 million from 2021 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 61 days compared to 58 days at 2021 year-end. Inventories increased $60.3 million for 2021 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.8% were the same as year-end 2021 and compared to 2.6% at the end of the first quarter in 2021. Our quarter end cash position of $861.1 million compared to $270 million at year-end 2021. Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 7.4% compared to 9.1% at year-end 2021. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million under our credit facilities. As of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2022. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in a range of $90 million to $100 million. In addition, we currently anticipate, absent any changes to the US tax legislation, that our full year 2022 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Yeah. 17.4%, absolutely right. Well, yes. I'd say, broadly speaking, Luke, is that RS&I and C&I, when they do have to entertain pricing actions, there is a lag basis. And the reason for that is, unless you're going to invoke force majeure, which you don't want to, if you don't have to. Sometimes you have one-year contracts in place with certain key customers, national accounts or certain large industrial customers. Oftentimes, we have distribution relationships, who have a requirement of a 60, 90-day advance notice. So you have to be more measured and because they don't use as exclusively the Snap-on brand. The Snap-on brand is a very powerful brand, which the Tools Group does enjoy. You make the case at C&I and RS&I a little bit more mortal when they walk around the immortality of the Tools Group. They have to be cognizant of what's happening in and around them, because they don't operate in a vacuum. There's some big competitors in and around them. So they can not make pricing decisions in a vacuum so to speak. As Nick mentioned earlier, you can argue Snap-on and the Tools Group is the price leader and it sets the umbrella for others. In the case of C&I and RS&I, I think they have to be cognizant that they're a major player and they are an influencer, but they do not walk alone."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Sara Verbsky, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nSara Verbsky: Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today as we review Snap-on's fourth quarter and full year results which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions. As usual, we provided slides to supplement our discussion. These slides can be accessed under the Downloads tab in the webcast viewer as well as on our website, snapon.com, under the Investors section. These slides will be archived on our website along with the transcript of today's call. Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs or that otherwise discuss management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements, and actual results to differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings. Finally, this presentation includes non-GAAP measures of financial performance, which are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for their GAAP counterparts. Additional information regarding these measures is included in our earnings release issued today, which can be found on our website. With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?\nNicholas Pinchuk: Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I'll start with the highlights of our quarter and our full year, and I'll provide my perspective on the results, on our markets and our path ahead. After that, Aldo will then give you a detailed review of the financials. The results for our fourth quarter represented that we believe, another period of forward progress. Again, we had opportunities and countered headwinds and the shape of the variated landscape changed as it regularly does. But in the end, we once again took advantage of the opportunities and overcame the turbulence. Sales in the quarter were $1,196,600 million or $1.2 billion, sounds better that way, up 3.5% as reported from last year, excluding $9.1 million of favorable foreign currency and $5.5 million from the recent Mount acquisition. Organic sales increased 2.2%. The results represent a positive trend of some significance, demonstrating Snap-on's ability to adapt and to overcome market disruptions. From an earnings perspective, our OpCo operating income for the quarter was $257.9 million, and the OI margin for the quarter was $21.6 million up 10 basis points compared to last year. For Financial Services, operating earnings were $67.9 million, rising from the $63.9 million recorded last year. And the combination of the results from OpCo and from Financial Services offered an overall consolidated margin of 25.2%, also up 10 basis points. And the overall EPS was $4.75, a rise of 7.5% from the $4.42 that was registered a year ago. Now I talked about margins, let's turn to those markets and the trends we're seeing, based on our customer connections. We're with customers all the time. We believe automotive repair continues to be clearly favorable. Vehicle OEMs continue to see the need for upgrading dealer repair shops and enabling the shops and servicing the blizzard of new miles and technologies making the way to the market. And preparing for that future, OEM continue, requiring dealership investments in new Under Car Equipment and essential tools to meet the challenge. It's a considerable opportunity at which Snap-on is clearly taking advantage. Activity in the independent shops is also robust. You can see it in the vehicle and repair macros, car parks. The car park is growing and getting older. Now over 12 years old on here, cars are getting more complex and more difficult to fix and reflecting all of that, service hours are up. Household spending on repair is growing. Wages are rising. The number of technicians is moving upward fast and ship-owners keep shouting, they want more technicians, even louder than they have over the past years. So the underlying repair business is strong. It's prospering. It was a reality that kept the text positive, even as the financial was champing over the past years and months, the recession is coming, the recession is coming. But cash isn't everything. Cash is in everything for the people of work. Personal confidence is a balance between your current environment, the garage we see and the way you see the world evolving in sometime and sometime in the mid fall of last year, our franchisees sense that balance shifting negatively. In recent weeks, I've been around, I visited franchisees all over the country; in Nevada, South Carolina and Wisconsin, and they all said about the same thing. The techs are cash rich, but because of the external bad news of getting for breakfast almost every day, the impact in the Ukraine, the war in the Middle East, the dysfunction at the border and the uncertainty of the upcoming election, the weight of it all appears to be turning the tech's, confidence poor. And when this happens, based on what we've seen in other times, we've seen it happen before, our customers keep purchasing, but they gravitate towards shorter payback items. And so it appeared to be as the quarter progressed. You saw that from mid to the end of the quarter. And so repair is strong, but the techs are worrying about the way forward, still cash rich, but they appear to be wavering in their confidence. This is a big change. Now let's move forward to critical industries. That's, of course, a bit different color. Confidence seems to be abundance across that business. This is where our commercial and industrial group or C&I, plays. We continue to see progress. And again, the results in the quarter reflect that trend. It's a complex segment. A lot of you know this already, but I'm going to say the context, it's a complex segment embedded with essential techs where the penalty for failure is high. It's an arena that demands precision, functionality and repeatability, all under the most grueling environments, covering a vast range of applications from the sensitive micro world of chip manufacturing to giant rugged earthmoving equipment to performance critical aviation, things even up to spaceships. The underlying need for customization - but in that segment, the underlying need for customization and precision both, Snap-on strength is clearly growing all across those sectors. C&I, is also the most geographically dispersed operations. And there's, significant variations from country-to-country and created by the uncertainties in the economic political policies. As such, we see mixed results in Europe and a continuing but slow recovery in Asia. We also see differences from sector-to-sector with education, aviation and the military, military and general industries, all showing nice improvements where natural resources and heavy-duty are off. But shining through all that variability is our expanding strength in those critical industries. The advantage Snap-on holds in product and brand and in people. And in the quarter, those drivers were on display. So across our corporation, I would characterize our markets as mixed, turbulent from period-to-period and from sector-to-sector, but filled with ongoing opportunity. And we believe we're well positioned to face the challenges of today, though at the end of today and those that may arise in the future. We remain confident that we have the continuing potential along - we have continuing potential long-run run rates for growth, and we see significant power to overcome rooted in our Snap-on value creation processes of safety, quality, customer action innovation and rapid continuous improvement, especially customer connection. One of our substantial competitive advantages is being right where the actual paths are being pursued and in engineering the products to make the work easier by matching those insights, the insights gained with technology applied. We've seen that over time, we've seen that innovative offerings create the path to advance and to overcome any turbulence. And in the quarter and in the year, our product line continued to advance, just kept getting stronger. And we continue to invest in Snap-on value creation to make that possible. We believe, in fact, that our product line has never been stronger. And despite the turbulence, we had more million dollar hit products in 2023 than ever before, and we believe we'll move higher again in 2023 than ever before, and we believe we'll move higher again in 2024. Now, let's talk about the full year, the 2023 performance. Sales of $4.7302 billion represented an increase of 5.3% as reported and arrived at 5.6% organically. Opco alone exceeded $1 billion. I'd say that again, $1 billion for the first time, reaching $1.399 billion and our Opco on margin of 22%, 22% represented an average increase, an increase of 110 basis points at gangbusters. We've never been at 22 and 110 is a great increase. And when we include financial services earnings of $270.5 million, the consolidated operating margin for the corporation year was 25.7%, up 80 basis points. Earnings per share with the year were $18.76, rising $1.94 or 11.5%. We believe these are good numbers. Now for an individual - for the individual operation. Now for the individual operating group. So let's start with C&I. Reported sales for the C&I group in the quarter were $363.9 million, up $20.7 million or 6%. That includes $5.5 million from the recent Mountz acquisition, $3.6 million of favorable foreign currency and our organic sales increase of $11.6 million or 3.3%. They all reflecting the strength in critical industries, partially offset by a slide in automotive power tools. C&I's operating income for the period was $54.1 million. It was up 12.9% and the OI margin was 14.9%, rising 90 basis points and overcoming 50 basis points of headwind associated with negative currency. Again in this case, the advance was driven by strong expansion in critical industries. And our increased kitting capacity for complex orders continue to play a large role in that progress, but significant advances also spur as a regular is by new product. Innovations like our recently launched automated tool control or ATC portal, it's the latest addition to our unique Snap-On ATC tool control product lineup. It's manufactured at our AutoCrib operation that was recently acquired in California, and the portal significantly extends the reach of our ATC systems. It enables efficient control over a much wider range of device shapes and sizes. In effect, this portal's a doorway, in line with radio frequency identification or RFID antenna, it's typically a place that enters to tool. Significant assets like hydraulic pumps, portable generators and valuable diagnostic equipment are often stored in common areas in factories or other places and enter a catalog by fixing an RFID tag. As technicians scan the badge is entering with the portal, the system documents the devices will be in and out of the secured stores, keeping close track of these critical items, just like the base ATC system keeps track of hand and power tools moving in and out of the tool storage box, but over a much wider set of areas. We anticipate that the new portal will be a big boost and a great opportunity for C&I in the growing area of tool control, a very important area for us. And in the fourth quarter, we saw some of that potential come to bear. So C&I, mixed progress, challenged with headwinds but clear and overall advancement, great momentum enabled by capacity expansion and by growing product power. Now to the Tools Group. The Tools Group quarter, not at our standard. But we do see a path forward adjusting to the changing environment. As you may remember, this is where we sell to the text. Those who toil the wrenches, punch the touchscreen and those who appear to be wavering in macro confidence and those customers who under these conditions shift to lower payback or quicker payback items. While the fourth quarter reflects our franchisees and the Tools Group pivoting to match that movement, that customer movement. Sales in the quarter were $513.3 million included in our - and they included an organic decrease of 5.7% compared to last year. Now more to our standard, group OI margins were 21.6%, up 20 basis points, overcoming 10 basis points of negative currency and the gross margin percentage rose 200 basis points, nice gains. As the quarter played out, the franchisee sense the change and redirected their ordering and selling focus to match the customer shifts to lower - to faster payback items. And Snap-On is doing the same, defining a way forward, redirecting factory capacity, adopting smaller ticket marketing focus and launching innovative or quicker payback products that fit the environment. State-of-the-art designs, like our new ratchet for a manufacturer to Elizabeth, Tennessee factory. This next evolution in our ratchet line is 102 design, we've named the Synergy series. We believe it's a game changer for technicians, a significant improvement that helps make repair work much easier. The Synergy is a short payback item that will make a clear difference right away, a 15% thinner head, an inch longer handle a 3.5-inch degree swing area, 20% more compact, all for easier access and quicker work in tight corners that they also come up like chassis areas in modern vehicles. Synergy's internal mechanisms were reengineered to engage the primary drag with 10 contact points versus the seventh in the previous design, greatly reducing the chance of slippage, improving the tools reliability and quality even while under maximum loads. Technicians may be uncertain about the way forward, but they're confident about the synergies. They know with the Synergy. They know it will provide a quick payback. It's thinner, longer, stronger. And going forward, we'll expand that new technology - the new 102 technology throughout the Snap-on lineup, and we believe it will quickly become a must-have all across the industry. Also in the quarter, our Algona, Iowa manufacturing facility to reach the new quick payback, KRSC2430, a 36-inch deluxe shop cart with its with smooth mobility and a substantial payload. It offers a technician economic an attractive way to start the tools but it also allows them to position their instruments adjacent to the workplace, increasing productivity, eliminating the time walking to and from the job. As a particularly special feature, the versal lid on this cart serves as a durable workbench when open separates into 2 sections, showing full and easy - allowing full and easy access to the deep 8-inch top compartment that's underneath. The unit also includes a complete power strip where technicians charge their cordless tools, diagnostic platforms, lights and other electronic devices. The innovative cards also configured with two additional jaws. There's kind of two additional drawers underneath the sliding top, providing quick accessibility for essential and small items preventing lost times from treasure hunting and large drawers or small-scale items. And it's a common problem with other units. And so this will really save time for the text. And like our top-of-the-line tool storage boxes, technicians can customize their cart, selecting from an array of colors and trims and so they can project their own personal identity throughout the shop. The KRSC2430 economical storage, attractive features convenient mobility, we expect it will have strong and continuing to appeal in this uncertain environment. And shifting the product focus also requires some repositioning in the factory. Expanding the capacity to match customer preference, we're doing just that, moving to currently popular items, more dedication to short payback to products like our plexin swivel sockets and the new long nose pliers in Milwaukee, additional cart welding, breaking bottlenecks for our economical storage cart options in Algona and doubling down on synergy production in Elizabeth, Tennessee. Finally, our sales teams are being deployed to help franchisees, giving them added energy and more time in selling shorter payback items off their truck. Well, that's the Tools Group. Shifting tech preferences, pivoting operations to ensure the way forward, adapting products, capacity and sales focus, making the most of our strengths in the turbulence. Now for RS&I. The group results confirmed what we've been saying all along, Snap-on is well positioned to support repair shops, dealers and independents and keeping pace with the growing complexity of the car park. RS&I sales in the quarter were $450.8 million, up $12.9 million versus last year, including an organic sales rise of $8.8 million that was authored by volume with vehicle OEM programs for new models and platforms and by strong progress in undercar for both dealerships and independent shops, gains that served to offset the decrease in the big-ticket diagnostic items. RS&I operating earnings for the quarter were $113.3 million, and the operating margin was a still strong 25.1%, but down 20 basis points, reflecting the mix shift to lower-margin under car and OEM facing and the OEM-facing activities. But just like other segments, RS&I advances are driven by new products. And even the aging car park is filled with diverse and ever-changing models. Light-duty trucks and full-size SUVs are bigger than ever requiring a range of wheel configurations and sizes somewhere over 100 pounds. And at the recent repair industry, SEMA show in Las Vegas, we had one of our answers to that challenge on prominent display. Our new automated armored wheeler series wheel balancers, specifically designed for high-volume shops that require precision and reliability made from robust steel for enhanced and rugged durability. Even a small compact footprint, the balancers intelligent operating system uses sonar technologies to automatically measure both the wheel and RIM, eliminating the need for manual intervention, a great time saver in the shop. And for improved safety, the unit also includes heavy-duty pneumatic for us that physicians cumbersome tires on the spindle, making it unnecessary, protects and physically lift or manipulate the heavy assembly, substantially avoiding is the strain. The balancer also includes the high resolution touch screen and an intuitive interface and an effective ergonomic design. It's a powerful combination of accuracy, speed, durability and safety and the SEMA crowd clearly noticed. So that's RS&I. Shop repair remains robust. Vehicle complexity continues to advance abundant opportunities for a great future. The group has abundant opportunities for a great future and our RSI team has the products to take advantage. Well, that's our quarter and our year. For the quarter, sales up 3.5% as reported, 2.2% organically. OI margin reached 21.6%, up 10 basis points, and the EPS was $4.75, rising 7.5% and against the turbulence. The period was marked by extraordinary positives in the critical industry - in the critical industries that are C&I. The Tools Group not reaching our standard, but displaying margin gains and pivoting to match the technician shifting focus and RS&I, enabling both dealerships and independent shops to meet the challenges of higher complexity in new technologies and the full year 2023 sales of $4.7302 billion, up 5.6% organically, an OI of over $1 billion rising 10.5% and OI margin of 22%, an increase of 110 basis points, 110 basis points like that and EPS of $18.76, up $1.94 or 11.5%. It was another encouraging year. Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?\nAldo Pagliari: Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $1196.6 billion in the quarter represented an increase of 3.5% from 2022 levels, reflecting a 2.2% organic sales gain, $9.1 million of favorable foreign currency translation and $5.5 million of acquisition-related sales. Sales were strong in our businesses serving critical industries this quarter while activity in our automotive repair market was mixed. Consolidated gross margin of 48.3%, including 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to 48.5% last year. Benefits from lower material and other costs and savings from the company's RCI initiatives were offset by the effects of a higher mix of lower sales and lower gross margin businesses. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales improved 30 basis points to 26.7% from 27% last year, primarily due to lower corporate expenses and benefits from higher sales volumes, partially offset by increased investment in personnel and other costs. Operating earnings before financial services of $257.9 million in the quarter, compared to $248 million in 2022. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 21.6%, including 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to 21.5% last year. Financial services revenue of $97.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $88.3 million last year, while operating earnings of $67.9 million compared to $63.9 million in 2022. Consolidated operating earnings of $325.8 million in the quarter compared to $311.9 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 25.2% compared to 25.1% in 2022. Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 21.4% compared to 22% last year, while our full year 2023 tax rate of 22.5% compared to 22.8% last year. Net earnings of $255.3 million or $4.75 per diluted share, reflected an increase of $16.4 million or $0.33 per share from 2022 levels and represented a 7.5% year-over-year improvement in diluted earnings per share. Now let's turn to our segment results for the quarter. Starting with the C&I group on Slide 7. Sales of $363.9 million increased from $343.2 million last year, reflecting an $11.6 million or 3.3% and organic sales gain, $5.5 million of acquisition-related sales and $3.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Organic growth includes a double-digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries, partially offset by a double-digit decline in sales of power tools. With respect to critical industries, sales to the military were robust as was activity in the aviation sector. As previously announced, during the quarter, Snap-on acquired Mountz Inc., a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of high-precision torque tools. The acquisition complements and expands Snap-on's torque offering for a variety of critical industry applications. The operating results of Mountz are reported within the C&I group. Gross margin improved 150 basis points to 39.2% in the fourth quarter from 37.7% in 2022. This was largely due to increased sales volumes and the higher gross margin critical industry sector pricing actions, savings from RCI initiatives and the 30 basis points of benefits from acquisitions. These improvements were partially offset by 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 60 basis points to 24.3% in the quarter from 23.7% in 2022, primarily due to a 30 basis point impact from acquisitions, as well as from investments in personnel and other costs. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $54.1 million, including $1.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $47.9 million last year. The operating margin of 14.9%, including 50 basis points of unfavorable currency effects compared to 14% in 2022, reflecting an improvement of 90 basis points. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $513.3 million compared to $542.7 million a year ago, reflecting a 5.7% organic sales decline partially offset by $1.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic decrease reflects a high single-digit decline in the U.S. business, partially offset by a mid-single digit gain in our international operations. Gross margin improved 200 basis points to 45.2% in the quarter from 43.2% last year. This improvement primarily reflects decreased sales of lower gross margin products, which includes lower sales of items where the Snap-on Tools Group serves as a distributor for products made by our C&I and RS&I groups. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 180 basis points to 23.6% in the quarter from 21.8% in 2022, largely due to the lower sales volume. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $111 million compared to $116.1 million last year. The operating margin of 21.6% compared to 21.4% in 2022. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $450.8 million, compared to $437.9 million in 2022, reflecting a 2% organic sales gain and $4.1 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase includes a high single-digit increase in activity with OEM dealerships and a mid-single-digit gain in sales of undercar equipment. These gains were partially offset by a high single-digit decline in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers. Gross margin was unchanged from last year with benefits from lower material and other costs and savings from RCI initiatives, offset by increased sales and lower gross margin businesses. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 20 basis points to 19.9% from 19.7% last year, primarily reflecting increased personnel and other costs. Operating earnings for the RS&I group of $113.3 million compared to $10.6 million last year. The operating margin of 25.1% compared to 25.3% reported last year. Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services increased $8.9 million to $97.2 million from $88.3 million last year, primarily reflecting the growth of the loan portfolio. Financial services and operating earnings of $67.9 million compared to $63.9 million in 2022. Financial services expenses were up $4.9 million from 2022 levels, including $3.9 million of higher provisions for credit losses. The year-over-year increase in provision reflects both the growth of the portfolio, as well as a return to what we believe to be a more normal pre-pandemic rate of provision. For reference, our gross worldwide extended credit or finance receivable portfolio has increased 8.5% year-over-year, and we believe the delinquency and portfolio performance trends currently remain stable. In the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022, the respective average yield on finance receivables were 17.8% and 17.6%. In the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022, the average yield on contract receivables were 8.9% and 8.6%, respectively. Total loan originations of $33.1 million in the fourth quarter represented an increase of $3.4 million or 1.1% from 2022 levels. Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $2.5 billion of gross financing receivables with $2.2 billion from our U.S. operation. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.8% for U.S. extended credit was up from 1.6% in 2022, but was the same as in the pre-pandemic period of 2019. On a sequential basis, the rate is up 30 basis points, reflecting the seasonal uptick we typically experience between the third and fourth quarters. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $50.4 million, represented 2.59% of outstandings at quarter end, which compares to 2.51% as reported at the end of last quarter. Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $296.9 million in the quarter, represented 114% of net earnings and compared to $210.6 million last year. The improvement as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, largely reflects lower year-over-year increases in working investment, which included a reduction in inventory in 2023 as well as higher net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $104.6 million included $42.6 million for acquisitions, net additions to finance receivables of $42.2 million and capital expenditures of $21.1 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $149 million included cash dividends of $98 million, and the repurchase of 217,000 shares of common stock for $60.9 million under our existing share repurchase program. As of year-end, we had approximately $22.9 million of common stock under our existing authorizations available for repurchase. Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $29.6 million from 2022 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 60 days compared to 61 days as of 2022 year-end. Inventories decreased $27.2 million from 2022 year-end. And on a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.3% compared to 2.5% at year-end 2022. Our year-end cash position of $1.15 billion compared to $757.2 million a year in 2022. Our net debt to capital ratio of 3.8% compared to 9% at year-end 2022. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $900 million available under our credit facilities. As of year-end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance, and I'll briefly review a few outlook items for 2024. We expect that capital expenditures will be in the range of $100 million to $110 million. In addition, we currently anticipate that our full year 2024 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 22% to 23%. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?\nNicholas Pinchuk: Thanks, Al. The Snap-on fourth quarter and full year. Geographic variation, shifting customer perspective, growing macro uncertainties, all overcome by Snap-on's ability to wield disadvantages making the most of opportunities, continuing its positive and upward trend now demonstrated over multiple quarters and a significant number of years. The quarter did see the change in technicians perspective. And in pivoting with just the Tools Group volume did not meet our standards, but the tools team did blunt the difficulty with favorable mix and RCI driving improvement of OI margins up 20 basis points with the gross margin rising 200 basis points. The story with repair shop owners and managers was somewhat different. They recognize the need to upgrade and RS&I increase this rise in participation in OEM programs and extended its gains in undercar equipment, particularly in the expanding collision space. And finally, we saw C&I register another quarter of increasing importance to the corporation with the critical industries rising double digits and achieving another leap in margin reaching new margins, reaching new and significant levels. And it all resulted in a fourth quarter advancement against some substantial headwinds. Sales were up 3.5% as reported 2.2% organically. OI margins of 21.6% increased 10 basis points and an EPS of $4.75 rising 7.5%, all representing progress and a time when all was not where we'd like it to be. But I believe the bright-line story in this period is the full year sales for the corporation increased 5.6% organically. Opco OI margin rose 110 basis points, another significant advance and a long line of game reaching 22% for the first time, and the EPS was $18.76 up versus all comparisons.  And it was all offered by some noteworthy performance of the Tools Group, not encountering the smoothest sailing but still achieving an OI margin of 23.6%, an increase of 150 basis points. RS&I, sales up 6.7% organically and an OI margin of 24.3%, up 70 basis points off a strong base. And C&I, facing a landscape of challenges. We're growing 4.2% as reported 5% organically with an OI margin of 15.5%, up 140 basis points against 50 basis points of negative currency. And perhaps the biggest story of all is the emergence of the critical industry business, growing strong double digits in all four quarters demonstrating that we really can roll the Snap-on brand out of the garage at considerable margins. We see the quarter in the year as demonstrating that Snap-on does have multiple run rates for progress. And if one of our segments is challenged, we can still move forward achieving clear and continuing advancement driven by the other parts of the enterprise. And as such, we're encouraged by our presence and by our future. We believe that with our advantages in product, everyone recognizes we know work and we do make tasks easier. In brand, everywhere you go, among the - everywhere you go in the people of work, the Snap-on sign is displayed and spoken up with great pride. And in our people, a team, battle tested, who find the way forward and upwards despite the challenges, the results of 2023 say it so. And we believe, enabled by those advantages, Snap-on will overcome, we'll achieve and will advance continuing the positive trend throughout 2024 and well beyond. Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll address our franchisees and associates. I know they're all listening. I've spoken today with belief and confidence on our current situation on our way forward. I do so principally, but I do so principally because I know the capability and the quality demonstrated over and over by all of you. For your contributions and authoring our achievements, you have my congratulations. For the skills and energy you bring to our corporation every day, you have my admiration. And for the commitment you consistently display for the future of our mutual enterprise, you have my thanks. Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Luke Junk with Baird. Please go ahead.\nLuke Junk: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question here. Nick, for starters, I was hoping you could just expand. I know you mentioned some of these things in the prepared remarks already, but if you could just expand on Snap-on's most important growth drivers in the Tools Group as we go into 2024 here, really irrespective of what the market is giving you? And if you pivot aggressively enough, do you think that you can grow the tools business this earning?\nNicholas Pinchuk: Yes, I think we can. I mean, I think we've done it. We did it We did it in the pandemic era coming out of the pandemic when confidence was kind of still in the tools. If you look at the first four quarters after the pandemic, it was mostly on shorter payback items. So we can make a good business out of that. We made it at the tail end of the financial recession as well. So we think that's the capability. We are simply - as you might say, what we saw coming out of the FFC, everybody was sort of business as usual, pumped up and they were ordering to a general mix of product. And then on late October and November, things started to look a little different to our franchisees, and they wanted to make a pivot because they had been through this rodeo before, and so they wanted to redirect. That's what we're doing. We think we have great things in hand tools and in diagnostics and in tool storage carts and maybe some of the lower lines of tool storage boxes themselves like at the classic series. So we're going to focus on that. That doesn't mean we're going to abandon the bigger ticket items, things like maybe Triton and so on in diagnostics or - which we believe is very strong but - or our boxes. But we're going to shift our focus. And it's important to talk about the capacity, Luke, because remember, we were already kind of bumping up the capacity, and we're fighting to expand it. And so what you want to do in this situation is try to use that expanded capacity in a redirected manner. So we actually have the volumes in the places we think are selling now. So we feel pretty good about that. Our product lineup is good. We've got a good - as I said, product leads the way. We've got a great array of hand tools coming forward. We got new tool boxes, diagnostics, power tools, all those things are going to work for us, we believe. So the way forward is, one, continue to drive the products, make sure we can actually deliver them. And then thirdly, as always, to try to help the franchisees in selling giving them more time to sell - and maybe sometimes it might take a little longer in this situation. So that's why we're deploying our field guys to get out there and provide a little bit more energy and time to the actual selling process. So we think it's a reasonable pivot. This is - again, it's not our first rodeo. It's not the Tools Group's first rodeo. So we think, okay, things have changed a little bit. We know how to respond.\nLuke Junk: Thanks for that. And then I guess a related question would be the shift in mechanic sentiments that you saw mid fall. Just how do you think that improves the appetite for credit here and as you tracked either originations or just other trends in book, I'm thinking more from the demand side, Nick?\nNicholas Pinchuk: Well, yes, you probably see less credit use in that situation. I mean, the originations were \u2013 I think Al was set down 1% in the United States in the quarter. So I mean, I think you see that kind of thing. And if you go back and you look at our numbers, say, coming out of COVID, let's say, quarter three and four of 2020 and first second quarter of 2021, you'll see that kind of phenomenon. So that could be the case. Now this is early days for this. Our people sense it. Well, the good thing about this is our people sensed it right away. And so sensing it, they changed their words that put a little strain on a factory because when you change the orders, it makes the capacity shrink a little bit. So you have those kinds of things. So I believe you may see a little pivoting away from that. Now I think this is right in tune with everything. I do believe, I've said it many times that there is a bifurcation economy that there's a financial economy, the kinds of people that I said in my talk that my remarks that we're talking about the recession is coming and recession is coming and the people are saying we're going to have a soft landing now. But the people at the grass level have a different view of the world. And if you look at the Wall Street Journal, the front page say and the paper position, there's an article saying just this. Actually, I met a bunch of franchisees, and I met a huge number of people in the factories and in garages in places like Conway and Louisville and a little bit in Tennessee and Milwaukee. So and they all kind of say the same thing. They got jobs. They got the cash coming in. But every day they get up and get bad news for breakfast. And you start to wonder about what's going to happen. So it's not that things are bad today, but people worry about how things are going to happen and what's going to happen in the future. And I think all of us looking at the events might say that's true.\nLuke Junk: Okay. And then maybe a final question. This one might be for Aldo. Just hoping on what happened in the car tools business, specifically this quarter, if we look at the inter-segment, so it seems like things maybe step down quite a bit. I'm just trying to reconcile what you saw in order trends versus your impression of underlying trends in power tools. Is it possible that there is sort of a onetime adjustment in orders to level set inventory on the bans in power tools. Am I thinking about that right?\nAldo Pagliari: So in some ways, there's another buffer stock in between the tools maintained its own levels of inventory. So you're right, simply the Tools Group had less need to buy as much in power tools and diagnostics in the quarter. It doesn't mean necessarily that that flows onto one through the demand because you have inventories in between, both inventories at demand itself and the inventories in the hands of the Tools Group. But you have lower sales from C&I and from RS&I to the Tools Group, reflects actually pretty much power tools and diagnostic related products.\nNicholas Pinchuk: Actually, yes, I'd offer that - what you're seeing a phenomenon as you're seeing, as Aldo said, some adjustment there. And if you look at \u2013 if you actually look at careful look at C&I, you see they actually had a pop quarter to their traditional customers. But what happens in the power tools business is our new CT9038 came out 18 volt, it sold great, then this happened. And that kept selling, but the bigger ticket items in power tools, like the 18 volts just dropped off and people tended to want the 144 volt. Our supply chains are a little longer for that. We couldn't supply all of that. So you have that kind of situation. But if you look at the Tools Group level, power tools are not down, especially an outstanding amount. It's mostly between the Tools Group and C&I.\nLuke Junk: Got it. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Buckley: Hi. Good morning, guys. This is Patrick Buckley on for Bret. Thanks for taking our questions.\nNicholas Pinchuk: Okay.\nPatrick Buckley: Could you talk a bit more on pricing versus units within the Tools Group. And then looking ahead, are pricing actions on the table here? Or is it more focused on pushing the shorter payable tools?\nNicholas Pinchuk: No. Pricing, we generally have - except in inflationary, exceptional inflationary times, which we've all been through more or less recently is we get 30 to 40 basis points of pricing, something like that. Most of our advancement basically comes from RCI and new product, which gets its margins. We get our margins for new products. We don't plan changing that approach. We're not really going to make a major adjustment in pricing going forward. This is more about shorter payback versus longer payback. It's the - think of it this way. It's just take a simple thing as a tool storage unit. Okay, you can buy a big epic and boy, they are great. People love them. They bring people up and show them their box, and they say, this is my dream, but that's not a quick payback. That's a longer payback. You got to work a long time and get efficiency from the size of that and the features in that to get a payback. But if you get yourself a cart, you can move from your workplace out into the shop, particularly in some of these independent chefs out into the shop yard or all over the shop. And that gives you immediate savings in time just there. And so that's the kind of thing I'm talking about is that shift to the idea. Is this thing going to pay for me right away, pay me back right away? Wrenches do that, particularly like the synergy I talked about here, which is a leap forward in terms of reliability and access and swing arc and make the jobs easier and able to beat the flat rate faster. So those are the kinds of things we're betting on. We've seen it work before. So I think the good thing about this is Tools Group saw it started to move on.\nPatrick Buckley: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And then was there anything notable to call out in the corporate expense line and Q4 seemed to take a step down from the run rate we saw in the past few years?\nAldo Pagliari: So we had lower spending in the quarter on legal expenses in particular. We had a favorable settlement on a matter. So it was able to reduce our expenditures in the quarter. But the run rate for corporate expenses is running in a typical fashion.\nNicholas Pinchuk: Actually, it's about $113 million. It's $113 million in the year. That's up $5 million to $6 million year-over-year.\nAldo Pagliari: $113 million versus $1.08 million.\nNicholas Pinchuk: Yes.\nPatrick Buckley: Got it. That\u2019s all for us. Thanks guys.\nOperator: The next question is from Scott Stember with Roth MKM. Please go ahead.\nScott Stember: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.\nNicholas Pinchuk: Sure.\nScott Stember: Nick, could you split out the different subsegments within tools, hand tools, power tools, obviously, sounds like color tools were down, but - and storage units, things like that? Thanks.\nNicholas Pinchuk: Well, it wasn't a lot of good - being down 5.7% is not a lot of good news to go around. The big kahuna moving downwards was diagnostics. They saw it diagnostics, and we have several ranges of diagnostics and the latest introduced was the soles - it's the low end of - I don't want to say low end, it's the lowest priced version of our product. And that pay in the quarter, not as well as we might have hoped in our situations. But what kind of went down was ZEUS, the top of the line and the next one down to Triton. And ZEUS had been introduced last year in the fourth quarter, so those comparisons around. But the biggest kahuna down was that. And then after that, I think actually Tool storage is up slightly, but all because of cards, pretty much because of carts and shop and tech were down. So, hand tools were down some. But if you looked at it, the thing that - one of the things that drove the margins, I think the important point out of that, Scott, what drove the margin improvement in the Tools Group despite the lower volume was that the stuff they make, the carts at Algona, the tool storage items and the hand tools were a bigger portion of their sales than in prior year - in the prior year. And so that that welded a much greater mix because from hands and what the tools group sells for hand tools and tool storage, they get both distribution and manufacturer margins for things like diagnostics and power tools and shopping tech stuff, they only get the distribution margin. So, there's a pretty big difference between those. So, you can get some pretty good news or bad news depending on how that mix works.\nScott Stember: So, going forward, obviously, you're focusing on quicker payback items. So, obviously, that would be hand tools? You're going to start cranking that up a little bit more?\nNicholas Pinchuk: You would say it this way. I mean there's - we like to think, Scott, that we could find quicker payback items than everything. Hand tools clearly mostly often, I should say often, our quick payback. The technicians can see quick payback. Certain versions of tool storage, as I've said, the carts in particular, which tend to be substantially cheaper and more efficacious because they're kind of an option to add on to a big box. And then or somebody can't afford a lot and wants to just get a Snap-On tool storage in some way at an affordable level. And then the lower end of that product, the classic series, which we're working on having in terms of in terms of programs coming up, which we've got scheduled for February and March. And so that would be the case. Diagnostics, it all tends to be bigger ticket items. So, there are - there is the sales at the lower end, and we have some - bring out a new diagnostic at some point during the year, which creates interest. But the lower ticket items is just at the bottom end of diagnostics. And then power tools can have I don't want to say big ticket items, but the 18 volts are a little more expensive. 14-volt is a lot more affordable and you tend to have a very focused application for where the 18-volt tends to be broader applications to bring that power to any place whereas the 18 - the 14-volt tend to be saying, I got this problem in this particular chassis area of the car I see, so I'm going to use that 14-volt. So, that tends to be quick payback as well. Those are the kinds of things you see.\nScott Stember: Got it. And then just a last question on the bigger picture. You said that the overall market, the underlying conditions look pretty strong. You're not seeing any warning signs for the businesses themselves, demand. I mean O'Reilly reported last night, and they said that their the professional business was up double-digits. So, I just want to make sure that we're not - this is not a canary in the coal mine that the underlying business--\nNicholas Pinchuk: I don't think so. I mean I think everybody says the business is good. I mean, I don't know. First of all, I have two amps to that. One is the metrics. If you look at the BOL data, that all seems positive. I mean, the miles driven are up in that. It's a long way thing. But the spending on - household spending on repair up 4% year-over-year. That's a pretty good number. The number of tech up 4.5%. I used to be 1%. They're growing at 4.5%. The technician wage is up 7%. So those kinds of things good things and the car park, of course, keeps growing, and so they keep pumping it in. And the auto industry, while this doesn't make a difference too much is starting to come back, and they're still rolling out those new technologies. So all that seems to be from a quantitative point of view seems to be positive. Now the Bureau labor data can trail, so I don't know, and people have questions about that. But then, when you go out in the windshield survey and you talk to not only the people our franchisees who are out there every day, but to talk to the general people who work, they think cash is rolling for them. They're not going to say they're cash rich, but they are. And so I think things look good right now. And I don't expect this to change.\nScott Stember: Got it. And just to firm up a follow-up on something you said earlier. You would not be surprised to see the Tools Group return to positive organic growth?\nNicholas Pinchuk: No, we don't give guidance. But I think I said like four times in my remarks, they weren't at standard.\nScott Stember: Got it.\nNicholas Pinchuk: We expect them to grow. If we don't, if we don't grow, they will be below our expectations.\nScott Stember: Got it. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you.\nNicholas Pinchuk: Sure.\nOperator: And our last question today comes from David McGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.\nDavid McGregor: Yes. Good morning, everyone and thanks for taking my questions. Let me just start by sort of picking up on the last line of questioning. It sounds like hand tools and storage is doing maybe a little bit better in relative terms. But that's also where you were adding capacity in Elizabeth and Milwaukee and Algona. Are they doing a little bit better because you finally just have a little more capacity you're able to liquidate some of that backlog? Or is there maybe a better underlying demand story in those categories?\nNicholas Pinchuk: That's a complicated question because of the situation, you know? I mean, I guess, I don't know. I think this way, though, I'm pretty sure we're doing better because we had in the queue some ability to adjust for shorter payback items in those areas. That's pretty much the way I can answer it. Now what I will tell you is - David, this is an operating guys song is that when you're thinking that you're going to have - you're going to have promotions rolling out of your factories and all of a sudden, your customers come up and, say, never mind, we want to go over here. This tends to create a lot of, shall I say, inefficiencies. And so you have to adjust to that. So I don't think we got the full result the capacities we had hoped the capacity expansions we had hoped to get in the fourth quarter because of those changes, they just optimize what you've added. And so that's part of - that's a factor in all of this. Yes, the backlog for - some of the backlog for tool storage was down. So we liquidated some of that, but we still have backlog in those areas. So it's a complicated answer, I think. You might have some of that. But on the other hand, we couldn't fulfill it as much. We couldn't have liquidated as much as we would have had we had full - had been able to roll in the way we had planned to roll in our production plans coming out of the SFC.\nDavid McGregor: Okay. Just a couple of other questions for you, Nick and Aldo, the trucks, I would love to get your sense if your organic growth was down 5.7%. What do you think the truck sell-through was?\nNicholas Pinchuk: I sort of know what it was, and it was better than that in the quarter and for the year, generally is better. This all tends to come out in the wash though - in the long run. But in the fourth quarter, the trucks were not down. We're substantially. They were still down, but not anything like the Tools Group.\nDavid McGregor: Down low single digits?\nNicholas Pinchuk: Yes. Sure. I mean so you would say maybe the - you don't know, but they've kind of liquidated some things. So part of it is delivery - if you pick a particular product and you say a shift to that product, we do have inventory, but the point is sometimes you don't have that product and you have to make changes in the factory, sometimes we couldn't even deliver what they wanted.\nDavid McGregor: Let me just shift to credit for a second, if I could. And Aldo, you normally share the breakdown on originations between finance receivables and credit receivables. Would you be kind enough to do that for us again this quarter?\nAldo Pagliari: You see the receivables, the originations were down, and that was more than offset by contract receivables. And similar to the results of the Tools Group, EC originations in the United States were down more than what we saw internationally. It was actually up in terms of EC originations. So that kind of gives you some of the blend.\nDavid McGregor: Okay. And I guess within those origination numbers, can you distinguish between merchandise versus franchisees flipping RA and DC?\nAldo Pagliari: Actually, I was pleased to say, I know you're asking, David, actually, in the quarter, there's less than what would be the typical mix of what we call transfers, RA transfers where they transfer items from the revolving accounts over to EC. There's actually less of an effect of that. But for the full year, it's very consistent with where we expect it to be. So there's been no signs of franchisees using the credit company to finance their operations by moving things from their revolving accounts across I think that's what you're after.\nDavid McGregor: Yes. And do you get a sense that there's an opportunity here to maybe I mean, you've got a very high-quality credit portfolio. I don't think that's ever been a doubt. Certainly, certainly, that's our sense. Do you get a sense there's maybe an opportunity here to relax a little on the credit standard in order to reinvigorate demand?\nNicholas Pinchuk: No.\nDavid McGregor: It was a nice tight answer, Nick.\nNicholas Pinchuk: Well, if that was me.\nAldo Pagliari: If you think about what we said, people are lacking confidence to some degree for big-ticket items. I don't think the way hold is to discount the interest rate you're going to charge those to provoke a sale. So we're not into the - discounting isn't usually our style. It doesn't mean we might not come up with creative promotions and bundling and things like that. But I don't think discounting is the way.\nDavid McGregor: And so what's the take on the regional kickoffs? Just help us think through first half that you're seeing in regional kickoff.\nNicholas Pinchuk: I think we usually comment on the kickoffs usually in the first quarter call. But in general, and we tried to shift the kickoff at the last moment for - we took a different approach to kickoffs this time. We saw this problem. We try to concentrate on shorter payback items that seemed to go reasonably okay with those items. And then we established a little more program in February and March, thinking that if we kind of stretch the kickoffs into other months, then we would be able to have better adjustments to the current situation. So that's sort of what we did in the kickoff. I was at one in Las Vegas and turn yes, they usually send me the Deadwood, South North Dakota. This time, I got to go to Las Vegas. And we had the Canadian guys there. That seemed to go okay. They seem to be positive. The franchisees don't seem to be daunted by this. They just report what they see. \nDavid McGregor: Right. The last question for me is just maybe on the competitive dynamics. You've been fairly steady in terms of the number of trucks you have on the road now for quite a number of years. gather, maybe there's a few more company-owned versus franchise within the mix overall. But at the same time, your competitors have been increasing the number of trucks on the road. You sense this is starting to have a little bit of an impact on it. Do you feel like maybe there was a little bit of share loss this quarter versus some of your peers? \nNicholas Pinchuk: I don't know. I don't like to - I never like to talk about share. I never talked about share when our numbers were booming upwards, and I don't talk about it now. You could think that, but I don't think so. I think, look, we got - we have - I don't think - I think we're covering the universe with the 3,400-or-so franchisees that we have - so you could argue that some locations might be seeing competition where they haven't. But there are a few locations, David, that don't have any competition. So what does happen sometimes is tough, okay, somebody one or two or three. One of the other competitors will put somebody in place. But that guy, our guy in that territory has already been dealing with people and the other guy has its own competition and it might create more business. But I never hear the franchisees saying that. Why you logically might think that would be the case, and we think about it all the time, and I ask the question all the time, but they almost never say that. In fact, never.\nDavid McGregor: Are you seeing any change in franchisee attrition rates?\nNicholas Pinchuk: No, that's pretty held the same, pretty much the same in the quarter. So franchisees, just in the quarter, we saw more - I think we saw more longer than the Tool guys leave in the quarter, an interesting phenomenon. But that was - that's just a sort of anecdotal view of it. I don't not sure that could make some difference, but I don't think we worry about that in particular in terms of the day-to-day dynamics of the competition. \nDavid McGregor: Got it. Thanks very much. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got. Good luck, gentlemen.\nNicholas Pinchuk: Hi, thanks.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Sara Verbsky for any closing remarks.\nSara Verbsky: Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day. \nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Nicholas Pinchuk",
            "content": "Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I'll start with the highlights of our quarter and our full year, and I'll provide my perspective on the results, on our markets and our path ahead. After that, Aldo will then give you a detailed review of the financials. The results for our fourth quarter represented that we believe, another period of forward progress. Again, we had opportunities and countered headwinds and the shape of the variated landscape changed as it regularly does. But in the end, we once again took advantage of the opportunities and overcame the turbulence. Sales in the quarter were $1,196,600 million or $1.2 billion, sounds better that way, up 3.5% as reported from last year, excluding $9.1 million of favorable foreign currency and $5.5 million from the recent Mount acquisition. Organic sales increased 2.2%. The results represent a positive trend of some significance, demonstrating Snap-on's ability to adapt and to overcome market disruptions. From an earnings perspective, our OpCo operating income for the quarter was $257.9 million, and the OI margin for the quarter was $21.6 million up 10 basis points compared to last year. For Financial Services, operating earnings were $67.9 million, rising from the $63.9 million recorded last year. And the combination of the results from OpCo and from Financial Services offered an overall consolidated margin of 25.2%, also up 10 basis points. And the overall EPS was $4.75, a rise of 7.5% from the $4.42 that was registered a year ago. Now I talked about margins, let's turn to those markets and the trends we're seeing, based on our customer connections. We're with customers all the time. We believe automotive repair continues to be clearly favorable. Vehicle OEMs continue to see the need for upgrading dealer repair shops and enabling the shops and servicing the blizzard of new miles and technologies making the way to the market. And preparing for that future, OEM continue, requiring dealership investments in new Under Car Equipment and essential tools to meet the challenge. It's a considerable opportunity at which Snap-on is clearly taking advantage. Activity in the independent shops is also robust. You can see it in the vehicle and repair macros, car parks. The car park is growing and getting older. Now over 12 years old on here, cars are getting more complex and more difficult to fix and reflecting all of that, service hours are up. Household spending on repair is growing. Wages are rising. The number of technicians is moving upward fast and ship-owners keep shouting, they want more technicians, even louder than they have over the past years. So the underlying repair business is strong. It's prospering. It was a reality that kept the text positive, even as the financial was champing over the past years and months, the recession is coming, the recession is coming. But cash isn't everything. Cash is in everything for the people of work. Personal confidence is a balance between your current environment, the garage we see and the way you see the world evolving in sometime and sometime in the mid fall of last year, our franchisees sense that balance shifting negatively. In recent weeks, I've been around, I visited franchisees all over the country; in Nevada, South Carolina and Wisconsin, and they all said about the same thing. The techs are cash rich, but because of the external bad news of getting for breakfast almost every day, the impact in the Ukraine, the war in the Middle East, the dysfunction at the border and the uncertainty of the upcoming election, the weight of it all appears to be turning the tech's, confidence poor. And when this happens, based on what we've seen in other times, we've seen it happen before, our customers keep purchasing, but they gravitate towards shorter payback items. And so it appeared to be as the quarter progressed. You saw that from mid to the end of the quarter. And so repair is strong, but the techs are worrying about the way forward, still cash rich, but they appear to be wavering in their confidence. This is a big change. Now let's move forward to critical industries. That's, of course, a bit different color. Confidence seems to be abundance across that business. This is where our commercial and industrial group or C&I, plays. We continue to see progress. And again, the results in the quarter reflect that trend. It's a complex segment. A lot of you know this already, but I'm going to say the context, it's a complex segment embedded with essential techs where the penalty for failure is high. It's an arena that demands precision, functionality and repeatability, all under the most grueling environments, covering a vast range of applications from the sensitive micro world of chip manufacturing to giant rugged earthmoving equipment to performance critical aviation, things even up to spaceships. The underlying need for customization - but in that segment, the underlying need for customization and precision both, Snap-on strength is clearly growing all across those sectors. C&I, is also the most geographically dispersed operations. And there's, significant variations from country-to-country and created by the uncertainties in the economic political policies. As such, we see mixed results in Europe and a continuing but slow recovery in Asia. We also see differences from sector-to-sector with education, aviation and the military, military and general industries, all showing nice improvements where natural resources and heavy-duty are off. But shining through all that variability is our expanding strength in those critical industries. The advantage Snap-on holds in product and brand and in people. And in the quarter, those drivers were on display. So across our corporation, I would characterize our markets as mixed, turbulent from period-to-period and from sector-to-sector, but filled with ongoing opportunity. And we believe we're well positioned to face the challenges of today, though at the end of today and those that may arise in the future. We remain confident that we have the continuing potential along - we have continuing potential long-run run rates for growth, and we see significant power to overcome rooted in our Snap-on value creation processes of safety, quality, customer action innovation and rapid continuous improvement, especially customer connection. One of our substantial competitive advantages is being right where the actual paths are being pursued and in engineering the products to make the work easier by matching those insights, the insights gained with technology applied. We've seen that over time, we've seen that innovative offerings create the path to advance and to overcome any turbulence. And in the quarter and in the year, our product line continued to advance, just kept getting stronger. And we continue to invest in Snap-on value creation to make that possible. We believe, in fact, that our product line has never been stronger. And despite the turbulence, we had more million dollar hit products in 2023 than ever before, and we believe we'll move higher again in 2023 than ever before, and we believe we'll move higher again in 2024. Now, let's talk about the full year, the 2023 performance. Sales of $4.7302 billion represented an increase of 5.3% as reported and arrived at 5.6% organically. Opco alone exceeded $1 billion. I'd say that again, $1 billion for the first time, reaching $1.399 billion and our Opco on margin of 22%, 22% represented an average increase, an increase of 110 basis points at gangbusters. We've never been at 22 and 110 is a great increase. And when we include financial services earnings of $270.5 million, the consolidated operating margin for the corporation year was 25.7%, up 80 basis points. Earnings per share with the year were $18.76, rising $1.94 or 11.5%. We believe these are good numbers. Now for an individual - for the individual operation. Now for the individual operating group. So let's start with C&I. Reported sales for the C&I group in the quarter were $363.9 million, up $20.7 million or 6%. That includes $5.5 million from the recent Mountz acquisition, $3.6 million of favorable foreign currency and our organic sales increase of $11.6 million or 3.3%. They all reflecting the strength in critical industries, partially offset by a slide in automotive power tools. C&I's operating income for the period was $54.1 million. It was up 12.9% and the OI margin was 14.9%, rising 90 basis points and overcoming 50 basis points of headwind associated with negative currency. Again in this case, the advance was driven by strong expansion in critical industries. And our increased kitting capacity for complex orders continue to play a large role in that progress, but significant advances also spur as a regular is by new product. Innovations like our recently launched automated tool control or ATC portal, it's the latest addition to our unique Snap-On ATC tool control product lineup. It's manufactured at our AutoCrib operation that was recently acquired in California, and the portal significantly extends the reach of our ATC systems. It enables efficient control over a much wider range of device shapes and sizes. In effect, this portal's a doorway, in line with radio frequency identification or RFID antenna, it's typically a place that enters to tool. Significant assets like hydraulic pumps, portable generators and valuable diagnostic equipment are often stored in common areas in factories or other places and enter a catalog by fixing an RFID tag. As technicians scan the badge is entering with the portal, the system documents the devices will be in and out of the secured stores, keeping close track of these critical items, just like the base ATC system keeps track of hand and power tools moving in and out of the tool storage box, but over a much wider set of areas. We anticipate that the new portal will be a big boost and a great opportunity for C&I in the growing area of tool control, a very important area for us. And in the fourth quarter, we saw some of that potential come to bear. So C&I, mixed progress, challenged with headwinds but clear and overall advancement, great momentum enabled by capacity expansion and by growing product power. Now to the Tools Group. The Tools Group quarter, not at our standard. But we do see a path forward adjusting to the changing environment. As you may remember, this is where we sell to the text. Those who toil the wrenches, punch the touchscreen and those who appear to be wavering in macro confidence and those customers who under these conditions shift to lower payback or quicker payback items. While the fourth quarter reflects our franchisees and the Tools Group pivoting to match that movement, that customer movement. Sales in the quarter were $513.3 million included in our - and they included an organic decrease of 5.7% compared to last year. Now more to our standard, group OI margins were 21.6%, up 20 basis points, overcoming 10 basis points of negative currency and the gross margin percentage rose 200 basis points, nice gains. As the quarter played out, the franchisee sense the change and redirected their ordering and selling focus to match the customer shifts to lower - to faster payback items. And Snap-On is doing the same, defining a way forward, redirecting factory capacity, adopting smaller ticket marketing focus and launching innovative or quicker payback products that fit the environment. State-of-the-art designs, like our new ratchet for a manufacturer to Elizabeth, Tennessee factory. This next evolution in our ratchet line is 102 design, we've named the Synergy series. We believe it's a game changer for technicians, a significant improvement that helps make repair work much easier. The Synergy is a short payback item that will make a clear difference right away, a 15% thinner head, an inch longer handle a 3.5-inch degree swing area, 20% more compact, all for easier access and quicker work in tight corners that they also come up like chassis areas in modern vehicles. Synergy's internal mechanisms were reengineered to engage the primary drag with 10 contact points versus the seventh in the previous design, greatly reducing the chance of slippage, improving the tools reliability and quality even while under maximum loads. Technicians may be uncertain about the way forward, but they're confident about the synergies. They know with the Synergy. They know it will provide a quick payback. It's thinner, longer, stronger. And going forward, we'll expand that new technology - the new 102 technology throughout the Snap-on lineup, and we believe it will quickly become a must-have all across the industry. Also in the quarter, our Algona, Iowa manufacturing facility to reach the new quick payback, KRSC2430, a 36-inch deluxe shop cart with its with smooth mobility and a substantial payload. It offers a technician economic an attractive way to start the tools but it also allows them to position their instruments adjacent to the workplace, increasing productivity, eliminating the time walking to and from the job. As a particularly special feature, the versal lid on this cart serves as a durable workbench when open separates into 2 sections, showing full and easy - allowing full and easy access to the deep 8-inch top compartment that's underneath. The unit also includes a complete power strip where technicians charge their cordless tools, diagnostic platforms, lights and other electronic devices. The innovative cards also configured with two additional jaws. There's kind of two additional drawers underneath the sliding top, providing quick accessibility for essential and small items preventing lost times from treasure hunting and large drawers or small-scale items. And it's a common problem with other units. And so this will really save time for the text. And like our top-of-the-line tool storage boxes, technicians can customize their cart, selecting from an array of colors and trims and so they can project their own personal identity throughout the shop. The KRSC2430 economical storage, attractive features convenient mobility, we expect it will have strong and continuing to appeal in this uncertain environment. And shifting the product focus also requires some repositioning in the factory. Expanding the capacity to match customer preference, we're doing just that, moving to currently popular items, more dedication to short payback to products like our plexin swivel sockets and the new long nose pliers in Milwaukee, additional cart welding, breaking bottlenecks for our economical storage cart options in Algona and doubling down on synergy production in Elizabeth, Tennessee. Finally, our sales teams are being deployed to help franchisees, giving them added energy and more time in selling shorter payback items off their truck. Well, that's the Tools Group. Shifting tech preferences, pivoting operations to ensure the way forward, adapting products, capacity and sales focus, making the most of our strengths in the turbulence. Now for RS&I. The group results confirmed what we've been saying all along, Snap-on is well positioned to support repair shops, dealers and independents and keeping pace with the growing complexity of the car park. RS&I sales in the quarter were $450.8 million, up $12.9 million versus last year, including an organic sales rise of $8.8 million that was authored by volume with vehicle OEM programs for new models and platforms and by strong progress in undercar for both dealerships and independent shops, gains that served to offset the decrease in the big-ticket diagnostic items. RS&I operating earnings for the quarter were $113.3 million, and the operating margin was a still strong 25.1%, but down 20 basis points, reflecting the mix shift to lower-margin under car and OEM facing and the OEM-facing activities. But just like other segments, RS&I advances are driven by new products. And even the aging car park is filled with diverse and ever-changing models. Light-duty trucks and full-size SUVs are bigger than ever requiring a range of wheel configurations and sizes somewhere over 100 pounds. And at the recent repair industry, SEMA show in Las Vegas, we had one of our answers to that challenge on prominent display. Our new automated armored wheeler series wheel balancers, specifically designed for high-volume shops that require precision and reliability made from robust steel for enhanced and rugged durability. Even a small compact footprint, the balancers intelligent operating system uses sonar technologies to automatically measure both the wheel and RIM, eliminating the need for manual intervention, a great time saver in the shop. And for improved safety, the unit also includes heavy-duty pneumatic for us that physicians cumbersome tires on the spindle, making it unnecessary, protects and physically lift or manipulate the heavy assembly, substantially avoiding is the strain. The balancer also includes the high resolution touch screen and an intuitive interface and an effective ergonomic design. It's a powerful combination of accuracy, speed, durability and safety and the SEMA crowd clearly noticed. So that's RS&I. Shop repair remains robust. Vehicle complexity continues to advance abundant opportunities for a great future. The group has abundant opportunities for a great future and our RSI team has the products to take advantage. Well, that's our quarter and our year. For the quarter, sales up 3.5% as reported, 2.2% organically. OI margin reached 21.6%, up 10 basis points, and the EPS was $4.75, rising 7.5% and against the turbulence. The period was marked by extraordinary positives in the critical industry - in the critical industries that are C&I. The Tools Group not reaching our standard, but displaying margin gains and pivoting to match the technician shifting focus and RS&I, enabling both dealerships and independent shops to meet the challenges of higher complexity in new technologies and the full year 2023 sales of $4.7302 billion, up 5.6% organically, an OI of over $1 billion rising 10.5% and OI margin of 22%, an increase of 110 basis points, 110 basis points like that and EPS of $18.76, up $1.94 or 11.5%. It was another encouraging year. Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Thanks, Al. The Snap-on fourth quarter and full year. Geographic variation, shifting customer perspective, growing macro uncertainties, all overcome by Snap-on's ability to wield disadvantages making the most of opportunities, continuing its positive and upward trend now demonstrated over multiple quarters and a significant number of years. The quarter did see the change in technicians perspective. And in pivoting with just the Tools Group volume did not meet our standards, but the tools team did blunt the difficulty with favorable mix and RCI driving improvement of OI margins up 20 basis points with the gross margin rising 200 basis points. The story with repair shop owners and managers was somewhat different. They recognize the need to upgrade and RS&I increase this rise in participation in OEM programs and extended its gains in undercar equipment, particularly in the expanding collision space. And finally, we saw C&I register another quarter of increasing importance to the corporation with the critical industries rising double digits and achieving another leap in margin reaching new margins, reaching new and significant levels. And it all resulted in a fourth quarter advancement against some substantial headwinds. Sales were up 3.5% as reported 2.2% organically. OI margins of 21.6% increased 10 basis points and an EPS of $4.75 rising 7.5%, all representing progress and a time when all was not where we'd like it to be. But I believe the bright-line story in this period is the full year sales for the corporation increased 5.6% organically. Opco OI margin rose 110 basis points, another significant advance and a long line of game reaching 22% for the first time, and the EPS was $18.76 up versus all comparisons.  And it was all offered by some noteworthy performance of the Tools Group, not encountering the smoothest sailing but still achieving an OI margin of 23.6%, an increase of 150 basis points. RS&I, sales up 6.7% organically and an OI margin of 24.3%, up 70 basis points off a strong base. And C&I, facing a landscape of challenges. We're growing 4.2% as reported 5% organically with an OI margin of 15.5%, up 140 basis points against 50 basis points of negative currency. And perhaps the biggest story of all is the emergence of the critical industry business, growing strong double digits in all four quarters demonstrating that we really can roll the Snap-on brand out of the garage at considerable margins. We see the quarter in the year as demonstrating that Snap-on does have multiple run rates for progress. And if one of our segments is challenged, we can still move forward achieving clear and continuing advancement driven by the other parts of the enterprise. And as such, we're encouraged by our presence and by our future. We believe that with our advantages in product, everyone recognizes we know work and we do make tasks easier. In brand, everywhere you go, among the - everywhere you go in the people of work, the Snap-on sign is displayed and spoken up with great pride. And in our people, a team, battle tested, who find the way forward and upwards despite the challenges, the results of 2023 say it so. And we believe, enabled by those advantages, Snap-on will overcome, we'll achieve and will advance continuing the positive trend throughout 2024 and well beyond. Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll address our franchisees and associates. I know they're all listening. I've spoken today with belief and confidence on our current situation on our way forward. I do so principally, but I do so principally because I know the capability and the quality demonstrated over and over by all of you. For your contributions and authoring our achievements, you have my congratulations. For the skills and energy you bring to our corporation every day, you have my admiration. And for the commitment you consistently display for the future of our mutual enterprise, you have my thanks. Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Yes, I think we can. I mean, I think we've done it. We did it We did it in the pandemic era coming out of the pandemic when confidence was kind of still in the tools. If you look at the first four quarters after the pandemic, it was mostly on shorter payback items. So we can make a good business out of that. We made it at the tail end of the financial recession as well. So we think that's the capability. We are simply - as you might say, what we saw coming out of the FFC, everybody was sort of business as usual, pumped up and they were ordering to a general mix of product. And then on late October and November, things started to look a little different to our franchisees, and they wanted to make a pivot because they had been through this rodeo before, and so they wanted to redirect. That's what we're doing. We think we have great things in hand tools and in diagnostics and in tool storage carts and maybe some of the lower lines of tool storage boxes themselves like at the classic series. So we're going to focus on that. That doesn't mean we're going to abandon the bigger ticket items, things like maybe Triton and so on in diagnostics or - which we believe is very strong but - or our boxes. But we're going to shift our focus. And it's important to talk about the capacity, Luke, because remember, we were already kind of bumping up the capacity, and we're fighting to expand it. And so what you want to do in this situation is try to use that expanded capacity in a redirected manner. So we actually have the volumes in the places we think are selling now. So we feel pretty good about that. Our product lineup is good. We've got a good - as I said, product leads the way. We've got a great array of hand tools coming forward. We got new tool boxes, diagnostics, power tools, all those things are going to work for us, we believe. So the way forward is, one, continue to drive the products, make sure we can actually deliver them. And then thirdly, as always, to try to help the franchisees in selling giving them more time to sell - and maybe sometimes it might take a little longer in this situation. So that's why we're deploying our field guys to get out there and provide a little bit more energy and time to the actual selling process. So we think it's a reasonable pivot. This is - again, it's not our first rodeo. It's not the Tools Group's first rodeo. So we think, okay, things have changed a little bit. We know how to respond. Well, yes, you probably see less credit use in that situation. I mean, the originations were \u2013 I think Al was set down 1% in the United States in the quarter. So I mean, I think you see that kind of thing. And if you go back and you look at our numbers, say, coming out of COVID, let's say, quarter three and four of 2020 and first second quarter of 2021, you'll see that kind of phenomenon. So that could be the case. Now this is early days for this. Our people sense it. Well, the good thing about this is our people sensed it right away. And so sensing it, they changed their words that put a little strain on a factory because when you change the orders, it makes the capacity shrink a little bit. So you have those kinds of things. So I believe you may see a little pivoting away from that. Now I think this is right in tune with everything. I do believe, I've said it many times that there is a bifurcation economy that there's a financial economy, the kinds of people that I said in my talk that my remarks that we're talking about the recession is coming and recession is coming and the people are saying we're going to have a soft landing now. But the people at the grass level have a different view of the world. And if you look at the Wall Street Journal, the front page say and the paper position, there's an article saying just this. Actually, I met a bunch of franchisees, and I met a huge number of people in the factories and in garages in places like Conway and Louisville and a little bit in Tennessee and Milwaukee. So and they all kind of say the same thing. They got jobs. They got the cash coming in. But every day they get up and get bad news for breakfast. And you start to wonder about what's going to happen. So it's not that things are bad today, but people worry about how things are going to happen and what's going to happen in the future. And I think all of us looking at the events might say that's true. Actually, yes, I'd offer that - what you're seeing a phenomenon as you're seeing, as Aldo said, some adjustment there. And if you look at \u2013 if you actually look at careful look at C&I, you see they actually had a pop quarter to their traditional customers. But what happens in the power tools business is our new CT9038 came out 18 volt, it sold great, then this happened. And that kept selling, but the bigger ticket items in power tools, like the 18 volts just dropped off and people tended to want the 144 volt. Our supply chains are a little longer for that. We couldn't supply all of that. So you have that kind of situation. But if you look at the Tools Group level, power tools are not down, especially an outstanding amount. It's mostly between the Tools Group and C&I. Okay. No. Pricing, we generally have - except in inflationary, exceptional inflationary times, which we've all been through more or less recently is we get 30 to 40 basis points of pricing, something like that. Most of our advancement basically comes from RCI and new product, which gets its margins. We get our margins for new products. We don't plan changing that approach. We're not really going to make a major adjustment in pricing going forward. This is more about shorter payback versus longer payback. It's the - think of it this way. It's just take a simple thing as a tool storage unit. Okay, you can buy a big epic and boy, they are great. People love them. They bring people up and show them their box, and they say, this is my dream, but that's not a quick payback. That's a longer payback. You got to work a long time and get efficiency from the size of that and the features in that to get a payback. But if you get yourself a cart, you can move from your workplace out into the shop, particularly in some of these independent chefs out into the shop yard or all over the shop. And that gives you immediate savings in time just there. And so that's the kind of thing I'm talking about is that shift to the idea. Is this thing going to pay for me right away, pay me back right away? Wrenches do that, particularly like the synergy I talked about here, which is a leap forward in terms of reliability and access and swing arc and make the jobs easier and able to beat the flat rate faster. So those are the kinds of things we're betting on. We've seen it work before. So I think the good thing about this is Tools Group saw it started to move on. Actually, it's about $113 million. It's $113 million in the year. That's up $5 million to $6 million year-over-year. Yes. Sure. Well, it wasn't a lot of good - being down 5.7% is not a lot of good news to go around. The big kahuna moving downwards was diagnostics. They saw it diagnostics, and we have several ranges of diagnostics and the latest introduced was the soles - it's the low end of - I don't want to say low end, it's the lowest priced version of our product. And that pay in the quarter, not as well as we might have hoped in our situations. But what kind of went down was ZEUS, the top of the line and the next one down to Triton. And ZEUS had been introduced last year in the fourth quarter, so those comparisons around. But the biggest kahuna down was that. And then after that, I think actually Tool storage is up slightly, but all because of cards, pretty much because of carts and shop and tech were down. So, hand tools were down some. But if you looked at it, the thing that - one of the things that drove the margins, I think the important point out of that, Scott, what drove the margin improvement in the Tools Group despite the lower volume was that the stuff they make, the carts at Algona, the tool storage items and the hand tools were a bigger portion of their sales than in prior year - in the prior year. And so that that welded a much greater mix because from hands and what the tools group sells for hand tools and tool storage, they get both distribution and manufacturer margins for things like diagnostics and power tools and shopping tech stuff, they only get the distribution margin. So, there's a pretty big difference between those. So, you can get some pretty good news or bad news depending on how that mix works. You would say it this way. I mean there's - we like to think, Scott, that we could find quicker payback items than everything. Hand tools clearly mostly often, I should say often, our quick payback. The technicians can see quick payback. Certain versions of tool storage, as I've said, the carts in particular, which tend to be substantially cheaper and more efficacious because they're kind of an option to add on to a big box. And then or somebody can't afford a lot and wants to just get a Snap-On tool storage in some way at an affordable level. And then the lower end of that product, the classic series, which we're working on having in terms of in terms of programs coming up, which we've got scheduled for February and March. And so that would be the case. Diagnostics, it all tends to be bigger ticket items. So, there are - there is the sales at the lower end, and we have some - bring out a new diagnostic at some point during the year, which creates interest. But the lower ticket items is just at the bottom end of diagnostics. And then power tools can have I don't want to say big ticket items, but the 18 volts are a little more expensive. 14-volt is a lot more affordable and you tend to have a very focused application for where the 18-volt tends to be broader applications to bring that power to any place whereas the 18 - the 14-volt tend to be saying, I got this problem in this particular chassis area of the car I see, so I'm going to use that 14-volt. So, that tends to be quick payback as well. Those are the kinds of things you see. I don't think so. I mean I think everybody says the business is good. I mean, I don't know. First of all, I have two amps to that. One is the metrics. If you look at the BOL data, that all seems positive. I mean, the miles driven are up in that. It's a long way thing. But the spending on - household spending on repair up 4% year-over-year. That's a pretty good number. The number of tech up 4.5%. I used to be 1%. They're growing at 4.5%. The technician wage is up 7%. So those kinds of things good things and the car park, of course, keeps growing, and so they keep pumping it in. And the auto industry, while this doesn't make a difference too much is starting to come back, and they're still rolling out those new technologies. So all that seems to be from a quantitative point of view seems to be positive. Now the Bureau labor data can trail, so I don't know, and people have questions about that. But then, when you go out in the windshield survey and you talk to not only the people our franchisees who are out there every day, but to talk to the general people who work, they think cash is rolling for them. They're not going to say they're cash rich, but they are. And so I think things look good right now. And I don't expect this to change. No, we don't give guidance. But I think I said like four times in my remarks, they weren't at standard. We expect them to grow. If we don't, if we don't grow, they will be below our expectations. Sure. That's a complicated question because of the situation, you know? I mean, I guess, I don't know. I think this way, though, I'm pretty sure we're doing better because we had in the queue some ability to adjust for shorter payback items in those areas. That's pretty much the way I can answer it. Now what I will tell you is - David, this is an operating guys song is that when you're thinking that you're going to have - you're going to have promotions rolling out of your factories and all of a sudden, your customers come up and, say, never mind, we want to go over here. This tends to create a lot of, shall I say, inefficiencies. And so you have to adjust to that. So I don't think we got the full result the capacities we had hoped the capacity expansions we had hoped to get in the fourth quarter because of those changes, they just optimize what you've added. And so that's part of - that's a factor in all of this. Yes, the backlog for - some of the backlog for tool storage was down. So we liquidated some of that, but we still have backlog in those areas. So it's a complicated answer, I think. You might have some of that. But on the other hand, we couldn't fulfill it as much. We couldn't have liquidated as much as we would have had we had full - had been able to roll in the way we had planned to roll in our production plans coming out of the SFC. I sort of know what it was, and it was better than that in the quarter and for the year, generally is better. This all tends to come out in the wash though - in the long run. But in the fourth quarter, the trucks were not down. We're substantially. They were still down, but not anything like the Tools Group. Yes. Sure. I mean so you would say maybe the - you don't know, but they've kind of liquidated some things. So part of it is delivery - if you pick a particular product and you say a shift to that product, we do have inventory, but the point is sometimes you don't have that product and you have to make changes in the factory, sometimes we couldn't even deliver what they wanted. No. Well, if that was me. I think we usually comment on the kickoffs usually in the first quarter call. But in general, and we tried to shift the kickoff at the last moment for - we took a different approach to kickoffs this time. We saw this problem. We try to concentrate on shorter payback items that seemed to go reasonably okay with those items. And then we established a little more program in February and March, thinking that if we kind of stretch the kickoffs into other months, then we would be able to have better adjustments to the current situation. So that's sort of what we did in the kickoff. I was at one in Las Vegas and turn yes, they usually send me the Deadwood, South North Dakota. This time, I got to go to Las Vegas. And we had the Canadian guys there. That seemed to go okay. They seem to be positive. The franchisees don't seem to be daunted by this. They just report what they see. I don't know. I don't like to - I never like to talk about share. I never talked about share when our numbers were booming upwards, and I don't talk about it now. You could think that, but I don't think so. I think, look, we got - we have - I don't think - I think we're covering the universe with the 3,400-or-so franchisees that we have - so you could argue that some locations might be seeing competition where they haven't. But there are a few locations, David, that don't have any competition. So what does happen sometimes is tough, okay, somebody one or two or three. One of the other competitors will put somebody in place. But that guy, our guy in that territory has already been dealing with people and the other guy has its own competition and it might create more business. But I never hear the franchisees saying that. Why you logically might think that would be the case, and we think about it all the time, and I ask the question all the time, but they almost never say that. In fact, never. No, that's pretty held the same, pretty much the same in the quarter. So franchisees, just in the quarter, we saw more - I think we saw more longer than the Tool guys leave in the quarter, an interesting phenomenon. But that was - that's just a sort of anecdotal view of it. I don't not sure that could make some difference, but I don't think we worry about that in particular in terms of the day-to-day dynamics of the competition. Hi, thanks."

            "content": "Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $1196.6 billion in the quarter represented an increase of 3.5% from 2022 levels, reflecting a 2.2% organic sales gain, $9.1 million of favorable foreign currency translation and $5.5 million of acquisition-related sales. Sales were strong in our businesses serving critical industries this quarter while activity in our automotive repair market was mixed. Consolidated gross margin of 48.3%, including 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to 48.5% last year. Benefits from lower material and other costs and savings from the company's RCI initiatives were offset by the effects of a higher mix of lower sales and lower gross margin businesses. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales improved 30 basis points to 26.7% from 27% last year, primarily due to lower corporate expenses and benefits from higher sales volumes, partially offset by increased investment in personnel and other costs. Operating earnings before financial services of $257.9 million in the quarter, compared to $248 million in 2022. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 21.6%, including 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to 21.5% last year. Financial services revenue of $97.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $88.3 million last year, while operating earnings of $67.9 million compared to $63.9 million in 2022. Consolidated operating earnings of $325.8 million in the quarter compared to $311.9 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 25.2% compared to 25.1% in 2022. Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 21.4% compared to 22% last year, while our full year 2023 tax rate of 22.5% compared to 22.8% last year. Net earnings of $255.3 million or $4.75 per diluted share, reflected an increase of $16.4 million or $0.33 per share from 2022 levels and represented a 7.5% year-over-year improvement in diluted earnings per share. Now let's turn to our segment results for the quarter. Starting with the C&I group on Slide 7. Sales of $363.9 million increased from $343.2 million last year, reflecting an $11.6 million or 3.3% and organic sales gain, $5.5 million of acquisition-related sales and $3.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Organic growth includes a double-digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries, partially offset by a double-digit decline in sales of power tools. With respect to critical industries, sales to the military were robust as was activity in the aviation sector. As previously announced, during the quarter, Snap-on acquired Mountz Inc., a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of high-precision torque tools. The acquisition complements and expands Snap-on's torque offering for a variety of critical industry applications. The operating results of Mountz are reported within the C&I group. Gross margin improved 150 basis points to 39.2% in the fourth quarter from 37.7% in 2022. This was largely due to increased sales volumes and the higher gross margin critical industry sector pricing actions, savings from RCI initiatives and the 30 basis points of benefits from acquisitions. These improvements were partially offset by 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 60 basis points to 24.3% in the quarter from 23.7% in 2022, primarily due to a 30 basis point impact from acquisitions, as well as from investments in personnel and other costs. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $54.1 million, including $1.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $47.9 million last year. The operating margin of 14.9%, including 50 basis points of unfavorable currency effects compared to 14% in 2022, reflecting an improvement of 90 basis points. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $513.3 million compared to $542.7 million a year ago, reflecting a 5.7% organic sales decline partially offset by $1.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic decrease reflects a high single-digit decline in the U.S. business, partially offset by a mid-single digit gain in our international operations. Gross margin improved 200 basis points to 45.2% in the quarter from 43.2% last year. This improvement primarily reflects decreased sales of lower gross margin products, which includes lower sales of items where the Snap-on Tools Group serves as a distributor for products made by our C&I and RS&I groups. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 180 basis points to 23.6% in the quarter from 21.8% in 2022, largely due to the lower sales volume. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $111 million compared to $116.1 million last year. The operating margin of 21.6% compared to 21.4% in 2022. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $450.8 million, compared to $437.9 million in 2022, reflecting a 2% organic sales gain and $4.1 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase includes a high single-digit increase in activity with OEM dealerships and a mid-single-digit gain in sales of undercar equipment. These gains were partially offset by a high single-digit decline in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers. Gross margin was unchanged from last year with benefits from lower material and other costs and savings from RCI initiatives, offset by increased sales and lower gross margin businesses. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 20 basis points to 19.9% from 19.7% last year, primarily reflecting increased personnel and other costs. Operating earnings for the RS&I group of $113.3 million compared to $10.6 million last year. The operating margin of 25.1% compared to 25.3% reported last year. Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services increased $8.9 million to $97.2 million from $88.3 million last year, primarily reflecting the growth of the loan portfolio. Financial services and operating earnings of $67.9 million compared to $63.9 million in 2022. Financial services expenses were up $4.9 million from 2022 levels, including $3.9 million of higher provisions for credit losses. The year-over-year increase in provision reflects both the growth of the portfolio, as well as a return to what we believe to be a more normal pre-pandemic rate of provision. For reference, our gross worldwide extended credit or finance receivable portfolio has increased 8.5% year-over-year, and we believe the delinquency and portfolio performance trends currently remain stable. In the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022, the respective average yield on finance receivables were 17.8% and 17.6%. In the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022, the average yield on contract receivables were 8.9% and 8.6%, respectively. Total loan originations of $33.1 million in the fourth quarter represented an increase of $3.4 million or 1.1% from 2022 levels. Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $2.5 billion of gross financing receivables with $2.2 billion from our U.S. operation. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.8% for U.S. extended credit was up from 1.6% in 2022, but was the same as in the pre-pandemic period of 2019. On a sequential basis, the rate is up 30 basis points, reflecting the seasonal uptick we typically experience between the third and fourth quarters. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $50.4 million, represented 2.59% of outstandings at quarter end, which compares to 2.51% as reported at the end of last quarter. Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $296.9 million in the quarter, represented 114% of net earnings and compared to $210.6 million last year. The improvement as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, largely reflects lower year-over-year increases in working investment, which included a reduction in inventory in 2023 as well as higher net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $104.6 million included $42.6 million for acquisitions, net additions to finance receivables of $42.2 million and capital expenditures of $21.1 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $149 million included cash dividends of $98 million, and the repurchase of 217,000 shares of common stock for $60.9 million under our existing share repurchase program. As of year-end, we had approximately $22.9 million of common stock under our existing authorizations available for repurchase. Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $29.6 million from 2022 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 60 days compared to 61 days as of 2022 year-end. Inventories decreased $27.2 million from 2022 year-end. And on a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.3% compared to 2.5% at year-end 2022. Our year-end cash position of $1.15 billion compared to $757.2 million a year in 2022. Our net debt to capital ratio of 3.8% compared to 9% at year-end 2022. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $900 million available under our credit facilities. As of year-end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance, and I'll briefly review a few outlook items for 2024. We expect that capital expenditures will be in the range of $100 million to $110 million. In addition, we currently anticipate that our full year 2024 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 22% to 23%. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? So in some ways, there's another buffer stock in between the tools maintained its own levels of inventory. So you're right, simply the Tools Group had less need to buy as much in power tools and diagnostics in the quarter. It doesn't mean necessarily that that flows onto one through the demand because you have inventories in between, both inventories at demand itself and the inventories in the hands of the Tools Group. But you have lower sales from C&I and from RS&I to the Tools Group, reflects actually pretty much power tools and diagnostic related products. So we had lower spending in the quarter on legal expenses in particular. We had a favorable settlement on a matter. So it was able to reduce our expenditures in the quarter. But the run rate for corporate expenses is running in a typical fashion. $113 million versus $1.08 million. You see the receivables, the originations were down, and that was more than offset by contract receivables. And similar to the results of the Tools Group, EC originations in the United States were down more than what we saw internationally. It was actually up in terms of EC originations. So that kind of gives you some of the blend. Actually, I was pleased to say, I know you're asking, David, actually, in the quarter, there's less than what would be the typical mix of what we call transfers, RA transfers where they transfer items from the revolving accounts over to EC. There's actually less of an effect of that. But for the full year, it's very consistent with where we expect it to be. So there's been no signs of franchisees using the credit company to finance their operations by moving things from their revolving accounts across I think that's what you're after. If you think about what we said, people are lacking confidence to some degree for big-ticket items. I don't think the way hold is to discount the interest rate you're going to charge those to provoke a sale. So we're not into the - discounting isn't usually our style. It doesn't mean we might not come up with creative promotions and bundling and things like that. But I don't think discounting is the way."

As usual, I'll start by covering the highlights of the quarter, and then I'll provide an update on our general environment and the trends we see. Aldo will then give you a detailed review of the financials.  Speaking about the last three months, I can say without question or qualification, we are once again encouraged fortified by the progress along our runways both growth and improvement. We encountered headwinds and we engaged challenges in a number of geographies still we capitalized on our opportunities, wielding our advantage and overcame the potential for disruption.  The franchising network remain resilient generating positive gains through a broad and sharp rise in critical industries expanding what is now a consistent upward trajectory enabled by the confluence of our robust market of growing product lines and an effective expansion of capacity in that business. And that progress was pretty evident in our numbers.  They speak for themselves. Reported sales were $1,159 million, up 5.2% from last year, a 4.7% organic rise and $4.4 million in favorable foreign currency effects with growth in every segments. This represents our 13th quarter, well, above pre-pandemic levels. OpCo income, OI before financial services were up 9.7%, reaching $245.2 million, OpCo operating margin rose 90 basis points to 21.2% with higher sales volumes, the benefits of great new products and the ongoing efficiencies of a rapid continuous improvement or RS&I more than offsetting up 50 basis points, a bad news from unfavorable foreign currency effects, 21.2% and 90 basis points. Nice.  The operating income for our financial services operation grew $69.4 million from the $66.4 million last year, a 4.5% improvement and the result - and that result combined with the OpCo performance to raise our consolidated operating margins to 25.1%, a 70 basis point rise from 2022. And EPS, EPS was $4.51. reflecting a 37 or 8.9% increase above last year. Strong.  Well those are the numbers. Once again strong signifying our corporation\u2019s continuing advance. You see, we again believe that Snap-on is stronger now than at any time in our history and the results they say it so.  Now let's review the markets. In vehicle repairs, key metrics continue to be favorable. The average age of vehicles on the road continuing to rise and in turn the number of techs in the garages, in the garage is growing high to high mid-single-digits maintaining consistently positive trends period-over-period, period-over-period. That's clearly upward.  Technician wages are robust and continuing to climb. So the market is favorable and the metrics back it up. But more than the quantitative evidence, you get the feeling of optimism potential when you speak with technicians.  Recently, I had a chance to visit with our customers\u2019 franchises and mechanics in New York. And I'm here to tell you the enthusiasm they displayed in the industry and the confidence they expressed in their future was something else. It was contagious. Even in this time of turbulence, the message was clear. They see opportunity and they're looking for more, more innovative solutions, that will increase productivity and take advantage of that potential.  And their confidence on the way forward is palpable. And we believe they see Snap-on products, brands and people as the best way to ensure that positive future. Vehicle repair is a strong market. We see this confirmed throughout the franchisee network in North America and in our international operations. It's one of the reasons we've expanded capacity.  We believe our franchisees and our technicians have never been more prosperous. It all makes sense. The car park is increasingly requires more repairs or greater complexity and our customers, the techs are major participants in that reality. They need - and they need new tools to follow the opportunity. Snap-on is positioned to take full advantage of that possibility.  Another important sector for us is the vehicle repair shop owners or managers. These are people who stand right next to the techs, but they buy at different cadences. This is where repairs systems and information group or S&I operates every day with advantage. The vehicle park is changing. The shops have to keep with the upswing model-by-model, new challenges, new challenges that they have to navigate.  Electronics to support more features. Automotive systems that enhance driver safety. New body materials to increase durability and reduce weight. Network of sensors to anticipate traffic and road conditions. No power trains. Enhanced internal combustion engines. EVs and plug-in hybrids and the conserved energy and on and on and on. Each of these, each of these trends creates opportunity for garages and they know it. But they also know it requires new more sophisticated equipment. The opportunity - that opportunity we see shines right through political uncertainty or economic turbulence.  We see, though that underneath every day when we call on the garages new software to guide repairs or manage the shop. Essential programs to accommodate either sequences of new vehicles, calibration protocols and advanced systems for sensor rays, advanced under car equipment to accommodate the precision - that the precision that supports efficient driving.  And we see the shop owners and managers are eager to take advantage of those trends Snap-on has the hardware and software to enable that pursuit bringing to shops and the results in our C&I are confirming the strength of that market and our strong position in it.  Finally, let\u2019s discuss the critical industries. This is where we extend outside the garage solving tasks that that really matter. This is where commercial industrial or C&I lives. And where much more international activity happens. This is the arena of critical applications, space declarations, wind power maintenance, subsea mining, smelting that exceeds 2300 degrees Fahrenheit, the mobilization of first responders. All critical environments where the penalty for rearview was high and the need for repeatability and reliability often requires custom tools engineered for a single purpose. In other words, tasks that require a Snap-on solution.  Just like in previous quarters, the market is booming. Momentum in multiple sectors like the military, general industry, aerospace, heavy-duty and aviation. Of course, do just see variations from geography-to-geography, this is an international business. Areas impacted by external factors that create disruptions in Europe, with the uncertainty associated with the Ukraine war in Asia where the remnants of the pandemic are still pretty apparent; there's turbulence in China and the weakening of currencies these days are impacting particular countries.  But overall, the critical industries are robust offering us significant potential for taking advantage and making significant gains. And in the quarter, we did just that. So our markets are resilient and are on a positive trajectory and we believe that our runways for growth will present clear and abundant opportunities as we move forward enhancing the franchise network, expanding where repair shop owners and managers extending to those critical industries. And building and emerging markets.  Rising - rising and going forward by leveraging our broadening product line, wielding our strengthening brand, and deploying the increasing understanding of the work that is the hallmark of the Snap-on team. That's the markets.  Now, let's turn to the segments. In the C&I group, third, quarter sales reached $266.4 million, up $9.6 million, which includes $1.6 million in unfavorable currency effects and an organic sales growth of 3.2% above last year. From an earnings perspective, C&I's operating income was $58.1 million, up 11.1% double-digits including $2.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency. And the operating margin was 15.9%, an increase of 120 basis points overcoming 70 basis points of negative currency.  We did have some variation across the group - across the group business units with substantial gains in industrial vision offsetting declines in Asia operations. But as usual, the C&I rise showed the power of our Snap-on value creation, particularly on customer connection, innovation authoring great new products, solutions that make critical tasks easier, like our new CT9038 power tool.  We talked about this. We talked about this to a last quarter saying the franchisees were waiting for its launch. Well it was worth the wait. It's a special to0l. A three eight inch drive, 18 volt impact unit that, that, that offers compact housing measuring only five inches long. That's why we call it the stubby. The unique silhouette is made possible by engineering the overall housing mechanism to stabilize the electric motor rather than the standard approach of adding a whole independent structure to support the drive components.  It's an innovation that reduces overall body dimensions allowing users to navigate really tight spaces and believe me, that's an attractive advantage for engine and suspension work on newer vehicles. And it does that while still delivering 520 foot pounds of bolt break away torque, power capable of busting with even the most stubborn of seized and seized fasteners. It's what you would expect from Snap-on.  It's an ergonomically balanced - it's ergonomically balanced, greatly reducing user fatigue. It's equipped with a super bright LED light to clearly illuminate the workplace. It also offers three torque settings and forward and reverse and includes a variable speed trigger enabling techs to apply just that necessary force avoiding the fastener damage that you know, often can happen in tight spaces.  The September launch was a big way oversubscribed. Clear testimony to the appreciation of the stubby\u2019s compact power and it's still showing great momentum. The orders remain very strong. It was worth wait.  C&I product is encouraging. But there's another story in the group. Our industrial division, extending the Snap-on brands to the critical industries. We've said in the past that the opportunity was there. Always needed was more capabilities to deliver. Well it played out just that way. We did add capacity for kidding and it drove results. Expansion came to the fall of the last year. And this past period was the third straight quarter of clear double-digit growth in the critical industries.  And that was what's strong margins. Gangbusters, gangbusters margins, gangbusters growth. It overcame the C&I challenge in Eastern Europe and Asia. And we believe we have much more room to run in the critical - in the critical industry's arena. So we're adding more capability in that business right now to take full advantage.  Let's C&I substantial challenges overcome by strong products and expanded capacity to drive upward in the critical industries and there's more to come.  Now on to the tools group. Sales line was up organically 3.7% over last year, reaching $515.4 million in the quarter. That's finished with great in a quarter, that finished with great momentum. And the Group's operating income continue to move strongly upward to $113.4, million, and 11% increase, double-digit increase over 2022 levels. Another in a series of those double-digit increases for the tools group and the operating margin was \u2013 it was 22% up 140 basis points from last year and that rise and \u2013 that considerable rise was achieved overcoming 50 basis points of unfavorable currencies, - a great quarter for the profitability and growth.  Now, the third quarter is when we hold our annual Snap-on franchisee conference what call is the SFC. This year the event was a net show with 9,000 people attending, franchisees, guests and of course, Snap-on team all participating in the, in a weekend of special - in a great weekend. It was a weekend of special training. Hands-on encounters with our massive product line and for some fun - for some fun, special Snap-on celebrations, they're really good.  The attendees had the opportunity to spend time ordering directly from the tool exit expo floor. And I am happy to say orders were up again this year, which is and that exposed spanned a space of over three football fields where our entire portfolio of products was on display, but it had a wide array of demonstrations and that was specially designed to showcase the Snap-on performance advantage.  The conference also provided a number training sessions, helping franchisees expand their business. Seminars and special breakouts, highlighting our product features and unique advantages in critical categories like power tools and diagnostics and we topped off that multi-day event. This is, these are the celebrations with a - of coach buses transporting the teams to downtown Nashville for unique Snap-on\u2019s evening.  Boom, shakalaka was the word of the day with another memorable SFC and sightful, education, great, new products, and a special fellowship, a special fellowship that reinforces our unique bond with our franchisees. From my perspective, our van drivers at Nashville spoke enthusiastically about their current businesses and radiated firm confidence in their future with Snap-on. And if you were there, you would have seen it too.  During the tool expo, franchisees were able to spend time interacting with some of the new innovative products derived from our customer connections inside game, directly in the workplace handles were big at the SFC and in the quarter and the demand was driven by special new products like our 12 millimeter 6.6. meter Duramax glow plug socket.  This product was inspired by a franchisee observing the technicians removing blocking components one-by-one from a diesel vehicle, fender of special intake lines in steering shifts. These items create access barriers increasing the difficulty of executing the very basic repair of just changing diesel glow plugs, a routine test that that was made difficult because of our crowded engine compartment design with minimal regard for servicing.  We listened to the franchisee feedback, went to work designed - and new socket longer than the standard to reach the glow plugs from a distance. And with a flex mechanism that guide around the blockers, making - making it unnecessary to remove them. Technicians immediately recognize the considerable time savings that - it made the new sockets very popular.  It's another customer connection that transforms a laborious process, making more easier, freeing time and increasing tech capacity and therefore tech income.  Also on display was another Display was another example of customer connection, the new FHC 72MPRR, these product terminations are mouthful. Triples but it's a we call it a triple function ratchet. Three tools in one. Again, born out of customer connection directly in the worst place. First the ratchet head can be secured parallel to the handle serving as an traditional ratchet.  Next, the head can be adjusted to take any one of 16 available positions, 240 degrees around the handle centerline enabling the tool to work while reaching around obstacles. Finally, the unit can be placed in a free spin mode providing the tech with 360 degrees in continuous rotation, greatly reducing work time in low torque situations.  Our customers, the technicians again saw the great benefit of that improved productivity and that recognition made the triple function ratchet a million dollar hit product in just the first month of selling. It was another win for customer connection and a driver for the tools group. The tools group proves a third quarter achievement and momentum fueled by customer connection, innovative insight, anchoring great new products. And with the group\u2019s continuous dedication to Snap-on value creation, we believe the hits in the progress will just keep on comments. Turning to RS&I. Sales of $431.8 million in the third quarter were up as reported by 4.2% with an organic improvement of 3.1%, expansions in the undercar equipment and our diagnostics and information portfolio continued to offset the OEM businesses where - which finished down slightly in a traditionally lumpy arena.  OI for RS&I was $104.9 million, up 10%, again double-digits from 2022 and the operating margins was 24.3% represent - which represented an improvement of 130 basis points again against 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency. We've great confidence in our RSI business. Our customers and industries, partners feel the same, and that confidence was demonstrated in the latest public recognitions.  Recently Motor Magazine shows our Zeus Plus fast track intelligent diagnostic platform as a top tool in 2023. Our premium handheld unit was recognized for simplifying the repairs, guiding technicians through the troubleshooting procedures avoiding unnecessary steps along the way and improving solution, accuracy, and most importantly, reducing the time to identify the proper fit. The Zeus Plus is the top of the line for vehicle repair and the publications know it recognizing our handhelds for our handheld new prominent bright screen, increasing the ease of use in direct sunlight.  It's faster processor with more onboard memory enabling greater task efficiency, and it's improved lab scope making component testing much more accurate and when professional tools and equipment knows ask this readers to choose the best new tools as recipients of that publication's People's Choice awards the tech selected seven Snap-on products led the Zeus Plus. The Zeus Plus top of the line indeed. Hardware, software, shaped by customer connection, another and a long line of distinctive and decisive RS&I products driving the group upwards and onwards.  We're quite positive about RS&I\u2019s possibilities with repair shop owners and managers as the vehicle industry evolves and the quarter supports that confidence.  So those are the highlights of the quarter. Continued strong progress. The 13th straight quarter above pre-pandemic levels. C&I margins up year-over-year volume growth and strong, strong OI margins. The tools group, great products, confident franchisees and strong momentum. RS&I under car repair information activity leading the charge enabling the repair shops in the challenges in today's vehicles.  And the overall corporation sales up 5.2% as reported 4.7% organically. OpCo operating margin 21.2% up 90 basis points, overcoming 50 basis points of currency headwinds and an EPS to $4.51 rising 8.9% versus last year. It was an encouraging quarter.  Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? \nAldo Pagliari : Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $1,159.3 million of the quarter represented an increase of 5.2% from 2022 levels, reflecting a 4.7% organic sales gain and $4.4 million of favorable foreign currency translation.  Organic sales growth was balanced across all three of our operating segments and from a geographic perspective, we experienced year-over-year gains in North and South America, as well as Europe. Asia continue to be attenuated by weakness in China and Japan, the latter hampered by a depreciating Yen.  Consolidated growth margin improved 160 basis points to 49.9% from 48.3% last year as gross margins expanded across all of our operating segments. Contributions from increased sales volume with pricing actions, lower material and other costs and benefits to the companies RCI initiatives were partially offset by 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.  Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales rose 70 basis points to 28.7% from 28% last year, primarily due to increased investment in personnel, and other costs. Operating earnings before financial services of $245.2 million in the quarter compared to $223.5 in 2022. As a percentage of net sales, operating larger before financial services of 21.2% including 50 basis points of unfavorable currency effects, reflects an expansion of 90 basis points over last year.  Financial services revenue of $94.9 million in the third quarter of 2023 compared to $87.3 million last year, while operating earnings of $69.4 million compared to $66.4 million in 2022. Consolidated operating earnings of $314.6 million in the quarter, compared to $289.9 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 25.1% reflects an improvement of 70 basis points from 2022.  Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 22.6%, compared to 21.6% last year. Net earnings of $243.1 million dollars or $4.51 per diluted share, including an $0.08 per share impact from unfavorable foreign currency, reflected an increase of $19.2 million and $0.37 per share from 2022 levels, and represented an 8.9% year-over-year improvement in diluted earnings per share.  Now let's turn to our segment results for the quarter. Starting with C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $366.4 million dollars increased from $356.8 million last year reflecting $11.2 million or 3.2% organic sales gain which was partially offset by $1.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Organic growth includes a double-digit gain in sales to customers and critical industries, partially offset by a double-digit decline in the segment to Asia Pacific operations.  With respect to critical industries, sales to the military were robust as was activity in the aviation sector. Overall C&I organic sales to external customers were up 7.1% for the quarter. Gross margin improved 210 basis points to 39% in the third quarter from 36.9% in 2022. This was largely due to increased sales volumes in the higher gross margin critical industry sector, pricing actions and benefits from RCI initiatives.  These improvements were partially offset by 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 90 basis points to 23.1% in the quarter, from 22.2% 2022, primarily due to increased sales and higher expense businesses and investments in personnel and other costs.  Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $58.1 billion, including $2.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $52.3 million last year. The operating margin of 15.9%, including 70 basis points of unfavorable currency effects, compared to 14.7% in 2022, reflecting an improvement of 120 basis points.  Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on tools group of $515.4 million compared to $496.6 million a year ago, reflecting a 3.7% organic sales gain and $500,000 of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales growth reflects a double-digit gain in our international operations and a low-single-digit increase in our US business.  Gross margin improved 140 basis points to 46.3% in the quarter from 44.9% last year. This increase is primarily due to higher sales volumes and pricing actions and benefits from RCI initiatives, partially offset by 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales was unchanged from last year with benefits from higher volumes offset by increased personnel and other costs.  Operating earnings for the Snap-on tools group of $113.4 million including $2.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $102.2 million last year. The operating margin of 22% includes 50 basis points of unfavorable currency, compared to 20.6% in 2022 reflecting an improvement of 140 basis points.  Turning to the RS&I group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $431.8 million compared to $414 million in 2022 reflecting a 3.1% organic sales gain and $4.8 million of favorable, foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase includes a high-single-digit gain in sales of undercar equipment and a low-single-digit increase in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers.  These gains were partially offset by a low-single-digit decline in activity with OEM dealerships where we often see variability in essential tool programs from period-to-period. Gross margin improved 260 basis points to 45.5% from 42.9% last year, mostly due to lower material and other costs and increase sales volumes and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales went up by 130 basis points to 21.2% from 19.9% last year, primary reflecting increased personnel and other costs. Operating earnings for the RS&I group of $104.9 million compared to $95.4 million last year. The operating margin improved 130 basis points to 24.3% from 23% reported last year.  Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services increased $7.6 million to $94.9 million from $87.3 million last year, primarily reflecting the growth of the loan portfolio. Financial services, operating earnings of $69.4 million compared to $66.4 million in 2022. Financial Services expenses were up $4.6 million from 2022 levels, including $4 million of higher provision for credit losses.  The year-over-year increase of provisions reflects both the growth of the portfolio, as well as a return to what we believe to be a more normal pre-pandemic rate of provision. Sequentially, the provision for credit losses decreased by about $500,000. For reference, our gross worldwide extended credit or finance receivable portfolio has increased 9.3% year-over-year and we believe that delinquency in portfolio performance trends currently remains stable.  In both the third quarters of 2023 and 2022, the respective average yield on finance receivables was 17.7%. In the third quarters of 2023 and 2022 average yields on contract receivables were 8.8% and 8.6% respectively. Total loan originations of $305.2 million in the third quarter represented an increase of $5 million or 1.7% from 2022 levels, including a 4% increase in originations of finance receivables.  Moving to Slide 11, our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.4 billion of gross financing receivables with $2.1 billion from our US operation. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.5% for US extended credit is the same as it was in this period last year. On a sequential basis, the rate is up 20 basis points reflecting the seasonal trend we typically experience in the third quarter.  As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $47.9 million represented 2.51% of outstandings at quarter end, which is up slightly from the 2.45% reported at the end of last quarter.  Now, turning to Slide 12, cash provided by operating activities of $285.4 million in the quarter represented 115% of net earnings when compared to $129.9 million last year. The improvement as compared to the third quarter of 2022, largely reflects lower year-over-year increases of working investment, as well as higher net earnings.  Net cash used by investing activities of $59.7 million included net additions to finance receivables of $35.1 million and capital expenditures of $25.1 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $135.3 million included cash dividends of $85.6 million and the repurchase of 194,000 shares of common stock for $51.8 million under our existing share repurchase programs.  As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $304.5 million of common stock under our existing authorizations.  Turning to Slide 13, trade and other accounts receivable increased $15.1 million from 2023 events. Net sales outstanding of 60 days compared to 61 days as of 2022 year end. Inventory decreased $200,000 from 2022 year end. On a trailing 12 month basis, inventory turns to 2.4 compared to 2.5 at year end 2022. Our quarter end cash position of $959.3 million, compared to $757.2 million at year in 2022. Our net debt to capital ratio of 4.8% compared to 9% at year 2022.  In addition to cash, we expected cash flow from operations, we entered into a five year $900,000 multi-currency revolving credit facility on September 12, which amends and restates our previous $800 million facility. As at quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding.  That concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. But briefly review a few outlook items for the remainder of 2023. We anticipate the capital expenditures will approximate $100 million. In addition we currently anticipate that our full year 2023 effective income tax rate will approximate 23%.  I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? \nNicholas Pinchuk: Thanks, Aldo. Well, that's our third quarter. You know, I always say as the third quarter could be somewhat squirrely, not always indicative of trends. That's because of the SFC and the vacation seasons around the world. But having said that, the last three months haven\u2019t been encouraging. We took on some significant headwinds, the war in the Ukraine, and the uncertainly in China, both politically and economically.  We engaged those challenges came through at all with clear progress. New heights across the board. Continuing our - it all, continue our upward trajectory movement, the upward conjecture we've been on for some time. We spoken quite a bit about capacity constraints, first in the industrial business and later in the tools group, born of the increasing demand for our solutions.  And in this quarter, we clearly see the power of such expansions wielded by capable of experienced team enabled by decisive advantages, and products, and brands and applied in markets that are critical and resilient even amidst the challenges. The industrialization is performing as we said it would. Clear double-digit growth and strong profitability now, demonstrated for three straight quarters as its new capacity has come online.  And the tools groups starting to see the very early effects of that capacity propulsion closing out the quarter with great momentum and with significant rises in overall profitability. At RS&I, not capacity bound, but establishing a strong and profitable position in the repair shops with software strength like our Mitchell 1 systems, diagnostic ascendance like our decorated Zeus Core to Intel and by clear answers to challenges of repair complexity up and down the under car equipment line, continuing the steep upward trend in that broad product arena.  This was an encouraging quarter. You can see it in the results. C&I sales up 3.2% organically, external sales, particularly robust. Significant gains in critical industry overcoming the uncertainty of Europe and Asia. OI margin of 15.9% up 120 basis points against 70. Again, 70 basis points of unfavorable currency. The tools group sales was up organically 3.7% close to target exiting the quarter with momentum as the expansion start to help and an OI margin of 22%, up 140 basis points. Again overcoming 50 basis points of currency headwinds.  In RS&I, sales rising 3.1%, OI rising 10% and the OI margins reaching 24.3%, an uplift of 130 points. And all drove the corporation higher. Sales were up 4.7% organically. Overall OpCo operating margins were 21.2%, a gain of 90 basis points, 90 basis points against 50 basis points a bad currency and all of that drove an EPS of $4.51, up versus every comparison.  And we believe that with our decisive and widening advantages in product, the Snap-on value creation process, customer connection and innovation, people keep - will keep rolling out powerful new products day after day. Our advantages in brands Snap-on remains the outward sign of pride and dignity that working men and women take in their profession.  Everybody knows it's true and advantages in people. Our battle tested and capable team people that expect to rise even against difficulties. With those advantages amplified by capacity investments and applied to resilience and critical markets we believe that our enterprise will rise on a clear and continuing positive trajectory through the remainder of the year on into 2024 and well beyond.  Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. My friends, this was an encouraging quarter. It was hard one against significant turbulence and it was driven by your constant dedication and effort. For the success in our third quarter delivered by your hands, you have my congratulations.  For the extraordinary capability you bring to bear every day and every situation, you have my admiration. And for the unwavering confidence you consistently express and clearly demonstrate in the future of our enterprise and our team, you have my thanks.  Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Brad Jordan at Jeffries. Please go ahead. \nPatrick Buckley: Hey, good morning guys. This is Patrick Buckley on for Brad. Thanks for taking our questions. \nNicholas Pinchuk: Sure. \nPatrick Buckley: Last quarter, you guys called out the demand exceeding capacity in a few tools product lines. Did you see that mix mismatch balance out this quarter? Or has some of the trends persisted there? \nNicholas Pinchuk: Yeah. Well, like, I think I \u2013 what I was trying to say in my remark is that it got better through the quarter. We started to get some of the value with the capacity expansions. We\u2019re starting to get the early effects of those things. So you saw some of that start to balance out, but it's still there. We expected to continue to - but those capacity expansions to continue helping us going forward.  But it's kind of the same thing. When we have these capacity constraints and they were principally in hand tools and in the tools group, there were at hand tools and in and tool storage as the quarter, we see them ease a little bit, but they're not where we want them to be. They're going to be, yes. \nPatrick Buckley: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And then, within your OEM dealership customer base, you guys will \u2013in that RS&I business you called out some weakness and lumpiness. Is overall demand pretty healthy there or what exactly is the driver? \nNicholas Pinchuk: Demand is pretty healthy on a relative basis. I mean, the thing is what these businesses what this business referred to is, these are projects, programs authored or commissioned by OEMs principally to deal with the idiosyncrasies of a changing environment or with a new vehicle. Maybe it needs a new trailer hitch adjustment because something wasn't anticipated or a different tool to take out the wiring harness or maybe to support vehicle charging stations that dealerships once because electric vehicles are coming on or maybe for a special.  And what it is, is the OEM ask us to configure the product and then distribute it to its dealerships. And, that\u2019s been going upwards. But it is lumpy, it's big project, that's a big project that's good product. So if you get, x number of men in one quarter and you get x minus one in another quarter is a little bit of pressure on that. In this situation, the, the EQS business was down somewhat.  Well, I think low-single-digits or something like that, but it was really last year it has risen tremendously associated with the fuselage of new models that are rolling out into the markets. And so this is down somewhat versus a pretty strong position. So it just reflects kind of some lumpiness along the surface for that business and that\u2019s created some offset to C&I. For RS&I. \nPatrick Buckley: Got it. That's helpful. That's all for us. Thanks guys. \nNicholas Pinchuk: Sure. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Please go ahead. \nGary Prestopino: Hey, good morning everyone. \nNicholas Pinchuk: Good morning, Gary. \nGary Prestopino: Nick, can you - you said that the orders coming out of the conference were strong. I mean, could you give us some idea of some metrics to surround that? I mean, was it one of \u2026 \nNicholas Pinchuk: Yeah, sure. They were up mid-single-digits. So, this is a nice we like this kind of thing because it shows we're going to keep growing in that sort of range we expect to grow. It's been upward during the pandemic, it have been up more higher at some points. But generally mid-single-digit growth is pretty good for us. We were kind of very encouraged by that idea. You know, you got to remember though Gary, as you know very well, these things are just orange. You know, they are orders. They are not necessarily sales and those orders are spread out over six months or seven months.  So it's hard to correlate them to anything in particular, but having said that, having orders up mid-single-digits is better than a poking an eye with a sharp stick. You know, it's okay. We kind of like that. \nGary Prestopino: Right. Okay. And then, just a question just in terms of, as we go forward as the car park gets older, but you're starting to get more of a proliferation of older cars with technology where does your emphasis go at that point? Does it more of a shift from hand tools to increased diagnostics? Specialized diagnostics for these cars? Or is that just or maybe you can give us some guidance there? \nNicholas Pinchuk: The thing is, is that you would think that would be logical. I would. Yeah, for sure, it bodes greater emphasis on electronics and software and other highly - high tech things like calibrations and things like that, which are the words of the day, then they are now, and then you are going to see a continuing upswing of that investment and the capability and value and revenue and profit generated by that stream.  But I'm not so sure that hand tools will be attenuated, because as we look backwards, you know we remember this industry in the 90s where the number of trouble codes, electronic trouble codes on a car were measured in dozens. Now they're measured in tens of thousands and the demand for handle tools is only going up.  So I would, I'm not so sure that hand tools will be lessened. I believe that software and electronics and diagnostics and calibration will be increased. That's what I would say. Now, by the way, the hand tools are pretty good margin. But it\u2019s hard to predict those, because like I try to explain and explain since I was putting out with the diesel plug, gold plug sockets and the triple flex function in ratchet.  Really these are things that are observed after the cars on road and you see the struggles that the technicians are having and you would enable them. And so I would anticipate they will continue to be in demand as we go forward. We haven't seen any abatement of that demand even as we've seen a growth in the electronics and calibration business. \nGary Prestopino: Okay. And then, just a question for Aldo, just on the tax rate, Aldo, I think you have kind of said and have the numbers in front of me, but your tax rate for this year would be between 23% and 24% on previous calls. Now you\u2019ve stepped it down to 23%. But to get to that kind of a tax rate for the year, you're going to have to be somewhere over 24% for Q4. Am I reading that, right? \nAldo Pagliari : That will be the neighborhood actually of - I think our rate year-to-date it\u2019s put them all together is around 22.9% or something like that. So we are in the ballpark area. So I think it'll be in that neighborhood in Q4 We've had some favorable outcomes on reducing our state taxes along with some other items. But that's what benefited Q3. In order to Q3 last year it was even better. So sometimes there's variation that occurs from time to time. But 23% is about the right number I think we're going to get to this upcoming full year. \nGary Prestopino: Okay.\nNicholas Pinchuk: Actually you are looking over a year we had you know kind of a - what 6,7,5,6 cents impact for taxes year over year each quarter. Negative impact. Yeah, so we still were up 8.9% even with the $0.37 even when that $0.06 impact. \nGary Prestopino: Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from David McGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. \nDavid McGregor: Yeah. Good morning, everyone. \nNicholas Pinchuk: Hi, David. \nDavid McGregor: Hey, Nick. I just wanted to ask you about the UAW strikes and any potential impact or re precautionary decision across the business. You talked already about the dealership business and you characterized as being lumpy, but I'm wondering just maybe OEMs told you to hit the brakes on that. Well, they are sorting the strike issues and then there was any followed on the tool segment as well? \nNicholas Pinchuk: Yeah, that's a complicated. Look, it's hard to predict, of course, this is like shooting darts in the dark or something. But, look, I think I think this is the situation. First of all, I want to correct just a little bit. The dealership business itself was not down. The OEM programs were down some, but they were still at a relatively historically high levels even though they backed off a little bit, year-over-year. So we haven't seen what I would call a significant pullback in the OEM programs at this point. Having said that, the OES, the UAW strike, I used to work for the auto companies themselves, and they are cash monsters, you know, they eat cash like mad and so it could happen as the strike goes on longer, you could see some diminishment in that business, in that particular business.  Now, when that would hit, I'm not so sure because, they might not cancel programs. They must just delay some or they may they may in fact cancel future programs. Not so clear how they would play out. But it is a possibility that that would happen. Regarding the dealerships themselves, I don't necessarily \u2013 I think the effect on them is unknowable because sometimes if they don't get new cars, they just turn more attention to repair and parts.  And so this is good news for us. Sometimes they pull in the back down the hatches and reduce. But generally I think they tend to look at more at repair and parts if they don't get the new cars and that's not so bad. So I see that as being the two possibilities playing out. \nDavid McGregor: Right. Okay, thanks for that. And then, just back to your earlier observation with the SFC order book was up 5% to mid-single-digit. \nNicholas Pinchuk: I think it\u2019s 5, to kind of mid-single. \nDavid McGregor: No you said mid-single. \nNicholas Pinchuk: Right. \nDavid McGregor: Right. Single-digit minus \u2013 I apologize. \nNicholas Pinchuk: Sure.\nDavid McGregor: I'm just trying to sort of reconcile that with some of the capacity challenges you're facing which are clearly improving, but it sound like they'll still be somewhat of an issue in 4Q. Do you see more of the fulfillment on that order growth being channeled into sort of 4Q and maybe on a year over basis than what you would seen a year ago when there wasn't that kind of an impediment in place? And there was a consequent you might see a little bit of incremental growth from that concentration in 4Q? \nNicholas Pinchuk: I guess. I don't know, I think I'm not quite sure I understood exactly the import of your question, David. But, but the thing is, the way I see it is, the capacity is getting better. Even if you have the building up, you can start putting in the machines there's a ramp up period. You don't have this worse and so you kind of get this, it starts to help you. The first the first product that comes out is the help but it's not so clear how much of a help will be.  I think, you'll still see us in a fourth quarter trying to stick handle around the capacity issues and that's part of the thing that's here. But that's stick handling will get more \u2013 less complex and therefore we should be able to take more advantage of the orders. But the timelines, the time constants associated with that are always pretty hard to predict, the dependent on your ability to wrap up, which we have a lot of faith in and it is dependent on the nature of the orders applied against those.  I would simply say that looking forward we feel like we're in a better position than looking recently backwards. \nDavid McGregor: And then - maybe this is a questions for Aldo, but are you able to talk about just, the impact on margins from the capacity constraints and incremental costs associated with that in 3Q? \nAldo Pagliari : No, the overall margin performance is pretty solid as you saw across the board. Sure, there are incremental cost and expediting expenses and elements of over time of overtime having to be expended. But at the same time, we with the supply chain improvements that have occurred over the past 12 months or so, we have more resources to turn our attention to RCI initiatives. So, David, well, there is a lot of challenge in any quarter we expect to rise the occasion and try to offset those incremental costs.  But yes, there will be some incremental cost involved, but the tools group and the other segments are able to offset that. \nNicholas Pinchuk: I don't know I had a chime in here though. In my book, I think over a hundred basis points margin improvement in every segment - I don't know, sounds gangbusters to me. Not so. And so, it sounds pretty good to me. So I think - I think it should be helped going forward, but I'm not sure where that will lay out. We anticipate like, I say we expect to improve margins all the time. \nDavid McGregor: Great. Thanks gentlemen. \nNicholas Pinchuk: Sure. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Christopher Glenn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. \nChristopher Glenn: Hey, thanks. Good morning all. Curious Nick if you could elaborate on your comments about expand adding capabilities in the critical industry space, what types of activities? What's the scale? What exactly are you chasing so to speak? \nNicholas Pinchuk: Well, look I think this a first of all, I would say that we haven't plumbed the complete ceiling of the first capacity expansion. By the way, just as a commercial, if you want to, if you want to behold the capacity expansion, you could look at it and I think the back page of our annual report this year. So, it's right there. Pretty, pretty sizable thing. And so we're still figuring out how to wheel that. That's how it works.  You start out and it's pretty good and then you do better, better and better. So I think we have some, some ways to go there. What I'm talking about adding is, we just added a new machine shop, just for the critical industries in that space. And so that's a particular product where we used to have to outsource them. They took longer to do and we weren't as effective in getting them out. And so we decided to do it ourselves in-house. And so we see that will match up one, we can we can be more efficient in sourcing, which is a big factor for us and two, we can be more creative and actually matching the direct demands that customers want. So that's what I meant. \nChristopher Glenn: Great. And then, cash is approaching $1 billion. Now, not sure what level you are comfortable holding but that will kind of keep piling up unless you accelerate some sort of deployment. So I am wondering how you are thinking about that cash balance? \nNicholas Pinchuk: Well, look, I think, I think this, first of all, we are very working capital intense. So, as we move upwards, you tend to use some of that cash for working capital. Although, we're in an era where we were, we used working capital to cushion ourselves against the difficulties of the pandemic. So, some of that go way out. We look hard at our dividends, which we have paid every quarter since 1939.  And I love to say at this point have never reduced it any quarter since 1939. And so, perpetuity is our guiding line on dividend. So we'll look at that again, we\u2019ll look at that. And then, you have things like pension and you have, you have things like acquisitions, which are important to us. So, we have a landscape of acquisitions, which will constantly look at.  Like, I always say, some are big, some are small and we're not afraid to make a big one. So I kind of like having a war chest for that, especially in these tides when the when the interest rates are pretty high. And then finally we look at buying back opportunistically shares. \nChristopher Glenn: Yeah, following up on the pipeline, are you seeing any changes in availability actionability of some of the larger prospects? \nNicholas Pinchuk: I'm not seeing any. I guess we see a little bit more availability. I'm not sure actionability is any better or not. I think there's been a lot of discussion of that. I think bankers \u2013 every bank that you see wants to talk about that. But I don't see much difference in that regard. You would think prices would be coming down with the maybe with interest rates rising. I don't know but - I don't see that. We see a little more availability, though. Little more availability. \nChristopher Glenn: Okay, great. Sorry last point for me. I think you said technician concept meant to high-single-digits. I imagine there's some lag effect to seeing that benefit. Is that fair to think about that as a lead indicator and driver during that \u201824? \nNicholas Pinchuk: I think that is fair to look, I think, especially sense there's an accelerator there, Christian. I've been in a shop I am ten1years. And for most of the years technicians were growing at 1%, 1.1%, that was just this. It was really like, a metronome. 1.1%, 1.1% , 1.1% And now it's growing mid single digits. And so, this has got to come in and accelerate for us because one, they'll be more technicians and two, the new guys need to tool up.  Now, of course that tool up takes on different shapes. So, for example, they may not be buying the top of line boxes right away. They may be focused on cards, which in fact if you looked at our tool storage business in the past quarter, it was heavily guided to cards. And so, we're seeing some of that effect right now.  What they do need to tool up and one of the great things about it is, we spent, I think we're like thousands of schools around the country trying to make sure that people understand that the Snap-on brand is the most powerful brand that repair making students Snap-on customers for life. And I think we see that as they come out into the marketplace. So growing Texas music to warriors. \nChristopher Glenn: Thanks for all the color. \nNicholas Pinchuk: Sure. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Scott Stember with Roth MKM. Please go ahead. \nScott Stember: Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. \nNicholas Pinchuk: Hey Scott. \nScott Stember: Hey. Within the tools, could you just tell us how some of the sub segments did, hand tools versus tool storage versus diagnostics in power tools? \nNicholas Pinchuk: Yeah. Look, I think the big the big cohonent this month was hand tools, just not last quarter, it was hand tools sold very well in the quarter. And so that, that was pretty strong. Diagnostics was off certainly after three good quarters and they didn't have a new installation here. And power tools was down somewhat because the stubby wasn't launched for sale until after the SFC.  So that was really a back-end phenomena given part of the great momentum in that situation. If you look at the back end, you would see power tools being a big factor in that situation because it's sold like wildfire. Like I said, the wait was worth it but we demonstrated at SFC people were crowding around it, but we weren't selling it.  We just wanted to create more pent-up demand in that situation. Tool storage was down somewhat, but that was pretty much a substitution of as I just said, of got the carts which are lower, lower value per unit than the bigger units. And they take up a little more, a little more manufacturing space. So that, that kind of thing is what was in was in tool storage. Units were pretty good, but revenues were a little lower because of the mix. \nScott Stember: Got it. And as far as the sales after van versus into the van. \nNicholas Pinchuk: Sales off the van probably follows the, you can say they pretty much follow the tools group, in terms of the numbers you saw in the tools group in general overall and the rise at the end of the quarter. I think one of the things this time, I think we saw a lot of vacations in some cases, like we always do that's why I say these quarters were squirrely. \nScott Stember: At the sell-in \u2013 sell-through was was essentially the same as sell-in. \nNicholas Pinchuk: Must be the same. Yes. \nScott Stember: Okay. Got it. And then just last housekeeping question I saw the corporate expense up five plus million. What was that related to? \nNicholas Pinchuk: Pretty much stock-based compensation was a lot of it and part of that is, okay, I think we're doing a little better this year than last year and just a basic year. But also, after you put several years together of good if you go back and look at our numbers, they're up, up, up, up. You know, you are talking about quite a bit of getting - point OI margins to start, it starts to work its way into the long term incent this as well. So, you're starting to see some of that play out in that situation. There are other things drifts and drafts here, but that I think for government work, that's it. \nScott Stember: Got it. That's all I have. Thank you. \nNicholas Pinchuk: Okay. \nOperator: Thank you. And our final question today comes from Luke Junk with Baird. Please go ahead. \nLuke Junk : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. A couple of margin related questions for me at the segment level. First one Nick, just if I look backwards in the tools group, there's just been a lot going on there in terms of material inflation, supply chain, product, mix that's been variable and it seems like those are things that could settle down into next year.  And I guess I said that against what's already been a step function change in profitability in the tools group. Do you see any key offsets or risks that we should be thinking about going into next year maybe normalizing price increases versus just building off of where the tools business is now and sort of a normal margin progression into 2024? \nNicholas Pinchuk: No. I don't - I look, I think this time material wasn't a major factor. Tools group is sort of over that, you know. And so I don't think you're going to see that. I think the tools group is just on a good - what, what you eat. But by the way, all the - lot of the things you mentioned, like product mix and all that that wasn't on it. It's all every quarter there. Here's been like this, every quarter is like that.  They're always a mix of things that happen in the tools group. So we just simply try to balance them so they drive things upwards. This quarter, we got a nice dollop of good margin business. The hand tool business is pretty good. And by the way, when you take a customer connection and you solve somebody's problems, that's why I try to talk about those two things.  When you get the glow plugs out in a substantially shorter time, people want that and you get your margins for it. It might seem arcane, but that's the kind of stuff that gets you money. When you provide them a triple flex ratchet, where they can use three different things that are having problems getting around them, they will pay it for it.  And that kind of stuff works for us. So most - I think one of the things that's been driving our margins in this period and all the periods has been a relatively robust product activity. Now, one of the things that did happen, I think fairly is during the pandemic when supply change started to be a problem, we were focusing on our engineers on substitution somewhat and took away new product capacity, because the engineers, we only have so many engineers, some of them are working on trying to find components that you can actually source, so you can deliver.  But now that that's all over, we can turn the engineers on new product again. So the machine starts rolling at full speed. So we feel pretty good about this actually going forward. \nLuke Junk : Thanks. And then just a follow up on RS&I, just thinking about mix in that business. So maybe I'm reading into this too much in which case, tell me if I am, the under car equipment, that's been growing strong double-digits for going, three years now just slightly lower growth up high-single-digits this quarter.  I'm just thinking of sort of the mix of growth here between the software businesses in under car equipment and to what extent we might see more of that software mix shine through going forward. Thanks. \nNicholas Pinchuk: Well, I don't know. I mean, I think we'd like to see the software mix go up. I mean I think you're going to see that software is up nicely. I mean Mitchell 1 had a better, nice quarter. Mitchell 1 had a great quarter, people or the repair shop owners or managers, or whatever they and we see that building there. So we think we got that on with some great new adjustments and we got more coming.  You got the diagnostics business, which will which will I think as we move forward new offerings will drive that business. And - but undercar equipment is lower - is lower profitability, but in the context of relativism they are I don't know, I believe at all-time high in profitability for them. So when you compare year-over-year, you're getting a positive margin contribution from those guys.  So what we have here, I mean, I think the way forward is somewhat what you're talking about, the way forward for RS&I is more software, but also we believe we can raise the margins in things like the equipment business. Because we have been doing it and they're at an all-time high now and going upwards. So we see those to be the two, I guess factors in that situation.  So that's where I see. So I think pretty good things. But look, RS&I with good sales and equipment with good strong sales and equipment that what were they, 24.3% up 130 basis points, that's not shop liver. So they seem to be able to keep improving, go back and look at the results. They keep going upwards. I think that'll continue. \nLuke Junk : Okay. Yeah, I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks for that comment on the equipment margins. That's helpful, Nick. \nNicholas Pinchuk: Sure. \nOperator: Thank you and ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question and answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Sara Verbsky for any closing remarks. \nSara Verbsky: Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on Snap-on.com. As always we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Nicholas Pinchuk",
            "content": "Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I'll start by covering the highlights of the quarter, and then I'll provide an update on our general environment and the trends we see. Aldo will then give you a detailed review of the financials.  Speaking about the last three months, I can say without question or qualification, we are once again encouraged fortified by the progress along our runways both growth and improvement. We encountered headwinds and we engaged challenges in a number of geographies still we capitalized on our opportunities, wielding our advantage and overcame the potential for disruption.  The franchising network remain resilient generating positive gains through a broad and sharp rise in critical industries expanding what is now a consistent upward trajectory enabled by the confluence of our robust market of growing product lines and an effective expansion of capacity in that business. And that progress was pretty evident in our numbers.  They speak for themselves. Reported sales were $1,159 million, up 5.2% from last year, a 4.7% organic rise and $4.4 million in favorable foreign currency effects with growth in every segments. This represents our 13th quarter, well, above pre-pandemic levels. OpCo income, OI before financial services were up 9.7%, reaching $245.2 million, OpCo operating margin rose 90 basis points to 21.2% with higher sales volumes, the benefits of great new products and the ongoing efficiencies of a rapid continuous improvement or RS&I more than offsetting up 50 basis points, a bad news from unfavorable foreign currency effects, 21.2% and 90 basis points. Nice.  The operating income for our financial services operation grew $69.4 million from the $66.4 million last year, a 4.5% improvement and the result - and that result combined with the OpCo performance to raise our consolidated operating margins to 25.1%, a 70 basis point rise from 2022. And EPS, EPS was $4.51. reflecting a 37 or 8.9% increase above last year. Strong.  Well those are the numbers. Once again strong signifying our corporation's continuing advance. You see, we again believe that Snap-on is stronger now than at any time in our history and the results they say it so.  Now let's review the markets. In vehicle repairs, key metrics continue to be favorable. The average age of vehicles on the road continuing to rise and in turn the number of techs in the garages, in the garage is growing high to high mid-single-digits maintaining consistently positive trends period-over-period, period-over-period. That's clearly upward.  Technician wages are robust and continuing to climb. So the market is favorable and the metrics back it up. But more than the quantitative evidence, you get the feeling of optimism potential when you speak with technicians.  Recently, I had a chance to visit with our customers' franchises and mechanics in New York. And I'm here to tell you the enthusiasm they displayed in the industry and the confidence they expressed in their future was something else. It was contagious. Even in this time of turbulence, the message was clear. They see opportunity and they're looking for more, more innovative solutions, that will increase productivity and take advantage of that potential.  And their confidence on the way forward is palpable. And we believe they see Snap-on products, brands and people as the best way to ensure that positive future. Vehicle repair is a strong market. We see this confirmed throughout the franchisee network in North America and in our international operations. It's one of the reasons we've expanded capacity.  We believe our franchisees and our technicians have never been more prosperous. It all makes sense. The car park is increasingly requires more repairs or greater complexity and our customers, the techs are major participants in that reality. They need - and they need new tools to follow the opportunity. Snap-on is positioned to take full advantage of that possibility.  Another important sector for us is the vehicle repair shop owners or managers. These are people who stand right next to the techs, but they buy at different cadences. This is where repairs systems and information group or S&I operates every day with advantage. The vehicle park is changing. The shops have to keep with the upswing model-by-model, new challenges, new challenges that they have to navigate.  Electronics to support more features. Automotive systems that enhance driver safety. New body materials to increase durability and reduce weight. Network of sensors to anticipate traffic and road conditions. No power trains. Enhanced internal combustion engines. EVs and plug-in hybrids and the conserved energy and on and on and on. Each of these, each of these trends creates opportunity for garages and they know it. But they also know it requires new more sophisticated equipment. The opportunity - that opportunity we see shines right through political uncertainty or economic turbulence.  We see, though that underneath every day when we call on the garages new software to guide repairs or manage the shop. Essential programs to accommodate either sequences of new vehicles, calibration protocols and advanced systems for sensor rays, advanced under car equipment to accommodate the precision - that the precision that supports efficient driving.  And we see the shop owners and managers are eager to take advantage of those trends Snap-on has the hardware and software to enable that pursuit bringing to shops and the results in our C&I are confirming the strength of that market and our strong position in it.  Finally, let's discuss the critical industries. This is where we extend outside the garage solving tasks that that really matter. This is where commercial industrial or C&I lives. And where much more international activity happens. This is the arena of critical applications, space declarations, wind power maintenance, subsea mining, smelting that exceeds 2300 degrees Fahrenheit, the mobilization of first responders. All critical environments where the penalty for rearview was high and the need for repeatability and reliability often requires custom tools engineered for a single purpose. In other words, tasks that require a Snap-on solution.  Just like in previous quarters, the market is booming. Momentum in multiple sectors like the military, general industry, aerospace, heavy-duty and aviation. Of course, do just see variations from geography-to-geography, this is an international business. Areas impacted by external factors that create disruptions in Europe, with the uncertainty associated with the Ukraine war in Asia where the remnants of the pandemic are still pretty apparent; there's turbulence in China and the weakening of currencies these days are impacting particular countries.  But overall, the critical industries are robust offering us significant potential for taking advantage and making significant gains. And in the quarter, we did just that. So our markets are resilient and are on a positive trajectory and we believe that our runways for growth will present clear and abundant opportunities as we move forward enhancing the franchise network, expanding where repair shop owners and managers extending to those critical industries. And building and emerging markets.  Rising - rising and going forward by leveraging our broadening product line, wielding our strengthening brand, and deploying the increasing understanding of the work that is the hallmark of the Snap-on team. That's the markets.  Now, let's turn to the segments. In the C&I group, third, quarter sales reached $266.4 million, up $9.6 million, which includes $1.6 million in unfavorable currency effects and an organic sales growth of 3.2% above last year. From an earnings perspective, C&I's operating income was $58.1 million, up 11.1% double-digits including $2.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency. And the operating margin was 15.9%, an increase of 120 basis points overcoming 70 basis points of negative currency.  We did have some variation across the group - across the group business units with substantial gains in industrial vision offsetting declines in Asia operations. But as usual, the C&I rise showed the power of our Snap-on value creation, particularly on customer connection, innovation authoring great new products, solutions that make critical tasks easier, like our new CT9038 power tool.  We talked about this. We talked about this to a last quarter saying the franchisees were waiting for its launch. Well it was worth the wait. It's a special to0l. A three eight inch drive, 18 volt impact unit that, that, that offers compact housing measuring only five inches long. That's why we call it the stubby. The unique silhouette is made possible by engineering the overall housing mechanism to stabilize the electric motor rather than the standard approach of adding a whole independent structure to support the drive components.  It's an innovation that reduces overall body dimensions allowing users to navigate really tight spaces and believe me, that's an attractive advantage for engine and suspension work on newer vehicles. And it does that while still delivering 520 foot pounds of bolt break away torque, power capable of busting with even the most stubborn of seized and seized fasteners. It's what you would expect from Snap-on.  It's an ergonomically balanced - it's ergonomically balanced, greatly reducing user fatigue. It's equipped with a super bright LED light to clearly illuminate the workplace. It also offers three torque settings and forward and reverse and includes a variable speed trigger enabling techs to apply just that necessary force avoiding the fastener damage that you know, often can happen in tight spaces.  The September launch was a big way oversubscribed. Clear testimony to the appreciation of the stubby's compact power and it's still showing great momentum. The orders remain very strong. It was worth wait.  C&I product is encouraging. But there's another story in the group. Our industrial division, extending the Snap-on brands to the critical industries. We've said in the past that the opportunity was there. Always needed was more capabilities to deliver. Well it played out just that way. We did add capacity for kidding and it drove results. Expansion came to the fall of the last year. And this past period was the third straight quarter of clear double-digit growth in the critical industries.  And that was what's strong margins. Gangbusters, gangbusters margins, gangbusters growth. It overcame the C&I challenge in Eastern Europe and Asia. And we believe we have much more room to run in the critical - in the critical industry's arena. So we're adding more capability in that business right now to take full advantage.  Let's C&I substantial challenges overcome by strong products and expanded capacity to drive upward in the critical industries and there's more to come.  Now on to the tools group. Sales line was up organically 3.7% over last year, reaching $515.4 million in the quarter. That's finished with great in a quarter, that finished with great momentum. And the Group's operating income continue to move strongly upward to $113.4, million, and 11% increase, double-digit increase over 2022 levels. Another in a series of those double-digit increases for the tools group and the operating margin was \u2013 it was 22% up 140 basis points from last year and that rise and \u2013 that considerable rise was achieved overcoming 50 basis points of unfavorable currencies, - a great quarter for the profitability and growth.  Now, the third quarter is when we hold our annual Snap-on franchisee conference what call is the SFC. This year the event was a net show with 9,000 people attending, franchisees, guests and of course, Snap-on team all participating in the, in a weekend of special - in a great weekend. It was a weekend of special training. Hands-on encounters with our massive product line and for some fun - for some fun, special Snap-on celebrations, they're really good.  The attendees had the opportunity to spend time ordering directly from the tool exit expo floor. And I am happy to say orders were up again this year, which is and that exposed spanned a space of over three football fields where our entire portfolio of products was on display, but it had a wide array of demonstrations and that was specially designed to showcase the Snap-on performance advantage.  The conference also provided a number training sessions, helping franchisees expand their business. Seminars and special breakouts, highlighting our product features and unique advantages in critical categories like power tools and diagnostics and we topped off that multi-day event. This is, these are the celebrations with a - of coach buses transporting the teams to downtown Nashville for unique Snap-on's evening.  Boom, shakalaka was the word of the day with another memorable SFC and sightful, education, great, new products, and a special fellowship, a special fellowship that reinforces our unique bond with our franchisees. From my perspective, our van drivers at Nashville spoke enthusiastically about their current businesses and radiated firm confidence in their future with Snap-on. And if you were there, you would have seen it too.  During the tool expo, franchisees were able to spend time interacting with some of the new innovative products derived from our customer connections inside game, directly in the workplace handles were big at the SFC and in the quarter and the demand was driven by special new products like our 12 millimeter 6.6. meter Duramax glow plug socket.  This product was inspired by a franchisee observing the technicians removing blocking components one-by-one from a diesel vehicle, fender of special intake lines in steering shifts. These items create access barriers increasing the difficulty of executing the very basic repair of just changing diesel glow plugs, a routine test that that was made difficult because of our crowded engine compartment design with minimal regard for servicing.  We listened to the franchisee feedback, went to work designed - and new socket longer than the standard to reach the glow plugs from a distance. And with a flex mechanism that guide around the blockers, making - making it unnecessary to remove them. Technicians immediately recognize the considerable time savings that - it made the new sockets very popular.  It's another customer connection that transforms a laborious process, making more easier, freeing time and increasing tech capacity and therefore tech income.  Also on display was another Display was another example of customer connection, the new FHC 72MPRR, these product terminations are mouthful. Triples but it's a we call it a triple function ratchet. Three tools in one. Again, born out of customer connection directly in the worst place. First the ratchet head can be secured parallel to the handle serving as an traditional ratchet.  Next, the head can be adjusted to take any one of 16 available positions, 240 degrees around the handle centerline enabling the tool to work while reaching around obstacles. Finally, the unit can be placed in a free spin mode providing the tech with 360 degrees in continuous rotation, greatly reducing work time in low torque situations.  Our customers, the technicians again saw the great benefit of that improved productivity and that recognition made the triple function ratchet a million dollar hit product in just the first month of selling. It was another win for customer connection and a driver for the tools group. The tools group proves a third quarter achievement and momentum fueled by customer connection, innovative insight, anchoring great new products. And with the group's continuous dedication to Snap-on value creation, we believe the hits in the progress will just keep on comments. Turning to RS&I. Sales of $431.8 million in the third quarter were up as reported by 4.2% with an organic improvement of 3.1%, expansions in the undercar equipment and our diagnostics and information portfolio continued to offset the OEM businesses where - which finished down slightly in a traditionally lumpy arena.  OI for RS&I was $104.9 million, up 10%, again double-digits from 2022 and the operating margins was 24.3% represent - which represented an improvement of 130 basis points again against 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency. We've great confidence in our RSI business. Our customers and industries, partners feel the same, and that confidence was demonstrated in the latest public recognitions.  Recently Motor Magazine shows our Zeus Plus fast track intelligent diagnostic platform as a top tool in 2023. Our premium handheld unit was recognized for simplifying the repairs, guiding technicians through the troubleshooting procedures avoiding unnecessary steps along the way and improving solution, accuracy, and most importantly, reducing the time to identify the proper fit. The Zeus Plus is the top of the line for vehicle repair and the publications know it recognizing our handhelds for our handheld new prominent bright screen, increasing the ease of use in direct sunlight.  It's faster processor with more onboard memory enabling greater task efficiency, and it's improved lab scope making component testing much more accurate and when professional tools and equipment knows ask this readers to choose the best new tools as recipients of that publication's People's Choice awards the tech selected seven Snap-on products led the Zeus Plus. The Zeus Plus top of the line indeed. Hardware, software, shaped by customer connection, another and a long line of distinctive and decisive RS&I products driving the group upwards and onwards.  We're quite positive about RS&I's possibilities with repair shop owners and managers as the vehicle industry evolves and the quarter supports that confidence.  So those are the highlights of the quarter. Continued strong progress. The 13th straight quarter above pre-pandemic levels. C&I margins up year-over-year volume growth and strong, strong OI margins. The tools group, great products, confident franchisees and strong momentum. RS&I under car repair information activity leading the charge enabling the repair shops in the challenges in today's vehicles.  And the overall corporation sales up 5.2% as reported 4.7% organically. OpCo operating margin 21.2% up 90 basis points, overcoming 50 basis points of currency headwinds and an EPS to $4.51 rising 8.9% versus last year. It was an encouraging quarter.  Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Thanks, Aldo. Well, that's our third quarter. You know, I always say as the third quarter could be somewhat squirrely, not always indicative of trends. That's because of the SFC and the vacation seasons around the world. But having said that, the last three months haven't been encouraging. We took on some significant headwinds, the war in the Ukraine, and the uncertainly in China, both politically and economically.  We engaged those challenges came through at all with clear progress. New heights across the board. Continuing our - it all, continue our upward trajectory movement, the upward conjecture we've been on for some time. We spoken quite a bit about capacity constraints, first in the industrial business and later in the tools group, born of the increasing demand for our solutions.  And in this quarter, we clearly see the power of such expansions wielded by capable of experienced team enabled by decisive advantages, and products, and brands and applied in markets that are critical and resilient even amidst the challenges. The industrialization is performing as we said it would. Clear double-digit growth and strong profitability now, demonstrated for three straight quarters as its new capacity has come online.  And the tools groups starting to see the very early effects of that capacity propulsion closing out the quarter with great momentum and with significant rises in overall profitability. At RS&I, not capacity bound, but establishing a strong and profitable position in the repair shops with software strength like our Mitchell 1 systems, diagnostic ascendance like our decorated Zeus Core to Intel and by clear answers to challenges of repair complexity up and down the under car equipment line, continuing the steep upward trend in that broad product arena.  This was an encouraging quarter. You can see it in the results. C&I sales up 3.2% organically, external sales, particularly robust. Significant gains in critical industry overcoming the uncertainty of Europe and Asia. OI margin of 15.9% up 120 basis points against 70. Again, 70 basis points of unfavorable currency. The tools group sales was up organically 3.7% close to target exiting the quarter with momentum as the expansion start to help and an OI margin of 22%, up 140 basis points. Again overcoming 50 basis points of currency headwinds.  In RS&I, sales rising 3.1%, OI rising 10% and the OI margins reaching 24.3%, an uplift of 130 points. And all drove the corporation higher. Sales were up 4.7% organically. Overall OpCo operating margins were 21.2%, a gain of 90 basis points, 90 basis points against 50 basis points a bad currency and all of that drove an EPS of $4.51, up versus every comparison.  And we believe that with our decisive and widening advantages in product, the Snap-on value creation process, customer connection and innovation, people keep - will keep rolling out powerful new products day after day. Our advantages in brands Snap-on remains the outward sign of pride and dignity that working men and women take in their profession.  Everybody knows it's true and advantages in people. Our battle tested and capable team people that expect to rise even against difficulties. With those advantages amplified by capacity investments and applied to resilience and critical markets we believe that our enterprise will rise on a clear and continuing positive trajectory through the remainder of the year on into 2024 and well beyond.  Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. My friends, this was an encouraging quarter. It was hard one against significant turbulence and it was driven by your constant dedication and effort. For the success in our third quarter delivered by your hands, you have my congratulations.  For the extraordinary capability you bring to bear every day and every situation, you have my admiration. And for the unwavering confidence you consistently express and clearly demonstrate in the future of our enterprise and our team, you have my thanks.  Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Sure. Yeah. Well, like, I think I \u2013 what I was trying to say in my remark is that it got better through the quarter. We started to get some of the value with the capacity expansions. We're starting to get the early effects of those things. So you saw some of that start to balance out, but it's still there. We expected to continue to - but those capacity expansions to continue helping us going forward.  But it's kind of the same thing. When we have these capacity constraints and they were principally in hand tools and in the tools group, there were at hand tools and in and tool storage as the quarter, we see them ease a little bit, but they're not where we want them to be. They're going to be, yes. Demand is pretty healthy on a relative basis. I mean, the thing is what these businesses what this business referred to is, these are projects, programs authored or commissioned by OEMs principally to deal with the idiosyncrasies of a changing environment or with a new vehicle. Maybe it needs a new trailer hitch adjustment because something wasn't anticipated or a different tool to take out the wiring harness or maybe to support vehicle charging stations that dealerships once because electric vehicles are coming on or maybe for a special.  And what it is, is the OEM ask us to configure the product and then distribute it to its dealerships. And, that's been going upwards. But it is lumpy, it's big project, that's a big project that's good product. So if you get, x number of men in one quarter and you get x minus one in another quarter is a little bit of pressure on that. In this situation, the, the EQS business was down somewhat.  Well, I think low-single-digits or something like that, but it was really last year it has risen tremendously associated with the fuselage of new models that are rolling out into the markets. And so this is down somewhat versus a pretty strong position. So it just reflects kind of some lumpiness along the surface for that business and that's created some offset to C&I. For RS&I. Sure. Good morning, Gary. Yeah, sure. They were up mid-single-digits. So, this is a nice we like this kind of thing because it shows we're going to keep growing in that sort of range we expect to grow. It's been upward during the pandemic, it have been up more higher at some points. But generally mid-single-digit growth is pretty good for us. We were kind of very encouraged by that idea. You know, you got to remember though Gary, as you know very well, these things are just orange. You know, they are orders. They are not necessarily sales and those orders are spread out over six months or seven months.  So it's hard to correlate them to anything in particular, but having said that, having orders up mid-single-digits is better than a poking an eye with a sharp stick. You know, it's okay. We kind of like that. The thing is, is that you would think that would be logical. I would. Yeah, for sure, it bodes greater emphasis on electronics and software and other highly - high tech things like calibrations and things like that, which are the words of the day, then they are now, and then you are going to see a continuing upswing of that investment and the capability and value and revenue and profit generated by that stream.  But I'm not so sure that hand tools will be attenuated, because as we look backwards, you know we remember this industry in the 90s where the number of trouble codes, electronic trouble codes on a car were measured in dozens. Now they're measured in tens of thousands and the demand for handle tools is only going up.  So I would, I'm not so sure that hand tools will be lessened. I believe that software and electronics and diagnostics and calibration will be increased. That's what I would say. Now, by the way, the hand tools are pretty good margin. But it's hard to predict those, because like I try to explain and explain since I was putting out with the diesel plug, gold plug sockets and the triple flex function in ratchet.  Really these are things that are observed after the cars on road and you see the struggles that the technicians are having and you would enable them. And so I would anticipate they will continue to be in demand as we go forward. We haven't seen any abatement of that demand even as we've seen a growth in the electronics and calibration business. Actually you are looking over a year we had you know kind of a - what 6,7,5,6 cents impact for taxes year over year each quarter. Negative impact. Yeah, so we still were up 8.9% even with the $0.37 even when that $0.06 impact. Hi, David. Yeah, that's a complicated. Look, it's hard to predict, of course, this is like shooting darts in the dark or something. But, look, I think I think this is the situation. First of all, I want to correct just a little bit. The dealership business itself was not down. The OEM programs were down some, but they were still at a relatively historically high levels even though they backed off a little bit, year-over-year. So we haven't seen what I would call a significant pullback in the OEM programs at this point. Having said that, the OES, the UAW strike, I used to work for the auto companies themselves, and they are cash monsters, you know, they eat cash like mad and so it could happen as the strike goes on longer, you could see some diminishment in that business, in that particular business.  Now, when that would hit, I'm not so sure because, they might not cancel programs. They must just delay some or they may they may in fact cancel future programs. Not so clear how they would play out. But it is a possibility that that would happen. Regarding the dealerships themselves, I don't necessarily \u2013 I think the effect on them is unknowable because sometimes if they don't get new cars, they just turn more attention to repair and parts.  And so this is good news for us. Sometimes they pull in the back down the hatches and reduce. But generally I think they tend to look at more at repair and parts if they don't get the new cars and that's not so bad. So I see that as being the two possibilities playing out. I think it's 5, to kind of mid-single. Right. Sure. I guess. I don't know, I think I'm not quite sure I understood exactly the import of your question, David. But, but the thing is, the way I see it is, the capacity is getting better. Even if you have the building up, you can start putting in the machines there's a ramp up period. You don't have this worse and so you kind of get this, it starts to help you. The first the first product that comes out is the help but it's not so clear how much of a help will be.  I think, you'll still see us in a fourth quarter trying to stick handle around the capacity issues and that's part of the thing that's here. But that's stick handling will get more \u2013 less complex and therefore we should be able to take more advantage of the orders. But the timelines, the time constants associated with that are always pretty hard to predict, the dependent on your ability to wrap up, which we have a lot of faith in and it is dependent on the nature of the orders applied against those.  I would simply say that looking forward we feel like we're in a better position than looking recently backwards. I don't know I had a chime in here though. In my book, I think over a hundred basis points margin improvement in every segment - I don't know, sounds gangbusters to me. Not so. And so, it sounds pretty good to me. So I think - I think it should be helped going forward, but I'm not sure where that will lay out. We anticipate like, I say we expect to improve margins all the time. Sure. Well, look I think this a first of all, I would say that we haven't plumbed the complete ceiling of the first capacity expansion. By the way, just as a commercial, if you want to, if you want to behold the capacity expansion, you could look at it and I think the back page of our annual report this year. So, it's right there. Pretty, pretty sizable thing. And so we're still figuring out how to wheel that. That's how it works.  You start out and it's pretty good and then you do better, better and better. So I think we have some, some ways to go there. What I'm talking about adding is, we just added a new machine shop, just for the critical industries in that space. And so that's a particular product where we used to have to outsource them. They took longer to do and we weren't as effective in getting them out. And so we decided to do it ourselves in-house. And so we see that will match up one, we can we can be more efficient in sourcing, which is a big factor for us and two, we can be more creative and actually matching the direct demands that customers want. So that's what I meant. Well, look, I think, I think this, first of all, we are very working capital intense. So, as we move upwards, you tend to use some of that cash for working capital. Although, we're in an era where we were, we used working capital to cushion ourselves against the difficulties of the pandemic. So, some of that go way out. We look hard at our dividends, which we have paid every quarter since 1939.  And I love to say at this point have never reduced it any quarter since 1939. And so, perpetuity is our guiding line on dividend. So we'll look at that again, we'll look at that. And then, you have things like pension and you have, you have things like acquisitions, which are important to us. So, we have a landscape of acquisitions, which will constantly look at.  Like, I always say, some are big, some are small and we're not afraid to make a big one. So I kind of like having a war chest for that, especially in these tides when the when the interest rates are pretty high. And then finally we look at buying back opportunistically shares. I'm not seeing any. I guess we see a little bit more availability. I'm not sure actionability is any better or not. I think there's been a lot of discussion of that. I think bankers \u2013 every bank that you see wants to talk about that. But I don't see much difference in that regard. You would think prices would be coming down with the maybe with interest rates rising. I don't know but - I don't see that. We see a little more availability, though. Little more availability. I think that is fair to look, I think, especially sense there's an accelerator there, Christian. I've been in a shop I am ten1years. And for most of the years technicians were growing at 1%, 1.1%, that was just this. It was really like, a metronome. 1.1%, 1.1% , 1.1% And now it's growing mid single digits. And so, this has got to come in and accelerate for us because one, they'll be more technicians and two, the new guys need to tool up.  Now, of course that tool up takes on different shapes. So, for example, they may not be buying the top of line boxes right away. They may be focused on cards, which in fact if you looked at our tool storage business in the past quarter, it was heavily guided to cards. And so, we're seeing some of that effect right now.  What they do need to tool up and one of the great things about it is, we spent, I think we're like thousands of schools around the country trying to make sure that people understand that the Snap-on brand is the most powerful brand that repair making students Snap-on customers for life. And I think we see that as they come out into the marketplace. So growing Texas music to warriors. Sure. Hey Scott. Yeah. Look, I think the big the big cohonent this month was hand tools, just not last quarter, it was hand tools sold very well in the quarter. And so that, that was pretty strong. Diagnostics was off certainly after three good quarters and they didn't have a new installation here. And power tools was down somewhat because the stubby wasn't launched for sale until after the SFC.  So that was really a back-end phenomena given part of the great momentum in that situation. If you look at the back end, you would see power tools being a big factor in that situation because it's sold like wildfire. Like I said, the wait was worth it but we demonstrated at SFC people were crowding around it, but we weren't selling it.  We just wanted to create more pent-up demand in that situation. Tool storage was down somewhat, but that was pretty much a substitution of as I just said, of got the carts which are lower, lower value per unit than the bigger units. And they take up a little more, a little more manufacturing space. So that, that kind of thing is what was in was in tool storage. Units were pretty good, but revenues were a little lower because of the mix. Sales off the van probably follows the, you can say they pretty much follow the tools group, in terms of the numbers you saw in the tools group in general overall and the rise at the end of the quarter. I think one of the things this time, I think we saw a lot of vacations in some cases, like we always do that's why I say these quarters were squirrely. Must be the same. Yes. Pretty much stock-based compensation was a lot of it and part of that is, okay, I think we're doing a little better this year than last year and just a basic year. But also, after you put several years together of good if you go back and look at our numbers, they're up, up, up, up. You know, you are talking about quite a bit of getting - point OI margins to start, it starts to work its way into the long term incent this as well. So, you're starting to see some of that play out in that situation. There are other things drifts and drafts here, but that I think for government work, that's it. Okay. No. I don't - I look, I think this time material wasn't a major factor. Tools group is sort of over that, you know. And so I don't think you're going to see that. I think the tools group is just on a good - what, what you eat. But by the way, all the - lot of the things you mentioned, like product mix and all that that wasn't on it. It's all every quarter there. Here's been like this, every quarter is like that.  They're always a mix of things that happen in the tools group. So we just simply try to balance them so they drive things upwards. This quarter, we got a nice dollop of good margin business. The hand tool business is pretty good. And by the way, when you take a customer connection and you solve somebody's problems, that's why I try to talk about those two things.  When you get the glow plugs out in a substantially shorter time, people want that and you get your margins for it. It might seem arcane, but that's the kind of stuff that gets you money. When you provide them a triple flex ratchet, where they can use three different things that are having problems getting around them, they will pay it for it.  And that kind of stuff works for us. So most - I think one of the things that's been driving our margins in this period and all the periods has been a relatively robust product activity. Now, one of the things that did happen, I think fairly is during the pandemic when supply change started to be a problem, we were focusing on our engineers on substitution somewhat and took away new product capacity, because the engineers, we only have so many engineers, some of them are working on trying to find components that you can actually source, so you can deliver.  But now that that's all over, we can turn the engineers on new product again. So the machine starts rolling at full speed. So we feel pretty good about this actually going forward. Well, I don't know. I mean, I think we'd like to see the software mix go up. I mean I think you're going to see that software is up nicely. I mean Mitchell 1 had a better, nice quarter. Mitchell 1 had a great quarter, people or the repair shop owners or managers, or whatever they and we see that building there. So we think we got that on with some great new adjustments and we got more coming.  You got the diagnostics business, which will which will I think as we move forward new offerings will drive that business. And - but undercar equipment is lower - is lower profitability, but in the context of relativism they are I don't know, I believe at all-time high in profitability for them. So when you compare year-over-year, you're getting a positive margin contribution from those guys.  So what we have here, I mean, I think the way forward is somewhat what you're talking about, the way forward for RS&I is more software, but also we believe we can raise the margins in things like the equipment business. Because we have been doing it and they're at an all-time high now and going upwards. So we see those to be the two, I guess factors in that situation.  So that's where I see. So I think pretty good things. But look, RS&I with good sales and equipment with good strong sales and equipment that what were they, 24.3% up 130 basis points, that's not shop liver. So they seem to be able to keep improving, go back and look at the results. They keep going upwards. I think that'll continue. Sure."

            "content": "Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $1,159.3 million of the quarter represented an increase of 5.2% from 2022 levels, reflecting a 4.7% organic sales gain and $4.4 million of favorable foreign currency translation.  Organic sales growth was balanced across all three of our operating segments and from a geographic perspective, we experienced year-over-year gains in North and South America, as well as Europe. Asia continue to be attenuated by weakness in China and Japan, the latter hampered by a depreciating Yen.  Consolidated growth margin improved 160 basis points to 49.9% from 48.3% last year as gross margins expanded across all of our operating segments. Contributions from increased sales volume with pricing actions, lower material and other costs and benefits to the companies RCI initiatives were partially offset by 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.  Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales rose 70 basis points to 28.7% from 28% last year, primarily due to increased investment in personnel, and other costs. Operating earnings before financial services of $245.2 million in the quarter compared to $223.5 in 2022. As a percentage of net sales, operating larger before financial services of 21.2% including 50 basis points of unfavorable currency effects, reflects an expansion of 90 basis points over last year.  Financial services revenue of $94.9 million in the third quarter of 2023 compared to $87.3 million last year, while operating earnings of $69.4 million compared to $66.4 million in 2022. Consolidated operating earnings of $314.6 million in the quarter, compared to $289.9 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 25.1% reflects an improvement of 70 basis points from 2022.  Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 22.6%, compared to 21.6% last year. Net earnings of $243.1 million dollars or $4.51 per diluted share, including an $0.08 per share impact from unfavorable foreign currency, reflected an increase of $19.2 million and $0.37 per share from 2022 levels, and represented an 8.9% year-over-year improvement in diluted earnings per share.  Now let's turn to our segment results for the quarter. Starting with C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $366.4 million dollars increased from $356.8 million last year reflecting $11.2 million or 3.2% organic sales gain which was partially offset by $1.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Organic growth includes a double-digit gain in sales to customers and critical industries, partially offset by a double-digit decline in the segment to Asia Pacific operations.  With respect to critical industries, sales to the military were robust as was activity in the aviation sector. Overall C&I organic sales to external customers were up 7.1% for the quarter. Gross margin improved 210 basis points to 39% in the third quarter from 36.9% in 2022. This was largely due to increased sales volumes in the higher gross margin critical industry sector, pricing actions and benefits from RCI initiatives.  These improvements were partially offset by 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 90 basis points to 23.1% in the quarter, from 22.2% 2022, primarily due to increased sales and higher expense businesses and investments in personnel and other costs.  Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $58.1 billion, including $2.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $52.3 million last year. The operating margin of 15.9%, including 70 basis points of unfavorable currency effects, compared to 14.7% in 2022, reflecting an improvement of 120 basis points.  Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on tools group of $515.4 million compared to $496.6 million a year ago, reflecting a 3.7% organic sales gain and $500,000 of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales growth reflects a double-digit gain in our international operations and a low-single-digit increase in our US business.  Gross margin improved 140 basis points to 46.3% in the quarter from 44.9% last year. This increase is primarily due to higher sales volumes and pricing actions and benefits from RCI initiatives, partially offset by 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales was unchanged from last year with benefits from higher volumes offset by increased personnel and other costs.  Operating earnings for the Snap-on tools group of $113.4 million including $2.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $102.2 million last year. The operating margin of 22% includes 50 basis points of unfavorable currency, compared to 20.6% in 2022 reflecting an improvement of 140 basis points.  Turning to the RS&I group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $431.8 million compared to $414 million in 2022 reflecting a 3.1% organic sales gain and $4.8 million of favorable, foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase includes a high-single-digit gain in sales of undercar equipment and a low-single-digit increase in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers.  These gains were partially offset by a low-single-digit decline in activity with OEM dealerships where we often see variability in essential tool programs from period-to-period. Gross margin improved 260 basis points to 45.5% from 42.9% last year, mostly due to lower material and other costs and increase sales volumes and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales went up by 130 basis points to 21.2% from 19.9% last year, primary reflecting increased personnel and other costs. Operating earnings for the RS&I group of $104.9 million compared to $95.4 million last year. The operating margin improved 130 basis points to 24.3% from 23% reported last year.  Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services increased $7.6 million to $94.9 million from $87.3 million last year, primarily reflecting the growth of the loan portfolio. Financial services, operating earnings of $69.4 million compared to $66.4 million in 2022. Financial Services expenses were up $4.6 million from 2022 levels, including $4 million of higher provision for credit losses.  The year-over-year increase of provisions reflects both the growth of the portfolio, as well as a return to what we believe to be a more normal pre-pandemic rate of provision. Sequentially, the provision for credit losses decreased by about $500,000. For reference, our gross worldwide extended credit or finance receivable portfolio has increased 9.3% year-over-year and we believe that delinquency in portfolio performance trends currently remains stable.  In both the third quarters of 2023 and 2022, the respective average yield on finance receivables was 17.7%. In the third quarters of 2023 and 2022 average yields on contract receivables were 8.8% and 8.6% respectively. Total loan originations of $305.2 million in the third quarter represented an increase of $5 million or 1.7% from 2022 levels, including a 4% increase in originations of finance receivables.  Moving to Slide 11, our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.4 billion of gross financing receivables with $2.1 billion from our US operation. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.5% for US extended credit is the same as it was in this period last year. On a sequential basis, the rate is up 20 basis points reflecting the seasonal trend we typically experience in the third quarter.  As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $47.9 million represented 2.51% of outstandings at quarter end, which is up slightly from the 2.45% reported at the end of last quarter.  Now, turning to Slide 12, cash provided by operating activities of $285.4 million in the quarter represented 115% of net earnings when compared to $129.9 million last year. The improvement as compared to the third quarter of 2022, largely reflects lower year-over-year increases of working investment, as well as higher net earnings.  Net cash used by investing activities of $59.7 million included net additions to finance receivables of $35.1 million and capital expenditures of $25.1 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $135.3 million included cash dividends of $85.6 million and the repurchase of 194,000 shares of common stock for $51.8 million under our existing share repurchase programs.  As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $304.5 million of common stock under our existing authorizations.  Turning to Slide 13, trade and other accounts receivable increased $15.1 million from 2023 events. Net sales outstanding of 60 days compared to 61 days as of 2022 year end. Inventory decreased $200,000 from 2022 year end. On a trailing 12 month basis, inventory turns to 2.4 compared to 2.5 at year end 2022. Our quarter end cash position of $959.3 million, compared to $757.2 million at year in 2022. Our net debt to capital ratio of 4.8% compared to 9% at year 2022.  In addition to cash, we expected cash flow from operations, we entered into a five year $900,000 multi-currency revolving credit facility on September 12, which amends and restates our previous $800 million facility. As at quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding.  That concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. But briefly review a few outlook items for the remainder of 2023. We anticipate the capital expenditures will approximate $100 million. In addition we currently anticipate that our full year 2023 effective income tax rate will approximate 23%.  I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? That will be the neighborhood actually of - I think our rate year-to-date it's put them all together is around 22.9% or something like that. So we are in the ballpark area. So I think it'll be in that neighborhood in Q4 We've had some favorable outcomes on reducing our state taxes along with some other items. But that's what benefited Q3. In order to Q3 last year it was even better. So sometimes there's variation that occurs from time to time. But 23% is about the right number I think we're going to get to this upcoming full year. No, the overall margin performance is pretty solid as you saw across the board. Sure, there are incremental cost and expediting expenses and elements of over time of overtime having to be expended. But at the same time, we with the supply chain improvements that have occurred over the past 12 months or so, we have more resources to turn our attention to RCI initiatives. So, David, well, there is a lot of challenge in any quarter we expect to rise the occasion and try to offset those incremental costs.  But yes, there will be some incremental cost involved, but the tools group and the other segments are able to offset that."

With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?\nNicholas Pinchuk: Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. Today, I'll start the call by as usual, by covering the highlights of the second quarter, and I'll give you my perspective on the environment and the trends we're seeing. A long way we'll cover the markets. They're encouraging actually. And I'll take you through the segments and the advancements we've made. Then Aldo will provide a detailed review of the financials. We see the second quarter as a period of significance. Sometimes you see a performance where you breakthrough into new heights. And this is one of those times. I'm going to tell you why we believe that to be true. In some ways, though, it was similar. This period was similar to many periods we've seen over time, as we continue to have significant headwinds. And there's always turbulence variation from market-to-market. But we believe it's our job to confront and overcome these obstacles, and we did just that in the second quarter by wielding the strength of our advantages, executing on our strategic runways for growth, making the most of our runways for improvement, and by relying on the skills and dedication of our people. And once again, it paid off the numbers screen it's sold, but here they are. As reported, second quarter sales of $1,191.3 billion were up 4.8% from 2022, including the impact of $8.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Organic activity was up 5.6%. The 12 straight quarter of year-over-year expansion beyond pre-pandemic levels. That's a trend that demonstrates that we believe it is a solid consistency during pretty uncertain times. Now let's talk about the earnings. OpCo operating income for the quarter, including the effects of unfavorable foreign currency was $277 million, up 12.3%. And our OpCo operating margin, the operating margin -- it was 23.3%, up 160 basis points from last year, BAFO. When I said new levels, I mean it. For financial services, the OI of $66.9 million represented an increase of $1.6 million, and it all combined to author an overall consolidated operating margin of 26.8% up 130 basis points from last year. And the second quarter EPS, it was $4.89, up $0.62 or 14.5% from last year's $4.27. I think I'll say it again, $4.89, up 14.5%. The productivity and profitability of Snap-on operations shining through as the supply chain viscosity diminished. We believe Snap-on is stronger now than ever before, and the quarter's profitability makes that crystal clear. Well, those are the overall numbers. Now let's speak to the market, auto repair. Again, this quarter, it's favorable. Miles driven are up. Spending on vehicle maintenance, up. Technician count, up. Technician wages, up. Consistently positive year-over-year trajectory across all these central categories. Drivers in vehicle repair are fairly understood. Car parks growing, getting older every year, and every year, the tests involved in maintaining and repair the vehicle park get increasingly complex, requiring more hours, greater scale, increased wages and more sophisticated tools, hands or power or data-driven tools. There's a significant need for more technicians and greater capabilities. The competition for that talent is growing, and it's being reflected in the rising wages at an everyday level. I think you can see this demand when you're trying to schedule a maintenance appointment or just by visually seeing abundant of cars and trucks in the repair base or parked outside, crowded around the shops waiting for their turn to get in. And in fact, just this month as with a group of franchisees and customers in Bristol, Tennessee, the NHRA Thunder nationals, the drag races, and they energetically expressed their enthusiasm during our conversations. You can feel their optimism resonating with an appreciation for our products, our solutions, and how we make work easier. So we expect that the trajectory of vehicle repair is solid. And we'll continue through the quarters and on into the years ahead, we expect that vehicle repair is the -- we believe that vehicle repair is a great place to operate and the repair information -- our Repair Information Group and our Tools Group are well positioned to take advantage of that. Now on to the critical industries or our commercial and industrial group or C&I takes our business out of the garage and solves to have a consequence where the penalty for failure is high in a wide range of sectors, where custom tools are often required to get the job done. This is also the segment where we have a most significant international presence, and the attended variations from country-to-country with many versions of economic and social headwinds. In the U.S., the landscape actually is pretty positive. We see progress across a number of sectors. Aerospace is strong. Increased demand in commercial aviation and momentum within space that cover exploration. The military business was another strong quarter of growth now better matching actual needs. Natural resources continue to advance in oil and gas and wind after the uncertainty of the last fall, energy repair is a positive place to be. Also begin the period with industrial transportation. Supply chain turbulence, I think has raised the attention on rail and heavy-duty fleets, society now more than ever sees the essential need to keep commercial supply moving and it's accruing positively for us. Now there are tepid spots across the globe. Place is traumatized by the Ukraine war, we see that weaknesses in some of the agent Pacific operations. But one of the clear and large positives in the period is the general rise of critical industries. And our industrial division is well positioned and it's taking advantage with this capability to customize products to a large number of applications, and it's working. Our critical industry teams are on an upward trajectory utilizing their capability and the enhanced capacity to capture significant gains. Overall, the story of Snap-on outside the garage looks quite promising. And as we move forward, we'll continue to capitalize on an abundant potential. And as part of that, we'll keep engaging Snap-on value creation, customer connection and innovation, developing profitable new products and solutions delivered by the insights and knowledge gains standing next to the customers right in the work place and will drive RCI all over the enterprise, including in the Tools Group. We will keep working to increase our franchisee selling capacity with efficient processes, with advanced training programs, with social media and digital content and expanded manufacturing capacity to meet the rising demand all combining to take full advantage of the opportunities and continue the positive trends we've seen into the future. Well, that's a market overview. Now let's move to the segments. For the C&I Group, as reported sales rose 1.4%, including $5.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency. Organic volume was up by 3%. A quite strong performance in the industrial division was attenuated by shortfalls in some of our more challenged areas. Power tools had smaller volumes as customers anticipated the arrival of new products in the third quarter. Our European-based hand tool business, SNA Europe, but our Asia-Pacific operations demonstrated growth in several markets, but softness in Eastern Europe and currency pressure in Japan and the yen was weak was some offset. But our industrial vision isn't just growing in volume. The margins are strong and rising. Customized product is a wonderful thing. So C&I OI was $68.1 million, a 12.4% increase over last year. And the operating margin was 16%, one of the highest ever for the group, representing a gain of 160 basis points over the second quarter of last year. The industrial division wielding the capacity provided by our new building in Kenosha registered significant sales progress. In April, we discussed the recoveries of the military business in the military segment. In this quarter, we continued that momentum, capturing significant long-term contracts, our product line, wide and effective produced in the U.S. made the difference. So we believe things look promising for the military business and for all of our industrial segments. Beyond the industrial division and C&I, our specialty tools operation continue to advance, meeting the need for precision with new torque products, covering a vast spectrum of clamping forces for challenging applications. Torque accuracy is rising an importance and Snap-on is ready to capitalize. We are confident and committed to extending in critical industries, and that conviction is anchored by the ongoing expansion of our lineup of innovative products, explicitly designed for particular tasks, offerings like our automated tool control or ATC enabled by proprietary digital imaging technology that scans toolbox, drawers, recording in real time, which tools are required are removed to replace. It's an increasingly crucial feature for aerospace for industrial manufacturing and for commercial transportation operations. Imagine working out of plan or a locomotive engine and unknowingly leaving a tool behind in the workplace. Not good, not good. This is a mistake that could result in a failure in any tight tolerance mechanism, one small item can be a huge problem. Well, ATC has an answer, keeping track of the tools, identifying missing items, tracing who signed them out and where are those to be used and giving the all clear when everything is returned. So the plans can take off. Snap-on critical industries are on the rise and ATC is part of the reason. And in the quarter, we released our next generation of ATC, a larger touchscreen to improve the shop productivity and upgraded processes with the latest technology for seamless integration with any central IT system. And as you might expect, our customers were enthusiastic, sophisticated products for complex products. It's a winning combination for C&I, and you can see it in the quarter's results. Now on to the Tools Group. Organic sales grew 1.1%, which includes 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency. Growth in the international markets and a slight improvement in the U.S. network. Based on our franchisees and customer feedback, like I said already, vehicle repair is robust. But in the period, our record demand met capacity constraints before our plant expansion, so we're fully operational, limiting some of the potential possibilities and somewhat attenuating the volumes. But for operating earnings, payrolls in the quarter by $13.3 million or 10.7% reaching $137.7 million. That's almost double the pre-pandemic level. The operating margin was 26.3%, a rise of 240 basis points against 50 basis points of negative currency. Let me say that again, Tools Group OI margin was 26.3% [indiscernible] this is an eye-popping number. So the Tools Group had another positive quarter with substantial profitability. We are confident in the strength of our van network and that believe is borne out of quantitative evidence, franchisee health metrics. We monitor them regularly every quarter. And again, this quarter, they remained strong. So what are you talking about talking to the franchisees at Thunder Valley or looking at the numbers, vehicle repair does appear robust and continues to be so. Now when you think of the Tools Group profitability, which is a pretty important subject this time. You think about hand tools, that high margin lineup was -- they were up -- that was up in the period. And new products led the way. One example of successful innovation that came from another customer connection was a number of franchisees observed that diesel technicians struggling to access sensors on Class 8 semi-trucks that were struggling to do that. So to change the part without risking damage. The path had to be cleared by removing several other blocking components. Believe me, that's a time-consuming process. And so armed with customer connection insights, those customer connection insights. Our engineers developed an innovative design, quickly produced a 3D prototype and confirm that it solved the problem. And that 3D tool, SWR5 90-degree special Crowfoot Wrench is being made right now at our Elizabethton Tennessee plant, and it's getting a lot of attention. It really does make truck repair easier. The techs love it, and we kind of like the margins. Profitable customer connection is one of the drivers behind the Tools Group success. And another example of this quarter is our two piece horizontal bushing adapter set. The BJP1 BKS2 [ph], these names are something, text at a Subaru dealership where they were taking a lot of time to remove and store control arm bushings from suspension setups on the newer models. Our team assessed the procedure and designed two new adapters to integrate with our existing ball joint press, and that enabled the fit for the new -- a good bit for the new suspension and say two hours in repair time per procedure, that's a big savings in the garage generated by customer connection and innovation. SNL a while ago, SNL's [indiscernible] said, it's always something. And it's true. There are always new repair challenges, whether the powertrain is internal combustion, plug-in hybrids or EV platforms. Vehicle architecture is getting tighter, packed with more devices, creating additional accessibility constraints, it's all music to our ears. Our franchisees and engineers observe the work, identify complications and simplify the complex and multifaceted tasks to raise efficiency and keep the world moving. And the attendant value is considerable. You can see that in the Tools Group profits. Now one of the highlights of the quarter was the continuing growth of our big ticket sales. A sign of technician confidence in the vehicle repair shop driving some of that trend was our latest tool storage unit, the KMP1023ZLT7, a 72-inch Master Series Roll Cab paining with a unique apparent scheme we call green envy, a break green body paired with black trim. It stands out and makes a statement in any repair shop, but beyond the eye-popping optics the box is also a productivity enhancing powerhouse equipment, 14 drawers, including three spanning the full width of the unit putting the most important tools of any size right at hand. It also offers our popular power drawer and dedicated space equipment. I guess five power outlets and two USB ports for charging a full array of core accessories. And for the hard to manage small parts, our 2-inch speed drawer, makes for easy organization with green NV color coordinated dividers, custom slots for components of various sizes. The box is already one of our hit products. It really energize franchisees and was well received by our customers. And as I said, it helped keep the big ticket train moving. Well, that's the Tools Group, strong profitability, built on solid foundations of innovative products and franchisee success. Mixed with a considerable portion of RCI gain. Now visible as supply that RCI gain is now clearly visible as a supply chain turbulence receives. And now let's go on to RS&I. Sales as reported reached $452 million that represented a $35.2 million or 8.4% increase. Gains in the equipment and OEM essential programs paired with -- gains in equipment and OEM paired with our successful rollout of our new handheld diagnostic platform. The OI in the period was $110.4 million, up 14.7% or 15.4%. Up $14.7 million or 15.4%, and the operating margin was 24.4%, a rise of 140 basis points. Nice. Nice. As we said, the vehicle repair environment is strong, offering significant opportunity and the second quarter results for C&I says it's so. And the recent launch of our new SOLUS+ diagnostic platform was a big key to that success. Great new features. including a two second boot up, the fastest in the industry and an 8-inch colored touch free with 60% higher resolution, making it much easier for technicians to view in brighter lighting. It supports the latest communication protocols, and it offers access to SureTrack. That's our library of vehicle-specific real fixes, repair tips and commonly replace parts that wheels our proprietary database of 2.5 billion repair records and 325 billion vehicle events. SOLUS+, the franchisees have been positive, the customers have been excited and the sales have been robust. New powertrains are driving the need for extending product lines, including vehicle lifts, enabling independent shops and dealerships to accommodate the new models. So -- and in meeting this opportunity with advantage, part of RS&I success has been our undercar equipment division. It's one of the drivers between our -- behind RS&I's strong growth. Take our Challenger Lift Operation in Louisville. The plant offers thousands of SKUs matched a separate lifting task and the numbers have been growing to meet the specific challenges of EV lifting. And in the quarter, that facility hosted Chief Executive magazine Smart Manufacturing Summit, and the event underlines the power of product customization and driving expansion and the extraordinary ability of RCI to render that low volume production quite profitable. It's that approach that drove RCI's gains. OI up 140 basis points in the quarter and we expect that it will keep doing just that as we go forward throughout the group and all across Snap-on. RS&I improving position with repair shop owners and managers, growing OEM relationships, expanding the product offerings, welding RCI everywhere, and it all combined to deliver substantial growth and strong profitability. The Snap-on second quarter, continued opportunities in vehicle repair and critical industries, progress along our runways for coherent growth and advancements down our runways for improvement. Overall sales increasing organically 5.6%, margins strong in every segment. OpCo OI margin 23.3%, up 160 basis points overcoming unfavorable currency and EPS $4.89, up versus all comparisons. It was another encouraging quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?\nAldo Pagliari: Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $1.191 billion in the quarter represented an increase of 4.8% from 2022 levels, reflecting a 5.6% organic sales gain, partially offset by $8.3 million or 80 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency translation. From a geographic perspective, we experienced year-over-year organic sales growth in North and South America as well as Europe, while sales in Asia-Pacific were down low single-digits, mostly due to weakness in the yen contributing to less activity in Japan. Consolidated gross margin improved 200 basis points at 50.7% from 48.7% last year. As gross margins expanded across all of our operating segments, contributions from increased sales volumes and pricing actions, lower material and other costs and benefits from the company's RCI initiatives were partially offset by 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales are 27.4% compared to 27% last year. The increase of 40 basis points is primarily due to increased investment in personnel and other costs. Operating earnings before financial services of $277 million in the quarter compared to $246.6 million in 2022. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services up 23.3%, including 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, reflects an expansion of 160 basis points over last year. Financial services revenue of $93.4 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared to $86.4 million last year, while operating earnings of $66.9 million compared to $65.3 million in 2022. Consolidated operating earnings of $343.9 million in the quarter compared to $311.9 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 26.8% reflects an improvement of 130 basis points from 2022. Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 22.9% compared to 23.8% last year. Net earnings of $264 million or $4.89 per diluted share, including $0.09 share impact from unfavorable foreign currency reflected an increase of $32.5 million or $0.62 per share from 2022 levels and represented a 14.5% year-over-year increase in diluted earnings per share. Now let's turn to our segment results for the quarter. Starting with the C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $364.2 million increased from $359.1 million last year, reflecting a $10.7 million or 3% organic sales gain, which was partially offset by $5.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic growth primarily reflects a double-digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries, partially offset by declines in power tool volumes. With respect to critical industries, sales to the military were robust as was activity in the aviation and heavy-duty sectors. Gross margin improved 220 basis points to 39.5% in the second quarter from 37.3% in 2022. This is largely due to increased volumes in the higher gross margin critical industry sector, pricing actions, lower material and other costs and benefits from RCI initiatives. These improvements were partially offset by 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased 60 basis points to 23.5% in the quarter, from 22.9% in 2022, mostly due to increased sales and higher expense businesses. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $58.1 million compared to $51.7 million last year. The operating margin improved 160 basis points to 16% from 14.4% last year. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales on the Snap-on Tools Group of $523.1 million compared to $520.6 million a year ago, reflecting a 1.1% organic sales gain, partially offset by $3.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales growth reflects a mid single-digit gain in our international operations and slightly higher sales in our U.S. business. Higher sales of hand tools and big ticket items in the quarter were partially offset by lower sales of Power Tools. Gross margin improved 300 basis points to 49% in the quarter from 46% last year. This increase is primarily due to higher sales volumes and pricing actions, lower material and other costs and benefits from RCI initiatives, partially offset by 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Material costs benefited from reduced expenses for various steel types used in our product offering. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales went up by 60 basis points to 22.7% from 22.1% last year, primarily due to increased investment in personnel and other costs. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $137.7 million, including $3.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $124.4 million last year. The operating margin of 26.3%, including 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to 23.9% in 2022, reflecting an improvement of 240 basis points. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $452 million compared to $416.8 million in 2022 reflecting an 8.5% organic sales gain, partially offset by $300,000 of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase is comprised of a double-digit gain in sales of undercar and collision repair equipment, a high single-digit increase in activity with OEM dealerships and a mid single-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers. Gross margin improved a 180 basis points to 45% from 43.2% last year, primarily due to increased sales volumes and pricing actions, lower material and other costs and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales went up by 40 basis points to 20.6% from 20.2% last year, primarily due to increased personnel and other costs. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $110.4 million compared to $95.7 million last year. The operating margin improved 140 basis points to 24.4% from 23% reported last year. Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services increased $7 million to $93.4 million from $86.4 million last year, reflecting the growth of the loan portfolio. Financial services operating earnings of $66.9 million, including $200,000 of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $65.3 million in 2022. Financial services expenses were up $5.4 million from 2022 levels, including $4.9 million of higher provisions for credit losses. The year-over-year increase in provisions reflects both the growth of the portfolio as well as a return to what we believe to be a more normal pre-pandemic rate of provision. Sequentially, the provision for credit losses decreased by about $500,000. For reference, Provisions for finance receivable losses in the current quarter were $13.7 million as compared to $9.1 million in the second quarter last year. In the second quarters of 2019 and 2018, Provisions for losses were $11.9 million and $13.6 million, respectively. In addition, our gross worldwide extended credit of finance receivable portfolio has increased 9.1% year-over-year and we believe the delinquency and portfolio performance trends currently remain stable. In the second quarters of 2023 and 2022, the respective average yield on finance receivables were 17.6% and 17.5%. In the second quarters of 2023 and 2022, the average yield on contract receivables were 8.6% and 8.5%, respectively. Total loan originations of $326.3 million in the second quarter represented an increase of $18.7 million or 6.1% from 2022 levels reflecting a 5.7% increase in originations of finance receivables and an 8.3% increase in originations of contract receivables. Gains in extended credit originations in the U.S. were led by franchisee sales of diagnostic products, including our recently launched SOLUS and ZEUS platforms. Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.4 billion of gross financing receivables with $2.1 billion from our U.S. operation. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.3% for U.S. extended credit compares to 1.4% in 2022. On a sequential basis, the rate is down 20 basis points, reflecting the seasonal trend we typically experience in the second quarter. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $46.4 million represented 2.45% of outstandings at quarter end, which is down slightly from the 2.46% reported at the end of last quarter. Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $270.3 million in the quarter compared to $140.8 million last year. The improvement as compared to the second quarter of 2022 primarily reflects lower year-over-year increases in working capital investment and higher net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $94.6 million included net additions to finance receivables of $68.6 million and capital expenditures of $25.8 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $136.5 million included cash dividends of $85.9 million and the repurchase of 359,000 shares of common stock for $94.8 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $336.7 million of common stock under our existing authorizations. Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $25.1 million from 2022 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 61 days was the same as 2022 year-end. Inventories increased $13 million from 2022 year-end. And on a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.4x compared to 2.5x at year-end 2022. Our quarter end cash position of $871.3 million compared to $757.2 million at year-end 2022. Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 6.5% compared to 9% at year-end 2022. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million available under our credit facilities. And as of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2023. We anticipate that capital expenditures will approximate $100 million. In addition, we currently anticipate that our full-year 2023 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?\nNicholas Pinchuk: Thanks, Aldo. Well, that's the quarter. RCI shining through as the supply sky is clear to show the new levels of performance. Vehicle repair continuing its strength, critical industry is accelerating RS&I growth, both in -- growth in both dealerships and independent shops, advances in helping customize shops to new vehicles, OI margin, 24.4%, up 140 basis points. Tools Group growth attenuated. But strong new products, solving specific problems, creating extraordinary value and an OI of $137.7 million, almost double pre-pandemic levels and OI margins of 26.3%, up 240 basis points, overcoming 50 basis points of unfavorable currency. C&I extending in the critical industries. We're opening new capacity, achieving broad growth and an OI margin of 16%. 160 basis points over last year, also overcoming unfavorable currency and Snap-on credit, profits up, originations rising indicating broad confidence in vehicle repair, and it came together for an attention getting overall performance. Snap-on organic sales rising 5.6%, an OI margin of 23.3%, up 160 basis points and an EPS of $4.89, new levels indeed. It was an encouraging quarter. And we believe that these results, representing new heights highlight the opportunities in our markets. They're essential, demonstrate the power of our approach. It creates extraordinary value solving the critical. And most of all, confirms the strength and reliability of our team, capable and battle-tested reliability of that team to wield our Snap-on value creation processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, all to overcome challenges and drive the corporation higher. And we expect that our decisive advantages -- those sets of advantages and opportunities and approach. And then people will author a continuing upward trajectory even beyond these levels throughout the remainder of this year, and on into 2024. Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I want to speak directly to our associates and franchisees, the Snap-on team. I know many of you are listening. These results do represent new heights. But more than that, there are ringing testimony to your unwavering focus on moving our enterprise forward. Your extraordinary achievements, hard one. Yes, my congratulations. For the capability you demonstrate every day, you have my admiration. And for the unshakable confidence you hold in our path forward, you have my thanks. Operator?\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time, we will take our first question, which will come from Scott Stember with ROTH MKM. Please go ahead.\nScott Stember: Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Nick, you talked about in tools that there was, I guess, it sounded like your ability to meet demand in certain areas was not met because of production. Can you maybe talk about that and maybe tie that into the decline that you talked about in Power Tools?\nNicholas Pinchuk: Sure. Sure. Look, I think they're semi-related, but here's the thing. I think we started -- I probably said 12 times in this pitch. We think the market is robust. So you're not seeing the market in those numbers. The situation simply here is rooted in hand tools and tool storage primarily, where generally, the mix of products we got exceeded our capacity. We expected a certain mix. We got a different mix. And part of that was the people saying, well, power tools is going to launch in the future new products. And therefore, power tools is not so popular, and it was down in the quarter, anticipating those power tools. And so we bumped up against capacity, particularly around the more customized models, which are more difficult to build and more difficult to turn out. So that's pretty much what it was. I mean fundamentally, if you look at power tools, I mean, tools in the quarter, hand tools, biggest ever, biggest ever. And you look at tool storage, not only does the tool storage factory have to supply some -- and hand tools are some of this, but tools storage, not only does the tool storage factory, you have to supply the Tools Group. But when you see the acceleration associated with the critical industries that they have boxes as well. And they were expanded. So put a lot of pressure on those factories. So we couldn't able -- we weren't able to follow the market. But -- we had anticipated expansion. Those expansions are starting to be ready now. So the hand tools plant in Milwaukee. We have about two-thirds of the expansion will be ready this month. And in the fourth quarter, the rest of it will be ready. The Elizabethan tool storage -- not tool storage, but the hand tool plant in Elizabethan will have its expansion in the end of the third quarter to fourth quarter, expanding space and the expansion along our tool storage business is starting to get in place sort of the end of this month. So we're expanding the capacity just that in this quarter, the mix of the products pretty much somewhat reflective of power tools being down and, therefore, filling that in with customized products bumped up against demand.\nScott Stember: Got it. Okay. And as far as sell into the van sell-through, it sounds as if probably...\nNicholas Pinchuk: Pretty good it was above our numbers like it has been for a couple of periods. We like to say that over time, that's all going to even out. But in this quarter, the sell-through was -- fell off the van, we say, was better.\nScott Stember: Okay. And you would expect that to balance out as you were surprised?\nNicholas Pinchuk: It always balances out. A quarter doesn't mean that much in that situation. But what I'm trying to say is that we still think that demand is pretty strong. You see that when you talk to franchisees and customers themselves. And the whole idea, Scott, is big ticket items are an indication of confidence usually in this market. I mean I suppose it isn't for sure. But generally, in our history, when we've seen big ticket items sell and they did. Originations were up and tool storage had -- I think it's one of its best quarters ever, if you put industrial and tools together, that indicates that customers are willing to enter into those longer payback items. And we also saw a nice range of diagnostics numbers this quarter. So those big ticket items really look good, positive sell-through. And so that indicates because the technicians are willing to enter into those longer payback items. And that as they think at least, that the market is good.\nScott Stember: And just to be clear, sales off the van [ph] are stronger right now than into the channel. Got it. All right, that's all I have for now. Thank you.\nNicholas Pinchuk: Okay.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.\nChristopher Glynn: Yes, thanks. Good morning. I had a question on the gross margin, which was very strong. You mentioned supply chain clearing. Is that more or less recovered now? Or does supply chain...\nNicholas Pinchuk: Well, every time I have a review, if somebody brings up something that says they got some spot buys still coming through. But in general, like I said, the skies have cleared, and we're going to get a little more benefit, but most of it is out now. Our big problem was, of course, everybody saw commodity prices to go up and freight price to go up. But the big problem for a company like us is we had spot things in a lot of situations, which we're paying 2x or 3x sometimes what the original price was. And so that ends up going in inventory. Just think about it. If you have in trouble getting stuff, you tend to overbuy it sometimes because you want to have it in stock because you want to deliver as the first priority. And so you get yourself in that situation. And so you're seeing that clear. And so what happens in that situation, the advances in new value products and the RCI we've been doing all this time starts to shine through.\nChristopher Glynn: Great. Thanks for that. And given the expansion at SOT over the past few years and your bandwidth capacity to sell, you've -- I think, grown your actively serviced technicians. I'm wondering, does that reopen the gate to add franchisees and were franchisee -- was U.S. franchisee count? Is that pretty stable, as I understand it to be?\nNicholas Pinchuk: It's pretty stable. We're down a few franchisees this quarter, but not many. It's not a factor for government work, Chris. But -- and we're not -- we're probably not going to add people. We believe that our franchisees sell more because we tell them, you're our guys. And if we do well, so you, and so we believe that subdividing their opportunity probably isn't the best alternative. Now we think we have the world covered. We have, what, 3,400 franchisees around the country. So we think we have most of the places covered. I suppose there's the odd place that we might find that we'd add one or two. But really, that's not going to be a program for us. Our way up is to get the guys to be more aggressive and in this instance, to be able to deliver better. We need to -- we're expanding our capacity, so that should relieve some of the problem. But it's a happy problem actually that people saying we're waiting for your tool storage products.\nChristopher Glynn: Yes. And is franchisee turnover still stable?\nNicholas Pinchuk: It's still about the same -- it's about the same. It's about -- I think it's about 10% and you'd say, Chris, what 5% of that is retirements. You'd say 5% is guys pretty much every year, you'll get that. And so 10% is pretty stable. It had been higher sometimes, but now last multiple quarters has been stable, about that number.\nChristopher Glynn: Great, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question will come from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. David MacGregor, your line is open.\nDavid MacGregor: Here we go. Sorry about that, it was on mute. Good morning everyone.\nNicholas Pinchuk: Good morning.\nDavid MacGregor: I guess I wanted to -- maybe a question for Aldo, but obviously, some huge incremental margins in both Snap-on Tools and in C&I. And you referenced the raw material benefit. So I mean we were expecting to report good margins, but these were certainly above what we were anticipating. How much of this price cost carries forward into 3Q and 4Q? Can you just talk about kind of the trajectory?\nNicholas Pinchuk: I could let out. Okay. Aldo agreed. Okay, you can answer the question, Aldo. Go ahead.\nAldo Pagliari: No. I think, David, I think most of the pricing actions a lot of incurred in the rearview mirror. So what you have now, as Nick has mentioned already, when you attenuate the incremental cost of spot buys have not gone completely, but they're greatly reduced. And steel different grades of steel at different prices, but particularly cold rolled steel, which is used in our tool storage products has come down, and we're able to hold on to the price that was set before and therefore, the benefit of material cost reductions accrue to the margin. So that's what you're seeing. And yes, I think that with a brand like Snap-on and the power of our approach to the market and the demand that Nick described that's out there, I expect that we'll be able to retain these types of margin performance as we move forward. Nothing's guaranteed, of course.\nNicholas Pinchuk: I was watching a show last night and somebody said on the show, it was movie and said, electronic prices only go down, Snap-on prices only go up. We don't drop our -- I mean it's because you've got all the promotions and everything. It's hard to put your finger on it. But generally, I don't see us surrendering that too easily.\nDavid MacGregor: Can I just ask how much of that margin benefit that incremental margin was a result of the capacity constraints forcing the mix towards more customized tools because that sounds like that's fair -- new capacity.\nNicholas Pinchuk: I don't know. It could be -- there could be some of that in there. Certainly, that -- the big factor, though, is there could be some of that. You're probably right. There's some of that. But the big factor, I think is the improvements in the face of the idea of no more spot buys, no more of those huge spot buys. So you're seeing that. Actually, we've been making improvements better than we have been showing for some time because of the material cost. And so what you see that is abating. So you're seeing a lot of that. So basically, I don't know where I put it on the foot of more customized product. We did sell a lot of customized products. So that works but we don't necessarily want to back off it. And so when you do have capacity constraints, you do tend to go to that. But on the other hand, when you got capacity constraint, you spend a little more money. You're looking at the SG&A and stuff like that, SG&A is up a little bit. And it takes you a little bit to manage through that. So you got some goes ins and goes out there. But there's a factor. But the big pack is RCI.\nDavid MacGregor: So let me just ask you about the organic growth of Snap-on tools because you report 1% organic growth. When you were talking about the Snap-on tool gross margin, you say both volume increases and price gains as drivers. So how do we reconcile the volume increases and price gains that you referenced in the gross margin story with the 1% organic growth and essentially flat in the U.S. Do we just take away from that, that the gross margins were essentially all cost reduction as opposed to revenue growth?\nNicholas Pinchuk: Well, look, I mean, some of this can be plant to plant and production line to production line, but I think you can say in aggregate, that's probably true. That's probably true. You don't get much wind in your sales from that kind of increase. It's not zero though, not zero increase. And so you get some of that. You have some international businesses that came back in this situation. So we had some things happen in that situation. but that's got to be the case right? You didn't get that much volume.\nDavid MacGregor: Yes. Last question for me because we're getting at the top of the hour here. But what's the trend in the total number of active stops across the Snap-on system in the U.S.?\nNicholas Pinchuk: Active stocks, meaning what?\nDavid MacGregor: Stops. I mean a number of actual customer locations. I know you track that. So I'm just wondering what's the trend there in terms of the total number of stops?\nNicholas Pinchuk: It's -- I don't have that number right here, but my feeling is it's moving upwards. But we don't really count the stops so much as we count the technicians and the technicians are growing. So we're getting more technicians.\nDavid MacGregor: Great, thanks very much. Thanks for taking the questions.\nNicholas Pinchuk: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Luke Junk with Baird. Please go ahead with your question.\nLuke Junk: Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. Nick, Aldo, good to talk. Nick, first question, I'm just wondering the capacity constraints you ran into the Tools Group this quarter, how that might play out in the near term versus the mix of business that you'd expect in the third quarter and what would typically be little bit of a seasonal decline sequentially. And if I listen to the cadence in terms of things coming online either end of this month or into the early part of the fourth quarter. It sounds like you think you'll be in a better position in the fourth quarter overall from a supply chain standpoint. Am I hearing that right now?\nNicholas Pinchuk: Yes. We think that -- we think the fourth as I've said, probably on every one of these calls in the second quarter, that the third quarter is always kind of squarely because you've got the franchisee conference, then you got vacations, which if franchisees take long vacations that can affect it a little bit or they take short vacations also can affect it. So you have that in place what the Snap-on franchisee conference occurs. Now we might be seeing some little bit of anticipation for that as we did in the power tools. Certainly, power tools is not going to be affected by capacity. I don't think. So that's not going to be. Those new launches shouldn't be affected by capacity. And the capacity is coming online. And so we'll see how efficacious that is. We tend to be pretty good in putting these things in place. So I think you'd be right that the fourth quarter would be -- where we'd be hitting on more cylinders.\nLuke Junk: And then for my follow-up, just hoping you could comment on the trends that you saw in C&I. You mentioned Europe briefly and Asia, you highlighted the weakness that you saw in Japan hoping you could just expand on Europe more broadly in Asia-Pacific, excluding?\nNicholas Pinchuk: Actually, the European business was up in RS&I and interestingly, the U.K. and the Tools Group came off of probably -- it was flat on its back last year, I think. So it came back some. But the C&I business was kind of a little bit up and down in Europe. And so you -- one of the things that was positive was critical industries. So the critical industry in C&I, boy, volumes and margins, new capacity in place smoke, but the other business is up and down, European hand tool based business in a number of different environments like the Nordics and so on, probably affected by concerns over the -- over the war and so on. That is a little bit up and down and not very robust. And I don't know where that's going to tell you. Your guess is as good as mine. I think we're well positioned, but I do think there are macros there that are hard to predict. In Asia-Pacific, boy, it's hard to find too many areas that aren't -- maybe India, I would say is doing well. But generally, a lot of areas seem to be having trouble creating a recovery from the COVID for a number of reasons. China, I think it's well documented. Everybody talks about China. We're holding our own in China. But Japan, the currencies make a little different. The Yen is pretty weak versus the U.S. dollar and has been for a while, and it's weakened recently versus the RMB. So products into Japan are not so competitive in some cases. So that weakens that. And the market itself is down somewhat. So you're seeing those kinds of things play out. I think Asia will start to work its way out because I don't think it has a long-term problem like the war or like some concerns over -- or where they're going to get their fuel or energy. So I think that fixes itself more quickly than Europe by in Europe, I'm not sure where it's going. Now the auto repair business in Europe in terms of the repair shop owners and managers is pretty good, particularly collision. The industrial business, pretty good, the critical industries business. But the basic up and down the street business and our tools business kind of.\nLuke Junk: Okay, I will leave it there. Thanks, Nick.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Please go ahead with your question.\nGary Prestopino: Hey, good morning everyone.\nNicholas Pinchuk: Good morning, Gary.\nGary Prestopino: Nick, I know we've talked about this [indiscernible], but I'm really -- I'm a little bit confused here about what's going on in the Tools Group. Could you maybe just talk about the product segments where you had these capacity constraints? I think you mentioned tool storage, but what other products were you having or segments where you're having issues with capacity installers?\nNicholas Pinchuk: Hand tools. Hand tools is at an all-time high. And some particular products are at over all-time high, like certain versions of the stock. And so when you got those stock, it sometimes your promotion is ready to go on a particular array of sockets as kind of a new package that will address a certain promise and you just don't have the capacity for, say, half of the package. And so that's open to us in a situation. So it's basically those guys bumping up against it and then over the top in tool storage, the industrial business starting to expand its capacity and being able to source more of other products from other people and so on, and break basically, the industrial business have been bound up in a kind of Gordian knot of shipments. I talked about it many times in the quarter. They cut that Gordian knot this quarter and started to ship more and that created more demand on the tool storage and hands tool plant as well.\nGary Prestopino: Okay. And then as we work through the year, you're bringing on capacity and this should alleviate as we work through that?\nNicholas Pinchuk: Yes. I mean we've been saying this for a long time. It's just the particular ordering -- this ordering pattern in this quarter kind of bumped us up against it quicker than we thought. That's simply it.\nGary Prestopino: Were the hand tools typical run-of-the-mill hand tools? Or were they more, like you said, customized? I'm just trying to understand how...\nNicholas Pinchuk: No, they were not so much standard-standard. But there's a lot of lower run. I mean, by that I mean shorter production run hand tool in these kinds of mixes. And when you get into them, they eat up a lot of capacity. You see what I mean because you got to stop and start the machines and so on. So it's not a linear thing necessarily. If it was just standard-standard products, we probably could have shipped out of inventory if we needed to. But these other products make it difficult. But we saw it coming. It was just this particular one with the policy, the idea that people weren't buying as many power tools because they're waiting for the new stuff kind of shifted the mix towards these -- even more towards hand tools and power tools. I mean tool storage.\nGary Prestopino: Okay. I just want to understand what's going on there. And then over time, as things have evolved here, could you maybe -- do you have any numbers or metrics you can circle around? What percentage of what you're doing in the tools or even across the whole company is going into collision repair versus mechanical repair?\nNicholas Pinchuk: It's -- well, let's put it this way. I would say collision repair is about -- let me think about this. Equipment, the undercar equipment business is about one-third of RS&I, and I would say about maybe 20% to quarter of that is collision repair. That kind of ballpark and growing, though because equipment has been growing double-digits for some time. It was up double-digits again, and its margins were up nicely again.\nGary Prestopino: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Sara Verbsky for any closing remarks.\nSara Verbsky: Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly at snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you very much for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Nicholas Pinchuk",
            "content": "Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. Today, I'll start the call by as usual, by covering the highlights of the second quarter, and I'll give you my perspective on the environment and the trends we're seeing. A long way we'll cover the markets. They're encouraging actually. And I'll take you through the segments and the advancements we've made. Then Aldo will provide a detailed review of the financials. We see the second quarter as a period of significance. Sometimes you see a performance where you breakthrough into new heights. And this is one of those times. I'm going to tell you why we believe that to be true. In some ways, though, it was similar. This period was similar to many periods we've seen over time, as we continue to have significant headwinds. And there's always turbulence variation from market-to-market. But we believe it's our job to confront and overcome these obstacles, and we did just that in the second quarter by wielding the strength of our advantages, executing on our strategic runways for growth, making the most of our runways for improvement, and by relying on the skills and dedication of our people. And once again, it paid off the numbers screen it's sold, but here they are. As reported, second quarter sales of $1,191.3 billion were up 4.8% from 2022, including the impact of $8.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Organic activity was up 5.6%. The 12 straight quarter of year-over-year expansion beyond pre-pandemic levels. That's a trend that demonstrates that we believe it is a solid consistency during pretty uncertain times. Now let's talk about the earnings. OpCo operating income for the quarter, including the effects of unfavorable foreign currency was $277 million, up 12.3%. And our OpCo operating margin, the operating margin -- it was 23.3%, up 160 basis points from last year, BAFO. When I said new levels, I mean it. For financial services, the OI of $66.9 million represented an increase of $1.6 million, and it all combined to author an overall consolidated operating margin of 26.8% up 130 basis points from last year. And the second quarter EPS, it was $4.89, up $0.62 or 14.5% from last year's $4.27. I think I'll say it again, $4.89, up 14.5%. The productivity and profitability of Snap-on operations shining through as the supply chain viscosity diminished. We believe Snap-on is stronger now than ever before, and the quarter's profitability makes that crystal clear. Well, those are the overall numbers. Now let's speak to the market, auto repair. Again, this quarter, it's favorable. Miles driven are up. Spending on vehicle maintenance, up. Technician count, up. Technician wages, up. Consistently positive year-over-year trajectory across all these central categories. Drivers in vehicle repair are fairly understood. Car parks growing, getting older every year, and every year, the tests involved in maintaining and repair the vehicle park get increasingly complex, requiring more hours, greater scale, increased wages and more sophisticated tools, hands or power or data-driven tools. There's a significant need for more technicians and greater capabilities. The competition for that talent is growing, and it's being reflected in the rising wages at an everyday level. I think you can see this demand when you're trying to schedule a maintenance appointment or just by visually seeing abundant of cars and trucks in the repair base or parked outside, crowded around the shops waiting for their turn to get in. And in fact, just this month as with a group of franchisees and customers in Bristol, Tennessee, the NHRA Thunder nationals, the drag races, and they energetically expressed their enthusiasm during our conversations. You can feel their optimism resonating with an appreciation for our products, our solutions, and how we make work easier. So we expect that the trajectory of vehicle repair is solid. And we'll continue through the quarters and on into the years ahead, we expect that vehicle repair is the -- we believe that vehicle repair is a great place to operate and the repair information -- our Repair Information Group and our Tools Group are well positioned to take advantage of that. Now on to the critical industries or our commercial and industrial group or C&I takes our business out of the garage and solves to have a consequence where the penalty for failure is high in a wide range of sectors, where custom tools are often required to get the job done. This is also the segment where we have a most significant international presence, and the attended variations from country-to-country with many versions of economic and social headwinds. In the U.S., the landscape actually is pretty positive. We see progress across a number of sectors. Aerospace is strong. Increased demand in commercial aviation and momentum within space that cover exploration. The military business was another strong quarter of growth now better matching actual needs. Natural resources continue to advance in oil and gas and wind after the uncertainty of the last fall, energy repair is a positive place to be. Also begin the period with industrial transportation. Supply chain turbulence, I think has raised the attention on rail and heavy-duty fleets, society now more than ever sees the essential need to keep commercial supply moving and it's accruing positively for us. Now there are tepid spots across the globe. Place is traumatized by the Ukraine war, we see that weaknesses in some of the agent Pacific operations. But one of the clear and large positives in the period is the general rise of critical industries. And our industrial division is well positioned and it's taking advantage with this capability to customize products to a large number of applications, and it's working. Our critical industry teams are on an upward trajectory utilizing their capability and the enhanced capacity to capture significant gains. Overall, the story of Snap-on outside the garage looks quite promising. And as we move forward, we'll continue to capitalize on an abundant potential. And as part of that, we'll keep engaging Snap-on value creation, customer connection and innovation, developing profitable new products and solutions delivered by the insights and knowledge gains standing next to the customers right in the work place and will drive RCI all over the enterprise, including in the Tools Group. We will keep working to increase our franchisee selling capacity with efficient processes, with advanced training programs, with social media and digital content and expanded manufacturing capacity to meet the rising demand all combining to take full advantage of the opportunities and continue the positive trends we've seen into the future. Well, that's a market overview. Now let's move to the segments. For the C&I Group, as reported sales rose 1.4%, including $5.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency. Organic volume was up by 3%. A quite strong performance in the industrial division was attenuated by shortfalls in some of our more challenged areas. Power tools had smaller volumes as customers anticipated the arrival of new products in the third quarter. Our European-based hand tool business, SNA Europe, but our Asia-Pacific operations demonstrated growth in several markets, but softness in Eastern Europe and currency pressure in Japan and the yen was weak was some offset. But our industrial vision isn't just growing in volume. The margins are strong and rising. Customized product is a wonderful thing. So C&I OI was $68.1 million, a 12.4% increase over last year. And the operating margin was 16%, one of the highest ever for the group, representing a gain of 160 basis points over the second quarter of last year. The industrial division wielding the capacity provided by our new building in Kenosha registered significant sales progress. In April, we discussed the recoveries of the military business in the military segment. In this quarter, we continued that momentum, capturing significant long-term contracts, our product line, wide and effective produced in the U.S. made the difference. So we believe things look promising for the military business and for all of our industrial segments. Beyond the industrial division and C&I, our specialty tools operation continue to advance, meeting the need for precision with new torque products, covering a vast spectrum of clamping forces for challenging applications. Torque accuracy is rising an importance and Snap-on is ready to capitalize. We are confident and committed to extending in critical industries, and that conviction is anchored by the ongoing expansion of our lineup of innovative products, explicitly designed for particular tasks, offerings like our automated tool control or ATC enabled by proprietary digital imaging technology that scans toolbox, drawers, recording in real time, which tools are required are removed to replace. It's an increasingly crucial feature for aerospace for industrial manufacturing and for commercial transportation operations. Imagine working out of plan or a locomotive engine and unknowingly leaving a tool behind in the workplace. Not good, not good. This is a mistake that could result in a failure in any tight tolerance mechanism, one small item can be a huge problem. Well, ATC has an answer, keeping track of the tools, identifying missing items, tracing who signed them out and where are those to be used and giving the all clear when everything is returned. So the plans can take off. Snap-on critical industries are on the rise and ATC is part of the reason. And in the quarter, we released our next generation of ATC, a larger touchscreen to improve the shop productivity and upgraded processes with the latest technology for seamless integration with any central IT system. And as you might expect, our customers were enthusiastic, sophisticated products for complex products. It's a winning combination for C&I, and you can see it in the quarter's results. Now on to the Tools Group. Organic sales grew 1.1%, which includes 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency. Growth in the international markets and a slight improvement in the U.S. network. Based on our franchisees and customer feedback, like I said already, vehicle repair is robust. But in the period, our record demand met capacity constraints before our plant expansion, so we're fully operational, limiting some of the potential possibilities and somewhat attenuating the volumes. But for operating earnings, payrolls in the quarter by $13.3 million or 10.7% reaching $137.7 million. That's almost double the pre-pandemic level. The operating margin was 26.3%, a rise of 240 basis points against 50 basis points of negative currency. Let me say that again, Tools Group OI margin was 26.3% [indiscernible] this is an eye-popping number. So the Tools Group had another positive quarter with substantial profitability. We are confident in the strength of our van network and that believe is borne out of quantitative evidence, franchisee health metrics. We monitor them regularly every quarter. And again, this quarter, they remained strong. So what are you talking about talking to the franchisees at Thunder Valley or looking at the numbers, vehicle repair does appear robust and continues to be so. Now when you think of the Tools Group profitability, which is a pretty important subject this time. You think about hand tools, that high margin lineup was -- they were up -- that was up in the period. And new products led the way. One example of successful innovation that came from another customer connection was a number of franchisees observed that diesel technicians struggling to access sensors on Class 8 semi-trucks that were struggling to do that. So to change the part without risking damage. The path had to be cleared by removing several other blocking components. Believe me, that's a time-consuming process. And so armed with customer connection insights, those customer connection insights. Our engineers developed an innovative design, quickly produced a 3D prototype and confirm that it solved the problem. And that 3D tool, SWR5 90-degree special Crowfoot Wrench is being made right now at our Elizabethton Tennessee plant, and it's getting a lot of attention. It really does make truck repair easier. The techs love it, and we kind of like the margins. Profitable customer connection is one of the drivers behind the Tools Group success. And another example of this quarter is our two piece horizontal bushing adapter set. The BJP1 BKS2 [ph], these names are something, text at a Subaru dealership where they were taking a lot of time to remove and store control arm bushings from suspension setups on the newer models. Our team assessed the procedure and designed two new adapters to integrate with our existing ball joint press, and that enabled the fit for the new -- a good bit for the new suspension and say two hours in repair time per procedure, that's a big savings in the garage generated by customer connection and innovation. SNL a while ago, SNL's [indiscernible] said, it's always something. And it's true. There are always new repair challenges, whether the powertrain is internal combustion, plug-in hybrids or EV platforms. Vehicle architecture is getting tighter, packed with more devices, creating additional accessibility constraints, it's all music to our ears. Our franchisees and engineers observe the work, identify complications and simplify the complex and multifaceted tasks to raise efficiency and keep the world moving. And the attendant value is considerable. You can see that in the Tools Group profits. Now one of the highlights of the quarter was the continuing growth of our big ticket sales. A sign of technician confidence in the vehicle repair shop driving some of that trend was our latest tool storage unit, the KMP1023ZLT7, a 72-inch Master Series Roll Cab paining with a unique apparent scheme we call green envy, a break green body paired with black trim. It stands out and makes a statement in any repair shop, but beyond the eye-popping optics the box is also a productivity enhancing powerhouse equipment, 14 drawers, including three spanning the full width of the unit putting the most important tools of any size right at hand. It also offers our popular power drawer and dedicated space equipment. I guess five power outlets and two USB ports for charging a full array of core accessories. And for the hard to manage small parts, our 2-inch speed drawer, makes for easy organization with green NV color coordinated dividers, custom slots for components of various sizes. The box is already one of our hit products. It really energize franchisees and was well received by our customers. And as I said, it helped keep the big ticket train moving. Well, that's the Tools Group, strong profitability, built on solid foundations of innovative products and franchisee success. Mixed with a considerable portion of RCI gain. Now visible as supply that RCI gain is now clearly visible as a supply chain turbulence receives. And now let's go on to RS&I. Sales as reported reached $452 million that represented a $35.2 million or 8.4% increase. Gains in the equipment and OEM essential programs paired with -- gains in equipment and OEM paired with our successful rollout of our new handheld diagnostic platform. The OI in the period was $110.4 million, up 14.7% or 15.4%. Up $14.7 million or 15.4%, and the operating margin was 24.4%, a rise of 140 basis points. Nice. Nice. As we said, the vehicle repair environment is strong, offering significant opportunity and the second quarter results for C&I says it's so. And the recent launch of our new SOLUS+ diagnostic platform was a big key to that success. Great new features. including a two second boot up, the fastest in the industry and an 8-inch colored touch free with 60% higher resolution, making it much easier for technicians to view in brighter lighting. It supports the latest communication protocols, and it offers access to SureTrack. That's our library of vehicle-specific real fixes, repair tips and commonly replace parts that wheels our proprietary database of 2.5 billion repair records and 325 billion vehicle events. SOLUS+, the franchisees have been positive, the customers have been excited and the sales have been robust. New powertrains are driving the need for extending product lines, including vehicle lifts, enabling independent shops and dealerships to accommodate the new models. So -- and in meeting this opportunity with advantage, part of RS&I success has been our undercar equipment division. It's one of the drivers between our -- behind RS&I's strong growth. Take our Challenger Lift Operation in Louisville. The plant offers thousands of SKUs matched a separate lifting task and the numbers have been growing to meet the specific challenges of EV lifting. And in the quarter, that facility hosted Chief Executive magazine Smart Manufacturing Summit, and the event underlines the power of product customization and driving expansion and the extraordinary ability of RCI to render that low volume production quite profitable. It's that approach that drove RCI's gains. OI up 140 basis points in the quarter and we expect that it will keep doing just that as we go forward throughout the group and all across Snap-on. RS&I improving position with repair shop owners and managers, growing OEM relationships, expanding the product offerings, welding RCI everywhere, and it all combined to deliver substantial growth and strong profitability. The Snap-on second quarter, continued opportunities in vehicle repair and critical industries, progress along our runways for coherent growth and advancements down our runways for improvement. Overall sales increasing organically 5.6%, margins strong in every segment. OpCo OI margin 23.3%, up 160 basis points overcoming unfavorable currency and EPS $4.89, up versus all comparisons. It was another encouraging quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Thanks, Aldo. Well, that's the quarter. RCI shining through as the supply sky is clear to show the new levels of performance. Vehicle repair continuing its strength, critical industry is accelerating RS&I growth, both in -- growth in both dealerships and independent shops, advances in helping customize shops to new vehicles, OI margin, 24.4%, up 140 basis points. Tools Group growth attenuated. But strong new products, solving specific problems, creating extraordinary value and an OI of $137.7 million, almost double pre-pandemic levels and OI margins of 26.3%, up 240 basis points, overcoming 50 basis points of unfavorable currency. C&I extending in the critical industries. We're opening new capacity, achieving broad growth and an OI margin of 16%. 160 basis points over last year, also overcoming unfavorable currency and Snap-on credit, profits up, originations rising indicating broad confidence in vehicle repair, and it came together for an attention getting overall performance. Snap-on organic sales rising 5.6%, an OI margin of 23.3%, up 160 basis points and an EPS of $4.89, new levels indeed. It was an encouraging quarter. And we believe that these results, representing new heights highlight the opportunities in our markets. They're essential, demonstrate the power of our approach. It creates extraordinary value solving the critical. And most of all, confirms the strength and reliability of our team, capable and battle-tested reliability of that team to wield our Snap-on value creation processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, all to overcome challenges and drive the corporation higher. And we expect that our decisive advantages -- those sets of advantages and opportunities and approach. And then people will author a continuing upward trajectory even beyond these levels throughout the remainder of this year, and on into 2024. Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I want to speak directly to our associates and franchisees, the Snap-on team. I know many of you are listening. These results do represent new heights. But more than that, there are ringing testimony to your unwavering focus on moving our enterprise forward. Your extraordinary achievements, hard one. Yes, my congratulations. For the capability you demonstrate every day, you have my admiration. And for the unshakable confidence you hold in our path forward, you have my thanks. Operator? Sure. Sure. Look, I think they're semi-related, but here's the thing. I think we started -- I probably said 12 times in this pitch. We think the market is robust. So you're not seeing the market in those numbers. The situation simply here is rooted in hand tools and tool storage primarily, where generally, the mix of products we got exceeded our capacity. We expected a certain mix. We got a different mix. And part of that was the people saying, well, power tools is going to launch in the future new products. And therefore, power tools is not so popular, and it was down in the quarter, anticipating those power tools. And so we bumped up against capacity, particularly around the more customized models, which are more difficult to build and more difficult to turn out. So that's pretty much what it was. I mean fundamentally, if you look at power tools, I mean, tools in the quarter, hand tools, biggest ever, biggest ever. And you look at tool storage, not only does the tool storage factory have to supply some -- and hand tools are some of this, but tools storage, not only does the tool storage factory, you have to supply the Tools Group. But when you see the acceleration associated with the critical industries that they have boxes as well. And they were expanded. So put a lot of pressure on those factories. So we couldn't able -- we weren't able to follow the market. But -- we had anticipated expansion. Those expansions are starting to be ready now. So the hand tools plant in Milwaukee. We have about two-thirds of the expansion will be ready this month. And in the fourth quarter, the rest of it will be ready. The Elizabethan tool storage -- not tool storage, but the hand tool plant in Elizabethan will have its expansion in the end of the third quarter to fourth quarter, expanding space and the expansion along our tool storage business is starting to get in place sort of the end of this month. So we're expanding the capacity just that in this quarter, the mix of the products pretty much somewhat reflective of power tools being down and, therefore, filling that in with customized products bumped up against demand. Pretty good it was above our numbers like it has been for a couple of periods. We like to say that over time, that's all going to even out. But in this quarter, the sell-through was -- fell off the van, we say, was better. It always balances out. A quarter doesn't mean that much in that situation. But what I'm trying to say is that we still think that demand is pretty strong. You see that when you talk to franchisees and customers themselves. And the whole idea, Scott, is big ticket items are an indication of confidence usually in this market. I mean I suppose it isn't for sure. But generally, in our history, when we've seen big ticket items sell and they did. Originations were up and tool storage had -- I think it's one of its best quarters ever, if you put industrial and tools together, that indicates that customers are willing to enter into those longer payback items. And we also saw a nice range of diagnostics numbers this quarter. So those big ticket items really look good, positive sell-through. And so that indicates because the technicians are willing to enter into those longer payback items. And that as they think at least, that the market is good. Okay. Well, every time I have a review, if somebody brings up something that says they got some spot buys still coming through. But in general, like I said, the skies have cleared, and we're going to get a little more benefit, but most of it is out now. Our big problem was, of course, everybody saw commodity prices to go up and freight price to go up. But the big problem for a company like us is we had spot things in a lot of situations, which we're paying 2x or 3x sometimes what the original price was. And so that ends up going in inventory. Just think about it. If you have in trouble getting stuff, you tend to overbuy it sometimes because you want to have it in stock because you want to deliver as the first priority. And so you get yourself in that situation. And so you're seeing that clear. And so what happens in that situation, the advances in new value products and the RCI we've been doing all this time starts to shine through. It's pretty stable. We're down a few franchisees this quarter, but not many. It's not a factor for government work, Chris. But -- and we're not -- we're probably not going to add people. We believe that our franchisees sell more because we tell them, you're our guys. And if we do well, so you, and so we believe that subdividing their opportunity probably isn't the best alternative. Now we think we have the world covered. We have, what, 3,400 franchisees around the country. So we think we have most of the places covered. I suppose there's the odd place that we might find that we'd add one or two. But really, that's not going to be a program for us. Our way up is to get the guys to be more aggressive and in this instance, to be able to deliver better. We need to -- we're expanding our capacity, so that should relieve some of the problem. But it's a happy problem actually that people saying we're waiting for your tool storage products. It's still about the same -- it's about the same. It's about -- I think it's about 10% and you'd say, Chris, what 5% of that is retirements. You'd say 5% is guys pretty much every year, you'll get that. And so 10% is pretty stable. It had been higher sometimes, but now last multiple quarters has been stable, about that number. Good morning. I could let out. Okay. Aldo agreed. Okay, you can answer the question, Aldo. Go ahead. I was watching a show last night and somebody said on the show, it was movie and said, electronic prices only go down, Snap-on prices only go up. We don't drop our -- I mean it's because you've got all the promotions and everything. It's hard to put your finger on it. But generally, I don't see us surrendering that too easily. I don't know. It could be -- there could be some of that in there. Certainly, that -- the big factor, though, is there could be some of that. You're probably right. There's some of that. But the big factor, I think is the improvements in the face of the idea of no more spot buys, no more of those huge spot buys. So you're seeing that. Actually, we've been making improvements better than we have been showing for some time because of the material cost. And so what you see that is abating. So you're seeing a lot of that. So basically, I don't know where I put it on the foot of more customized product. We did sell a lot of customized products. So that works but we don't necessarily want to back off it. And so when you do have capacity constraints, you do tend to go to that. But on the other hand, when you got capacity constraint, you spend a little more money. You're looking at the SG&A and stuff like that, SG&A is up a little bit. And it takes you a little bit to manage through that. So you got some goes ins and goes out there. But there's a factor. But the big pack is RCI. Well, look, I mean, some of this can be plant to plant and production line to production line, but I think you can say in aggregate, that's probably true. That's probably true. You don't get much wind in your sales from that kind of increase. It's not zero though, not zero increase. And so you get some of that. You have some international businesses that came back in this situation. So we had some things happen in that situation. but that's got to be the case right? You didn't get that much volume. Active stocks, meaning what? It's -- I don't have that number right here, but my feeling is it's moving upwards. But we don't really count the stops so much as we count the technicians and the technicians are growing. So we're getting more technicians. Yes. Yes. We think that -- we think the fourth as I've said, probably on every one of these calls in the second quarter, that the third quarter is always kind of squarely because you've got the franchisee conference, then you got vacations, which if franchisees take long vacations that can affect it a little bit or they take short vacations also can affect it. So you have that in place what the Snap-on franchisee conference occurs. Now we might be seeing some little bit of anticipation for that as we did in the power tools. Certainly, power tools is not going to be affected by capacity. I don't think. So that's not going to be. Those new launches shouldn't be affected by capacity. And the capacity is coming online. And so we'll see how efficacious that is. We tend to be pretty good in putting these things in place. So I think you'd be right that the fourth quarter would be -- where we'd be hitting on more cylinders. Actually, the European business was up in RS&I and interestingly, the U.K. and the Tools Group came off of probably -- it was flat on its back last year, I think. So it came back some. But the C&I business was kind of a little bit up and down in Europe. And so you -- one of the things that was positive was critical industries. So the critical industry in C&I, boy, volumes and margins, new capacity in place smoke, but the other business is up and down, European hand tool based business in a number of different environments like the Nordics and so on, probably affected by concerns over the -- over the war and so on. That is a little bit up and down and not very robust. And I don't know where that's going to tell you. Your guess is as good as mine. I think we're well positioned, but I do think there are macros there that are hard to predict. In Asia-Pacific, boy, it's hard to find too many areas that aren't -- maybe India, I would say is doing well. But generally, a lot of areas seem to be having trouble creating a recovery from the COVID for a number of reasons. China, I think it's well documented. Everybody talks about China. We're holding our own in China. But Japan, the currencies make a little different. The Yen is pretty weak versus the U.S. dollar and has been for a while, and it's weakened recently versus the RMB. So products into Japan are not so competitive in some cases. So that weakens that. And the market itself is down somewhat. So you're seeing those kinds of things play out. I think Asia will start to work its way out because I don't think it has a long-term problem like the war or like some concerns over -- or where they're going to get their fuel or energy. So I think that fixes itself more quickly than Europe by in Europe, I'm not sure where it's going. Now the auto repair business in Europe in terms of the repair shop owners and managers is pretty good, particularly collision. The industrial business, pretty good, the critical industries business. But the basic up and down the street business and our tools business kind of. Good morning, Gary. Hand tools. Hand tools is at an all-time high. And some particular products are at over all-time high, like certain versions of the stock. And so when you got those stock, it sometimes your promotion is ready to go on a particular array of sockets as kind of a new package that will address a certain promise and you just don't have the capacity for, say, half of the package. And so that's open to us in a situation. So it's basically those guys bumping up against it and then over the top in tool storage, the industrial business starting to expand its capacity and being able to source more of other products from other people and so on, and break basically, the industrial business have been bound up in a kind of Gordian knot of shipments. I talked about it many times in the quarter. They cut that Gordian knot this quarter and started to ship more and that created more demand on the tool storage and hands tool plant as well. Yes. I mean we've been saying this for a long time. It's just the particular ordering -- this ordering pattern in this quarter kind of bumped us up against it quicker than we thought. That's simply it. No, they were not so much standard-standard. But there's a lot of lower run. I mean, by that I mean shorter production run hand tool in these kinds of mixes. And when you get into them, they eat up a lot of capacity. You see what I mean because you got to stop and start the machines and so on. So it's not a linear thing necessarily. If it was just standard-standard products, we probably could have shipped out of inventory if we needed to. But these other products make it difficult. But we saw it coming. It was just this particular one with the policy, the idea that people weren't buying as many power tools because they're waiting for the new stuff kind of shifted the mix towards these -- even more towards hand tools and power tools. I mean tool storage. It's -- well, let's put it this way. I would say collision repair is about -- let me think about this. Equipment, the undercar equipment business is about one-third of RS&I, and I would say about maybe 20% to quarter of that is collision repair. That kind of ballpark and growing, though because equipment has been growing double-digits for some time. It was up double-digits again, and its margins were up nicely again."

            "content": "Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $1.191 billion in the quarter represented an increase of 4.8% from 2022 levels, reflecting a 5.6% organic sales gain, partially offset by $8.3 million or 80 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency translation. From a geographic perspective, we experienced year-over-year organic sales growth in North and South America as well as Europe, while sales in Asia-Pacific were down low single-digits, mostly due to weakness in the yen contributing to less activity in Japan. Consolidated gross margin improved 200 basis points at 50.7% from 48.7% last year. As gross margins expanded across all of our operating segments, contributions from increased sales volumes and pricing actions, lower material and other costs and benefits from the company's RCI initiatives were partially offset by 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales are 27.4% compared to 27% last year. The increase of 40 basis points is primarily due to increased investment in personnel and other costs. Operating earnings before financial services of $277 million in the quarter compared to $246.6 million in 2022. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services up 23.3%, including 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, reflects an expansion of 160 basis points over last year. Financial services revenue of $93.4 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared to $86.4 million last year, while operating earnings of $66.9 million compared to $65.3 million in 2022. Consolidated operating earnings of $343.9 million in the quarter compared to $311.9 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 26.8% reflects an improvement of 130 basis points from 2022. Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 22.9% compared to 23.8% last year. Net earnings of $264 million or $4.89 per diluted share, including $0.09 share impact from unfavorable foreign currency reflected an increase of $32.5 million or $0.62 per share from 2022 levels and represented a 14.5% year-over-year increase in diluted earnings per share. Now let's turn to our segment results for the quarter. Starting with the C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $364.2 million increased from $359.1 million last year, reflecting a $10.7 million or 3% organic sales gain, which was partially offset by $5.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic growth primarily reflects a double-digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries, partially offset by declines in power tool volumes. With respect to critical industries, sales to the military were robust as was activity in the aviation and heavy-duty sectors. Gross margin improved 220 basis points to 39.5% in the second quarter from 37.3% in 2022. This is largely due to increased volumes in the higher gross margin critical industry sector, pricing actions, lower material and other costs and benefits from RCI initiatives. These improvements were partially offset by 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased 60 basis points to 23.5% in the quarter, from 22.9% in 2022, mostly due to increased sales and higher expense businesses. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $58.1 million compared to $51.7 million last year. The operating margin improved 160 basis points to 16% from 14.4% last year. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales on the Snap-on Tools Group of $523.1 million compared to $520.6 million a year ago, reflecting a 1.1% organic sales gain, partially offset by $3.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales growth reflects a mid single-digit gain in our international operations and slightly higher sales in our U.S. business. Higher sales of hand tools and big ticket items in the quarter were partially offset by lower sales of Power Tools. Gross margin improved 300 basis points to 49% in the quarter from 46% last year. This increase is primarily due to higher sales volumes and pricing actions, lower material and other costs and benefits from RCI initiatives, partially offset by 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Material costs benefited from reduced expenses for various steel types used in our product offering. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales went up by 60 basis points to 22.7% from 22.1% last year, primarily due to increased investment in personnel and other costs. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $137.7 million, including $3.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $124.4 million last year. The operating margin of 26.3%, including 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to 23.9% in 2022, reflecting an improvement of 240 basis points. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $452 million compared to $416.8 million in 2022 reflecting an 8.5% organic sales gain, partially offset by $300,000 of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase is comprised of a double-digit gain in sales of undercar and collision repair equipment, a high single-digit increase in activity with OEM dealerships and a mid single-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers. Gross margin improved a 180 basis points to 45% from 43.2% last year, primarily due to increased sales volumes and pricing actions, lower material and other costs and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales went up by 40 basis points to 20.6% from 20.2% last year, primarily due to increased personnel and other costs. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $110.4 million compared to $95.7 million last year. The operating margin improved 140 basis points to 24.4% from 23% reported last year. Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services increased $7 million to $93.4 million from $86.4 million last year, reflecting the growth of the loan portfolio. Financial services operating earnings of $66.9 million, including $200,000 of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $65.3 million in 2022. Financial services expenses were up $5.4 million from 2022 levels, including $4.9 million of higher provisions for credit losses. The year-over-year increase in provisions reflects both the growth of the portfolio as well as a return to what we believe to be a more normal pre-pandemic rate of provision. Sequentially, the provision for credit losses decreased by about $500,000. For reference, Provisions for finance receivable losses in the current quarter were $13.7 million as compared to $9.1 million in the second quarter last year. In the second quarters of 2019 and 2018, Provisions for losses were $11.9 million and $13.6 million, respectively. In addition, our gross worldwide extended credit of finance receivable portfolio has increased 9.1% year-over-year and we believe the delinquency and portfolio performance trends currently remain stable. In the second quarters of 2023 and 2022, the respective average yield on finance receivables were 17.6% and 17.5%. In the second quarters of 2023 and 2022, the average yield on contract receivables were 8.6% and 8.5%, respectively. Total loan originations of $326.3 million in the second quarter represented an increase of $18.7 million or 6.1% from 2022 levels reflecting a 5.7% increase in originations of finance receivables and an 8.3% increase in originations of contract receivables. Gains in extended credit originations in the U.S. were led by franchisee sales of diagnostic products, including our recently launched SOLUS and ZEUS platforms. Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.4 billion of gross financing receivables with $2.1 billion from our U.S. operation. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.3% for U.S. extended credit compares to 1.4% in 2022. On a sequential basis, the rate is down 20 basis points, reflecting the seasonal trend we typically experience in the second quarter. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $46.4 million represented 2.45% of outstandings at quarter end, which is down slightly from the 2.46% reported at the end of last quarter. Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $270.3 million in the quarter compared to $140.8 million last year. The improvement as compared to the second quarter of 2022 primarily reflects lower year-over-year increases in working capital investment and higher net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $94.6 million included net additions to finance receivables of $68.6 million and capital expenditures of $25.8 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $136.5 million included cash dividends of $85.9 million and the repurchase of 359,000 shares of common stock for $94.8 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $336.7 million of common stock under our existing authorizations. Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $25.1 million from 2022 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 61 days was the same as 2022 year-end. Inventories increased $13 million from 2022 year-end. And on a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.4x compared to 2.5x at year-end 2022. Our quarter end cash position of $871.3 million compared to $757.2 million at year-end 2022. Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 6.5% compared to 9% at year-end 2022. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million available under our credit facilities. And as of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2023. We anticipate that capital expenditures will approximate $100 million. In addition, we currently anticipate that our full-year 2023 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? No. I think, David, I think most of the pricing actions a lot of incurred in the rearview mirror. So what you have now, as Nick has mentioned already, when you attenuate the incremental cost of spot buys have not gone completely, but they're greatly reduced. And steel different grades of steel at different prices, but particularly cold rolled steel, which is used in our tool storage products has come down, and we're able to hold on to the price that was set before and therefore, the benefit of material cost reductions accrue to the margin. So that's what you're seeing. And yes, I think that with a brand like Snap-on and the power of our approach to the market and the demand that Nick described that's out there, I expect that we'll be able to retain these types of margin performance as we move forward. Nothing's guaranteed, of course."

As usual, I\u2019ll start the call by covering the highlights of the first quarter, and I\u2019ll give you my perspective on what it all means. And then Aldo will provide a detailed review of the financials. Along the way, we\u2019ll cover the markets, the robust gangbusters. We\u2019ll also give you a view of our momentum. It\u2019s been unbroken and vibrant. Once again, the story of our quarter is continued resilience. Our ability to navigate the complex while knowing that with the flip of a calendar -- the flip of a calendar will bring new challenges. You could pick up any significant publication or listen or watch any business show and you will encounter a barrage of concerns, the measures of adversity and contraction. But we know, we can resist the difficulties, and so we have for the past three months and for quarter after quarter. You see, we\u2019re armed with significant advantages. Our market\u2019s displaying resilience; born out of criticality, our brand standing above delivering quality and reinforcing personal pride; our products. They clearly move the world forward by making the critical easier; and finally, our people, our team, experienced, capable and confident. We are encouraged by this quarter, and I\u2019ll tell you why. Our reported sales in the period were $1,183 million, up versus last year by $85.2 million or 7.8%, including $24 million or 240 basis points of unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales, they were up 10.2%, increases in every group, our 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating expansion. Our OpCo operating income for the quarter was $259.8 million, including $7.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency, increasing by 16.5%. And the operating margin -- the operating margin, it was 22%, rising 170 basis points over last year. For financial services, operating income of $66.3 million compared to last year\u2019s $70.4 million. And that combined with OpCo -- and that combined with OpCo resulted in a consolidated operating margin of 25.6%, an 80 basis-point improvement. And the first quarter\u2019s EPS, $4.60, up $0.60 or 15% from last year\u2019s $4. So we believe our confidence and our ongoing optimism is clearly justified by the numbers. Now, let\u2019s look closer at our markets. The automotive repair environment remains hot, demand across all disciplines. We continue investing in new products and accommodating the repair challenges of newer models, matching the increased complexity. As platforms change, the modification requires new tools to accomplish the task and we\u2019re keeping pace. Whether it\u2019s an internal combustion engine or an electric vehicle, the techs need an assist, and we\u2019re ready to bring it. The updates create a range of challenges, new challenges, from accessibility issues associated with confined spaces requiring new designs of varying geometries, to tighter engineering challenges fueling the need for precision torque instrument to the increasing number of fasteners and listing our power tools to remove and install parts efficiently to the rise of drive by wire. More electronics -- the more the electronics, the greater the need for handheld diagnostics and special software that can communicate with and manage the neural network of computers and sensors. We\u2019re seeing strength in OEM dealerships. As new models break on to the market, new arrays of essential tools, equipment and diagnostics are needed to service the different and unique characteristics of each vehicle. For independent repair shops, business is booming. If you\u2019re taking your vehicle in for service, recently, you\u2019ve witnessed this first hand, the pays are full and the parking lots are chockablock. And when I speak with our franchisees, they are enthusiastic, saying demand is robust. It\u2019s written all over the numbers. Garages are scheduled further out for shops of all types. Owners see the growth. They know they need technicians. And as you might expect, the rise in the tech count is substantial and the wages are moving up. And then, of course, this is all music to our ears. We believe that with the new vehicle models, the rise of automation, the growing need for precision and the increasing vehicle complexity, we may be entering the golden age of vehicle repair and our numbers say it may be so. So people repair. It\u2019s a great place to operate for our Tools Group and for our Repair Systems & Information Group, RS&I. And we believe it\u2019s only getting better. Now, let\u2019s talk about the critical industries where commercial and industrial or C&I, take Snap-on out of the garage, solving tasks of consequences, representing our most significant international presence. It\u2019s an area where we\u2019re -- I suppose, most subject to global headwinds, but the news is still reasonably encouraging. The critical industries kept rising across sectors, aviation, education, heavy-duty fleets, general industry and natural resources, all up. And the military, once down, is now rebounding with high demand. And for geographies, North America was strong. Europe was improved even in the face of ongoing -- of the ongoing war in Ukraine and the revenue disruption of the Brexit, and Asia Pacific remained mixed, variation across the landscape. But overall, the critical industry markets of C&I showed significant and broad positives, every sector. The first quarter is marked by substantial strides in that arena, and we see more opportunity on the horizon. We believe there\u2019s abundant and ongoing potential all along our runways for growth, enhancing the van network, expanding with repair shop owners and managers, extending the critical industry and building in emerging markets, leveraging our expansive product line, wielding our strengthening brand and deploying the increasing understanding of the task, connecting to the customer, standing face-to-face in the workplace where the tasks are performed, observing the work, turning that insight into innovative new products and some in the future for professionals. And we amplify that endeavor by applying a generous helping of rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, as we call it, driving our productivity and our margin upwards. So, that\u2019s our view of the market. Now, let\u2019s turn to the groups. In the C&I Group, sales of $363.8 million, including $12.5 million unfavorable foreign currency, increased 7% to last year. Organic sales were up 11.1% with double-digit gains in critical industries and specialty torque that precision leading the way. C&I\u2019s operating income of $55.8 million, including $2 million of unfavorable foreign currency, represents an increase of 22.1% over last year, and the operating margin was 15.3%, up 190 basis points from the 2022 level, promising numbers. C&I demonstrated considerable growth, despite the ongoing uncertainty across geographies. One of the factors that\u2019s been attenuating C&I in the recent past was the impact of supply turbulence. The customized -- you heard me say it on the calls, the customized kits with many different products are vulnerable to availability disruption. And one of the drivers behind the C&I rise were the improvements along the supply chain. During the period, we started to clean the logjams and reduced the impacts. The first quarter is evidence of that progress. For some time, we\u2019ve said that the demand in critical initiatives have been strong. It continued in the first quarter. And that positive is rooted in innovative products designed specifically for making a difference in critical paths. One example is our new ATECH 1/4 inch drive flex-head TechAngle micro torque wrench, sure a mouthful, but it\u2019s a great product. It\u2019s aimed directly at the aircraft repair -- where at aircraft repair with a necessity for torque precision is rising. The need for power is increasing and repair and tight spaces is becoming more common. Our new unit works on all three fronts. The new wrench is almost 1 foot long, but less than an inch in diameter configured to facilitate access deep inside engine compartments. It\u2019s also equipped with a 15-degree flex-head design, allowing it to avoid obstacles. And it uses our durable 72-inch -- 72 tooth gear mechanism, enabling the tool to operate with small rotations when the barriers restrict motion, making it tough to wrench. The new ATECH has power, significant power, reaching 300-inch and it\u2019s expanding the range by 20% and increasing the number of applications that tool can cover, consolidating tests from multiple devices into one convenient unit and eliminating change over time, providing -- that\u2019s providing a nice productivity gain. The unit has 4 alert modes, LCD, LED, vibratory and audible. Those four prevent over torquing, even when the visibility is low and the space is constrained. And when combined with the unit\u2019s accuracy of plus or minus 2%, the feature served to keep the fastening right on spec. The ATECH accessibility, power and accuracy protects throughout the aviation sector. It\u2019s another hit product that helped drive C&I upward in this quarter. Well, that\u2019s C&I, on the rise, higher sales, stronger profits, powerful products and more to come. Now on to the Tools Group. Sales of $537.0 million, up $24.9 million, including $7.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency, registering a 6.3% organic gain with high single-digit increases in the U.S. and a low single-digit rise in the international network, and the operating margin -- the operating margin was 24.5%, up 180 basis points against 80 basis points of unfavorable currency, boomshakalaka!. This was a great number for us. We\u2019re really optimistic and encouraged by this. The vehicle repair markets are strong and resilient and they trace an ongoing path of abundant opportunity. And once again, the tools numbers back it up. But beyond the quantitative evidence, I was just with some of our -- our van drivers last week. And their view was incandescently positive. That\u2019s the only word I can use, without equivocation or without question. They say shops are busy. All the product -- all our product lines are in high demand and their technician customers are brimming with confidence. It seems like the people of vehicle repair from top to bottom have great expectations for the way forward. And that positivity is evident in the continuing enthusiasm for big tickets, longer payback items, diagnostics and tool storage boxes. They continue to be major contributors to our results. You can see it in the success of the top of the line ZEUS+ handheld diagnostics units. You can find it in the reception of our latest addition to the EPIQ tool storage lineup. The 68-inch EPIQ limited edition box, toolbox, we call it the Neon Stinger. It\u2019s generated considerable excitement with its eye-catching look, a gloss black body with the newest color in tool storage trim, [indiscernible]. I mean this baby pops. Even at a less than bright light in say, the corner of a shop of a tool storage -- a repair shop, it stands out to any place, giving the techs a chance to make a statement. And it\u2019s not just the glow. It also offers a range of powerful functionality. The speed drawer providing customizable organizations, a power drawer with securable charging space, and LED power top spanning the entire length of the box, fully illuminating the drawers and the tools making them shine like the jewels they are. The Stinger, it also offers a 15 power outlets and 6 USB ports, all to ensure the tech -- cordless tools, lights and accessories are always charged and ready to go. I\u2019ll tell you, demand was strong and the Stinger was a Snap-on million-dollar hit product in a blink of an eye. So the Tools Group, robust demand in all product segments and the momentum train just kept running throughout the quarter. Now let\u2019s speak of RS&I. Sales reached $446.6 million, up $48.4 million or 12.2%, including $6 million in unfavorable foreign currency. Organic activity advanced 13.9% with double-digit increases in undercar equipment and OEM business is driving the game, two big contributors. RS&I operating earnings were $104.6 million, rising 14.2% over last year, and the operating margin was 23.4%, up 40 basis points. Again -- once again, this quarter, software products and subscriptions were a significant plus. Along those lines, our Mitchell 1 division responsible for providing repair information software to independent shops, continue to succeed, pursuing customer connection and innovation by bringing great new improvements to shop efficiency. And this year -- an example is at this year\u2019s meeting of the heavy-duty technology and maintenance council in Orlando, Mitchell 1 introduced our powerful wiring navigation features specifically for trucks. It was immediately clear to large truck professionals that our new software would make it much easier and quicker for technicians to navigate the challenges of electrical issues on today\u2019s ever more complex vehicles, whether powered by internal combustion or battery cells. The feature makes a real difference. It\u2019s a significant aid to truck repair -- to the truck repair world, enabling quick transition from one wiring diagram to another, following the wire without interruption between views. This is a significant time saver for the techs across the industry and the shops are noticing. Mitchell 1 just released another great product. It\u2019s automated work package function for its collision repair software. The new system gathers into one screen all the relevant information needed for collision jobs, overhaul procedures, illustrations and diagrams, all retrieved with the click of a button with one click of the button. One of the difficulties in collision repair is that the multifaceted nature of the task. You need part details, repair procedures, system diagrams, but that information is usually found in separate places in varying categories within the vehicle\u2019s documentation. Our new system combines the data into a single work package that guides the technician progressively through the effective repair. It sounds really simple. But in fact, the consolidated comprehensive information eliminates the 20 to 90 minutes that\u2019s ordinarily needed to prepare an effective guide for collision repair test. We believe that the software will be a big contributor to Mitchell 1\u2019s growth. It\u2019s a clear savings in an area that\u2019s rising in modern vehicle repair. With the increase of vehicle automation and the associated growth in sensor networks, collision repair is increasingly more important, and our new feature is right on target to ease of the way. We keep expanding in RS&I. We keep expanding RS&I\u2019s position with repair shop owners and managers, offering more and more solutions for the day-to-day challenges, wielding customer connection and innovation to essential components of Snap-on value creation, processes to drive winning new software and hardware. We\u2019re confident. It\u2019s a successful formula and RS&I results reinforce that view. So, those are the highlights of our quarter. Continued momentum. Our 11th straight period of year-over-year operating growth. C&I is showing strength, gaining against the supply turbulence of the day, RS&I remaining robust, rising with software and hardware. The Tools Group, a healthy and enhanced van network, aiming for more, organic sales in the quarter, up 10.2%; OpCo operating margin 22% and EPS $4.60, up 15% over last year, a significant increase. It all adds up. It all serves to provide clear evidence and powerful testimony that Snap-on has emerged from the great withering in the COVID, stronger than when it entered and the enterprise is continuing that upward trend with capability and conviction. It was an encouraging quarter. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Aldo.\nAldo Pagliari: Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on slide 6. Net sales of $1.183 million in the quarter increased 7.8% from 2022 levels, reflecting a 10.2% organic sales gain, partially offset by $24 million or 240 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase this quarter includes broad-based gains across all of the segments. From a geographic perspective, we experienced double-digit year-over-year organic sales growth in North America and low single-digit organic gains in Europe. Consolidated gross margin of 49.8% improved 110 basis points from 48.7% last year. Contributions from the increased sales volumes and pricing actions and benefits from the Company\u2019s RCI initiatives more than offset the effects of higher material and other costs as well as 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency. While the supply chain environment has somewhat improved, we believe the corporation continued to navigate effectively costs and other challenges associated with the ongoing conditions. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 27.8%, improved 60 basis points from 28.4% last year. Operating earnings before financial services of $259.8 million in the quarter compared to $223.1 million in 2022. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 22% improved 170 basis points from last year\u2019s first quarter. Financial Services revenue of $92.6 million in the first quarter of 2023 increased 5.6% compared to $87.7 million last year. Operating earnings of $66.3 million decreased $4.1 million from 2022 levels and included a return to what we believe to be a more normal level of provisions for credit losses than those recorded last year. Consolidated operating earnings $326.1 million in the quarter compared to $293.5 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 25.6% improved 80 basis points from last year. Our first quarter effective income tax rate of 23.1% compared to 23.7% last year. Net earnings of $248.7 million or $4.60 per diluted share including $0.12 of unfavorable impact associated with foreign currency, increased $31.3 million or $0.60 per share from 2022 levels, representing a 15% increase in diluted earnings per share. Now, let\u2019s turn to our segment results for the quarter. Starting with C&I on slide 7. Sales of $363.8 million increased from $340.1 million last year, reflecting a $36.2 million or 11.1% organic sales gain, which was partially offset by $12.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic growth primarily reflects double-digit gains in sales to customers in critical industries and in the segment specialty torque business as well as low single-digit increase in the segment\u2019s European-based hand tools business. With respect to critical industries, the sales gains were wide ranging in the quarter. In addition to higher activity across general industry, sales of the military were robust as were sales to technical education, aviation and natural resources. Gross margin of 38.8% improved 240 basis points from 36.4% in the first quarter of 2022. This was primarily due to higher sales volumes including increased activity and the higher gross margin critical industries, pricing actions and benefits from RCI initiatives. These improvements were partially offset by the effects of higher material and other costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 23.5% in the quarter increased 50 basis points from 23% in 2022, mostly due to increased sales and higher expense businesses. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $55.8 million increased 22.1%, $45.7 million last year. The operating margin of 15.3% improved 190 basis points from 13.4% last year. Turning now to slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $537 million compared to $512.1 million a year ago, reflecting a 6.3% organic sales gain, partially offset by $7.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales growth reflects a high single-digit gain in our U.S. business and a low single-digit increase in our international operations. Sales in the quarter were up year-over-year in all product lines. Gross margin of 47.3% in the quarter improved 180 basis points from 45.5% last year. This increase is primarily due to higher sales volumes and pricing actions, lower material and other costs and benefits from RCI initiatives, partially offset by 80 basis points of unfavorable currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22.8% were unchanged from last year. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $131.7 million, including $6.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $15.7 million from last year, while the operating margin of 24.5%, including 80 basis points of unfavorable currency effects, improved 180 basis points from 22.7% in 2022. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on slide 9. Sales of $446.6 million increased 12.2% from $398.2 million in 2022, reflecting a 13.9% organic sales gain, partially offset by $6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain is comprised of double-digit increases in sales of undercar and collision repair equipment and in activity with OEM dealerships and a mid-single-digit gain in the sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers. Gross margin of 43.5% declined 110 basis points from 44.6% last year, primarily due to increased sales in lower gross margin businesses and the effects of higher material and other costs. These declines were partially offset by benefits from pricing actions and savings from our RCI initiatives as well as 30 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 20.1% improved 150 basis points from 21.6% last year, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage and higher activity and lower expense businesses and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $104.6 million compared to $91.6 million last year. The operating margin of 23.4% compared to 23% reported a year ago. Now turning to slide 10. Revenue from financial services of $92.6 million increased from $87.7 million last year, primarily reflecting the growth of the loan portfolio. Financial Services operating earnings of $66.3 million, including $700,000 of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $70.4 million in 2022. Financial services expenses of $26.3 million were up $9 million from 2022 levels, including $8.1 million of higher provisions for credit losses. The year-over-year increase in provisions reflects both the growth of the portfolio as well as a return to what we believe to be a more normal pre-pandemic rate of provision. For reference, provisions for finance receivable losses in the quarter were $14.2 million, as compared to $6.3 million in the first quarter last year. In the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, provisions for losses were $12.5 million and $15.8 million, respectively. In addition, the gross worldwide extended credit or finance receivable portfolio has increased 7.5% year-over-year, and we believe the delinquency and portfolio performance trends currently remain stable. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1.1% in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to 8 -- 0.8% last year. In the first quarters of 2023 and 2022, respective average yield on finance receivables were 17.7% and 17.6%. In the first quarters of 2023 and 2022, the average yield on contract receivables were 8.7% and 8.5%, respectively. Total loan originations of $300.9 million in the first quarter increased $55.3 million or 22.5% from 2022 levels, reflecting a 25.1% increase in originations of finance receivables and a 9.2% increase in originations of contract receivables. The increase in finance receivable origination reflects the continued strong demand for big ticket products sold by our franchisees during the quarter. Moving to slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $2.3 billion of gross financing receivables, including $2 billion from our U.S. operation. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.5% for U.S. extended credit compares to 1.6% in 2022. On a sequential basis, the rate is down 10 basis points, reflecting the seasonal trend we typically experience between the fourth and first quarters. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $45.1 million represented 2.46% of outstandings at the end of the first quarter. While this was up 12 basis points from a year ago, it is 45 basis points lower than year-end 2019. Now turning to slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $301.6 million in the quarter compared to $193.9 million last year. The increase from the first quarter of 2022 primarily reflects lower year-over-year increases in working investment, improved net earnings and lower cash tax and compensation payments. Net cash used by investing activities of $72.9 million included net additions to finance receivables of $49.6 million and capital expenditures of $23 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $152.1 million included cash dividends of $86.1 million and the repurchase of 356,000 shares of common stock for $87.2 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $345.4 million of common stock under existing authorizations. Turning to slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $20.7 million from 2022 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 62 days compared to 61 days at 2022 year-end. Inventories increased $16 million from 2022 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.4 compared to 2.5 at year-end 2022. The growth in inventory primarily reflects higher demand, including inventories to support new products as well as critical industry projects. Additionally, to better assure availability given the dynamics of the current supply chain situation, our level of safety stocks and in-transit parts components and raw materials are up as our year-over-year costs associated with finished goods. Our quarter end cash position of $833.8 million compared to $757.2 million at year-end 2022. Our net debt to capital ratio of 7.4% compared to 9% at year-end 2022. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million available under our credit facilities. And as of quarter-end, there are no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there are no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. I\u2019ll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2023. We anticipate that capital expenditures will approximate $100 million. In addition, we currently anticipate that our full year 2023 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?\nNick Pinchuk: Thanks, Aldo, for that detailed financial review. Well, at Snap-on\u2019s first quarter, it is an encouraging performance, demonstrating clearly the breadth, the depth and the length of our extraordinary advance. The breadth, progress across each of the operating groups. C&I, gaining on the challenge of customized kits amidst supply turbulence and rising above the difficulties of geographic reach in troubled times. Tools Group, continuing its upward trend, taking full advantage of the hot resilient vehicle repair market, reaching yet another margin high. RS&I, riding the wave of vehicle complexity and new model introductions, registering another quarter of profitable growth. The period was positive all across our enterprise. Our quarter also had depth. The record was strong from top to bottom, up and down the P&L. C&I, 11.1% organic growth and the OI margin was 15.3%, up 190 basis points. RS&I, organic sales rising, 13.9% and OI margin, a strong 23.4%, 40 points over last year. The Tools Group organic activity increasing 6.3% more in the U.S., high single digits. And we spoke of the eye-catching brilliance of the Stinger toolbox. Remember -- I mean, it really pops, well, something else that pops is the Tools\u2019 OI margin. It\u2019s something to catch attention. It pops like a neon sign, 24.5%, up 180 basis points directly against 80 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency. All that added up to strength across the corporation, organic sales advancing 10.2%, up big, even in the uncertainty, OI margin, 22% -- 22%, representing a rise of 170 basis points. And the final tally of it all, EPS, it was $4.60, up by a clear distance over any comparison. And finally, our performance is marked by length, by the extended positive trend. It was the 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating gain. The world is evolving as we thought it would. New equipment and software being needed to follow the acceleration of model change and new technologies. The vehicle repair market is looking like it\u2019s approaching a golden age, more technicians, wages rising, collective and individual optimism across the sector. And we sought our momentum extending in the quarter, a positive view that was confirmed by the voice of the franchisees. And moving forward, we believe that the momentum will continue. And we are confident -- we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re positioned to make the most of the abundant opportunities, growing and improving. We\u2019ve done it period after period, and we did it again in the first quarter. You see, we do have device of advantages in our product, authored by customer connection and innovation, easing the way for critical path, making a clear difference with professionals. We have an advantage in our brand, marking the serious and the professional, bringing pride and dignity, like no other name. And we have an advantage in our people, our team, challenge tested and fully dedicated. And we believe the resilient markets and these considerable advantages will enable Snap-on to maintain its momentum and continue its rise into the second quarter, throughout 2023 and well beyond. Now before I turn the call over to the operator, it\u2019s appropriate that I speak to our franchisees and associates, our team. I know many of you are listening. This quarter is encouraging, but those who would ask why or how need only look to all of you. For the considerable part you played in this performance, you have my congratulations. For the extraordinary commitment you\u2019ve given to our team, you have my admiration. And for the unfailing confidence you hold in Snap-on future, you have my thanks. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?\nOperator: Yes. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And this morning\u2019s first question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.\nChristopher Glynn: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I was curious, Nick, about the C&I kind of showing some stepped up organic growth there. You talked about the supply chain easing a little bit. So curious what -- if you\u2019re seeing past due backlog kind of diminish here and where you are in that stage? And is overall backlog continuing to grow because it sounds like the breadth is becoming quite assertive.\nNick Pinchuk: Backlog is still pretty strong. I mean, the 11.1%, the increase -- by the way, it was bigger than that really in the critical industries. So that wasn\u2019t borne out of the backlog. Pretty much the backlog is still there. And what you\u2019re seeing is our getting some of the repair challenges underway. I\u2019m not declaring complete victory over the supply turbulence but it looks a lot better this quarter than it has in the past. Plus, you got the military coming back in that period. The military was down before. So you have those two factors driving critical industries upwards, and that\u2019s pretty good. And it isn\u2019t -- we still have a pretty strong backlog sitting there. Orders just keep going. Everybody likes to have customized products.\nChristopher Glynn: Okay. And in the press release, you mentioned the period continues the Snap-on value creation process and you referred to considerable capacity for improvement. Could you elaborate on some of the specifics that undergird that statement?\nNick Pinchuk: Yes. We could be a lot more efficient in selling off the vans. This is one of the reasons that altered our business going upwards in the Tools Group on the principal components of driving it upwards, we could do better than that. Our factories could be more efficient because they\u2019re chockablock. They\u2019re up to their eyeballs. We\u2019re trying to expand them. So we\u2019re working on the expansion, and we\u2019re pounding the RCI into those expansions. So we better -- that will help us quite a bit. So, you see that. And I think in a lot of ways, RCI applies to the Tools business, to the Product business because that\u2019s the complexity in repair goes up. It needs new products. And having a large number of new products really necessitates a real focus on RCI and the actual customer connection and innovation process and so, will drive that through. So fundamentally, we see a lot of opportunities. Our business is sort of like that, Chris. We sort of structurally have opportunities because we have 85,000 SKUs. We\u2019re pretty vertically integrated in a lot of places, sometimes in some cases, raw steel comes in the back of the factory and through a number of different processes from forging all the way to plating to make it look like jewels and putting in the hands of the end user, we have tremendous verticality. So, we have horizontal, 85,000 SKUs and a verticality. That creates a lot of interest for continuous improvement. So we have lots of confidence in our ability to do better.\nChristopher Glynn: Great. If I could sneak one more in, just want to go a little deeper into the military that had been soft for some time, and it sounds like it\u2019s a pretty sharp and resetting levels there. Just curious if you could give some color on -- I think lumpiness is part of the military story, too. So just curious how to factor that aspect here.\nNick Pinchuk: I think we\u2019re seeing an encouraging situation. I mean, we were spitting blood all over the military in the quarters -- further quarters. It was a big negative for us, it was really not there. But now it seems to have come back in a number of different projects, and they\u2019re not huge projects, they\u2019re smaller projects. So this is kind of a -- we interpret it as an opening of the spicket. Every time -- the guys in military tell me this every time a new administration comes in, regardless of who it is, there\u2019s a new sheriff in town, they raise -- we\u2019re going to have new procedures, the new procedures actually don\u2019t work. And so eventually, the war fighters say, I need tools, and therefore, the spicket opens. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening now.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies.\nBret Jordan: I think you called out sort of strength in some of the higher ticket items. Could you give us some more color on that sort of what the hand tools versus high ticket and then storage versus diagnostics within the higher ticket product mix?\nNick Pinchuk: Sure. Look, hand tools are about -- just with the growth this period. So, if you\u2019re looking for mix, there\u2019s really not a mix story along the product lines, we don\u2019t see. If you step back, you look at it, there\u2019s a lot of product, particularly hand tools, they\u2019re about equal to our growth, give or take, equal to our growth. And in terms of big ticket, you got diagnostics being stronger than tool storage because we just introduced and we introduced the big Zeus -- ZEUS+, I think it\u2019s $12,000. This is a monster, the top-of-the-line handheld diagnostic. And so that\u2019s been selling robustly. And you see that together with tool storage in the originations this quarter. So I think for the selling off -- the selling to the franchisees quarter, you\u2019re seeing a good big ticket -- a little bit more or more with diagnostics this quarter than in past quarters because of the Zeus launch. And then you see hand tools kind of keeping pace with the average. Everybody else is the -- the other cats and dogs are floating around it.\nBret Jordan: Okay. And then a question on the credit business, I mean, obviously, underlying rates have come up and your -- I think your yield was 17.7 or so. Is there the potential to bring your yields up? I mean, can you pass through some of the higher base rates on those loans? Or is that...\nNick Pinchuk: I want to answer this question, but Aldo needs to have at least one question. So, I\u2019ll let\u2026\nAldo Pagliari: Bret, probably not. And the reason for that is we hold our rates. They\u2019re not the lowest rates in the world. They are reflective of the credit profile of the customers that we serve. So they certainly are competitive in the segment where we play. But our rates have been kind of steady over the decade, not just the years, decade, and we\u2019re funded long, as you probably recall. And therefore, we don\u2019t have the same upward pressure on our cost of funds for the next several years. So, as a result of that, we tend to hold the program steady. So the uptick you see right now really is probably reflective a little bit of the slightly better profile of customers as maybe compared to a year or so ago, but it\u2019s very slight, right, 17.6 to 17.7.\nBret Jordan: Okay. And one last question for you then on the cost input side. Are you seeing -- what\u2019s the cadence? And whether it\u2019s metals pricing or labor, obviously shipping has come down, but how are you seeing the input cost cadence trending?\nAldo Pagliari: So look, the cost is similar -- similar, there\u2019s slight pockets of improvement. Every once in a while, you still have to resort to a spot buy and you\u2019re looking at materials. So, I\u2019d say the most broadly speaking, as I think we said earlier, is that there\u2019s some improvement, but every day, you have to remain agile, flexible. There\u2019s always a new challenge when you walk in the door. So, modest improvement, but still, you got to bring all your resources to the table to effectively manage it.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.\nGary Prestopino: I have a question for Aldo, so the second question.\nNick Pinchuk: Oh, no.\nGary Prestopino: Well, I got one for you, too. In the other category, Aldo, there was a $15.2 million looks like positive and you tax effect that, it\u2019s about, I think, $0.20 of earnings, $0.21 of earnings. What exactly is that?\nAldo Pagliari: I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re looking at other income, but if we\u2019re looking at that\u2026\nGary Prestopino: Yes.\nAldo Pagliari: Actually, believe it or not, Gary, on the cash that we have on hand, we\u2019re earning a much higher level of interest income than what we did last year. You might remember, about a year ago, you\u2019re getting hardly nothing on your money. Now effectively, the corporation is earning about 4.75% on whatever cash it does have.\nGary Prestopino: Okay. All right. So that explains that. And then I just want to get a question on the diagnostics and the software. Nick, it\u2019s growing. Are you finding that there are shops that -- and I don\u2019t -- can\u2019t believe that this is possible that did not have any diagnostic capabilities that are rapidly adapting it because of the more of the electronics on the models, or are entities just looking to upgrade and buy a more powerful machine?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, I mean, look, I think the -- sure, there are shops that don\u2019t have diagnostics. I mean, there are guys who think they can do it themselves. And by the way, you can repair it yourself, but it takes more time. And so the more experienced technicians think they can get through in some of them, particularly in truck shops, you\u2019ll see that more. But generally, diagnostics are an upgrade and they\u2019re upgrading the software. And what happens, the good thing about this, like I say in the remarks, is the more drive by wire, the more you need more advancements in both the software and the hardware. It\u2019s one of the reasons why the ZEUS+ has been such a baffle hit, is that it really does move everything forward, bigger screens, make it easier from a hardware point of view, and it\u2019s got enhanced software. And we tried to emphasize that. We keep coming up with ideas like Mitchell 1, like the wiring diagrams for trucks. That may not sound like much, but it\u2019s bad because if you have to keep -- it\u2019s really helpful because if you have to keep trying to find the wire in a new view, it\u2019s a real puzzle sometimes, and they\u2019re holding about collision. Collision is booming. And so writing software for collision, we\u2019re kind of, I think in kind of one of the only few they\u2019re trying to do that, and we see that being very positive. So there\u2019s a lot of opportunity flow through there. Most of it, though, it really depends on the shop. If you\u2019re talking about just the vehicle repair shop, most of them are upgrading what they have already. In some cases, the shop certainly has something. That would be -- in some cases, you\u2019re adding technicians that are using more diagnostics or don\u2019t have a diagnostic now, they\u2019re borrowing. In other cases, if you look at truck or collision repair, they\u2019re just starting to get diagnostics. That\u2019s a little more fertile ground for it.\nGary Prestopino: Okay. And then as you sell these higher-ticket diagnostic products, I would assume that the software package that comes with it or is associated with it is also a higher ticket versus the low-end diagnostic.\nNick Pinchuk: I\u2019ll tell you what, Gary, I don\u2019t know how we can afford to sell it for the price we do. But we do -- we view it as a high value, but yes, the software is more -- when you buy the initial package, you get software for a period of time, like six months in the package. And so then you could take a subscription then that will start after six months or you can wait till six months over and take a subscription or you can wait for six months and buy a title. But if you\u2019re talking about let\u2019s take a look at the discrete purchase would be like buy a title, which would be six months of new software, Zeus higher than the next level down and the next level down. So, it\u2019s higher.\nGary Prestopino: And just lastly, do you foresee a situation where as more EVs proliferate through the car park that you would develop a diagnostic tool that\u2019s just specific for EVs?\nNick Pinchuk: Sure. But -- yes, that\u2019s a long time off there because first, what would happen is a diagnostic unit that would handle internal combustion and EVs because they\u2019re going to be sharing the space for a long time. They\u2019re going to be chewing the same dirt on a highway for a long time. And so, the real thing is you\u2019re going to need a broad group of that, both in software and tools. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. Eventually, EVs may take over a plug-in hybrids or whatever evolves in that situation, and that will move the car part. But it\u2019s a long way process. There\u2019s no singularity in here. But once they start to get some presence in the market, you have to start including them in your diagnostic software so that you help the technicians deal with them as you help them deal with the 650-horsepower BMW M5 competition.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America.\nElizabeth Suzuki: First, I wanted to ask about the financing arm. In terms of your outlook, I mean, do you see risk to originations, if your customers start shifting from some of these bigger ticket items smaller ticket and as credit conditions more broadly kind of tighten, does that have an impact on your customers\u2019 ability or willingness to take on additional debt for those large purchases.\nNick Pinchuk: Actually, I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s a big question. There\u2019s a lot of hypotheticals in there. I don\u2019t think we see a risk right now. People seem to be robust in terms of the big ticket items. One of the messages of our point is I think I said when we were at the conference, there almost seems to be two economies, the financial economy and the physical economy. And the physical economy right now seems pretty pumped to me. And so we see -- and we see that with the take-up of big-ticket items that expresses their confidence. Really, and in past downturns, it hasn\u2019t been the rates that influenced because our rates stay the same. It hasn\u2019t been the rates or the actual money that -- of technicians that influences the choice. It\u2019s their mental view. The paraphrase is -- what was [Technical Difficulty] election. It\u2019s a psychology. And so basically, in the great financial recession, it was the -- we would have said economies glum repair shops hum. And they kept going. And so yes, but they were getting up every day, getting bad news for breakfast on all the shows and reading the paper. So, they were worried about taking long-term long payback items, but they had the money. So, I don\u2019t anticipate the money going away, but I -- but they could change their attitude, depending on how much bombardment occurs. I think really, that\u2019s how we see the world playing out. Repair is essential. It keeps going. But the mentality of the customers can shift between big ticket and small ticket. We saw -- I mean, it\u2019s evidence that you go back to just out of the COVID -- coming out of the COVID everybody had money and garages and never stopped, but they were focused on small ticket items, not big ticket. And when they started to get more comfortable and they had the psychological recovery and exhilaration, they started to go big ticket. That\u2019s what we see now.\nElizabeth Suzuki: Yes. Got it. No, it certainly makes sense that the sentiment is a little different here on Wall Street than it is on Main Street. So I get that. All right. Thank you for that.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Scott Stember with ROTH MKM.\nScott Stember: Nick, you\u2019re talking about how collision is booming. I just wanted to flesh that out a little bit. How much of it is just from, I guess, a volume standpoint at the collision level, which I guess you could see with increased purchases of on the car or just collision equipment versus increased demand of diagnostics for ADAS for the collision side.\nNick Pinchuk: It\u2019s both of those. I think increasingly in the collision area is people are more and more interested in -- as we go forward in the sort of like the ADAS situation where you\u2019re talking about calibration and setting the neural network of sensors. And also, things like we talked about with Mitchell 1 with the special collision focused software because people are seeing that job more and more. Two things are happening -- three things are happening, I suppose. The first one is a lot of different materials in a car now. So you just can\u2019t bend steel, you have to cut different like carbon fiber and so on. So, there\u2019s a lot of different physical products that we sell that make that. That was -- that\u2019s a longstanding trend. And then as the neural networks have become more ubiquitous, they need a lot of software and hardware that\u2019s focused on that to recalibrate and do that. And then thirdly, collision jobs are getting more jobs because the collision has taken more time. If you don\u2019t think that -- when you hammer your bumper, see how much it costs you, how long it takes you to get it replaced. Those are taking more time. So, there\u2019s more work for collision jobs. So they\u2019re seeing three factors: one, the material; two, addressing the neural network; and three, just handling the volume and getting productivity.\nScott Stember: Got it. And just housekeeping in the Tools segment, sell into the van channel versus sell-through, were they pretty much in line?\nNick Pinchuk: They were in line, pretty well balanced this quarter. They go up and down, but we\u2019re pretty -- we pretty much feel as though they\u2019re kind of matching up, and they have. They fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. But this quarter is evenly keeled. Maybe there\u2019s a little bit more selling off the van that\u2019s selling into there, maybe a little bit, but not anything significant. So, [Technical Difficulty] pretty solid.\nScott Stember: All right. And just last question, just going back to Bret\u2019s question about the, I guess, the composition of the Tools Group. It sounds that tools were up -- or hand tools were up in line with the overall segment. Can you maybe just talk about anything to point out new products out there, or is it different selling tactics? Is it bundling of certain things? Just trying to see what\u2019s there.\nNick Pinchuk: A lot of different things. I mean, fundamentally, the big kahuna in the Tools Group this time is ZEUS+, big ticket item, $12,000. So that\u2019s rolling through that business. And so that\u2019s the thing that gets your attention. I talked about this Neon Stinger, and I really meant it. It was flying off the shelf. We showed it at our kickoff and people loved it because [Technical Difficulty] and technicians want to make a statement. So tool storage has got some nice products. So you have a new model and diagnostic that\u2019s driving that. You have some really nice innovations in tool storage. And in hand tools, you have a number of different things, some of which are things like new pliers. We have a range of new pliers that everybody loves. I was talking to the franchisees, like I said, a couple of weeks ago. And these guys whipped out these pliers and started talking about how great they are and easy to sell because they\u2019re so functional, how in grip. They hold on really well, three positions, so you can handle any kind of job. People love them. So you see that. Plus we\u2019re bundling some things like impact sockets, putting together some impact sockets where they weren\u2019t bundled before. So people -- impact sockets are things you use for very hard and difficult like trucks, you really need a lot of power. So the sockets have to be of a different dimension, less hard but stronger, thicker wall and those kinds of things. So, we see those coming out, maybe focused on the truck shop. So those are the kinds of things that are driving the situation. But it\u2019s always that way. There\u2019s always a story around products.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.\nDavid MacGregor: Let me start off by just asking about the revenue mix overall. Are you seeing a shift in the percentage of revenues from technicians versus independent garage owners and dealerships?\nNick Pinchuk: Not really. I mean, you could say this. Let me say this. Only in this way, not in the Tools Group for sure. I don\u2019t see it in the Tools group. You could argue that, all right, you tend to get garage owners who are also technicians, they are the probably number one buyer of a ZEUS+. So in that way, you might see more of that. But every time you roll out the top of the line diagnostic unit, you\u2019re seeing that. So adjusting for our expectations in that way, I don\u2019t see any change in the Tools Group. If you go to RS&I, while repairs -- software and diagnostic sales to independent repair shops were up, the two big pounders in RS&I was the OEM businesses following the new models and the equipment. But equipment is split between -- pretty much equally between garages and independent. So generally, you\u2019ll see a slight shading toward OEM garages on the RS&I side. You won\u2019t see any -- much of a mix change on the tools side except for the fact that ZEUS+ seems to always -- the big kahuna always sells, has a strong shop by. That\u2019s pretty much it. Other than that, we don\u2019t see any changes.\nDavid MacGregor: Just staying on the garage owners for a minute, Nick. Your contract receivable is up 9.2%. You sense that garage owners are maybe starting to face a little more difficulty securing credit, returning to Snap-on credit as an alternative?\nAldo Pagliari: For -- the contract receivables are with the franchisees and the van leases and inventory. So, that\u2019s\u2026\nDavid MacGregor: Yes. So, let\u2019s throw them in there as well and just say, is this group facing any more of a challenge on secure credit?\nNick Pinchuk: David, it\u2019s a logical extension of -- higher credit maybe. But I\u2019m not hearing it. I don\u2019t know. You\u2019re a windshield guy, too. I mean, I don\u2019t hear it in my windshield surveys, nobody is saying that. And I would just offer, our impression was based on how our franchisees are and how they say the technicians are is the balance sheets are pretty robust. So yes, that might happen, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re seeing it happen now. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s occurring right now. I think this is a pretty robust sector. We haven\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t see it get manipulated during the great [Technical Difficulty] they were more cautious, but they were still pretty plush. So I don\u2019t know. Could happen, but I don\u2019t hear it anyway.\nDavid MacGregor: Okay. Thanks for that. And then just on storage and maybe any of the other categories where you\u2019ve got large backlogs. Can you just give us some sense of how far back those backlogs are extending and...\nNick Pinchuk: Too far. That\u2019s why we\u2019re spending -- factories. Look, that is -- I was at these franchisees. I don\u2019t know, you can take this around many grains, so if you wish, but these guys are telling me they can sell every tool storage box they get. Backlogs go back. I don\u2019t want to really get into that. Sorry. But it\u2019s pretty substantial, probably longer than we would like. But sometimes we wonder -- I\u2019d tell you what, just a key -- looking at sometimes we wonder it is better if the backlog is long. It makes people want them more. I don\u2019t know. You know what I mean? Because everybody wants a Snap-on box, it seems. So maybe it just makes it more attractive, like if you have to wait for a car for a long time. But we\u2019d like to bring this backlog down. That\u2019s why we are enhancing our factories in all categories really. Virtually all of our product lines are up to the eyeballs and trying to turn out the factories. But the one that chases the most is tool storage because everywhere we go, people say, I need more. I need more. I need more.\nDavid MacGregor: Is there a reason then, Nick, why at the regional kickoffs you were offering discount packages on storage? It seems odd that you\u2019d be discounting something as backlog.\nNick Pinchuk: Because we offer discount packages all the time. That\u2019s part of the reason to buy now. You could say, okay, you don\u2019t have to have the discount package. But in reality -- in reality, David, our franchisees are conditioned to sell off a kind of deal. Our art is to make that deal attractive but leaner or richer depending on how we want to move the product.\nDavid MacGregor: Got it. Last question for me is just, I guess, given the strength in big-ticket sales, Nick, combined with -- whether you\u2019re on Wall Street or Main Street, there\u2019s a slowing macro out there. I guess, what gives you confidence you aren\u2019t pulling forward technician purchasing power that adversely impacts hand tools sales and future growth at some point down the road?\nNick Pinchuk: Actually, I don\u2019t worry so much about hand tools. I don\u2019t. I mean, hand tools have been strong come hell or high water. I mean I think -- I mean I only been here 15 years. So maybe that\u2019s not long enough. But the thing is it seems though hand tools -- if you\u2019re talking about the longer payback items, like I was talking to Liz, sooner or later, sometimes, the psychology of it all breaks through and even the guys who are working every day and pulling in the money, they say, I want to keep my powder dry for a while, sometimes. But that\u2019s a psychological balance, which I think right now there\u2019s tremendous reservoirs of optimism in the people of work. It\u2019s different than the big companies. If you look at the National Association of Manufacturers and you look at small manufacturers versus large manufacturers, there\u2019s all of a sudden a big divide between them in terms of their optimism, their outlook. The small guys have almost never been higher. So, I think this is part of what it is. I think there\u2019s a lot of talk. As you say, there\u2019s a lot of talk and just we saw -- I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s wrong or anything like that. But when you walk in -- when I walk in a garage or meet the franchisees, they\u2019re saying, who\u2019s this guy? Is this guy, Paul? I don\u2019t even know who he is.\nDavid MacGregor: Well, it was a good quarter. Congratulations, Nick.\nOperator: And the last question comes from Luke Junk with Baird.\nLuke Junk: Thanks for getting me in here. I know we\u2019re maybe a little limited for time, so I\u2019ll just ask one question today. And what I was really hoping to understand is, Nick or Aldo, you could just unpack the gross margin gains we saw both in the Tools Group and C&I this quarter a little bit more. Especially what I\u2019m hoping to understand how much normalization we\u2019re seeing right now in the margin in terms of price and what\u2019s going on with material costs and whether you think that\u2019s sustainable or even there might be more opportunity as we go from here. Thanks.\nNick Pinchuk: Well, look, -- I like to do this. So I\u2019ll do this. Look, in C&I it\u2019s simple. Critical industries, boomshakalaka!. Critical industries are the highest margin business in that area. And the margins are robust and they did pretty well. And like we talked about the military and I don\u2019t know if you heard that call, but the military tends to be -- is the base by base type of product we\u2019re getting that\u2019s moving it. And that tends to be pretty good. So I think that\u2019s one factor you\u2019re seeing there. That\u2019s pretty strong. They were up -- the critical industries were up greater than 11%. And that\u2019s what drove the margins I think, principally, There were other things. I mean another thing is that generally, the supply chain is getting better, but some of the stuff you go out and buy a whole bunch of stuff on -- when you spot [ph] buy, you buy a lot because you don\u2019t want to have to not have them. So some of that stuff is working its way through. So it\u2019s a very complex mix. We are seeing some abatement. That should continue. But mostly, the big factor there, the 190 basis points had to do with critical industries doing well. The customized kits are great for us and they sold -- we broke some of the bottlenecks, and we did well in that situation. So that\u2019s C&I. If you look at Tools Group, it\u2019s -- there\u2019s no product mix story that I think guys were wondering; if there were, it wasn\u2019t that. But it is the fact that there is an attenuation in the commodities, so the commodities, which Tools Group is very vertically integrated, so they buy commodities in a lot of situations. So they get a nice pop from that. And so, they\u2019re getting some improvement in that situation. Of course, they\u2019re taking their foot off the pricing in concert with that. And then the Tools Group has been hammering away at RCI. So, you see a lot of that happening in this situation. So, we think the whole thing is sustainable. Now that -- I\u2019m not telling you that the OI margin for the Tools Group is going to be the same next quarter, but we don\u2019t think they can\u2019t -- we believe they could go higher. Not necessarily next quarter, but we think there\u2019s room to move up from RCI and a rationalization of the situation.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to return the floor to Sara Verbsky for any closing comments.\nSara Verbsky: Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day.\nOperator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. And you may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Nick Pinchuk",
            "content": "Thanks, Sarah. As usual -- good morning, everybody. Good morning. As usual, I'll start the call by covering the highlights of the first quarter, and I'll give you my perspective on what it all means. And then Aldo will provide a detailed review of the financials. Along the way, we'll cover the markets, the robust gangbusters. We'll also give you a view of our momentum. It's been unbroken and vibrant. Once again, the story of our quarter is continued resilience. Our ability to navigate the complex while knowing that with the flip of a calendar -- the flip of a calendar will bring new challenges. You could pick up any significant publication or listen or watch any business show and you will encounter a barrage of concerns, the measures of adversity and contraction. But we know, we can resist the difficulties, and so we have for the past three months and for quarter after quarter. You see, we're armed with significant advantages. Our market's displaying resilience; born out of criticality, our brand standing above delivering quality and reinforcing personal pride; our products. They clearly move the world forward by making the critical easier; and finally, our people, our team, experienced, capable and confident. We are encouraged by this quarter, and I'll tell you why. Our reported sales in the period were $1,183 million, up versus last year by $85.2 million or 7.8%, including $24 million or 240 basis points of unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales, they were up 10.2%, increases in every group, our 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating expansion. Our OpCo operating income for the quarter was $259.8 million, including $7.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency, increasing by 16.5%. And the operating margin -- the operating margin, it was 22%, rising 170 basis points over last year. For financial services, operating income of $66.3 million compared to last year's $70.4 million. And that combined with OpCo -- and that combined with OpCo resulted in a consolidated operating margin of 25.6%, an 80 basis-point improvement. And the first quarter's EPS, $4.60, up $0.60 or 15% from last year's $4. So we believe our confidence and our ongoing optimism is clearly justified by the numbers. Now, let's look closer at our markets. The automotive repair environment remains hot, demand across all disciplines. We continue investing in new products and accommodating the repair challenges of newer models, matching the increased complexity. As platforms change, the modification requires new tools to accomplish the task and we're keeping pace. Whether it's an internal combustion engine or an electric vehicle, the techs need an assist, and we're ready to bring it. The updates create a range of challenges, new challenges, from accessibility issues associated with confined spaces requiring new designs of varying geometries, to tighter engineering challenges fueling the need for precision torque instrument to the increasing number of fasteners and listing our power tools to remove and install parts efficiently to the rise of drive by wire. More electronics -- the more the electronics, the greater the need for handheld diagnostics and special software that can communicate with and manage the neural network of computers and sensors. We're seeing strength in OEM dealerships. As new models break on to the market, new arrays of essential tools, equipment and diagnostics are needed to service the different and unique characteristics of each vehicle. For independent repair shops, business is booming. If you're taking your vehicle in for service, recently, you've witnessed this first hand, the pays are full and the parking lots are chockablock. And when I speak with our franchisees, they are enthusiastic, saying demand is robust. It's written all over the numbers. Garages are scheduled further out for shops of all types. Owners see the growth. They know they need technicians. And as you might expect, the rise in the tech count is substantial and the wages are moving up. And then, of course, this is all music to our ears. We believe that with the new vehicle models, the rise of automation, the growing need for precision and the increasing vehicle complexity, we may be entering the golden age of vehicle repair and our numbers say it may be so. So people repair. It's a great place to operate for our Tools Group and for our Repair Systems & Information Group, RS&I. And we believe it's only getting better. Now, let's talk about the critical industries where commercial and industrial or C&I, take Snap-on out of the garage, solving tasks of consequences, representing our most significant international presence. It's an area where we're -- I suppose, most subject to global headwinds, but the news is still reasonably encouraging. The critical industries kept rising across sectors, aviation, education, heavy-duty fleets, general industry and natural resources, all up. And the military, once down, is now rebounding with high demand. And for geographies, North America was strong. Europe was improved even in the face of ongoing -- of the ongoing war in Ukraine and the revenue disruption of the Brexit, and Asia Pacific remained mixed, variation across the landscape. But overall, the critical industry markets of C&I showed significant and broad positives, every sector. The first quarter is marked by substantial strides in that arena, and we see more opportunity on the horizon. We believe there's abundant and ongoing potential all along our runways for growth, enhancing the van network, expanding with repair shop owners and managers, extending the critical industry and building in emerging markets, leveraging our expansive product line, wielding our strengthening brand and deploying the increasing understanding of the task, connecting to the customer, standing face-to-face in the workplace where the tasks are performed, observing the work, turning that insight into innovative new products and some in the future for professionals. And we amplify that endeavor by applying a generous helping of rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, as we call it, driving our productivity and our margin upwards. So, that's our view of the market. Now, let's turn to the groups. In the C&I Group, sales of $363.8 million, including $12.5 million unfavorable foreign currency, increased 7% to last year. Organic sales were up 11.1% with double-digit gains in critical industries and specialty torque that precision leading the way. C&I's operating income of $55.8 million, including $2 million of unfavorable foreign currency, represents an increase of 22.1% over last year, and the operating margin was 15.3%, up 190 basis points from the 2022 level, promising numbers. C&I demonstrated considerable growth, despite the ongoing uncertainty across geographies. One of the factors that's been attenuating C&I in the recent past was the impact of supply turbulence. The customized -- you heard me say it on the calls, the customized kits with many different products are vulnerable to availability disruption. And one of the drivers behind the C&I rise were the improvements along the supply chain. During the period, we started to clean the logjams and reduced the impacts. The first quarter is evidence of that progress. For some time, we've said that the demand in critical initiatives have been strong. It continued in the first quarter. And that positive is rooted in innovative products designed specifically for making a difference in critical paths. One example is our new ATECH 1/4 inch drive flex-head TechAngle micro torque wrench, sure a mouthful, but it's a great product. It's aimed directly at the aircraft repair -- where at aircraft repair with a necessity for torque precision is rising. The need for power is increasing and repair and tight spaces is becoming more common. Our new unit works on all three fronts. The new wrench is almost 1 foot long, but less than an inch in diameter configured to facilitate access deep inside engine compartments. It's also equipped with a 15-degree flex-head design, allowing it to avoid obstacles. And it uses our durable 72-inch -- 72 tooth gear mechanism, enabling the tool to operate with small rotations when the barriers restrict motion, making it tough to wrench. The new ATECH has power, significant power, reaching 300-inch and it's expanding the range by 20% and increasing the number of applications that tool can cover, consolidating tests from multiple devices into one convenient unit and eliminating change over time, providing -- that's providing a nice productivity gain. The unit has 4 alert modes, LCD, LED, vibratory and audible. Those four prevent over torquing, even when the visibility is low and the space is constrained. And when combined with the unit's accuracy of plus or minus 2%, the feature served to keep the fastening right on spec. The ATECH accessibility, power and accuracy protects throughout the aviation sector. It's another hit product that helped drive C&I upward in this quarter. Well, that's C&I, on the rise, higher sales, stronger profits, powerful products and more to come. Now on to the Tools Group. Sales of $537.0 million, up $24.9 million, including $7.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency, registering a 6.3% organic gain with high single-digit increases in the U.S. and a low single-digit rise in the international network, and the operating margin -- the operating margin was 24.5%, up 180 basis points against 80 basis points of unfavorable currency, boomshakalaka!. This was a great number for us. We're really optimistic and encouraged by this. The vehicle repair markets are strong and resilient and they trace an ongoing path of abundant opportunity. And once again, the tools numbers back it up. But beyond the quantitative evidence, I was just with some of our -- our van drivers last week. And their view was incandescently positive. That's the only word I can use, without equivocation or without question. They say shops are busy. All the product -- all our product lines are in high demand and their technician customers are brimming with confidence. It seems like the people of vehicle repair from top to bottom have great expectations for the way forward. And that positivity is evident in the continuing enthusiasm for big tickets, longer payback items, diagnostics and tool storage boxes. They continue to be major contributors to our results. You can see it in the success of the top of the line ZEUS+ handheld diagnostics units. You can find it in the reception of our latest addition to the EPIQ tool storage lineup. The 68-inch EPIQ limited edition box, toolbox, we call it the Neon Stinger. It's generated considerable excitement with its eye-catching look, a gloss black body with the newest color in tool storage trim, [indiscernible]. I mean this baby pops. Even at a less than bright light in say, the corner of a shop of a tool storage -- a repair shop, it stands out to any place, giving the techs a chance to make a statement. And it's not just the glow. It also offers a range of powerful functionality. The speed drawer providing customizable organizations, a power drawer with securable charging space, and LED power top spanning the entire length of the box, fully illuminating the drawers and the tools making them shine like the jewels they are. The Stinger, it also offers a 15 power outlets and 6 USB ports, all to ensure the tech -- cordless tools, lights and accessories are always charged and ready to go. I'll tell you, demand was strong and the Stinger was a Snap-on million-dollar hit product in a blink of an eye. So the Tools Group, robust demand in all product segments and the momentum train just kept running throughout the quarter. Now let's speak of RS&I. Sales reached $446.6 million, up $48.4 million or 12.2%, including $6 million in unfavorable foreign currency. Organic activity advanced 13.9% with double-digit increases in undercar equipment and OEM business is driving the game, two big contributors. RS&I operating earnings were $104.6 million, rising 14.2% over last year, and the operating margin was 23.4%, up 40 basis points. Again -- once again, this quarter, software products and subscriptions were a significant plus. Along those lines, our Mitchell 1 division responsible for providing repair information software to independent shops, continue to succeed, pursuing customer connection and innovation by bringing great new improvements to shop efficiency. And this year -- an example is at this year's meeting of the heavy-duty technology and maintenance council in Orlando, Mitchell 1 introduced our powerful wiring navigation features specifically for trucks. It was immediately clear to large truck professionals that our new software would make it much easier and quicker for technicians to navigate the challenges of electrical issues on today's ever more complex vehicles, whether powered by internal combustion or battery cells. The feature makes a real difference. It's a significant aid to truck repair -- to the truck repair world, enabling quick transition from one wiring diagram to another, following the wire without interruption between views. This is a significant time saver for the techs across the industry and the shops are noticing. Mitchell 1 just released another great product. It's automated work package function for its collision repair software. The new system gathers into one screen all the relevant information needed for collision jobs, overhaul procedures, illustrations and diagrams, all retrieved with the click of a button with one click of the button. One of the difficulties in collision repair is that the multifaceted nature of the task. You need part details, repair procedures, system diagrams, but that information is usually found in separate places in varying categories within the vehicle's documentation. Our new system combines the data into a single work package that guides the technician progressively through the effective repair. It sounds really simple. But in fact, the consolidated comprehensive information eliminates the 20 to 90 minutes that's ordinarily needed to prepare an effective guide for collision repair test. We believe that the software will be a big contributor to Mitchell 1's growth. It's a clear savings in an area that's rising in modern vehicle repair. With the increase of vehicle automation and the associated growth in sensor networks, collision repair is increasingly more important, and our new feature is right on target to ease of the way. We keep expanding in RS&I. We keep expanding RS&I's position with repair shop owners and managers, offering more and more solutions for the day-to-day challenges, wielding customer connection and innovation to essential components of Snap-on value creation, processes to drive winning new software and hardware. We're confident. It's a successful formula and RS&I results reinforce that view. So, those are the highlights of our quarter. Continued momentum. Our 11th straight period of year-over-year operating growth. C&I is showing strength, gaining against the supply turbulence of the day, RS&I remaining robust, rising with software and hardware. The Tools Group, a healthy and enhanced van network, aiming for more, organic sales in the quarter, up 10.2%; OpCo operating margin 22% and EPS $4.60, up 15% over last year, a significant increase. It all adds up. It all serves to provide clear evidence and powerful testimony that Snap-on has emerged from the great withering in the COVID, stronger than when it entered and the enterprise is continuing that upward trend with capability and conviction. It was an encouraging quarter. Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Thanks, Aldo, for that detailed financial review. Well, at Snap-on's first quarter, it is an encouraging performance, demonstrating clearly the breadth, the depth and the length of our extraordinary advance. The breadth, progress across each of the operating groups. C&I, gaining on the challenge of customized kits amidst supply turbulence and rising above the difficulties of geographic reach in troubled times. Tools Group, continuing its upward trend, taking full advantage of the hot resilient vehicle repair market, reaching yet another margin high. RS&I, riding the wave of vehicle complexity and new model introductions, registering another quarter of profitable growth. The period was positive all across our enterprise. Our quarter also had depth. The record was strong from top to bottom, up and down the P&L. C&I, 11.1% organic growth and the OI margin was 15.3%, up 190 basis points. RS&I, organic sales rising, 13.9% and OI margin, a strong 23.4%, 40 points over last year. The Tools Group organic activity increasing 6.3% more in the U.S., high single digits. And we spoke of the eye-catching brilliance of the Stinger toolbox. Remember -- I mean, it really pops, well, something else that pops is the Tools' OI margin. It's something to catch attention. It pops like a neon sign, 24.5%, up 180 basis points directly against 80 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency. All that added up to strength across the corporation, organic sales advancing 10.2%, up big, even in the uncertainty, OI margin, 22% -- 22%, representing a rise of 170 basis points. And the final tally of it all, EPS, it was $4.60, up by a clear distance over any comparison. And finally, our performance is marked by length, by the extended positive trend. It was the 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating gain. The world is evolving as we thought it would. New equipment and software being needed to follow the acceleration of model change and new technologies. The vehicle repair market is looking like it's approaching a golden age, more technicians, wages rising, collective and individual optimism across the sector. And we sought our momentum extending in the quarter, a positive view that was confirmed by the voice of the franchisees. And moving forward, we believe that the momentum will continue. And we are confident -- we're confident that we're positioned to make the most of the abundant opportunities, growing and improving. We've done it period after period, and we did it again in the first quarter. You see, we do have device of advantages in our product, authored by customer connection and innovation, easing the way for critical path, making a clear difference with professionals. We have an advantage in our brand, marking the serious and the professional, bringing pride and dignity, like no other name. And we have an advantage in our people, our team, challenge tested and fully dedicated. And we believe the resilient markets and these considerable advantages will enable Snap-on to maintain its momentum and continue its rise into the second quarter, throughout 2023 and well beyond. Now before I turn the call over to the operator, it's appropriate that I speak to our franchisees and associates, our team. I know many of you are listening. This quarter is encouraging, but those who would ask why or how need only look to all of you. For the considerable part you played in this performance, you have my congratulations. For the extraordinary commitment you've given to our team, you have my admiration. And for the unfailing confidence you hold in Snap-on future, you have my thanks. Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Backlog is still pretty strong. I mean, the 11.1%, the increase -- by the way, it was bigger than that really in the critical industries. So that wasn't borne out of the backlog. Pretty much the backlog is still there. And what you're seeing is our getting some of the repair challenges underway. I'm not declaring complete victory over the supply turbulence but it looks a lot better this quarter than it has in the past. Plus, you got the military coming back in that period. The military was down before. So you have those two factors driving critical industries upwards, and that's pretty good. And it isn't -- we still have a pretty strong backlog sitting there. Orders just keep going. Everybody likes to have customized products. Yes. We could be a lot more efficient in selling off the vans. This is one of the reasons that altered our business going upwards in the Tools Group on the principal components of driving it upwards, we could do better than that. Our factories could be more efficient because they're chockablock. They're up to their eyeballs. We're trying to expand them. So we're working on the expansion, and we're pounding the RCI into those expansions. So we better -- that will help us quite a bit. So, you see that. And I think in a lot of ways, RCI applies to the Tools business, to the Product business because that's the complexity in repair goes up. It needs new products. And having a large number of new products really necessitates a real focus on RCI and the actual customer connection and innovation process and so, will drive that through. So fundamentally, we see a lot of opportunities. Our business is sort of like that, Chris. We sort of structurally have opportunities because we have 85,000 SKUs. We're pretty vertically integrated in a lot of places, sometimes in some cases, raw steel comes in the back of the factory and through a number of different processes from forging all the way to plating to make it look like jewels and putting in the hands of the end user, we have tremendous verticality. So, we have horizontal, 85,000 SKUs and a verticality. That creates a lot of interest for continuous improvement. So we have lots of confidence in our ability to do better. I think we're seeing an encouraging situation. I mean, we were spitting blood all over the military in the quarters -- further quarters. It was a big negative for us, it was really not there. But now it seems to have come back in a number of different projects, and they're not huge projects, they're smaller projects. So this is kind of a -- we interpret it as an opening of the spicket. Every time -- the guys in military tell me this every time a new administration comes in, regardless of who it is, there's a new sheriff in town, they raise -- we're going to have new procedures, the new procedures actually don't work. And so eventually, the war fighters say, I need tools, and therefore, the spicket opens. That's what's happening now. Sure. Look, hand tools are about -- just with the growth this period. So, if you're looking for mix, there's really not a mix story along the product lines, we don't see. If you step back, you look at it, there's a lot of product, particularly hand tools, they're about equal to our growth, give or take, equal to our growth. And in terms of big ticket, you got diagnostics being stronger than tool storage because we just introduced and we introduced the big Zeus -- ZEUS+, I think it's $12,000. This is a monster, the top-of-the-line handheld diagnostic. And so that's been selling robustly. And you see that together with tool storage in the originations this quarter. So I think for the selling off -- the selling to the franchisees quarter, you're seeing a good big ticket -- a little bit more or more with diagnostics this quarter than in past quarters because of the Zeus launch. And then you see hand tools kind of keeping pace with the average. Everybody else is the -- the other cats and dogs are floating around it. I want to answer this question, but Aldo needs to have at least one question. So, I'll let... Oh, no. Well, I mean, look, I think the -- sure, there are shops that don't have diagnostics. I mean, there are guys who think they can do it themselves. And by the way, you can repair it yourself, but it takes more time. And so the more experienced technicians think they can get through in some of them, particularly in truck shops, you'll see that more. But generally, diagnostics are an upgrade and they're upgrading the software. And what happens, the good thing about this, like I say in the remarks, is the more drive by wire, the more you need more advancements in both the software and the hardware. It's one of the reasons why the ZEUS+ has been such a baffle hit, is that it really does move everything forward, bigger screens, make it easier from a hardware point of view, and it's got enhanced software. And we tried to emphasize that. We keep coming up with ideas like Mitchell 1, like the wiring diagrams for trucks. That may not sound like much, but it's bad because if you have to keep -- it's really helpful because if you have to keep trying to find the wire in a new view, it's a real puzzle sometimes, and they're holding about collision. Collision is booming. And so writing software for collision, we're kind of, I think in kind of one of the only few they're trying to do that, and we see that being very positive. So there's a lot of opportunity flow through there. Most of it, though, it really depends on the shop. If you're talking about just the vehicle repair shop, most of them are upgrading what they have already. In some cases, the shop certainly has something. That would be -- in some cases, you're adding technicians that are using more diagnostics or don't have a diagnostic now, they're borrowing. In other cases, if you look at truck or collision repair, they're just starting to get diagnostics. That's a little more fertile ground for it. I'll tell you what, Gary, I don't know how we can afford to sell it for the price we do. But we do -- we view it as a high value, but yes, the software is more -- when you buy the initial package, you get software for a period of time, like six months in the package. And so then you could take a subscription then that will start after six months or you can wait till six months over and take a subscription or you can wait for six months and buy a title. But if you're talking about let's take a look at the discrete purchase would be like buy a title, which would be six months of new software, Zeus higher than the next level down and the next level down. So, it's higher. Sure. But -- yes, that's a long time off there because first, what would happen is a diagnostic unit that would handle internal combustion and EVs because they're going to be sharing the space for a long time. They're going to be chewing the same dirt on a highway for a long time. And so, the real thing is you're going to need a broad group of that, both in software and tools. That's what's going to happen. Eventually, EVs may take over a plug-in hybrids or whatever evolves in that situation, and that will move the car part. But it's a long way process. There's no singularity in here. But once they start to get some presence in the market, you have to start including them in your diagnostic software so that you help the technicians deal with them as you help them deal with the 650-horsepower BMW M5 competition. Actually, I don't know. That's a big question. There's a lot of hypotheticals in there. I don't think we see a risk right now. People seem to be robust in terms of the big ticket items. One of the messages of our point is I think I said when we were at the conference, there almost seems to be two economies, the financial economy and the physical economy. And the physical economy right now seems pretty pumped to me. And so we see -- and we see that with the take-up of big-ticket items that expresses their confidence. Really, and in past downturns, it hasn't been the rates that influenced because our rates stay the same. It hasn't been the rates or the actual money that -- of technicians that influences the choice. It's their mental view. The paraphrase is -- what was [Technical Difficulty] election. It's a psychology. And so basically, in the great financial recession, it was the -- we would have said economies glum repair shops hum. And they kept going. And so yes, but they were getting up every day, getting bad news for breakfast on all the shows and reading the paper. So, they were worried about taking long-term long payback items, but they had the money. So, I don't anticipate the money going away, but I -- but they could change their attitude, depending on how much bombardment occurs. I think really, that's how we see the world playing out. Repair is essential. It keeps going. But the mentality of the customers can shift between big ticket and small ticket. We saw -- I mean, it's evidence that you go back to just out of the COVID -- coming out of the COVID everybody had money and garages and never stopped, but they were focused on small ticket items, not big ticket. And when they started to get more comfortable and they had the psychological recovery and exhilaration, they started to go big ticket. That's what we see now. It's both of those. I think increasingly in the collision area is people are more and more interested in -- as we go forward in the sort of like the ADAS situation where you're talking about calibration and setting the neural network of sensors. And also, things like we talked about with Mitchell 1 with the special collision focused software because people are seeing that job more and more. Two things are happening -- three things are happening, I suppose. The first one is a lot of different materials in a car now. So you just can't bend steel, you have to cut different like carbon fiber and so on. So, there's a lot of different physical products that we sell that make that. That was -- that's a longstanding trend. And then as the neural networks have become more ubiquitous, they need a lot of software and hardware that's focused on that to recalibrate and do that. And then thirdly, collision jobs are getting more jobs because the collision has taken more time. If you don't think that -- when you hammer your bumper, see how much it costs you, how long it takes you to get it replaced. Those are taking more time. So, there's more work for collision jobs. So they're seeing three factors: one, the material; two, addressing the neural network; and three, just handling the volume and getting productivity. They were in line, pretty well balanced this quarter. They go up and down, but we're pretty -- we pretty much feel as though they're kind of matching up, and they have. They fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. But this quarter is evenly keeled. Maybe there's a little bit more selling off the van that's selling into there, maybe a little bit, but not anything significant. So, [Technical Difficulty] pretty solid. A lot of different things. I mean, fundamentally, the big kahuna in the Tools Group this time is ZEUS+, big ticket item, $12,000. So that's rolling through that business. And so that's the thing that gets your attention. I talked about this Neon Stinger, and I really meant it. It was flying off the shelf. We showed it at our kickoff and people loved it because [Technical Difficulty] and technicians want to make a statement. So tool storage has got some nice products. So you have a new model and diagnostic that's driving that. You have some really nice innovations in tool storage. And in hand tools, you have a number of different things, some of which are things like new pliers. We have a range of new pliers that everybody loves. I was talking to the franchisees, like I said, a couple of weeks ago. And these guys whipped out these pliers and started talking about how great they are and easy to sell because they're so functional, how in grip. They hold on really well, three positions, so you can handle any kind of job. People love them. So you see that. Plus we're bundling some things like impact sockets, putting together some impact sockets where they weren't bundled before. So people -- impact sockets are things you use for very hard and difficult like trucks, you really need a lot of power. So the sockets have to be of a different dimension, less hard but stronger, thicker wall and those kinds of things. So, we see those coming out, maybe focused on the truck shop. So those are the kinds of things that are driving the situation. But it's always that way. There's always a story around products. Not really. I mean, you could say this. Let me say this. Only in this way, not in the Tools Group for sure. I don't see it in the Tools group. You could argue that, all right, you tend to get garage owners who are also technicians, they are the probably number one buyer of a ZEUS+. So in that way, you might see more of that. But every time you roll out the top of the line diagnostic unit, you're seeing that. So adjusting for our expectations in that way, I don't see any change in the Tools Group. If you go to RS&I, while repairs -- software and diagnostic sales to independent repair shops were up, the two big pounders in RS&I was the OEM businesses following the new models and the equipment. But equipment is split between -- pretty much equally between garages and independent. So generally, you'll see a slight shading toward OEM garages on the RS&I side. You won't see any -- much of a mix change on the tools side except for the fact that ZEUS+ seems to always -- the big kahuna always sells, has a strong shop by. That's pretty much it. Other than that, we don't see any changes. David, it's a logical extension of -- higher credit maybe. But I'm not hearing it. I don't know. You're a windshield guy, too. I mean, I don't hear it in my windshield surveys, nobody is saying that. And I would just offer, our impression was based on how our franchisees are and how they say the technicians are is the balance sheets are pretty robust. So yes, that might happen, but I don't think we're seeing it happen now. I don't think that's occurring right now. I think this is a pretty robust sector. We haven't -- we didn't see it get manipulated during the great [Technical Difficulty] they were more cautious, but they were still pretty plush. So I don't know. Could happen, but I don't hear it anyway. Too far. That's why we're spending -- factories. Look, that is -- I was at these franchisees. I don't know, you can take this around many grains, so if you wish, but these guys are telling me they can sell every tool storage box they get. Backlogs go back. I don't want to really get into that. Sorry. But it's pretty substantial, probably longer than we would like. But sometimes we wonder -- I'd tell you what, just a key -- looking at sometimes we wonder it is better if the backlog is long. It makes people want them more. I don't know. You know what I mean? Because everybody wants a Snap-on box, it seems. So maybe it just makes it more attractive, like if you have to wait for a car for a long time. But we'd like to bring this backlog down. That's why we are enhancing our factories in all categories really. Virtually all of our product lines are up to the eyeballs and trying to turn out the factories. But the one that chases the most is tool storage because everywhere we go, people say, I need more. I need more. I need more. Because we offer discount packages all the time. That's part of the reason to buy now. You could say, okay, you don't have to have the discount package. But in reality -- in reality, David, our franchisees are conditioned to sell off a kind of deal. Our art is to make that deal attractive but leaner or richer depending on how we want to move the product. Actually, I don't worry so much about hand tools. I don't. I mean, hand tools have been strong come hell or high water. I mean I think -- I mean I only been here 15 years. So maybe that's not long enough. But the thing is it seems though hand tools -- if you're talking about the longer payback items, like I was talking to Liz, sooner or later, sometimes, the psychology of it all breaks through and even the guys who are working every day and pulling in the money, they say, I want to keep my powder dry for a while, sometimes. But that's a psychological balance, which I think right now there's tremendous reservoirs of optimism in the people of work. It's different than the big companies. If you look at the National Association of Manufacturers and you look at small manufacturers versus large manufacturers, there's all of a sudden a big divide between them in terms of their optimism, their outlook. The small guys have almost never been higher. So, I think this is part of what it is. I think there's a lot of talk. As you say, there's a lot of talk and just we saw -- I'm not saying it's wrong or anything like that. But when you walk in -- when I walk in a garage or meet the franchisees, they're saying, who's this guy? Is this guy, Paul? I don't even know who he is. Well, look, -- I like to do this. So I'll do this. Look, in C&I it's simple. Critical industries, boomshakalaka!. Critical industries are the highest margin business in that area. And the margins are robust and they did pretty well. And like we talked about the military and I don't know if you heard that call, but the military tends to be -- is the base by base type of product we're getting that's moving it. And that tends to be pretty good. So I think that's one factor you're seeing there. That's pretty strong. They were up -- the critical industries were up greater than 11%. And that's what drove the margins I think, principally, There were other things. I mean another thing is that generally, the supply chain is getting better, but some of the stuff you go out and buy a whole bunch of stuff on -- when you spot [ph] buy, you buy a lot because you don't want to have to not have them. So some of that stuff is working its way through. So it's a very complex mix. We are seeing some abatement. That should continue. But mostly, the big factor there, the 190 basis points had to do with critical industries doing well. The customized kits are great for us and they sold -- we broke some of the bottlenecks, and we did well in that situation. So that's C&I. If you look at Tools Group, it's -- there's no product mix story that I think guys were wondering; if there were, it wasn't that. But it is the fact that there is an attenuation in the commodities, so the commodities, which Tools Group is very vertically integrated, so they buy commodities in a lot of situations. So they get a nice pop from that. And so, they're getting some improvement in that situation. Of course, they're taking their foot off the pricing in concert with that. And then the Tools Group has been hammering away at RCI. So, you see a lot of that happening in this situation. So, we think the whole thing is sustainable. Now that -- I'm not telling you that the OI margin for the Tools Group is going to be the same next quarter, but we don't think they can't -- we believe they could go higher. Not necessarily next quarter, but we think there's room to move up from RCI and a rationalization of the situation."

            "content": "Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on slide 6. Net sales of $1.183 million in the quarter increased 7.8% from 2022 levels, reflecting a 10.2% organic sales gain, partially offset by $24 million or 240 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase this quarter includes broad-based gains across all of the segments. From a geographic perspective, we experienced double-digit year-over-year organic sales growth in North America and low single-digit organic gains in Europe. Consolidated gross margin of 49.8% improved 110 basis points from 48.7% last year. Contributions from the increased sales volumes and pricing actions and benefits from the Company's RCI initiatives more than offset the effects of higher material and other costs as well as 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency. While the supply chain environment has somewhat improved, we believe the corporation continued to navigate effectively costs and other challenges associated with the ongoing conditions. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 27.8%, improved 60 basis points from 28.4% last year. Operating earnings before financial services of $259.8 million in the quarter compared to $223.1 million in 2022. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 22% improved 170 basis points from last year's first quarter. Financial Services revenue of $92.6 million in the first quarter of 2023 increased 5.6% compared to $87.7 million last year. Operating earnings of $66.3 million decreased $4.1 million from 2022 levels and included a return to what we believe to be a more normal level of provisions for credit losses than those recorded last year. Consolidated operating earnings $326.1 million in the quarter compared to $293.5 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 25.6% improved 80 basis points from last year. Our first quarter effective income tax rate of 23.1% compared to 23.7% last year. Net earnings of $248.7 million or $4.60 per diluted share including $0.12 of unfavorable impact associated with foreign currency, increased $31.3 million or $0.60 per share from 2022 levels, representing a 15% increase in diluted earnings per share. Now, let's turn to our segment results for the quarter. Starting with C&I on slide 7. Sales of $363.8 million increased from $340.1 million last year, reflecting a $36.2 million or 11.1% organic sales gain, which was partially offset by $12.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic growth primarily reflects double-digit gains in sales to customers in critical industries and in the segment specialty torque business as well as low single-digit increase in the segment's European-based hand tools business. With respect to critical industries, the sales gains were wide ranging in the quarter. In addition to higher activity across general industry, sales of the military were robust as were sales to technical education, aviation and natural resources. Gross margin of 38.8% improved 240 basis points from 36.4% in the first quarter of 2022. This was primarily due to higher sales volumes including increased activity and the higher gross margin critical industries, pricing actions and benefits from RCI initiatives. These improvements were partially offset by the effects of higher material and other costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 23.5% in the quarter increased 50 basis points from 23% in 2022, mostly due to increased sales and higher expense businesses. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $55.8 million increased 22.1%, $45.7 million last year. The operating margin of 15.3% improved 190 basis points from 13.4% last year. Turning now to slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $537 million compared to $512.1 million a year ago, reflecting a 6.3% organic sales gain, partially offset by $7.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales growth reflects a high single-digit gain in our U.S. business and a low single-digit increase in our international operations. Sales in the quarter were up year-over-year in all product lines. Gross margin of 47.3% in the quarter improved 180 basis points from 45.5% last year. This increase is primarily due to higher sales volumes and pricing actions, lower material and other costs and benefits from RCI initiatives, partially offset by 80 basis points of unfavorable currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22.8% were unchanged from last year. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $131.7 million, including $6.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $15.7 million from last year, while the operating margin of 24.5%, including 80 basis points of unfavorable currency effects, improved 180 basis points from 22.7% in 2022. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on slide 9. Sales of $446.6 million increased 12.2% from $398.2 million in 2022, reflecting a 13.9% organic sales gain, partially offset by $6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain is comprised of double-digit increases in sales of undercar and collision repair equipment and in activity with OEM dealerships and a mid-single-digit gain in the sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers. Gross margin of 43.5% declined 110 basis points from 44.6% last year, primarily due to increased sales in lower gross margin businesses and the effects of higher material and other costs. These declines were partially offset by benefits from pricing actions and savings from our RCI initiatives as well as 30 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 20.1% improved 150 basis points from 21.6% last year, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage and higher activity and lower expense businesses and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $104.6 million compared to $91.6 million last year. The operating margin of 23.4% compared to 23% reported a year ago. Now turning to slide 10. Revenue from financial services of $92.6 million increased from $87.7 million last year, primarily reflecting the growth of the loan portfolio. Financial Services operating earnings of $66.3 million, including $700,000 of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $70.4 million in 2022. Financial services expenses of $26.3 million were up $9 million from 2022 levels, including $8.1 million of higher provisions for credit losses. The year-over-year increase in provisions reflects both the growth of the portfolio as well as a return to what we believe to be a more normal pre-pandemic rate of provision. For reference, provisions for finance receivable losses in the quarter were $14.2 million, as compared to $6.3 million in the first quarter last year. In the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, provisions for losses were $12.5 million and $15.8 million, respectively. In addition, the gross worldwide extended credit or finance receivable portfolio has increased 7.5% year-over-year, and we believe the delinquency and portfolio performance trends currently remain stable. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1.1% in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to 8 -- 0.8% last year. In the first quarters of 2023 and 2022, respective average yield on finance receivables were 17.7% and 17.6%. In the first quarters of 2023 and 2022, the average yield on contract receivables were 8.7% and 8.5%, respectively. Total loan originations of $300.9 million in the first quarter increased $55.3 million or 22.5% from 2022 levels, reflecting a 25.1% increase in originations of finance receivables and a 9.2% increase in originations of contract receivables. The increase in finance receivable origination reflects the continued strong demand for big ticket products sold by our franchisees during the quarter. Moving to slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $2.3 billion of gross financing receivables, including $2 billion from our U.S. operation. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.5% for U.S. extended credit compares to 1.6% in 2022. On a sequential basis, the rate is down 10 basis points, reflecting the seasonal trend we typically experience between the fourth and first quarters. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $45.1 million represented 2.46% of outstandings at the end of the first quarter. While this was up 12 basis points from a year ago, it is 45 basis points lower than year-end 2019. Now turning to slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $301.6 million in the quarter compared to $193.9 million last year. The increase from the first quarter of 2022 primarily reflects lower year-over-year increases in working investment, improved net earnings and lower cash tax and compensation payments. Net cash used by investing activities of $72.9 million included net additions to finance receivables of $49.6 million and capital expenditures of $23 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $152.1 million included cash dividends of $86.1 million and the repurchase of 356,000 shares of common stock for $87.2 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $345.4 million of common stock under existing authorizations. Turning to slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $20.7 million from 2022 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 62 days compared to 61 days at 2022 year-end. Inventories increased $16 million from 2022 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.4 compared to 2.5 at year-end 2022. The growth in inventory primarily reflects higher demand, including inventories to support new products as well as critical industry projects. Additionally, to better assure availability given the dynamics of the current supply chain situation, our level of safety stocks and in-transit parts components and raw materials are up as our year-over-year costs associated with finished goods. Our quarter end cash position of $833.8 million compared to $757.2 million at year-end 2022. Our net debt to capital ratio of 7.4% compared to 9% at year-end 2022. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million available under our credit facilities. And as of quarter-end, there are no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there are no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2023. We anticipate that capital expenditures will approximate $100 million. In addition, we currently anticipate that our full year 2023 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Bret, probably not. And the reason for that is we hold our rates. They're not the lowest rates in the world. They are reflective of the credit profile of the customers that we serve. So they certainly are competitive in the segment where we play. But our rates have been kind of steady over the decade, not just the years, decade, and we're funded long, as you probably recall. And therefore, we don't have the same upward pressure on our cost of funds for the next several years. So, as a result of that, we tend to hold the program steady. So the uptick you see right now really is probably reflective a little bit of the slightly better profile of customers as maybe compared to a year or so ago, but it's very slight, right, 17.6 to 17.7. So look, the cost is similar -- similar, there's slight pockets of improvement. Every once in a while, you still have to resort to a spot buy and you're looking at materials. So, I'd say the most broadly speaking, as I think we said earlier, is that there's some improvement, but every day, you have to remain agile, flexible. There's always a new challenge when you walk in the door. So, modest improvement, but still, you got to bring all your resources to the table to effectively manage it. I don't know if you're looking at other income, but if we're looking at that... Actually, believe it or not, Gary, on the cash that we have on hand, we're earning a much higher level of interest income than what we did last year. You might remember, about a year ago, you're getting hardly nothing on your money. Now effectively, the corporation is earning about 4.75% on whatever cash it does have. For -- the contract receivables are with the franchisees and the van leases and inventory. So, that's..."

[Operator Instructions] After today's remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Sara Verbsky, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nSara Verbsky: Thank you, Gary and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us today as we review Snap-on's third quarter results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call, Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick-off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions. As usual, we provided slides to supplement our discussion. These slides can be accessed under the Downloads tab in the webcast viewer as well as on our website, snapon.com, under the Investors section. These slides will be archived on our website along with the transcript of today's call. Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates, or beliefs or that otherwise discuss management's or the company's outlook, plans, or projections are forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings. Finally, this presentation includes non-GAAP measures of financial performance, which are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for their GAAP counterparts. Additional information regarding these measures is included in our earnings release issued today, which can be found on our website. With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?\nNick Pinchuk: Thanks Sara. Good morning everyone. As usual, I'll start with the highlights of our third quarter. I'll provide my perspectives on the results, on our markets, and on our path ahead. After that, Aldo will give you a detailed review of the financials. My perspective, I am encouraged and we believe our third quarter was encouraging, another period of broad profitability growth and significant forward progress, product and process success, and clear traction in our Tools Group pivot to quick paybacks. Of course, the quarter again had its challenges, ongoing macro pressures creating obstacles of uncertainty, just like we've encountered before. But in the end, we adjusted, withstood the turbulence, took advantage of the opportunities, and drove another strong earnings performance. And all of that is written clearly across the results. Here they are. Third quarter sales of $1,147 million were slightly down from the $1,159.3 million recorded last year. On an organic basis, excluding $200,000 in unfavorable foreign currency translation and $7.2 million from acquisitions, our organic sales were lower by 1.7%. But the OpCo operating income was up, and the OI margin was 22%, up 80 basis points, setting a new benchmark for our third quarters. For financial services, the OI grew to $71.7 million, that's up from the $69.4 million of 2023, a number that when combined with our OpCo result, raised our consolidated OI margin to 26%, up 90 basis points from last year's 25.1%. And EPS, it was $4.70, a nice gain from last year's $4.51. So, those are the overall results, marked by operating capability, structural balance, and consistent resilience prevailing against significant headwinds. Now, let's take a view of the market. During the third quarter, automotive repair remained robust. It continued to expand in complexity. New models entered the market, unveiling a rollout of new drivetrains, motor configurations, and high-tech electrical systems that control a neural network of sensors woven together that enable driver-assisted vehicle autonomy, all of it housed in modern chassis, fashioned out of space age materials. And this cavocated [ph] sophisticated advancements combined with an aging car park, now averages 12.6 years to make fixing vehicles even more challenging if you're from Snap-on. This is music to your ears and the hits just keep on coming, creating opportunities for years to come. Let's talk about organizations. The OEM, the dealerships, the independent garages, the segment that primarily focuses on infrastructure-type investments, recovering things like renovating bays and upgrading repair equipment, meeting the challenges of new vehicle models and expanding shop capacities to match the rise in repair work, driven by the ongoing increase in vehicle complexity. New lifts to support the extra weight of battery systems, sophisticated undercar equipment to calibrate the driver assist systems that enable vehicle automation and more powerful software suites for managing parts rooms, service space, and customer interfaces, enhanced vehicle communication devices to interact with the more complex designs and more powerful repair information databases to read, to diagnose, and to fix the vehicles of the now and of the future. Our repair information group or RS&I thrives in this world of complexity, serving repair shop owners and managers, delivering solutions that make the full repair path much easier, paving the way forward with innovative dealership management systems, proprietary one-of-a-kind intelligent diagnostics platforms, and the full array of capable shop equipment. Now, the opportunities for the garages is strong, but uncertain interest rates, rumors of tax changes, and worries over the elections are all weighing on investment decisions, creating a mixed landscape across the market, but the overall outlook still remains quite positive. And we believe that Snap-on and RS&I are poised to participate fully in the abundant opportunities. Now, let's shift to the technician market. These are the folks who decipher the data, touch the screen, diagnose the problems, twirl the wrenches and wheel their extraordinary skills to execute the repair. It's where our van network applies its trade. In that regard, the third quarter is always a great time for me because it's when we hold our annual Snap-on Franchisee Conference, or SFC. It's a gathering of men and women who drive the vans and call on hundreds of thousands of techs every week. It's an unmatched connection to the world of vehicle repair. Again, this year, I had extended conversations with dozens and dozens of our franchisees and each encounter resonated with enthusiasm. We say Snap-on prevails in turbulence and proceeds with confidence and the franchisees know it's true. Now, with that said, the macro environment is still weighing on our technician customers with considerable uncertainty, driven by the election and its perceived impact, the fears of ongoing inflation by border pressure and by the specter of prolonged wars. The shops are full, yech wages are up, the hours are expanding, and the demand for tech continues. They have cash, but they're still confidence poor. The bad news they get every day for breakfast is weighing on them. Right now, they're hesitant on the future and as such, they're reluctant on big ticket items with longer paybacks. So, to accommodate, the Tools Group continues to pivot, focusing on shorter payback items to match the technicians' current preferences. And the third quarter results confirm that it's working. So, we believe the automotive repair market is robust. Current uncertainty notwithstanding, it's a great place to operate. Now, let's turn to the critical industries, where the penalty for failure is high, this is where our commercial and industrial group or C&I makes its living. It's challenging, rugged environments like oil and gas platforms, mining sites, and battlefields, but it also includes sensitive and sophisticated atmospheres needed to manufacture computer chips to build airplanes and to launch rockets. The customers in this segment are organizations big and small, and they're more influenced by the data than the text, interest rates, GDP, and industry demands. And as such, these segments are pretty positive. And we see it in the results, growth in aviation, in defense, in general industries, and sectors that need our precision torque device to execute and document accuracy and the areas enabled by our custom kits, packages that meet the specific needs of the tasks that improve quality, productivity, and safety. In other words, solutions that are right up our alley. This is also the segment where our largest international presence is. And consequently, it's the segment with the headwinds of geopolitical turbulence. In that regard, Europe continues to vary region-by-region. The South remains positive, but several countries, particularly in the North, are dealing with difficulty in some cases, technical recessions. And in Asia, it's also mixed. China is still recovering from the pandemic and the effects of the extended lockdowns. At the same time, Korea and Japan are resilient. So, there are geographic challenges in the critical industries. But overall, this market is positive. The potential is considerable, and we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on these possibilities. Well, those are the markets. Now, let's -- those are the markets -- in summary, automotive repair is mixed in the now, but broad potential for the future. And the critical industries are still robust and rich with opportunities. Now, let's talk about the operating groups. In C&I, sales of $365.7 million compared to $366.4 million registered last year. Sales excluding $7.3 million of acquisition-related volume -- excluding the $7.2 million of acquisition-related volume, the organic sales were down by 2.1%. From an earnings perspective, however, C&I OI of $61 million improved by $2.9 million or 5% over last year, and the OI margin was 16.7%, up 80 basis points, expanding to -- equaling the record high established in the last quarter. The major contributor was our industrial division, continuing its upward trajectory and strong profitability, wielding the capacity provided by its new kitting center in Kenosha and meeting the rising demand for customized solutions along the way. In addition to our investments in the kitting center, our acquisition of Mountz last year is rolling into its 12th month, and it's been a valuable contributor in meeting the needs of our customers for small precision torque. Torque continues to be -- to rise in significance with critical industry customers. And to meet this need, we packaged our existing medium and heavy-duty torque products with Mountz's lighter offerings, giving us a wide spectrum of clamping forces -- the wide spectrum of clamping forces that are essential to the critical industry from oil and gas to the aviation to defense. We're capitalizing on that opportunity and the quarter showed it. Our specialty torque business rose significantly both in volume and in profitability. We also continued adding to our portfolio of professional cordless tools, engineered products, aligned with the work performed and the expectations of techs doing repairs. For the serious people of work, new products can add great value and our quarter was marked by that effect. For working on large equipment and over-the-road trucks, we unveiled a CT9175 3.75-inch 18-volt impact, not for the faint of heart. This unit delivers 1,550 foot-pounds of bolt breakaway torque. It's ideal for the most challenging jobs. The rugged lightweight housing shakes off harsh environments. The ergonomic design reduces stress and fatigue, pretty important when you're wielding 1,550 foot-pounds. And this 9175 monster has a great feature set to boot like LED spotlights, multiple power settings, and a variable speed trigger to just apply the right torque to the job. It's a great tool. Just what you'd expect from Snap-on, powerful application, easy to use and very efficient. It's a tool that techs increasingly want in their arsenal when they're fighting the toughest jobs. The 9175, it's a great productivity enhancer and the technicians have noticed. One last thought about the results. C&I kept investing in the quarter, maintaining and expanding our advantage in product, brands, and in people. Operating expenses were 140 basis points of sales higher than last year. But with the benefits of rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, the value of new -- and the value of new products, gross margins rose by 220 basis points and the OI margin, despite the spending, was up 80 basis points, higher spending and higher profits without additional scale. That's C&I, innovative products, custom solutions, precision instruments, all combined to reach customers in critical industries and extend the Snap-on brand out of the garage with momentum and profitability. Now, for the Tools Group. Sales in the third quarter of $500.5 million included an organic decrease of 3.1% with a U.S. decrease that was not much different. The OI margin in the period was 21.6%, down 40 basis points from last year due to the lower volume. With that said, gross margins remained strong, improving 100 basis points, driven by new products, RCI, and manufacturing efficiencies. That was quite a feat actually. And during the period, our team maintained its focus on product development, designing solutions that make work easier and provide customers with quick paybacks. And that pivot is taking hold, closing the deficit both overall in the U.S. to less than half it was in the second quarter. And that trend was reinforced in the period by sales being $18.5 million higher than the second quarter. With summer vacation and SFC breaks, we haven't seen the Tools Group up sequentially in the third quarter for some time. We believe it's a sign of considerable momentum. The Tools Group is coming back. Beyond the numbers, we held our annual SFC in August this year in Orlando with attendance reaching 9,000 franchisees, guests, and Snap-on associates. This tool show spanned over three football fields showcasing the latest in product innovation, more than 4,500 SKUs strong. The weekend also was packed with training sessions, purposely designed to grow each fan's business and expand the franchisees' already substantial product knowledge. Among those seminars was an in-depth review of our intelligent diagnostic portfolio with instructors connected directly to the vehicles, communicating with the cars in real-time and clearly demonstrating our industry-leading advantage. It attracted a lot of attention. And we celebrated Saturday night by transporting the entire crew in what could be described as an armada of buses to SeaWorld for a night of roller coasters, aquatic shows, and a lot of fun. It was another memorable event, but principally, it serves as a testament to the unique bond that our franchisees hold with the Snap-on team. I believe anyone attending would affirm that the franchisees left reassured on the power of our operation, enthusiastic about their way forward with our enterprise and convinced that Snap-on really does prevail in difficulty and proceed with confidence. The product booths at this year's event were pretty busy. We're busy, especially near the Cartway to Heaven. It was an eye-catching and colorful wall of mobile tool carts. The model that stole the show was our brand-new KRSC 2460 flip-top roll cart, a unit that offers Snap-on tool storage in a quick payback form, just what techs want in today's world. That's why it was so popular. The 2460 can hold a significant breadth of sockets, wrenches, and power tools in a variety of drawers that range from 2-inch to 3-inch to 5-inch configurations. And the ultra-deep top compartment is designed with five AC outlets and two USB ports to ensure that electrical devices are charged and at-the-ready for any use at any time. The launch was a significant success, and it provides even more testimony that the Tools Group traction to pivoting -- and pivoting to shorter payback items is working. Also on the shop floor were products highlighting Snap-on's customer connection. We stand next to mechanics, observing work, experiencing the complexity of vehicle repair, and we use those insights gained and design innovations that make work easier. One such custom solution available at the SFC was our new S8400 half-inch drive axle spindle nut socket. That's a mouthful. It's manufactured right here in the U.S.A., our Elkmont, Alabama plant. Since 2022, GM 3500 heavy-duty pickups have used a unique fastener that's very deep into the axle -- inside the axle hub. It's a very difficult and time-consuming operation to extract it with standard tooling. So, our new specially designed socket reaches in, links precisely with the embedded fastener, and it makes the removal or installation safe, quick, and effortless. Each vehicle is unique and a range of different repairs are needed as they age. This is the motherload for a toolmaker and Snap-on customer connection positions our team to have just the device to match the task. It's a great advantage that was on display at the SFC and it was on display in our third quarter results. The Tools Group, pivoting to quick paybacks, launching differentiating new products, and summoning resilience against the headwinds. Now, for RS&I. Sales of $422.7 million in the third quarter represented an organic decline of 1.9%. Lower sales in undercar equipment and reduced activity with OEM dealerships were partially offset by higher sales in diagnostics and information products to independent shops -- for independent shops. In effect, declines in hardware, balanced by gains in software. OI for RS&I was $107.3 million, up 2.3% compared to last year, despite the lower sales and the OI margin of 25.4%, one of the group's highest for some time, was up 110 basis points from 2023. All of it was authored by big product and RCI-driven gains in gross -- RCI-driven gains in gross margins, partially offset by spending in operating expenses. Gross margin is up, operating expense is balancing some of it, but it was all the investment was there to maintain and extend our advantages and so we did. During the quarter, RS&I launched its latest addition to our intelligent diagnostic lineup, the APOLLO+. This is a new ergonomically designed handheld that offers a 2-second boot up, the fastest in the industry and a large 10-inch touchscreen for improved visibility and navigation. Most importantly, the platform is powered by our proprietary intelligent diagnostic software with almost 3 billion data records and over 400 billion unique diagnostic events, all organized to help technicians diagnose and fix vehicles much faster. It was introduced in mid-August, toward the end of the quarter, and it represents a tech's most economical way to wield the power of intelligent diagnostics. And it already has the customers' attention. Our on the Street feedback says the new sophisticated platform with a quick payback is a real hit and we believe it has a great future. We're encouraged by the strength of our handheld diagnostics and the other unique solutions we provide and that confidence is reinforced by outside experts. Our SOLUS handheld was eligible for the 2024 awards and it was cited by Motor Magazine as one of the top of the 2024 Top 20 Tools. And it was also recognized by Power Tools and Equipment News, or P10, for one of its -- as one of the 2024 People's Choice Awards, that's a distinction based on the endorsements from real technicians, actual users from all across the nation. RS&I also received P10 recognitions for its Collision Repair package. It's on-truck brake-wave, it's heavy-duty diagnostic software and its M1, Mitchell 1 Shop Management System. Collectively this year, across all our operations, Snap-on won 20 such awards. Product is a Snap-on advantage, and everybody knows it. We're confident in the strength of RS&I and we'll keep driving to expand its position with repair shop owners and managers, making work easier, the base more productive, and providing the garages with the means to match the ever-growing challenges of modern vehicle repair. Well, those are the third quarter results. Tools Group, demonstrating improvement sequentially, pivoting effectively to meet customer preferences. C&I and RS&I, innovative new products and operating efficiencies, managing the headwinds, producing benchmark OI margins. And for the overall corporation, sales organically down 1.7%, but OpCo OI, up 2.9%. Opco OI margin of 22%, up 80 basis points; and EPS, $4.70, up 4.2%, rising over every comparison, all achieved against the wins. It was another encouraging quarter. Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?\nAldo Pagliari: Thanks Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $1,147 million in the quarter compared to $1,159.3 million last year, reflecting a 1.7% organic sales decline and $300,000 of unfavorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by $7.2 million of acquisition-related sales. Despite the ongoing uncertainties of the current environment, overall sales activity in the quarter can be characterized as stable. And while our franchise van channel revenues continue to be tempered by technician confidence, the Tools Group generated higher sales sequentially versus last quarter. Generally, the third quarter reflects lower sales dollar activity as compared to the second quarter. Consolidated gross margin improved 130 basis points to 51.2% from 49.9% last year, reflecting increased sales in higher gross margin businesses, benefits from the company's RCI initiatives and lower material and other costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales rose 50 basis points to 29.2% from 28.7% in 2023, primarily due to the lower sales volumes. Operating earnings before financial services of $252.4 million in the quarter compared to $245.2 million in 2023. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 22% represented an improvement of 80 basis points from the 21.2% reported last year. Financial services' revenues of $100.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $94.9 million last year, while operating earnings of $71.7 million compared to $69.4 million in 2023. Consolidated operating earnings of $324.1 million compared to $314.6 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin increased 90 basis points to 26% from 25.1% in 2023. Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 22.9% compared to 22.6% last year. Net earnings of $251.1 million compared to $243.1 million in 2023 and net earnings per diluted share of $4.70 in the quarter compared to $4.51 per diluted share last year, an increase of 4.2%. Now, let's turn to our segment results for the quarter, starting with C&I on Slide 7. Sales of $365.7 million compared to $366.4 million last year, reflecting a 2.1% organic sales decline, partially offset by $7.2 million of acquisition-related sales. The organic decrease is primarily due to double-digit reduction with respect to intersegment sales of power tools and a mid-single-digit decline in the segment's European-based hand tool businesses. These were partially offset by a gain in sales to customers in critical industries, including a high single-digit increase in specialty torque. With respect to critical industries, in addition to higher torque product sales, defense and aviation-related activity was strong, but it was somewhat offset by declines in the natural resources sector. Gross margin improved 220 basis points to 41.2% in the third quarter from 39% in 2023. This was largely due to the increased sales volume and higher gross margin critical industry sectors, lower material and other costs, savings from RCI initiatives, and 50 basis points of benefit from acquisitions. These improvements were partially offset by 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 140 basis points to 24.5% in the quarter from 23.1% in 2023, primarily due to investments in personnel and other costs and a 50 basis point impact from acquisitions. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $61 million compared to $58.1 million last year. The operating margin improved 80 basis points to 16.7% from 15.9% in 2023. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $500.5 million compared to $515.4 million a year ago, reflecting a 3.1% organic sales decline and $900,000 of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic decrease reflects a mid-single-digit decline in our U.S. business, partially offset by a low single-digit gain in our international operations. That being said, it is meaningful to highlight that sales in the historically lower third quarter period are higher than the $482 million recorded in the second quarter of this year, representing a sequential increase of 3.8%. We believe this as well as the more modest year-over-year sales decline in the U.S. van network in the third quarter than in previous quarters favorably demonstrates the resilience of this business. Gross margin improved 100 basis points to 47.3% in the quarter from 46.3% last year, primarily due to lower material and other costs and benefits from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 140 basis points to 25.7% in the quarter from 24.3% in 2023, largely due to the lower sales volume. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $108.3 million compared to $113.4 million last year. The operating margin of 21.6% compared to 22% in 2023. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $422.7 million compared to $431.8 million in 2023, reflecting a 1.9% organic sales decline and $900,000 of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic decrease includes a mid-single-digit decline in the sales of undercar equipment and a low single-digit reduction in activity with OEM dealerships, where we often see variability in essential tool programs from period-to-period. These decreases were partially offset by a low single-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. Gross margin improved 190 basis points to 47.4% from 45.5% last year, primarily reflecting increased sales of higher gross margin products. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 80 basis points to 22% from 21.2% in 2023, largely due to lower sales volumes and increased personnel and other costs. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $107.3 million compared to $104.9 million last year. The operating margin improved 110 basis points to 25.4% from the 24.3% reported last year. Now, turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services increased $5.5 million or 5.8% to $100.4 million from $94.9 million last year, primarily reflecting the growth of the loan portfolio. Financial services operating earnings of $71.7 million compared to $69.4 million in 2023. Financial services expenses were up $3.2 million from 2023 levels, including $2.4 million of higher provisions for credit losses. Sequentially, the provisions for credit losses were lower by $1.6 million. In the third quarters of both 2024 and 2023, the average yield on finance receivables was 17.7%. In the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, the average yield on contract receivables were 9.1% and 8.8%, respectively. Total loan originations of $288 million in the third quarter represented a decrease of $17.2 million or 5.6% from 2023 levels, reflecting a 6.7% decline in extended credit originations and a 1.3% decrease in originations of contract receivables. The decrease in extended credit originations mostly reflects lower sales of big-ticket items. Geographically, extended credit originations were consistent with the sales activity in the Tools Group with the decline in the U.S. only partially offset by growth in originations internationally. Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.5 billion of gross financing receivables with $2.2 billion from our U.S. operation. For extended credit or finance receivables, the U.S. 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.9% is up 40 basis points from the third quarter of 2023. Trailing 12-month net losses for the overall extended credit portfolio of $62.3 million represented 3.11% of outstandings at quarter end. While delinquencies and net losses are trending upward, we believe that these portfolio performance metrics remain relatively balanced considering the current environment. Now, turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $274.2 million in the quarter represented 106% of net earnings and compared to $285.4 million last year. The decrease in cash flow as compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily reflects increases in working investment, which were partially offset by higher net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $40.5 million mostly reflected net additions to finance receivables of $20.6 million and capital expenditures of $20.4 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $156.2 million included cash dividends of $97.9 million and the repurchase of 215,000 shares of common stock for $59.9 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $471.5 million of common stock under our existing authorizations, including under the $500 million authorization recently approved by the Board of Directors in August of this year. Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $5.1 million from 2023 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 61 days compared to 60 days at year-end 2023. Inventories decreased $10.1 million from 2023 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.3 remained unchanged from year-end. Our quarter end cash position of $1,313.3 million compared to $1,1.5 million at year-end 2023. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $900 million available under our credit facilities. As of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2024. For the full year, we expect that capital expenditures will be approximately $100 million and we currently anticipate that our full year 2024 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 22% to 23%. Finally, with respect to corporate costs, we would expect expenses in the upcoming fourth quarter to be more in line with those incurred in the third quarter of this year as the fourth quarter of 2023 included some benefit for the recovery of costs associated with a legal matter, which will not repeat. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?\nA - Nick Pinchuk: Well, thanks, Aldo. Well, that's our quarter, resilience against the turbulence. We believe the period demonstrated that with great clarity. Sales attenuated, but great products solving critical tasks, material savings, and RCI drove strong and substantial gains in gross margins, strong enough that we're able to keep investing in our product, brand, and our people, maintaining and building them for the opportunities to come, and still increase OI margins significantly. And all of that was authored by the ongoing characteristics of our -- of the Snap-on Enterprise. Businesses that are strategically positioned for advantage for establishing and maintaining ongoing connections to the customers, processes embedded in Snap-on value creation that really do deliver progress every day. And a very capable team that's committed to our enterprise, greatly experienced and battle-tested and is well able to consistently marshal advantage to drive -- for driving positive outcomes and you see that all across the corporation. C&I sales down low single-digits for profits up, OI margin, 16.7%, up 80 basis points. Gross margins up 220 basis points, gains from wielding customization in the critical industries. The Tools Group, meeting the challenges -- of the challenges of the day, executing the pivot to quick payback items, closing the sales gap and displaying momentum. Sales down low single-digits, OI margin is 21.6%, down 40 basis points, but gross margins up 100 basis points. RS&I, wielding its advantage with software, sales down low single-digits, but profits up and OI margins of 25.4%, up 110 basis points and gross margins up 190 basis points and it all came together as a corporation. Sales attenuated lower by 1.7% organically, but OI rising from last year. OI margins reaching 22%, up 80 basis points and gross margins up triple-digit basis points all across the corporation and an EPS of $4.70, up versus every -- up over every comparison. It was another encouraging quarter. And we believe that propelled by our device -- decisive advantage in our product, in our brand, and our people, all maintained and strengthened even in the turbulence, Snap-on will continue its momentum, so clearly demonstrated in the quarter and extend our trend of positive performance well on through the days and the years to come. Now, before I turn the call over to the operator, I want to speak directly to our franchisees and associates. As always, I know many of you are listening. Our quarter demonstrates that Snap-on does indeed prevail in turbulence. And once again, you are the creators of that result, hard one. For your achievements in authoring our success, you have my congratulations. For the skill, energy, and experience you bring to bear every day. On behalf of our team, you have my admiration and for your unshakable confidence in and dedication to the future of our enterprise, you have my thanks. Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Glynn: Thanks. Good morning Nick, Aldo, and Sara.\nNick Pinchuk: Good morning Chris.\nChristopher Glynn: Good morning. I wanted to dive into the kind of seasonal strength at SOT. Does that feel like kind of a reset baseline for normal seasonal, kind of, patterns from here. We usually have a fourth quarter lift or -- maybe that gets into what the sell-in sell-through was in the third quarter, too, and that needs to be tested on the sell-through in the current quarter?\nNick Pinchuk: The sell-through, as you know, hasn't been -- the sales off the van for some time have been a little bit more than our sales to the van. In this particular quarter, it was slightly reversed in that situation. The sales to the van were a little bit better. But the third quarter is kind of a hard one to predict. I always call it squirrely in that situation. So, we -- if it wasn't for the third quarter, I think this is much more definitive, but it's clear that the Tools Group is doing better, certainly did better in the third quarter. And we have not seen a third quarter over the second quarter in a dog's age, except for the one in the COVID where we had -- we came out in a V-shaped recovery in the third quarter. But you can look back for a long time and you don't see that. And this is the total group, and it's the U.S. in general and so we view it as some momentum. The question is, I suppose, will they be able to continue that momentum? We think they can. We like their products, and we like the fact that doing this has come out of their profitability up 100 basis points. They got a little bit of volume impact, but the 100 basis points of gross margin wielded by great new products and the manufacturing efficiencies in some ways that come out of the new expansions that are more productive than the old across the major plants in the United States. So, we think things are moving positively. But we don't give guidance, but I like our chances going forward for the tools.\nChristopher Glynn: Sounds great. And then just switching on RS&I. It's been very sturdy run rate, third quarter, a bit of a step down, historically, not much routine seasonality, though 3Q last year also kind of deviated a little lower versus kind of the way the business had been trending. So, curious if you can offer any insights around that? Maybe does it feel like the equipment side is entering an interim pause after some steady customers recapitalizing?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, I'd say -- look, I think the thing as I stated that the -- I said in my -- very simple, hardware down, software up. So, the hardware piece is the equipment piece, and that was -- there was some attenuation of that. Some of that can be seasonal. I don't know, I wouldn't hang my hat on that, but there is a little bit of headwind in the third quarter. vacations that happened in the garages and so on and stuff like that. But I think there is some uncertainty in the garages that may weigh on that, and we'll see how that plays out going forward. Look, I think the other piece of it is the OEM lumpy business, which kind of hit a flat spot in this quarter, but we don't think that's going to be continuing every quarter. It's just that it's lumpy, and we happen to catch a lump, a downward lump, depression in this quarter. But the real good thing is if you look at the software businesses, you look at the diagnostics business, the Mitchell, those business, the diagnostics information, which is Mitchell and diagnostic itself to repair shop owners and managers up and those things are profitable. And then you have the sales of electronic parts catalogs, another software piece up. And if you look at the software in the Tools Group associated with diagnostics, yes, it's -- we're increasing -- we're following hardware launches, but increasing the software looks pretty strong. And if you look at the software in the diagnostic -- just in the Tools business, that's a pretty good piece of business that's up year-over-year, and that helped drive some of the profitability in the Tools Group. So, I feel pretty good about RS&I. I'm not so worried about it. I think -- and by the way, if you could trade off the software businesses at high margins for a little bit of turbulence in the hardware business, wouldn't you do it? I would.\nChristopher Glynn: Thank you, Nick.\nOperator: The next question is from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Please go ahead.\nGary Prestopino: Hey good morning all. Hey Nick, in your narrative, you did try and give us a peek here as to what this pivot in the Tools Group, how it impacted the quarter and on a quarterly basis, sequentially, you were up $18 million. Is -- could you maybe just help us here, was the majority of that sequential increase due to the pivot in sales?\nNick Pinchuk: A lot of it was. Hand tools. Hand tools were the strongest category in this quarter. And it was a bigger -- why we -- why you can see the pivot is when you look at it all, I don't like parsing those numbers. It'd be a little bit squirrely from quarter-to-quarter. But really, hand tools represented a major mix of Tools Group sales to the franchisees in this quarter than for -- all the way back to the pandemic. And so that is helping drive this. That is the real testimony to the pivot because that is what we wanted to have happened because this is what customers are ready to buy, and that helped a lot of that situation. Plus it helps the margins.\nGary Prestopino: Is it safe to say that a lot of this was due to new products coming into the market that you introduced?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, I think yes and there are also promotions overlay -- look, we had 4,500 -- there's a little thing, 4,500 products, I think SKUs displayed in our Tool Show at the SFC and over 500 were new in some way. Now, I'm not saying they were all breakthrough products. But there were 500 of the 4,500 franchisees could say, I'm offering our customers something they couldn't quite have before. And so that qualifies as something new, and it gives you something to sell and that helped push some of this. And a lot of that was in that area. Although promotion can also make hand tools look good if you strike the right cord. You give away for example, buy a set of hand tools, you get a dinner with Aldo Pagliari, for example. This will sell a lot of things.\nGary Prestopino: I'd buy a whole Snap-on toolbox of tools just to do that.\nAldo Pagliari: I'll remember that.\nGary Prestopino: The last question is, it seems like you've kind of talked about your torque products in C&I over the last couple of quarters. Now, has that -- is something changing in the market that is moving more towards specialty torque? I know you developed products and obviously, you've made some acquisitions in that area. But could you just help us out on what kind of secular tailwinds there are that's driving for?\nNick Pinchuk: I can answer that in asking you a question. Can you say the word Boeing?\nGary Prestopino: Yes.\nNick Pinchuk: I think this is -- it's a little bit like, but this is kind of an example. I think people are becoming more and more aware that the mechanisms throughout critical industries are more and more complex and therefore, precision has to be greater than may have been applied in the past. So, one, you need more precise tools and torque wrenches are an element of that or a deliverer of that. And the more accurate they are, the wider range they are, the better you're able to do that in your operations. That's number one. And then the second one, Gary, is everybody wants to say, if something goes wrong, I want to be able to tell people that I did the right product, I did the right thing. I performed the task and a lot of our products connect with the central system in a factory recording and documenting that the torque -- the fasteners are applied correctly and that's helping drive it. So, the combination of the idea of being accurate in the moment and being able to do it with accuracy and ease on the line. And secondly, the document is helping torque go upwards. And that business grew both in profits and sales in the quarter. We like it. And as you know, we've been investing and doing it. We've been making quite a few investments, I mean, acquisitions and in expanding that business, we like that as a business going forward and it's essential in critical industries in a lot of different places.\nGary Prestopino: Okay. Thank you.\nNick Pinchuk: Sure.\nOperator: The next question is from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.\nDavid MacGregor: Yes, sir. Good morning everyone.\nNick Pinchuk: David, thank you.\nDavid MacGregor: Hey, good morning. I wonder if we could just -- a couple of just questions for the model. SFC order growth, I mean, you indicated last year in the third quarter, you saw mid-single-digit growth. Can you just give us some sense of what that order growth or decline might have looked like this year? And just how -- also with respect to the--\nNick Pinchuk: Go ahead, sorry.\nDavid MacGregor: So, it was flat year-over-year or it was up mid-single-digits?\nNick Pinchuk: It was flat year-over-year. So, it's about the same as -- so in other words, we thought last year was a pretty good one. The problem coming out of the SFC, people slammed into the wall of uncertainty that they saw, say, sometime in like now, and they started to back away from their orders. Remember, the SFC ain't sales, it's orders. And so of course, getting a lot of orders or better than a poking eye with a sharp stick. But -- so we felt pretty good. Now, this year, we don't think there's any surprises on the horizon and people still order about the same amount. So--\nDavid MacGregor: And Nick, when you think about the fulfillment on those orders from SFC this year and sort of the cadence or the timing of those orders, will there be anything different in terms of the pattern as they fall across 3Q and 4Q than last year?\nNick Pinchuk: The difference -- the little difference is this is that we didn't push it out quite as far and so it's a little shorter period. And we've planned some reinforcing promotions in between just have belts and suspenders on this kind of thing. So, we'll see how that plays out. That's the -- in terms of tools talk, that's what we're doing. But in general, differences, David, it's all -- okay, we got the same amount of orders as last year. If people don't see the same alarming uncertainty arising in front of them theoretically, it should go better. If they -- but on the other hand, you never know until you know in that situation.\nDavid MacGregor: So, I just want to clarify, you got about the same number of orders as you did last year, but you shipped a little more in 3Q versus 4Q this year than you would have last year is what you're saying?\nNick Pinchuk: No, I'm not saying that. Yes, I am saying that. But in other words, when I say the same, I mean about the same amount of orders adjusted for the time that we sold these things. So, you're saying, okay, maybe last year, we sold in a couple of weeks -- had orders out in a couple of weeks in January. This year, we didn't have that. So, when I say the same, I'm kind of rating it out over the shorter period, and that's the same.\nDavid MacGregor: Okay. And then a question for Aldo, on the Snap-on Tools gross profits up 100 basis points, you called out in your slide deck, price/cost and raw materials and RCI. You didn't mention the category mix with the stronger hand tools versus, say, diagnostics. Is that just an oversight? Or is there something that we should read into the way you've--?\nAldo Pagliari: Anything to read into it. I think that the product line -- the efficiency across the board is better. Broadly speaking, the cost of steel is down, particularly in some of the cold-rolled sheet steel that we use in the Algona factory. But that's one of the key contributors. And they just are a little bit more efficient with some of the new factory arrangements. Some of that investment has resulted in slightly better efficiencies. So they're just a little bit better at delivering the demand that was in front of them. And the product mix as Nick mentioned. Yes, hand tools gives you a little bit of favorability, but they were -- it was across the board.\nDavid MacGregor: Okay. It sounds like maybe that category mix is not quite as bigger contributor this quarter as it has been in previous quarters. Is that your assessment?\nNick Pinchuk: I wouldn't necessarily say that. I don't know where you get that idea. I mean the point is that there's three pieces of this, as Aldo just said. It's the category mix, the product mix. There is -- there was -- as I said, there's efficiencies in the factory that are in there, RCI in the factory and there's some material costs. So, there are three things pushing. You're talking about the 100 basis point improvement, right? Yes, there are three things. What I was talking about in terms of profitability is an indication of the effect of the pivot. So, that helped our sales.\nDavid MacGregor: Next question for me, just on fourth quarter, the Snap-on Tools segment again, you've got an easier compare on a year-over-year basis. You talked about the third quarter truck restock going on. I just -- how are you thinking about the growth puts and takes for 4Q in Snap-on Tools?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, look, that's a tough call. Look, we don't give guidance. There are a lot of variables going forward, but I like our chances. I'll say, it looks -- if you're talking about the Snap-on Tools Group, the Tools Group seems to have momentum. So, if you were me and you were sitting here and saying, look, I'm confronted with uncertainty, people want to go to lower payback items. I've seen our ability to cater to that, to meet that, to match that requirement. I've seen the factories come on stream. I've seen us launch new products that are compelling and strong. So, I like where we're going on this. I believe we're going forward with momentum. I can't predict the slope of the curve.\nDavid MacGregor: Right. Okay. Last question for me. I wonder if you could just update us on franchisee attrition trends, can you just talk about what the typical experience is with growth performance when that route comes back to the operator--?\nNick Pinchuk: It's been about the same. It's been about the same for some time. It moves tenth of a point from quarter-to-quarter. And the fill rate varies depending on, well, can you find people, how are you -- we don't like to lower our standards. And if people leave in a certain area, do we have people in that area, we can easily find. And that's what drives the variation from quarter-to-quarter. I think that's good. One of the good things in the quarter was we saw the number of assistant as a percent of franchisees grow some. So, I like that structural point of view. It grew maybe a number of basis points, so upwards. The percentage seems to be moving upward in this era. So, I view that as kind of a sub-rows of favorable event that when we get orders uncertainty, that's going to accrue to our benefit.\nDavid MacGregor: Right. And the repurchase of inventory from exiting franchisees, did that impact the growth number this quarter?\nNick Pinchuk: There were some of that, but I wouldn't have called it a significant change year-over-year or quarter-to-quarter. There's some of it. But I -- we don't really -- we haven't seen it to be something that I would report to the world and say, that's a significant thing. you ought to consider it. It hasn't changed that much. It can change from time-to-time, but not this quarter, wasn't a big.\nDavid MacGregor: Okay. Thanks Nick. Appreciate it.\nNick Pinchuk: Sure.\nOperator: The next question is from Luke Junk with Baird. Please go ahead.\nLuke Junk: Good morning Nick. Thanks for taking my question. Hey Aldo. Good to catch up with you too. First one for me is on the Tools Group, 3Q up versus 2Q, a great outcome. Obviously, most years, it's the opposite, as you noted. I want to focus on the execution side. Clearly, the focus on quicker payback items is the same. But just the enabling activities, what do you think were the bigger contributors? Is it the capacity expansions helping incrementally, Milwaukee especially? Can you tie it back to getting the mix of promotions right? Is there something we should be looking at the tool carts? Is it all of the above, Nick? Anything you spike out?\nNick Pinchuk: It's probably some of all of that. But look, I think the thing is that we -- it's a combination of product development, to pivoting to producing some of the more popular products in the midst of a factory expansion, no easy exercise for a plant manager. And those two things kind of came together with, as Aldo said, a range of things. We had RCI up and down the corporate, both from a design point of view. So, we designed new products. In some cases, it allowed us to take advantage of material cost reductions. And so a lot of that all came together in this situation, driving the gross margin profitability 100 basis points. If you're talking about making the pivot in the sales, you're talking about pretty much getting closer to those quicker payback items and making them work and the factory being able to deliver better because we expanded the capacity. Remember, we entered this whole thing up to our eyeballs in orders, and we couldn't deliver. So, we expanded the capacity, and that's all sort of normalizing out. And the factories are able to get more in sync with the new products coming out, we're able to deliver better, and that's working.\nLuke Junk: Got it. And then second, if you could just double-click on what you're seeing within diagnostics, specifically, we can see the number, obviously, in RS&I, but I'm wondering about Tools Group as well. RS&I flipped from down mid-single-digit last quarter to now up low single-digit. APOLLO+ is out there right now as a newer product, is that what we're seeing the RS&I number incrementally? Does Tools Group benefit from that as well, Nick?\nNick Pinchuk: Tools Group does benefit. In other words, one of the good things in the quarter is year-over-year diagnostics were relatively stronger, mainly on the launch of this APOLLO+. I'm not saying they were incandescent, but they were pretty good in this quarter. And it was kind of artificially pushed with APOLLO+, but the APOLLO+ seemed to launch pretty well. It's early days because it's just introduced at the SFC. People got to see the guys on the floor, plugging into cars, showing how our databases can be wield and it's better, gives them great advantage. So, they went to the field enthusiastic about that. So, the sale was up substantially year-over-year and the activations are up nicely in the quarter. So, at least the launch looked pretty good. You got to see how it plays out and how much legs it has. But we -- what we like about it is it's the most cost-effective way to get intelligent diagnostics. And we think that tagline has some appeal -- has considerable appeal in the marketplace. So, that works pretty well. The big -- the other thing though that I think can get lost is in a number of different ways inside the Tools Group, which bleeds into both groups in RS&I and C&I -- I mean, and Tools Group is the rise of software. Subscriptions are up substantially. The titles are down, but in general, software growth is up nicely. And I don't have to tell you that, that's a nice profitability across the corporation. So, that's another factor going on in the Tools Group.\nLuke Junk: Got it. Appreciate the color Nick. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nBret Jordan: Hey, good morning guys.\nNick Pinchuk: Morning.\nBret Jordan: Hey in the Tools Group, I mean, you talked about improving momentum. Is that mix in the sense that the low value or the quick payback product is gaining share? Or are you seeing sort of a sentiment change at the shop level? Because it still seems like traffic is pretty sluggish from talking to parts distributors and the collision industry is still down, is it mix? Or is the mechanic sentiment improving?\nNick Pinchuk: Mechanic sentiment is not improving. The garages though -- I don't know who you're talking to, but the garages seem to be filled. The purchase of capital type equipment in the garages like collision is down, and that's -- it's kind of off the bubble a little bit, and that's seen in our equipment group. But the sentiment of the technician, remember, we're dealing with the tech in terms of Tools Group. You're not seeing that change very much. What you're seeing, though, is the Tools Group pivoting its emphasis to try to present to people attractive and buy now ideas that they don't have to finance for three years. They can just deal within 15 weeks. And so that's what we always said would work, and it has been working. So, that's what you see the comeback. And for us, I don't know if you caught the whole conversation, but for us, one of the real indicators of momentum, at least improvement and the traction that you're seeing in that pivot is the idea that the third quarter is up over the second quarter. We have seen that. And so that has to say there's some momentum in this situation. But it doesn't have to do with the attitudes getting better.\nBret Jordan: Yes. The guys who sell parts to the garages to say it's pretty sluggish. I guess, although, on the corporate expense modeling, I mean, could you help us a little bit with 2025, just given the variation in that, is there -- is running Q3 to Q4 sort of flat? Is that a rate we should continue into next year?\nAldo Pagliari: I'd say a little bit of hope here in my voice is that one of the reasons that we're lower this year is lower performance-based compensation expense. So, as we reset our plan objectives for 2025, usually you start the year assuming you're going to hit the target. So that means if that were the case, I'd more model 27-ish per quarter, something in that range. That's just how I would think about that, Bret. But this year, we're not growing as fast as we had expected coming into the year and therefore, that's one of the key reasons why there's performance-based compensation differences.\nBret Jordan: Okay. Another quick question. I guess, election outcome is one better for you than another. If we're going to tariff imported everything, does that make the Tools business less competitive? Or how do you think about that?\nNick Pinchuk: Who knows? You know what I mean, these guys -- look -- okay, you hear so many different things. We're not going to tax tips. We're not going to tax overtime. We're going to control prices. We're going to ding the supermarkets. We're going to tax unrealized capital gains. We're going to tariff the world. Welcome to the Mad Hatter's Tea Party. Nobody knows what actually is going to happen. So, you can't even make a pronouncement. Each of these could be -- we want to raise corporate tax. Each of these could be attenuating or not. It really depends on the details. I don't think you can discern anything from what these guys have been saying. Of course, if they care of everything in the world, that's probably -- it will take some adjustment for that. It will take some adjustment for sure. But maybe it helps people who sell in the markets where they produce. Sometimes that can happen over time. But boy, I tell you what, that's a torturous set of assumptions you have to make to come to any conclusion about which person would be best or would help us or hurt us.\nBret Jordan: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Carolina Jolly with Gabelli. Please go ahead.\nCarolina Jolly: Hi, thank you for taking my question. So, it sounds like within RS&I, software, and diagnostics, the higher-margin business is doing well. But can you remind me what's kind of happening in terms of the hardware in that business?\nNick Pinchuk: Say that again, please. I lost the last. You can remind me what -- remind you of what--?\nCarolina Jolly: What's kind of happening in the hardware part of the business, the areas that might be a little more sluggish?\nNick Pinchuk: I mean -- well, look, I don't know. equipment was going gangbusters for a long time. That's under car equipment. It's like aligners and collision equipment and lifts and those kinds of things. And some of those product categories are up. Lifts happen to be up a little bit. But in general, these are capital-light expansions -- capital-light expansions in a garage. They're fairly big ticket items, and they're sold through direct and through distributors to the actual repair shop owner and manager. And what we're seeing here is a little back off an attitude. Some of it can be associated with the macro environment. Some of it could be saying, hey, I don't know, do I want to install something now and finance it at this level when the Fed is going to keep dropping interest rates by 50-point increments and maybe I'll wait a little while. So, our reports are a little bit like that, that people are saying, I need to put new stuff in because the complexity of the new vehicles need changes to manage it, just I want to wait a little bit. Now, on top of that, you would say that CDK's disruption and some of our people do say this, CDK's disruption in the quarter turned dealerships, I think they were at 40% of the dealerships turn dealership attention away from saying adding a lift or an aligner to just trying to stay at their head above water while they didn't have a computer system. So, some of that probably was in the quarter. It's hard to really document that and I don't know how much it was, but that was certainly -- that wasn't a favorable event for us that happened in the quarter. I'm trying to hang the reduction on that, but that piled on top of the uncertainty. So, that's what's happening. And we would think though that we kind of think this is shorter term than, say, the technicians' worries, a little bit more solvable. It probably gets solvable by maybe somewhat by the election and maybe somewhat by interest rates being more definitive. And the technicians, you're more talking about broad bad news for breakfast, things like, okay, two wars, the border is lousy. Everything seems to be crashing down. I'm saying we don't know what's going to happen in 15 weeks -- after 15 weeks, a little bit different.\nCarolina Jolly: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Sara Verbsky for any closing remarks.\nSara Verbsky: Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Nick Pinchuk",
            "content": "Thanks Sara. Good morning everyone. As usual, I'll start with the highlights of our third quarter. I'll provide my perspectives on the results, on our markets, and on our path ahead. After that, Aldo will give you a detailed review of the financials. My perspective, I am encouraged and we believe our third quarter was encouraging, another period of broad profitability growth and significant forward progress, product and process success, and clear traction in our Tools Group pivot to quick paybacks. Of course, the quarter again had its challenges, ongoing macro pressures creating obstacles of uncertainty, just like we've encountered before. But in the end, we adjusted, withstood the turbulence, took advantage of the opportunities, and drove another strong earnings performance. And all of that is written clearly across the results. Here they are. Third quarter sales of $1,147 million were slightly down from the $1,159.3 million recorded last year. On an organic basis, excluding $200,000 in unfavorable foreign currency translation and $7.2 million from acquisitions, our organic sales were lower by 1.7%. But the OpCo operating income was up, and the OI margin was 22%, up 80 basis points, setting a new benchmark for our third quarters. For financial services, the OI grew to $71.7 million, that's up from the $69.4 million of 2023, a number that when combined with our OpCo result, raised our consolidated OI margin to 26%, up 90 basis points from last year's 25.1%. And EPS, it was $4.70, a nice gain from last year's $4.51. So, those are the overall results, marked by operating capability, structural balance, and consistent resilience prevailing against significant headwinds. Now, let's take a view of the market. During the third quarter, automotive repair remained robust. It continued to expand in complexity. New models entered the market, unveiling a rollout of new drivetrains, motor configurations, and high-tech electrical systems that control a neural network of sensors woven together that enable driver-assisted vehicle autonomy, all of it housed in modern chassis, fashioned out of space age materials. And this cavocated [ph] sophisticated advancements combined with an aging car park, now averages 12.6 years to make fixing vehicles even more challenging if you're from Snap-on. This is music to your ears and the hits just keep on coming, creating opportunities for years to come. Let's talk about organizations. The OEM, the dealerships, the independent garages, the segment that primarily focuses on infrastructure-type investments, recovering things like renovating bays and upgrading repair equipment, meeting the challenges of new vehicle models and expanding shop capacities to match the rise in repair work, driven by the ongoing increase in vehicle complexity. New lifts to support the extra weight of battery systems, sophisticated undercar equipment to calibrate the driver assist systems that enable vehicle automation and more powerful software suites for managing parts rooms, service space, and customer interfaces, enhanced vehicle communication devices to interact with the more complex designs and more powerful repair information databases to read, to diagnose, and to fix the vehicles of the now and of the future. Our repair information group or RS&I thrives in this world of complexity, serving repair shop owners and managers, delivering solutions that make the full repair path much easier, paving the way forward with innovative dealership management systems, proprietary one-of-a-kind intelligent diagnostics platforms, and the full array of capable shop equipment. Now, the opportunities for the garages is strong, but uncertain interest rates, rumors of tax changes, and worries over the elections are all weighing on investment decisions, creating a mixed landscape across the market, but the overall outlook still remains quite positive. And we believe that Snap-on and RS&I are poised to participate fully in the abundant opportunities. Now, let's shift to the technician market. These are the folks who decipher the data, touch the screen, diagnose the problems, twirl the wrenches and wheel their extraordinary skills to execute the repair. It's where our van network applies its trade. In that regard, the third quarter is always a great time for me because it's when we hold our annual Snap-on Franchisee Conference, or SFC. It's a gathering of men and women who drive the vans and call on hundreds of thousands of techs every week. It's an unmatched connection to the world of vehicle repair. Again, this year, I had extended conversations with dozens and dozens of our franchisees and each encounter resonated with enthusiasm. We say Snap-on prevails in turbulence and proceeds with confidence and the franchisees know it's true. Now, with that said, the macro environment is still weighing on our technician customers with considerable uncertainty, driven by the election and its perceived impact, the fears of ongoing inflation by border pressure and by the specter of prolonged wars. The shops are full, yech wages are up, the hours are expanding, and the demand for tech continues. They have cash, but they're still confidence poor. The bad news they get every day for breakfast is weighing on them. Right now, they're hesitant on the future and as such, they're reluctant on big ticket items with longer paybacks. So, to accommodate, the Tools Group continues to pivot, focusing on shorter payback items to match the technicians' current preferences. And the third quarter results confirm that it's working. So, we believe the automotive repair market is robust. Current uncertainty notwithstanding, it's a great place to operate. Now, let's turn to the critical industries, where the penalty for failure is high, this is where our commercial and industrial group or C&I makes its living. It's challenging, rugged environments like oil and gas platforms, mining sites, and battlefields, but it also includes sensitive and sophisticated atmospheres needed to manufacture computer chips to build airplanes and to launch rockets. The customers in this segment are organizations big and small, and they're more influenced by the data than the text, interest rates, GDP, and industry demands. And as such, these segments are pretty positive. And we see it in the results, growth in aviation, in defense, in general industries, and sectors that need our precision torque device to execute and document accuracy and the areas enabled by our custom kits, packages that meet the specific needs of the tasks that improve quality, productivity, and safety. In other words, solutions that are right up our alley. This is also the segment where our largest international presence is. And consequently, it's the segment with the headwinds of geopolitical turbulence. In that regard, Europe continues to vary region-by-region. The South remains positive, but several countries, particularly in the North, are dealing with difficulty in some cases, technical recessions. And in Asia, it's also mixed. China is still recovering from the pandemic and the effects of the extended lockdowns. At the same time, Korea and Japan are resilient. So, there are geographic challenges in the critical industries. But overall, this market is positive. The potential is considerable, and we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on these possibilities. Well, those are the markets. Now, let's -- those are the markets -- in summary, automotive repair is mixed in the now, but broad potential for the future. And the critical industries are still robust and rich with opportunities. Now, let's talk about the operating groups. In C&I, sales of $365.7 million compared to $366.4 million registered last year. Sales excluding $7.3 million of acquisition-related volume -- excluding the $7.2 million of acquisition-related volume, the organic sales were down by 2.1%. From an earnings perspective, however, C&I OI of $61 million improved by $2.9 million or 5% over last year, and the OI margin was 16.7%, up 80 basis points, expanding to -- equaling the record high established in the last quarter. The major contributor was our industrial division, continuing its upward trajectory and strong profitability, wielding the capacity provided by its new kitting center in Kenosha and meeting the rising demand for customized solutions along the way. In addition to our investments in the kitting center, our acquisition of Mountz last year is rolling into its 12th month, and it's been a valuable contributor in meeting the needs of our customers for small precision torque. Torque continues to be -- to rise in significance with critical industry customers. And to meet this need, we packaged our existing medium and heavy-duty torque products with Mountz's lighter offerings, giving us a wide spectrum of clamping forces -- the wide spectrum of clamping forces that are essential to the critical industry from oil and gas to the aviation to defense. We're capitalizing on that opportunity and the quarter showed it. Our specialty torque business rose significantly both in volume and in profitability. We also continued adding to our portfolio of professional cordless tools, engineered products, aligned with the work performed and the expectations of techs doing repairs. For the serious people of work, new products can add great value and our quarter was marked by that effect. For working on large equipment and over-the-road trucks, we unveiled a CT9175 3.75-inch 18-volt impact, not for the faint of heart. This unit delivers 1,550 foot-pounds of bolt breakaway torque. It's ideal for the most challenging jobs. The rugged lightweight housing shakes off harsh environments. The ergonomic design reduces stress and fatigue, pretty important when you're wielding 1,550 foot-pounds. And this 9175 monster has a great feature set to boot like LED spotlights, multiple power settings, and a variable speed trigger to just apply the right torque to the job. It's a great tool. Just what you'd expect from Snap-on, powerful application, easy to use and very efficient. It's a tool that techs increasingly want in their arsenal when they're fighting the toughest jobs. The 9175, it's a great productivity enhancer and the technicians have noticed. One last thought about the results. C&I kept investing in the quarter, maintaining and expanding our advantage in product, brands, and in people. Operating expenses were 140 basis points of sales higher than last year. But with the benefits of rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, the value of new -- and the value of new products, gross margins rose by 220 basis points and the OI margin, despite the spending, was up 80 basis points, higher spending and higher profits without additional scale. That's C&I, innovative products, custom solutions, precision instruments, all combined to reach customers in critical industries and extend the Snap-on brand out of the garage with momentum and profitability. Now, for the Tools Group. Sales in the third quarter of $500.5 million included an organic decrease of 3.1% with a U.S. decrease that was not much different. The OI margin in the period was 21.6%, down 40 basis points from last year due to the lower volume. With that said, gross margins remained strong, improving 100 basis points, driven by new products, RCI, and manufacturing efficiencies. That was quite a feat actually. And during the period, our team maintained its focus on product development, designing solutions that make work easier and provide customers with quick paybacks. And that pivot is taking hold, closing the deficit both overall in the U.S. to less than half it was in the second quarter. And that trend was reinforced in the period by sales being $18.5 million higher than the second quarter. With summer vacation and SFC breaks, we haven't seen the Tools Group up sequentially in the third quarter for some time. We believe it's a sign of considerable momentum. The Tools Group is coming back. Beyond the numbers, we held our annual SFC in August this year in Orlando with attendance reaching 9,000 franchisees, guests, and Snap-on associates. This tool show spanned over three football fields showcasing the latest in product innovation, more than 4,500 SKUs strong. The weekend also was packed with training sessions, purposely designed to grow each fan's business and expand the franchisees' already substantial product knowledge. Among those seminars was an in-depth review of our intelligent diagnostic portfolio with instructors connected directly to the vehicles, communicating with the cars in real-time and clearly demonstrating our industry-leading advantage. It attracted a lot of attention. And we celebrated Saturday night by transporting the entire crew in what could be described as an armada of buses to SeaWorld for a night of roller coasters, aquatic shows, and a lot of fun. It was another memorable event, but principally, it serves as a testament to the unique bond that our franchisees hold with the Snap-on team. I believe anyone attending would affirm that the franchisees left reassured on the power of our operation, enthusiastic about their way forward with our enterprise and convinced that Snap-on really does prevail in difficulty and proceed with confidence. The product booths at this year's event were pretty busy. We're busy, especially near the Cartway to Heaven. It was an eye-catching and colorful wall of mobile tool carts. The model that stole the show was our brand-new KRSC 2460 flip-top roll cart, a unit that offers Snap-on tool storage in a quick payback form, just what techs want in today's world. That's why it was so popular. The 2460 can hold a significant breadth of sockets, wrenches, and power tools in a variety of drawers that range from 2-inch to 3-inch to 5-inch configurations. And the ultra-deep top compartment is designed with five AC outlets and two USB ports to ensure that electrical devices are charged and at-the-ready for any use at any time. The launch was a significant success, and it provides even more testimony that the Tools Group traction to pivoting -- and pivoting to shorter payback items is working. Also on the shop floor were products highlighting Snap-on's customer connection. We stand next to mechanics, observing work, experiencing the complexity of vehicle repair, and we use those insights gained and design innovations that make work easier. One such custom solution available at the SFC was our new S8400 half-inch drive axle spindle nut socket. That's a mouthful. It's manufactured right here in the U.S.A., our Elkmont, Alabama plant. Since 2022, GM 3500 heavy-duty pickups have used a unique fastener that's very deep into the axle -- inside the axle hub. It's a very difficult and time-consuming operation to extract it with standard tooling. So, our new specially designed socket reaches in, links precisely with the embedded fastener, and it makes the removal or installation safe, quick, and effortless. Each vehicle is unique and a range of different repairs are needed as they age. This is the motherload for a toolmaker and Snap-on customer connection positions our team to have just the device to match the task. It's a great advantage that was on display at the SFC and it was on display in our third quarter results. The Tools Group, pivoting to quick paybacks, launching differentiating new products, and summoning resilience against the headwinds. Now, for RS&I. Sales of $422.7 million in the third quarter represented an organic decline of 1.9%. Lower sales in undercar equipment and reduced activity with OEM dealerships were partially offset by higher sales in diagnostics and information products to independent shops -- for independent shops. In effect, declines in hardware, balanced by gains in software. OI for RS&I was $107.3 million, up 2.3% compared to last year, despite the lower sales and the OI margin of 25.4%, one of the group's highest for some time, was up 110 basis points from 2023. All of it was authored by big product and RCI-driven gains in gross -- RCI-driven gains in gross margins, partially offset by spending in operating expenses. Gross margin is up, operating expense is balancing some of it, but it was all the investment was there to maintain and extend our advantages and so we did. During the quarter, RS&I launched its latest addition to our intelligent diagnostic lineup, the APOLLO+. This is a new ergonomically designed handheld that offers a 2-second boot up, the fastest in the industry and a large 10-inch touchscreen for improved visibility and navigation. Most importantly, the platform is powered by our proprietary intelligent diagnostic software with almost 3 billion data records and over 400 billion unique diagnostic events, all organized to help technicians diagnose and fix vehicles much faster. It was introduced in mid-August, toward the end of the quarter, and it represents a tech's most economical way to wield the power of intelligent diagnostics. And it already has the customers' attention. Our on the Street feedback says the new sophisticated platform with a quick payback is a real hit and we believe it has a great future. We're encouraged by the strength of our handheld diagnostics and the other unique solutions we provide and that confidence is reinforced by outside experts. Our SOLUS handheld was eligible for the 2024 awards and it was cited by Motor Magazine as one of the top of the 2024 Top 20 Tools. And it was also recognized by Power Tools and Equipment News, or P10, for one of its -- as one of the 2024 People's Choice Awards, that's a distinction based on the endorsements from real technicians, actual users from all across the nation. RS&I also received P10 recognitions for its Collision Repair package. It's on-truck brake-wave, it's heavy-duty diagnostic software and its M1, Mitchell 1 Shop Management System. Collectively this year, across all our operations, Snap-on won 20 such awards. Product is a Snap-on advantage, and everybody knows it. We're confident in the strength of RS&I and we'll keep driving to expand its position with repair shop owners and managers, making work easier, the base more productive, and providing the garages with the means to match the ever-growing challenges of modern vehicle repair. Well, those are the third quarter results. Tools Group, demonstrating improvement sequentially, pivoting effectively to meet customer preferences. C&I and RS&I, innovative new products and operating efficiencies, managing the headwinds, producing benchmark OI margins. And for the overall corporation, sales organically down 1.7%, but OpCo OI, up 2.9%. Opco OI margin of 22%, up 80 basis points; and EPS, $4.70, up 4.2%, rising over every comparison, all achieved against the wins. It was another encouraging quarter. Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Good morning Chris. The sell-through, as you know, hasn't been -- the sales off the van for some time have been a little bit more than our sales to the van. In this particular quarter, it was slightly reversed in that situation. The sales to the van were a little bit better. But the third quarter is kind of a hard one to predict. I always call it squirrely in that situation. So, we -- if it wasn't for the third quarter, I think this is much more definitive, but it's clear that the Tools Group is doing better, certainly did better in the third quarter. And we have not seen a third quarter over the second quarter in a dog's age, except for the one in the COVID where we had -- we came out in a V-shaped recovery in the third quarter. But you can look back for a long time and you don't see that. And this is the total group, and it's the U.S. in general and so we view it as some momentum. The question is, I suppose, will they be able to continue that momentum? We think they can. We like their products, and we like the fact that doing this has come out of their profitability up 100 basis points. They got a little bit of volume impact, but the 100 basis points of gross margin wielded by great new products and the manufacturing efficiencies in some ways that come out of the new expansions that are more productive than the old across the major plants in the United States. So, we think things are moving positively. But we don't give guidance, but I like our chances going forward for the tools. Well, I'd say -- look, I think the thing as I stated that the -- I said in my -- very simple, hardware down, software up. So, the hardware piece is the equipment piece, and that was -- there was some attenuation of that. Some of that can be seasonal. I don't know, I wouldn't hang my hat on that, but there is a little bit of headwind in the third quarter. vacations that happened in the garages and so on and stuff like that. But I think there is some uncertainty in the garages that may weigh on that, and we'll see how that plays out going forward. Look, I think the other piece of it is the OEM lumpy business, which kind of hit a flat spot in this quarter, but we don't think that's going to be continuing every quarter. It's just that it's lumpy, and we happen to catch a lump, a downward lump, depression in this quarter. But the real good thing is if you look at the software businesses, you look at the diagnostics business, the Mitchell, those business, the diagnostics information, which is Mitchell and diagnostic itself to repair shop owners and managers up and those things are profitable. And then you have the sales of electronic parts catalogs, another software piece up. And if you look at the software in the Tools Group associated with diagnostics, yes, it's -- we're increasing -- we're following hardware launches, but increasing the software looks pretty strong. And if you look at the software in the diagnostic -- just in the Tools business, that's a pretty good piece of business that's up year-over-year, and that helped drive some of the profitability in the Tools Group. So, I feel pretty good about RS&I. I'm not so worried about it. I think -- and by the way, if you could trade off the software businesses at high margins for a little bit of turbulence in the hardware business, wouldn't you do it? I would. A lot of it was. Hand tools. Hand tools were the strongest category in this quarter. And it was a bigger -- why we -- why you can see the pivot is when you look at it all, I don't like parsing those numbers. It'd be a little bit squirrely from quarter-to-quarter. But really, hand tools represented a major mix of Tools Group sales to the franchisees in this quarter than for -- all the way back to the pandemic. And so that is helping drive this. That is the real testimony to the pivot because that is what we wanted to have happened because this is what customers are ready to buy, and that helped a lot of that situation. Plus it helps the margins. Well, I think yes and there are also promotions overlay -- look, we had 4,500 -- there's a little thing, 4,500 products, I think SKUs displayed in our Tool Show at the SFC and over 500 were new in some way. Now, I'm not saying they were all breakthrough products. But there were 500 of the 4,500 franchisees could say, I'm offering our customers something they couldn't quite have before. And so that qualifies as something new, and it gives you something to sell and that helped push some of this. And a lot of that was in that area. Although promotion can also make hand tools look good if you strike the right cord. You give away for example, buy a set of hand tools, you get a dinner with Aldo Pagliari, for example. This will sell a lot of things. I can answer that in asking you a question. Can you say the word Boeing? I think this is -- it's a little bit like, but this is kind of an example. I think people are becoming more and more aware that the mechanisms throughout critical industries are more and more complex and therefore, precision has to be greater than may have been applied in the past. So, one, you need more precise tools and torque wrenches are an element of that or a deliverer of that. And the more accurate they are, the wider range they are, the better you're able to do that in your operations. That's number one. And then the second one, Gary, is everybody wants to say, if something goes wrong, I want to be able to tell people that I did the right product, I did the right thing. I performed the task and a lot of our products connect with the central system in a factory recording and documenting that the torque -- the fasteners are applied correctly and that's helping drive it. So, the combination of the idea of being accurate in the moment and being able to do it with accuracy and ease on the line. And secondly, the document is helping torque go upwards. And that business grew both in profits and sales in the quarter. We like it. And as you know, we've been investing and doing it. We've been making quite a few investments, I mean, acquisitions and in expanding that business, we like that as a business going forward and it's essential in critical industries in a lot of different places. Sure. David, thank you. Go ahead, sorry. It was flat year-over-year. So, it's about the same as -- so in other words, we thought last year was a pretty good one. The problem coming out of the SFC, people slammed into the wall of uncertainty that they saw, say, sometime in like now, and they started to back away from their orders. Remember, the SFC ain't sales, it's orders. And so of course, getting a lot of orders or better than a poking eye with a sharp stick. But -- so we felt pretty good. Now, this year, we don't think there's any surprises on the horizon and people still order about the same amount. So-- The difference -- the little difference is this is that we didn't push it out quite as far and so it's a little shorter period. And we've planned some reinforcing promotions in between just have belts and suspenders on this kind of thing. So, we'll see how that plays out. That's the -- in terms of tools talk, that's what we're doing. But in general, differences, David, it's all -- okay, we got the same amount of orders as last year. If people don't see the same alarming uncertainty arising in front of them theoretically, it should go better. If they -- but on the other hand, you never know until you know in that situation. No, I'm not saying that. Yes, I am saying that. But in other words, when I say the same, I mean about the same amount of orders adjusted for the time that we sold these things. So, you're saying, okay, maybe last year, we sold in a couple of weeks -- had orders out in a couple of weeks in January. This year, we didn't have that. So, when I say the same, I'm kind of rating it out over the shorter period, and that's the same. I wouldn't necessarily say that. I don't know where you get that idea. I mean the point is that there's three pieces of this, as Aldo just said. It's the category mix, the product mix. There is -- there was -- as I said, there's efficiencies in the factory that are in there, RCI in the factory and there's some material costs. So, there are three things pushing. You're talking about the 100 basis point improvement, right? Yes, there are three things. What I was talking about in terms of profitability is an indication of the effect of the pivot. So, that helped our sales. Well, look, that's a tough call. Look, we don't give guidance. There are a lot of variables going forward, but I like our chances. I'll say, it looks -- if you're talking about the Snap-on Tools Group, the Tools Group seems to have momentum. So, if you were me and you were sitting here and saying, look, I'm confronted with uncertainty, people want to go to lower payback items. I've seen our ability to cater to that, to meet that, to match that requirement. I've seen the factories come on stream. I've seen us launch new products that are compelling and strong. So, I like where we're going on this. I believe we're going forward with momentum. I can't predict the slope of the curve. It's been about the same. It's been about the same for some time. It moves tenth of a point from quarter-to-quarter. And the fill rate varies depending on, well, can you find people, how are you -- we don't like to lower our standards. And if people leave in a certain area, do we have people in that area, we can easily find. And that's what drives the variation from quarter-to-quarter. I think that's good. One of the good things in the quarter was we saw the number of assistant as a percent of franchisees grow some. So, I like that structural point of view. It grew maybe a number of basis points, so upwards. The percentage seems to be moving upward in this era. So, I view that as kind of a sub-rows of favorable event that when we get orders uncertainty, that's going to accrue to our benefit. There were some of that, but I wouldn't have called it a significant change year-over-year or quarter-to-quarter. There's some of it. But I -- we don't really -- we haven't seen it to be something that I would report to the world and say, that's a significant thing. you ought to consider it. It hasn't changed that much. It can change from time-to-time, but not this quarter, wasn't a big. Sure. It's probably some of all of that. But look, I think the thing is that we -- it's a combination of product development, to pivoting to producing some of the more popular products in the midst of a factory expansion, no easy exercise for a plant manager. And those two things kind of came together with, as Aldo said, a range of things. We had RCI up and down the corporate, both from a design point of view. So, we designed new products. In some cases, it allowed us to take advantage of material cost reductions. And so a lot of that all came together in this situation, driving the gross margin profitability 100 basis points. If you're talking about making the pivot in the sales, you're talking about pretty much getting closer to those quicker payback items and making them work and the factory being able to deliver better because we expanded the capacity. Remember, we entered this whole thing up to our eyeballs in orders, and we couldn't deliver. So, we expanded the capacity, and that's all sort of normalizing out. And the factories are able to get more in sync with the new products coming out, we're able to deliver better, and that's working. Tools Group does benefit. In other words, one of the good things in the quarter is year-over-year diagnostics were relatively stronger, mainly on the launch of this APOLLO+. I'm not saying they were incandescent, but they were pretty good in this quarter. And it was kind of artificially pushed with APOLLO+, but the APOLLO+ seemed to launch pretty well. It's early days because it's just introduced at the SFC. People got to see the guys on the floor, plugging into cars, showing how our databases can be wield and it's better, gives them great advantage. So, they went to the field enthusiastic about that. So, the sale was up substantially year-over-year and the activations are up nicely in the quarter. So, at least the launch looked pretty good. You got to see how it plays out and how much legs it has. But we -- what we like about it is it's the most cost-effective way to get intelligent diagnostics. And we think that tagline has some appeal -- has considerable appeal in the marketplace. So, that works pretty well. The big -- the other thing though that I think can get lost is in a number of different ways inside the Tools Group, which bleeds into both groups in RS&I and C&I -- I mean, and Tools Group is the rise of software. Subscriptions are up substantially. The titles are down, but in general, software growth is up nicely. And I don't have to tell you that, that's a nice profitability across the corporation. So, that's another factor going on in the Tools Group. Morning. Mechanic sentiment is not improving. The garages though -- I don't know who you're talking to, but the garages seem to be filled. The purchase of capital type equipment in the garages like collision is down, and that's -- it's kind of off the bubble a little bit, and that's seen in our equipment group. But the sentiment of the technician, remember, we're dealing with the tech in terms of Tools Group. You're not seeing that change very much. What you're seeing, though, is the Tools Group pivoting its emphasis to try to present to people attractive and buy now ideas that they don't have to finance for three years. They can just deal within 15 weeks. And so that's what we always said would work, and it has been working. So, that's what you see the comeback. And for us, I don't know if you caught the whole conversation, but for us, one of the real indicators of momentum, at least improvement and the traction that you're seeing in that pivot is the idea that the third quarter is up over the second quarter. We have seen that. And so that has to say there's some momentum in this situation. But it doesn't have to do with the attitudes getting better. Who knows? You know what I mean, these guys -- look -- okay, you hear so many different things. We're not going to tax tips. We're not going to tax overtime. We're going to control prices. We're going to ding the supermarkets. We're going to tax unrealized capital gains. We're going to tariff the world. Welcome to the Mad Hatter's Tea Party. Nobody knows what actually is going to happen. So, you can't even make a pronouncement. Each of these could be -- we want to raise corporate tax. Each of these could be attenuating or not. It really depends on the details. I don't think you can discern anything from what these guys have been saying. Of course, if they care of everything in the world, that's probably -- it will take some adjustment for that. It will take some adjustment for sure. But maybe it helps people who sell in the markets where they produce. Sometimes that can happen over time. But boy, I tell you what, that's a torturous set of assumptions you have to make to come to any conclusion about which person would be best or would help us or hurt us. Say that again, please. I lost the last. You can remind me what -- remind you of what--? I mean -- well, look, I don't know. equipment was going gangbusters for a long time. That's under car equipment. It's like aligners and collision equipment and lifts and those kinds of things. And some of those product categories are up. Lifts happen to be up a little bit. But in general, these are capital-light expansions -- capital-light expansions in a garage. They're fairly big ticket items, and they're sold through direct and through distributors to the actual repair shop owner and manager. And what we're seeing here is a little back off an attitude. Some of it can be associated with the macro environment. Some of it could be saying, hey, I don't know, do I want to install something now and finance it at this level when the Fed is going to keep dropping interest rates by 50-point increments and maybe I'll wait a little while. So, our reports are a little bit like that, that people are saying, I need to put new stuff in because the complexity of the new vehicles need changes to manage it, just I want to wait a little bit. Now, on top of that, you would say that CDK's disruption and some of our people do say this, CDK's disruption in the quarter turned dealerships, I think they were at 40% of the dealerships turn dealership attention away from saying adding a lift or an aligner to just trying to stay at their head above water while they didn't have a computer system. So, some of that probably was in the quarter. It's hard to really document that and I don't know how much it was, but that was certainly -- that wasn't a favorable event for us that happened in the quarter. I'm trying to hang the reduction on that, but that piled on top of the uncertainty. So, that's what's happening. And we would think though that we kind of think this is shorter term than, say, the technicians' worries, a little bit more solvable. It probably gets solvable by maybe somewhat by the election and maybe somewhat by interest rates being more definitive. And the technicians, you're more talking about broad bad news for breakfast, things like, okay, two wars, the border is lousy. Everything seems to be crashing down. I'm saying we don't know what's going to happen in 15 weeks -- after 15 weeks, a little bit different."

            "content": "Well, thanks, Aldo. Well, that's our quarter, resilience against the turbulence. We believe the period demonstrated that with great clarity. Sales attenuated, but great products solving critical tasks, material savings, and RCI drove strong and substantial gains in gross margins, strong enough that we're able to keep investing in our product, brand, and our people, maintaining and building them for the opportunities to come, and still increase OI margins significantly. And all of that was authored by the ongoing characteristics of our -- of the Snap-on Enterprise. Businesses that are strategically positioned for advantage for establishing and maintaining ongoing connections to the customers, processes embedded in Snap-on value creation that really do deliver progress every day. And a very capable team that's committed to our enterprise, greatly experienced and battle-tested and is well able to consistently marshal advantage to drive -- for driving positive outcomes and you see that all across the corporation. C&I sales down low single-digits for profits up, OI margin, 16.7%, up 80 basis points. Gross margins up 220 basis points, gains from wielding customization in the critical industries. The Tools Group, meeting the challenges -- of the challenges of the day, executing the pivot to quick payback items, closing the sales gap and displaying momentum. Sales down low single-digits, OI margin is 21.6%, down 40 basis points, but gross margins up 100 basis points. RS&I, wielding its advantage with software, sales down low single-digits, but profits up and OI margins of 25.4%, up 110 basis points and gross margins up 190 basis points and it all came together as a corporation. Sales attenuated lower by 1.7% organically, but OI rising from last year. OI margins reaching 22%, up 80 basis points and gross margins up triple-digit basis points all across the corporation and an EPS of $4.70, up versus every -- up over every comparison. It was another encouraging quarter. And we believe that propelled by our device -- decisive advantage in our product, in our brand, and our people, all maintained and strengthened even in the turbulence, Snap-on will continue its momentum, so clearly demonstrated in the quarter and extend our trend of positive performance well on through the days and the years to come. Now, before I turn the call over to the operator, I want to speak directly to our franchisees and associates. As always, I know many of you are listening. Our quarter demonstrates that Snap-on does indeed prevail in turbulence. And once again, you are the creators of that result, hard one. For your achievements in authoring our success, you have my congratulations. For the skill, energy, and experience you bring to bear every day. On behalf of our team, you have my admiration and for your unshakable confidence in and dedication to the future of our enterprise, you have my thanks. Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator.

            "name": "Aldo Pagliari",
            "content": "Thanks Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $1,147 million in the quarter compared to $1,159.3 million last year, reflecting a 1.7% organic sales decline and $300,000 of unfavorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by $7.2 million of acquisition-related sales. Despite the ongoing uncertainties of the current environment, overall sales activity in the quarter can be characterized as stable. And while our franchise van channel revenues continue to be tempered by technician confidence, the Tools Group generated higher sales sequentially versus last quarter. Generally, the third quarter reflects lower sales dollar activity as compared to the second quarter. Consolidated gross margin improved 130 basis points to 51.2% from 49.9% last year, reflecting increased sales in higher gross margin businesses, benefits from the company's RCI initiatives and lower material and other costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales rose 50 basis points to 29.2% from 28.7% in 2023, primarily due to the lower sales volumes. Operating earnings before financial services of $252.4 million in the quarter compared to $245.2 million in 2023. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 22% represented an improvement of 80 basis points from the 21.2% reported last year. Financial services' revenues of $100.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $94.9 million last year, while operating earnings of $71.7 million compared to $69.4 million in 2023. Consolidated operating earnings of $324.1 million compared to $314.6 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin increased 90 basis points to 26% from 25.1% in 2023. Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 22.9% compared to 22.6% last year. Net earnings of $251.1 million compared to $243.1 million in 2023 and net earnings per diluted share of $4.70 in the quarter compared to $4.51 per diluted share last year, an increase of 4.2%. Now, let's turn to our segment results for the quarter, starting with C&I on Slide 7. Sales of $365.7 million compared to $366.4 million last year, reflecting a 2.1% organic sales decline, partially offset by $7.2 million of acquisition-related sales. The organic decrease is primarily due to double-digit reduction with respect to intersegment sales of power tools and a mid-single-digit decline in the segment's European-based hand tool businesses. These were partially offset by a gain in sales to customers in critical industries, including a high single-digit increase in specialty torque. With respect to critical industries, in addition to higher torque product sales, defense and aviation-related activity was strong, but it was somewhat offset by declines in the natural resources sector. Gross margin improved 220 basis points to 41.2% in the third quarter from 39% in 2023. This was largely due to the increased sales volume and higher gross margin critical industry sectors, lower material and other costs, savings from RCI initiatives, and 50 basis points of benefit from acquisitions. These improvements were partially offset by 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 140 basis points to 24.5% in the quarter from 23.1% in 2023, primarily due to investments in personnel and other costs and a 50 basis point impact from acquisitions. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $61 million compared to $58.1 million last year. The operating margin improved 80 basis points to 16.7% from 15.9% in 2023. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $500.5 million compared to $515.4 million a year ago, reflecting a 3.1% organic sales decline and $900,000 of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic decrease reflects a mid-single-digit decline in our U.S. business, partially offset by a low single-digit gain in our international operations. That being said, it is meaningful to highlight that sales in the historically lower third quarter period are higher than the $482 million recorded in the second quarter of this year, representing a sequential increase of 3.8%. We believe this as well as the more modest year-over-year sales decline in the U.S. van network in the third quarter than in previous quarters favorably demonstrates the resilience of this business. Gross margin improved 100 basis points to 47.3% in the quarter from 46.3% last year, primarily due to lower material and other costs and benefits from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 140 basis points to 25.7% in the quarter from 24.3% in 2023, largely due to the lower sales volume. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $108.3 million compared to $113.4 million last year. The operating margin of 21.6% compared to 22% in 2023. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $422.7 million compared to $431.8 million in 2023, reflecting a 1.9% organic sales decline and $900,000 of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic decrease includes a mid-single-digit decline in the sales of undercar equipment and a low single-digit reduction in activity with OEM dealerships, where we often see variability in essential tool programs from period-to-period. These decreases were partially offset by a low single-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. Gross margin improved 190 basis points to 47.4% from 45.5% last year, primarily reflecting increased sales of higher gross margin products. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 80 basis points to 22% from 21.2% in 2023, largely due to lower sales volumes and increased personnel and other costs. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $107.3 million compared to $104.9 million last year. The operating margin improved 110 basis points to 25.4% from the 24.3% reported last year. Now, turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services increased $5.5 million or 5.8% to $100.4 million from $94.9 million last year, primarily reflecting the growth of the loan portfolio. Financial services operating earnings of $71.7 million compared to $69.4 million in 2023. Financial services expenses were up $3.2 million from 2023 levels, including $2.4 million of higher provisions for credit losses. Sequentially, the provisions for credit losses were lower by $1.6 million. In the third quarters of both 2024 and 2023, the average yield on finance receivables was 17.7%. In the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, the average yield on contract receivables were 9.1% and 8.8%, respectively. Total loan originations of $288 million in the third quarter represented a decrease of $17.2 million or 5.6% from 2023 levels, reflecting a 6.7% decline in extended credit originations and a 1.3% decrease in originations of contract receivables. The decrease in extended credit originations mostly reflects lower sales of big-ticket items. Geographically, extended credit originations were consistent with the sales activity in the Tools Group with the decline in the U.S. only partially offset by growth in originations internationally. Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.5 billion of gross financing receivables with $2.2 billion from our U.S. operation. For extended credit or finance receivables, the U.S. 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.9% is up 40 basis points from the third quarter of 2023. Trailing 12-month net losses for the overall extended credit portfolio of $62.3 million represented 3.11% of outstandings at quarter end. While delinquencies and net losses are trending upward, we believe that these portfolio performance metrics remain relatively balanced considering the current environment. Now, turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $274.2 million in the quarter represented 106% of net earnings and compared to $285.4 million last year. The decrease in cash flow as compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily reflects increases in working investment, which were partially offset by higher net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $40.5 million mostly reflected net additions to finance receivables of $20.6 million and capital expenditures of $20.4 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $156.2 million included cash dividends of $97.9 million and the repurchase of 215,000 shares of common stock for $59.9 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $471.5 million of common stock under our existing authorizations, including under the $500 million authorization recently approved by the Board of Directors in August of this year. Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $5.1 million from 2023 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 61 days compared to 60 days at year-end 2023. Inventories decreased $10.1 million from 2023 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.3 remained unchanged from year-end. Our quarter end cash position of $1,313.3 million compared to $1,1.5 million at year-end 2023. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $900 million available under our credit facilities. As of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2024. For the full year, we expect that capital expenditures will be approximately $100 million and we currently anticipate that our full year 2024 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 22% to 23%. Finally, with respect to corporate costs, we would expect expenses in the upcoming fourth quarter to be more in line with those incurred in the third quarter of this year as the fourth quarter of 2023 included some benefit for the recovery of costs associated with a legal matter, which will not repeat. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? I'll remember that. Anything to read into it. I think that the product line -- the efficiency across the board is better. Broadly speaking, the cost of steel is down, particularly in some of the cold-rolled sheet steel that we use in the Algona factory. But that's one of the key contributors. And they just are a little bit more efficient with some of the new factory arrangements. Some of that investment has resulted in slightly better efficiencies. So they're just a little bit better at delivering the demand that was in front of them. And the product mix as Nick mentioned. Yes, hand tools gives you a little bit of favorability, but they were -- it was across the board. I'd say a little bit of hope here in my voice is that one of the reasons that we're lower this year is lower performance-based compensation expense. So, as we reset our plan objectives for 2025, usually you start the year assuming you're going to hit the target. So that means if that were the case, I'd more model 27-ish per quarter, something in that range. That's just how I would think about that, Bret. But this year, we're not growing as fast as we had expected coming into the year and therefore, that's one of the key reasons why there's performance-based compensation differences."

Additional information regarding these measures is included in our earnings release issued today which can be found on our website. With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?\nNick Pinchuk: Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I'll start with the highlights of our second quarter and I'll provide my perspectives on the results on our markets and our path ahead. After that, Aldo will give you a detailed review of the financials. Our second quarter -- of course, there were challenges uncertainty remain prominent among our technician customers but our Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I Group, with repair shop owners and managers and our commercial and industrial or C&I group, enabling critical tasks outside the vehicle shop. They both progressed very nicely, taking full advantage of their opportunities and balancing the tech turbulence and tools. So our results in the second quarter are clear and unmistakable demonstration that Snap-on's principal value creating mechanism, observing work right in the workplace, using the insights learned to create products that make critical tests easier and more efficient, that works across many industries and in many environments. It highlights that our enterprise is not dependent on a particular customer base. We believe, it shows that as we move forward, reaching higher we do so with greater resilience and with expanding possibilities and with an enterprise that's broader and stronger than ever before. Like most quarters, we did have headwinds, we had opportunities with disparities from group to group and geography to geography. North America remained mixed with significant gains in critical industries. Internationally, our consolidated results were varied but reflected overall positive. Europe showed some signs of recovery among the scattered economic disruptions from region to region and the Asia Pacific markets registered progress overcoming the delayed recovery in China. So now, let's talk about the results. Second quarter sales of $1179.4 million was slightly down from the $1191.3 million of last year. on an organic basis, excluding $5.7 million in unfavorable foreign currency and $7.3 million from acquisitions, our sales were lower by 1.1%. The OpCo operating income or OI margin for the full quarter was 23.8%, up 50 basis points. Now with that said, that level included the benefit of a final payment from our recent legal win, excluding that addition, the OI margin was 22.8%, down from 2023 but still among our very best to pass the only by the recent -- by the record-setting second quarter of last year. For financial services, the OI grew to $70.2 million from the $66.9 million recorded in 2023. A number that when combined with our OpCo results, raised the consolidated OI margin to 27.4%, up 60 basis points over the 26.8% of 2023 and EPS, it was $5.07 which included a benefit from the legal payment of $0.16. Again, excluding that legal item, EPS was $4.91 still above last year and representing a new Snap-on level for any quarter, strength and progress against the wind. So those are the overall numbers. Now for a view of the market. The second quarter once again highlighted that the opportunities in automotive repair, they continue to be favorable, marked by the ever-expanding complexity of design, new and diverse powertrains. More interlocking systems to advance driving autonomy, arrays of drive by wire sensors, new body materials and an aging car park now averaging 12.6 years. The opportunity in vehicle repair exists industry-wide and they appear to be unwavering. The vehicle OEMs, the dealerships and the independent shops recognizes the positive trend and they continue to invest in tools and equipment that will expand their capabilities to support the influx of new models and the ever rising complexity of repair. And in the quarter, our RS&I Group expanded our reach into OEM dealership -- into OEM dealership programs and strengthened our position in independent garages with our repair management software packages and with great new hardware products. So the possibility, with repair shop owners and managers are strong, the outlook looking forward is quite positive and Snap-on is well positioned to seize the opportunities. Now let's shift to the technicians. These are the folks who turn the wrenches to make the diagnosis and execute the repairs. Again this quarter, I had multiple occasions to meet with the franchisees, the garage owners and the tech and it reconfirmed that the shops and the technicians are prospering. The micro data says it's true, repair hours are up. Tech wages are healthy. The demand for tech is strong and the number of techs are increasing. The number of tech is increasing. It makes sense, new systems, the rising complexity, the aging car park makes what the techs do more difficult and more valuable. So the economic trajectory of vehicle repair is quite positive. It's an attractive place to be. But it's also clear that while the techs are busy and have cash, their confidence in the way forward is still poor. Every day there is bad news. Two wars with no end in sight, the border unsettled, the shipping lanes disrupted, tit-for-tat with China, lingering inflation and the election, the election seems to get more unpredictable with every morning news cycle; the hits just keep on coming for bad news for breakfast. It's almost like the grassroots technicians have a fear of what may happen. And paraphrasing the movie Dune fear is the outlook killer. The franchisees also confirmed to us that with general uncertainty, the techs are leaning toward purchases that provide quick paybacks, while making the work easier right away. They're kind of cool on longer-term bigger ticket items. And knowing that, the Tools Group continues to focus on near-term product development, manufacturing changes and selling efforts that match those preferences. So now let's talk about the critical industries, where Snap-on rolls out of the garage, solving tasks of significant consequence. This is where the C&I group operates. And it's our most significant international presence. The area where we're most subject to global headwinds but the news was still reasonably encouraging. For the sectors, the critical industries kept rising in the period, the military, aviation and education segments led the way. For geographies, Europe was mixed. Several countries in recession and the ongoing impacts of the Ukraine war. Asia Pacific will also remain mixed. China was weak, driven by delayed financial recovery and Southeast Asia, again, had its difficulties. But -- both regions for C&I and for the corporation in total, were positive in the quarter despite the variations. Now speaking more - now I'd like to speak more about the critical industries, the demand for customized solutions to drive reliability and productivity keeps rising. And C&I continues to show significant and broader advantage in that arena and we believe there's more coming. So that's the market, vehicle tech, cash-rich but confidence poor. Preferring quick payback products. Repair shop owners and managers moving upward to match the car park and the critical industry is booming outside the garage. In C&I, so let's cover the groups now. In C&I, sales were $372 million representing an organic sales gain of 1.2%, excluding $7.3 million of acquisition-related sales and $3.8 million of an unfavorable foreign currency. Higher activity with customers based in those critical industries and the gains in Asia -- and a gain in Asia that defies the turbulence more than offset declines in our power tool and European-based hand tool operations. From an earnings perspective, C&I OI of $62.2 million, improved $4.1 million or 7.1% above last year. And the OI margin, it was 16.7%, up 70 basis points representing a new record for that group; gangbusters -- gangbusters for those guys. And the big driver was our International division. Continuing its upward trajectory with a double-digit rise and very strong profitability. About 18 months ago, we expanded our capability to make [Indiscernible] easier outside the garage by adding another building for industrial custom kitting, serving a range of critical segments and it's paid off -- it's paid off big. Since then, that business has been on a tear, [Indiscernible] cranking out more and more bespoke product bundles, sophisticated solutions like our automated tool control units that have become the standard for a range of industries. Custom kit offerings aimed at specific applications and at making the critical work easier and more reliable. It's driven some nice gains all around the world. And we believe we see many more possibilities in that arena. So we continue to invest in critical industries, expanding capabilities like in our custom tool machine in Kenosha, producing low volume, high reward items, for the most essential tasks. For example, visiting an oil drilling site. We saw that adding a section of pipe on the rigs requires technicians to move around the circumference constantly repositioning the turning tool. It's a slow and clumsy and imprecise effort. Our custom team tackled the problem designing both, a new bespoke \u2013 both a new bespoke wrench -- both designing a new bespoke wrench, specifically for the task and enabled by our new Kenosha machine shop configured a special machining process to produce it and it all worked. The special oil rig pipe wrench, greatly reduced the rework associated with misalignment and substantially decreased the task time, getting the job done more efficiently and more reliably and along the way, expanding the Snap-on reputation in the critical oil and gas sector. Also in the quarter, we introduced a new line of 14.4-volt micropower drills aimed specifically at diverse applications in aviation and general manufacturing. Test in all sectors vary from inserting wood screws to drilling accurate holes in airframe, to high volumes on production lines. To span the variety, each tool in the new line, and there is a range of them, is set to a different RPM range, enabling the tech to fit the speed to the job, substantially reducing rework or irreversible damages -- damage. The drill -- it's also designed for 2 operating states, the first slower. Allowing the tools to bite into the materials, securing a position for the serious drilling and the second stage, performing that serious drilling at the predetermined RPM, making a quick and clear cut. Our new industrial micro drills, 2-stage design, matched to the task, bringing new levels with accuracy, consistency and reliability to the work, it's a superior tool for the very task of those sectors and the customers have noticed. C&I in the quarter, launching customized solutions, maintaining its strong momentum in the critical industry, extending out of the garage and reaching new heights in profitability. Now for the Tools Group. Sales in the second quarter are $482 million included an organic decrease of 7.7%. The group's OI margin in the period was 23.8%, down 250 basis points due to the lower volumes. But gross margins held down 20 basis points, almost flat. The benefits of new product, manufacturing efficiencies and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, is written all over those numbers. And during the quarter, we continue to focus our product development, redirect our plans and guide our selling programs toward innovative quick payback solutions that drive productivity. A cornerstone for the pivot is rooted in customer - in our customer connection, standing side-by-side with the technicians, observing the work, witnessing the difficulties of modern and complex repair and using the insights gained to create a tool that makes especially difficult tasks much easier. In the second quarter, those insights lead the Tool Group to design a new torque adapter for use on Ford E-Series commercial vans. The standard procedure for basic brake repair on that model, requires the rear caliper bolts to be torqued at over 160-foot pounds, not so easy. And the task made doubly difficult because the bolt is obstructed, making it impossible to access the area with standard tooling without removing auxiliary parts, a big [tie] (ph) meter. So we've specifically configured a 21-millimeter, 12.6 inch flat adapter with a half inch hex drive to make the work easier and to specification. The device nestles perfectly. Between the particular obstructions on the model, engaging the fastener, turning a time-consuming task into one of just seconds and freeing the tech up to tackle the next repair order. It's made in our Elizabethton, Tennessee plant and it brings great value to the techs working on the E-Series. And you know there's a lot of them. Another example is the still observed when we observed when removing a canister tap that houses the fuel filter on 4 Super Duty trucks. Access to the 32-millimeter hectare on top of cap is impeded by other components. Standard part or sockets are out. Seeing the problem. Our team created a special low-profile socket, tapered, gradually, just the slide into position under the blocking hoses and then using a standard ration and extension, easily removing the clamp of a tap [ph], complete the repair, a complicated [ph] -- and complete the repair, a complicated job made much easier. Produced in our Milwaukee plant, it's another quick buyback item that makes a substantial difference and the text a lot of it. A final example comes from observing technicians walking to and from the work piece; back and forth from their work to achieve standard flyers for basic test. A compact design seemed to be the solution. So we expanded our triple joint flyer line to develop a small 4.5-inch fire set with 3 models, a combination along those in a flank drive slip joint version for versatility and they were all pocket size to be always at the ready, call it out of your pocket and you're ready to go. And all designed to allow immediate access to remove low torque in place to pull through users, to adjust hoses or provide some additional gripping leverage for basic repairs or just inspections. The new units save steps and make work easier in tight spaces and they're offered in 2 handle models. A cushion grip addition to reduce hand fatigue and for the first time, our bare metal diamond plate texture that provides a superior grid even with sweaty or oily hands. Cold forge in the U.S., the new pliers a game changer. And the rollout was a huge hit, making our million-dollar hit product status just during the initial launch. Well, that's the Tools Group. Pivoting to technicians preferences, producing innovative, quick paybacks, making work easier, New tools matched to the task and guided by customer connection, bringing quick value to the text and you can see the value play out in the gross margins, bringing quick value to the tech. And you can see that play out in the gross margins, almost flat in the downturn. You can also see, I think, our unwavering support for the franchisees and the operating expense. It was about flat even in the turbulence, even in the downturn, even with the lower sales. We'll maintain our training, our programs and our efforts in the field. Even in this turbulence. You see, we believe the uncertainty will recede and we want the network to be strong and fully loaded when that occurs. Now for RS&I. Group sales of $458.8 million in the quarter, representing a $4.3 million or 1% organic increase that was partially offset by $1.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. Those gains reflected higher activity with OEM dealerships attenuated by lower sales in the diagnostics division, BOI margin, it was an even 25%, rising 60 basis points and among the group's best. The numbers reflect the strength of RS&I products and programs for repair shareholders and managers as we help them match the evolving challenges of [indiscernible] car park. Speaking of the product evolutions and our progress with OEM pores. The traditional method of lifting vehicles is becoming more complex with the onset of new hybrid and EV platforms. The batteries require changes in lift points to adjust for the different center of gravity on EVs. And to complicate the matter. Each model design presents a different problem. In response, we designed steel floor plates matched to particular models that service guides and positioning the vehicle in the exact location that puts the lift arms in the proper place for that vehicle, enabling a safe procedure and an easy lift. The OEMs and the shops, they enthusiastically seen the innovation as another a long line of the modifications needed to match the evolving car park. They need to facilitate to match that change and we're helping them do it. Another successful [indiscernible] release was the ProX1HD [ph] on vehicle break plate [ph], specifically for heavy-duty platforms like buses, fire engine and semi-truck, delayed cuts away in perfections and abrasion on a brake rotor surface -- the imperfections and abrasions on a brake\u2019s rotor surface that always arise during regular operations. The result is a fully restored component that supports optimized brake performance without the need of a replacement. The previous choice for heavy-duty break repair work was the disassemble of break assembly or and either order new parts or smooth the rotor on a stand-alone bench lay [ph]; in either case, a laborious process. The new ProCut design avoids both the time and the effort to lift the heavy components off the vehicle and it eliminates the cost of new parts. We believe it's another changer. Garage owners have seen the value and we project that the ProCut will become the industry standard. Also in RS&I, C&I, a car aligner serves the vehicle collision market serves the vehicle collision market. Serves the vehicle fusion market with a number of heavy-duty items. A good example during the quarter is the release of our low profile frame bench innovatively designed holding the workpiece at an optimal height, making it easier for technicians to interact with the damaged vehicle. The bench is rugged for heavy collision work and integrates with our existing policy solutions that stretch and can torque the chassis back in position. The ability to raise and lower the benches in multiple positions while still engaging with the vehicle reduces fatigue with the user and makes the process much easier. The collision space is quite robust. By the changing vehicles. And Carline has been on -- and as such, Carline has been on a continuing positive trajectory. And the new bench makes our advantage of that market even stronger. RS&I expanding its res which shop owners and managers, confronting the increased complexity, focusing on developing innovations that simplify the difficult and help shops prosper along the way. Well, those are the -- for along the way. Well, those -- the RS&I quarter was quite strong. Well, those are the second quarter results, Tools Group down impacted by uncertainty, pivoting to customer preference, launching new product, holding the gross margins and maintaining the network. C&I and RS&I providing the multi-sector power of customer connection and new product recording strong profitability, balancing the headwinds of technician uncertainty and the overall corporation. Launching a broad range of products from tapered sockets to industrial power tools to collision benches, sales about flat, OI margin, 23.8% -- 22.8%, excluding the legal benefits, one of our highest and EPS $5.07, $4.91 excluding the legal item setting a new high. performance achieved against the wind. It was an encouraging quarter. Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?\nAldo Pagliari: Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $1.1794 billion [ph] in the quarter compared to $1.1913 billion [ph] last year. Reflecting a 1.1% organic sales decline and $5.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by $7.3 million of acquisition-related sales. Sales activity was similar to what we experienced in the first quarter, while our franchise van channel revenues continue to be dampened by afflicted technician confidence, our sales of repair shop owners and managers, again increased year-over-year. Encouragingly, activity with customers serving the critical industries remained robust. Consolidated gross margin of 50.6% compared to 50.7% last year, reflecting the lower sales volumes largely offset by savings from the company's RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 26.8% compared to 27.4% laser. In the quarter, as noted in our press release, operating expenses included an $11.2 million benefit for the final payments received associated with the legal matter. The 60 basis point improvement in the operating expense ratio is primarily due to the benefit from the legal payments, partially offset by the effects of lower sales volumes. Operating earnings before financial services of $280.3 million in the quarter included a benefit from the lead payments compared to $277 million in 2023. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 23.8%, including a 100 basis point benefit in the legal payments compared to 23.3% last year. Financial services revenue of $100.5 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to $93.4 million last year, while operating earnings of $70.2 million compared to $66.9 million in 2023. Consolidated operating earnings of $350.5 million which includes a legal benefit compared to $343.9 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 27.4%, including the legal payments, compared to 26.8% in 2023. Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 22.6% compared to 22.9% last year. Net earnings of $271.2 million or $5.07 per diluted share, including an $8.7 million or $0.16 per diluted share after tax benefit from the legal payments compared to $264 million or $4.89 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2023. Now, let's turn to our segment results for the quarter. Starting with the C&I group on Slide 7. Sales of $372 million compared to $364.2 million last year, reflecting a 1.2% organic sales gain and $7.3 million of acquisition-related sales, partially offset by $3.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase is primarily due to a double-digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in the segment's European-based hand tools business and a double-digit reduction in the power tools operation, the latter mostly associated with lower intersegment sales. With respect to critical industries, defense-related sales are strong as it was activity in the aviation sector. Gross margin improved 220 basis points to 41.7% in the second quarter from 39.5% in 2023. This was largely due to the increased sales volumes and the higher gross margin critical industry sector, savings from RCI initiatives and 50 basis points of benefit from acquisitions. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 150 basis points to 25% in the quarter from 23.5% in 2023, primarily due to investments in personnel and other costs and a 60 basis point impact from acquisitions. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $62.2 million compared to $58.1 million last year. The operating margin of 16.7% compared to 16% in 2023 and represented a new milestone of achievement for the segment. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $482 million compared to $543.1 million a year ago reflecting a 7.7% organic sales decline and $800,000 of unfavorable foreign currency translation. And now I guess with the last quarter, the organic decrease reflects a high single-digit decline in our U.S. business, partially offset by a low single-digit gain in our international operations. Gross margin of 48.8% in the quarter declined 20 basis points from 49% last year and that's primarily due to sales -- lower sales volumes. Operating expenses as a percent of sales rose 230 basis points to 25% in the quarter from 22.7% in 2023, largely due to the effects of lower sales volume. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $114.8 million compared to $137.7 million last year, the operating margin of 23.8% compared to 26.3% in 2023. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $454.8 million compared to $452 million in 2023, reflecting a 1% organic sales increase, partially offset by $1.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain includes a high single-digit increase in activity with OEM dealerships, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. Gross margin improved 50 basis points to 45.5% from 45% last year. primarily due to savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 20.5% improve 10 basis points from 20.6% last year. And the operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $113.6 million compared to $110.4 million last year. The operating margin of 25% compared to 24.4% reported last year. Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services increased $7.1 million or 7.6% to $100.5 million from $93.4 million last year, primarily reflecting the growth of the loan portfolio. Financial Services operating earnings of $70.2 million compared to $66.9 million in 2023. Financial services expenses were up $3.8 million from 2023 levels including $3.5 million of higher provisions for credit losses. Sequentially, the provision for credit losses was lower by $1.3 million. In the second quarter of 2024 and 2023, respective average yield on finance receivables were 17.7% and 17.6%. In the second quarter of '24 and '23, the average yield on contract receivables were 8.9% and 8.6%, respectively. Total loan originations of $308. 1 million in the second quarter represented a decrease of $18.2 million or 5.6% and from 2023 levels, primarily reflecting a high single-digit decline in extended credit originations, partially offset by higher originations of contract receivables. Consistent with the sales activity in the Snap-on Tools Group, extended credit origination to the U.S. declined and were only partially offset by growth in originations internationally. Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.5 billion of gross financing receivables with $2.2 billion from our U.S. operation. For extended credit or finance receivables, the U.S. 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.6% is up 30 basis points from the second quarter of 2023 but down 20 basis points sequentially from the 1.8% reported last quarter. Turn 12-month net losses for the overall extended credit portfolio of $58.6 million represented 2.94% [ph] of outstandings at quarter-end. Considering the current environment, we believe the delinquency in portfolio performance metrics remain relatively stable and are consistent with pre-COVID experience. Now, turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $301.1 million in the quarter represented 108% of net earnings compared to $270.3 million last year. The increase as compared to the second quarter of 2023 largely reflects decreases in working investment and higher net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $60.2 million primarily reflected net additions to finance receivables of $41.2 million and capital expenditures of $23.2 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $127.9 million included cash dividends of $98 million and the repurchase of 174,000 shares of common stock for $47.4 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $271.1 million of common stock under our existing authorization. Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivables decreased $7.8 million from 2023 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 60 days were unchanged from year-end. Inventories decreased $40.9 million from 2023 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.4 compared to 2.3 at year-end 2023. Our quarter end cash position of $1.2327 billion compared to $1.15 billion [ph] at year-end 2023. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $900 million available under our credit facilities. As of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2024. For the full year, we expect that capital expenditures will be in the range of $100 million to $110 million and we currently anticipate that our full year 2024 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 22% to 23%. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing out. Nick?\nNick Pinchuk: Thanks, Aldo. Wow! that's our second quarter. A period of continuing turbulence borne out of the uncertainty in the grassroots detect, uncertainty on the near-term environment. Customers tech that are cash rich and confidence poor. But it was also a period where our value-creating mechanism observing past right in the workplace, connecting with customers and translating the insights in an innovation that can make critical tasks easier where that core of our business model demonstrated that if efficacy stretches well beyond our traditional customer -- technician customer base and it does so quite profitably. It was an interlude in which our Snap-on value creation processes showed its ongoing strength, particularly visible in the Tools Group, where it drove product value and operating efficiency that buttressed [ph] gross margins, that stayed close to about flat despite the lower volumes. And you can see that written all across the quarter. The Tools Group, an uncertainty driven decline in volume continuing an -- and continuing and unreduced support for its franchise network but with profitable quick payback products on RCI [ph] keeping gross margins at reasonable levels, offsetting some of the volume impact. RS&I, seizing the opportunity to help shop owners and managers, matching the rising vehicle repair complexity and doing it very profitably, achieving an OI margin of 25% one of its best C&I rolling out of the garage to -- in critical industries overcoming the recessions in Europe and the turbulence to grow in each feeder [ph], continuing the upward trajectory of its customized kitting business driving expansion in critical industries and achieving an OI margin of 16.7%, up 70 basis points; its highest ever. And it all came together for a positive performance for the overall enterprise. Sales; about flat against the uncertainty. OI margins, 23.8% -- 22.8%, excluding the legal payment, one of our very strongest, and EPS $5.07 -- $4.91 without the legal payment, the highest for any Snap-on quarter. It was an encouraging period. And we believe that with the strength of our business model, with the opportunities inherent in our broad markets and with the considerable and harm experience of our team, Snap-on will remain resilient in the turbulence, making the most of it is the abundant possibility to markets and we'll continue to advance making progress through 2024 and well beyond. Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. I know a lot of you are listening. The strength Snap-on has demonstrated in the turbulence and the associated advantages we carry into the days ahead have been created by all of you. the considerable capabilities you bring to bear every hour to have my admiration. For the significant success you've achieved in the quarter and for many periods before, you have my congratulations. And for the unwavering belief you hold in the future of our team, you have my thanks. Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Luke Junk with Baird.\nLuke Junk: To start with, just hoping we could get an update on the facility expansion projects that you have going on right now, both kind of progress incrementally timing and then how things are progressing versus your expectations? And to what extent you can leverage that to pivot the mix and really focus on those quicker payback items that folks are looking for?\nNick Pinchuk: [Indiscernible] is concerning what the...\nLuke Junk: Facility expansions -- I think -- both, Milwaukee -- yes [ph].\nNick Pinchuk: Okay. It's only expansion, I can talk about that. Look, Algona added some space that's in place. They're starting to use it now. Now the thing is you use it but you figure out how to be more efficient. So just because it's in place and you're in the saddle doesn't mean it's going to work at high efficiency. But that's breaking some bottlenecks out there and allowing us to build things like we're bringing on a new workbench. We're bringing out a 36-inch small Epic toolbox that's smaller than we ever saw before -- than we've had before and therefore, it's a lower price situation. In other words, quicker payback items. So that's working in Milwaukee. We're expanding 25% and we've got -- we've expanded the machining area. Some of the machines are in. We're still delivering others because they were ordered, frankly, to adjust to a pivot. So we've had partial expansion of some of our flexible socket impact line and also some of our bit line. And we -- so that will be sort of developing through the expanding and getting better and bigger during the quarter. And as we move out, we'll get more and more efficient. And then we're building probably for the fourth quarter and first quarter, we're building the more capacity into the plating line up there because we expand in Elizabeth on another hand, that's where we make the wrenches [indiscernible]. We've expanded the plating line already there and that's up and operating and we're putting more machines in there to fill another expansion to build more effective ranches using cold forming to reduce the near net ship and making -- raising our capacity for those -- for ratchets in that situation. And we're expanding our adjustable rent capacity down there because it's in demand and we can't build enough of them. So you have to -- that will give you some examples, I think, in terms of outgoing -- and it's I think it increases by about 25%. In Milwaukee increased by 25%, Alcon's 30%, and Elizabeth -- will be 35% at the end. So -- and then, so they're all in place. Some of it is working, some isn't. But what it has done is it broken some of the difficult workarounds we've had in the places. So part of the things you see in gross margin in some of the efficiencies that are coming out of the already partial expansions being completed and up and running.\nLuke Junk: That's very helpful. Could you maybe comment on tool storage, specifically in the quarter [ph] the benefit, I think, already in the first quarter of you having the capacity in place and flexing it like you just spoke to, did the growth continue in the second quarter?\nNick Pinchuk: The product line -- every product line in this quarter was more balanced. Every product line was down some in the quarter. And big ticket, you saw the originations. I think originations were down more originations which is a surrogate for big tool -- for big ticket sales and longer payback sales was down more than the Tools Group was down in the quarter. So the big scans were a smaller percentage of that. Now that was led, Diagnostics was probably the big player in that because diagnostics was comparing to a launch of the SOLUS+ last year. So a non-launch quarter you can have different comparisons with that in this quarter like this with the launch quarter. But generally, tool storage, if you're talking about the efficacy of tool storage, One of the things this is doing is allowing us to sell and pivot to provide people the accessories, the benches, the cards that technicians are more receptive to in this situation. So that will accrue to us. It's a question of how quickly we can get that burned in to the Algona production process. It's working a little bit now. But in the quarter, technician uncertainty, I think, was a little higher this quarter. So you probably like you might see the conditions are a little more uncertain. And so I think the ticket was down again.\nLuke Junk: And then lastly, just given the uncertainty in terms of tax right now, do you meter or change your approach to the SFC all this year just in terms of promotions and positioning and could it be maybe a venue to refine your approach in this more unsettled environment kind of exiting this year into '25 [ph]?\nNick Pinchuk: Yes, yes. I mean, the thing -- the -- look, not the overall thing. The overall thing is the SFC is 3 purposes. Before. One is we have a training seminar, -- we're going to train the heck out of things, things we think need train -- some of those are smaller ticket diagnostic units, some of them are handles and so on. So we're working on those things in the SFC. We're going to continue that because we're going to continue to support. Like I said, we want to be a full sprint on fully loaded when we come out of this difficulty with the Tools Group and our network. And then we have kind of a tool show which is several football fields and you want to let the people touch the tools and that's where we'll have some change because we'll be trying to emphasize the quicker payback items which we think that technicians want. For example, one of the warm-up promotions for the SFC was the Super 7 which is filled with the hand tools, wrenches and ratchets and hammers and torque units. And it did go pretty well. It did get subscribed almost as a sellout. So we're going to try to push in that situation. So we'll be trying to emphasize by physical presentation and by verbal urging the idea of quicker payback items, not completely neglecting tools further diagnostics in that situation. And then -- the other thing about the SFC, you need the SFC, I think, because you don't touch your franchisees that often and we all want to give them a message and reinforce that they have listed their economic future with a strong and robust business called [indiscernible].\nOperator: And our next question will come from Bret Jordan with Jefferies.\nPatrick Buckley: This is Patrick Buckley on for Brett. On the RS&I, could you talk a bit more on the dispersion between the OEM dealer customers and the independents. Is that independent shop softness similar to what you're seeing in the Tools Group? Just more cautious given the backdrop? Or is there something else there?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, remember that that's characterization. We are strong in the dealerships because the OEM programs have been strong, the change the idea -- that was the purpose of the Lyft discussion with is that really the OEMs are coloring up or are raising their game to match the different drivetrains and the more autonomy and the OEMs are launching programs to do that. and either associated with new models and new capabilities like demonstrated in Lyft. So you see that and that is marking. That business grew again high single digits in the quarter. So that is Boeing is underpinning that. And also, it's around the -- some of the software in that business with our electronic parts catalog. Now if you pivot, it's a little more complicated situation with the independent because flowing through RS&I is the diagnostics. They have the Diagnostics division because of its dependence on the information basis which are integral to other RS&I products. So diagnostics like big ticket was down in the Tools Group. So that dragged down some of the RS&I volume. If you look at our RS&I C&I, both sell to power tools and C&I diagnostics and ours. And if you look at them, they were up, I think the number was 1% organically at RS&I 1.2% organically in C&I. But if you looked at it externally, excluding sales to the Tools Group, internal sales, C&I was up 3.9% organically. And RS&I was up over 4%. And so it's a little more complicated description of that. We described it that way based on the efficacy of the actual reported numbers. So we do see some progress in independent shops, particularly with our direct sales businesses. You see one of the things that is happening in RS&I and coming out in RS&I is that when we can get up and sell directly to the customer with our, I think, really strong product line and broad, we do pretty well. We're still doing pretty well. But a part of that business goes through distributors. And when they go through distributors, we're seeing a pull off of that business. We saw it particularly in some of the RS&I businesses. So I don't think it's the independent shops. I think it's the distributors themselves or maybe getting a little white knuckle at this time and maybe taking down some of their inventories, some of those distributors. So you're seeing that over here. It's kind of a complicated complicate around late summarized. We're doing pretty well with the dealerships. We're doing well selling to direct independent shops which means they're doing pretty well and they're doing -- they're still robust. But the intermediaries are a little bit more reluctant.\nPatrick Buckley: Got it. That's helpful. And then within the Tools Group, could you talk about how pricing compared to units during the quarter? Or maybe just additional color around how successful these lower payback items are and improving volumes and how that mix is affecting things?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, the price per unit is a lot lower. So you've got to sell a lot more wrenches to make up for a tool storage box, that's pretty important. And that can weigh on your volume. But I would offer to you, you need to look no further than gross margin. Margin down 20 basis points with a -- what was it, 7.7% organic sales down, gross margin down 20 basis points -- how does you think that happened? Well, it happens because the new tools you bring out. The new ranches, the new tools we're bringing out, they are selling at good margins -- that doesn't mean we're pricing the existing businesses but a lot of these new tools and a lot of them are rolling out we got rent ships and ratchets and extensions and things that are especially made after the E-Series and the Super Duty trucks we talked about. People are willing to pay big premiums or that kind of stuff and it's playing out in the gross margins. part of the story about the Tools Group is, we held the margins pretty well and we kept spending at lower volumes. We didn't back off of the SG&A supporting the franchisees. So in effect, we could have blunted the volume even more if we didn't want to we didn't believe that the sun is coming out again and we want to be at full strength. So those are the balances. Gross margin is a big -- if you look at the gross margin overall the corporation, C&I is up 220 basis points RS&I up 50 basis points. The overall corporation is 5.6%, only down 10 basis points. So what you're seeing in our financials are, boy, we're still pretty robust. That's why I love the idea of C&I and RS&I Boeing up the turbulence of the Tools Group because if you look at the overall business, you say, hey, this business at the gross margin level looks pretty healthy.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.\nGary Prestopino: Just wanted to address the corporate expenses look like they were down and I would assume that's the impact of the legal settlement, right?\nNick Pinchuk: Yes. Except -- down, I don't know, like, what, $18 million or something like that? Maybe equal change. Okay. This hands me to tell you this, there, pains me nearly you got $11.2 million, I think, for the legal settlement and [indiscernible] change for reduced management stock-based compensation and bonuses estimated for the. So it hurts me to tell you that on this call. But in fact, that's a difference in this quarter.\nGary Prestopino: Right. And I could also see the stock comp was down. And I guess what I'm getting at is that looking forward in the back half of the year, should it be some -- without the impact of any legal settlement? Should it be somewhere between $20 million and $25 million a quarter?\nNick Pinchuk: I more at the top end of that. I would think more of the top end of that, actually. That's it I think.\nGary Prestopino: The other question I want to ask you is quite obvious that there's a slowdown here in the buying of diagnostic equipment. Some of it deals with the fact that you just had a great year last year. But when does it get to the point where the technician or the shop starts falling behind, if ever, if that occurs really with not upgrading their diagnostic product. And my understanding is that with these products, it really speeds up your production being able to repair cars. So does that start coming into play here as we work deeper into this?\nNick Pinchuk: Sure. It does. I think -- this is the thing. I think you've got 2 things going on. One, I hate to say the comparison but it is true that we launched a new product last second quarter and you're comparing against that. But you also have the technicians clear aversion for bigger ticket items at this point. They don't want to -- they're less like, you can see it broadly in the originations. They're gravitating towards other things. I was with franchisees and garage owners and Syracuse and in Atlanta and I had all the regional guys in here and I was watering them for probably longer than they wanted to be questions -- and they all said the same thing. People are starting -- they're just worried there's a fear in the situation of where they're going. So they don't want to get embroiled and pay them back over years as much. They're a little more conservative about that. They're not probably in the spending. So you see but your overarching point is quite true. Eventually, people have to say, people do say, boy and it's like it you could -- the car nowadays usually be able to take the car by sound. Now you have to look at the -- most we'll have to look at the trouble codes and try to the troubled points mean and then try to fix it. That's what scanners they tell you the trouble codes are. Those are the simpler and competitive diagnostic unit. But ours, what we confirmed in the legal settlement, we have a proprietary database that will take those data points, those data points, those trouble codes and decaled them tell you what's actually wrong with the car. Right now, the previous that, you can only scan, you have to figure that out for yourself. Our database will put you right on target. So eventually, as the cars go up in complexity, people aren't going to be able to -- just like they haven't been able to read now, they're not able to read the even get an idea about the car, even start without knowing what the trouble costs. In the future, they're going to have to be able to decode the trouble code because it's going to get even more complex and you see that weighing on the situation. And so we expect that to all figure out. That will all come out in the next -- over the next period. We'll be launching new diagnostics which will have new hardware and our software keeps getting better. Now one of the things we do see, Gary, is supporting your point is people who have diagnostics really fall in love with them and so they want to update their software. Our subscriptions are going up. Part of the reason why the tools was able to hold its margins is because it's software content is moving upwards. So people value it but eventually, they're going to want hardware.\nOperator: Our next question will come from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.\nDavid MacGregor: Nick, let me just ask you about sort of the second half and expectations here. I mean given second quarter negative organic growth in Snap-on tools. Does that suggest second half growth should be negative as well. And I mean, 2Q was not a challenging compare. And so I guess I'm just wondering how much forward visibility you have given the truck inventory levels and pre-SFC order growth?\nNick Pinchuk: Well. I don't know. I think I wouldn't have said that Q2 last year, you're right. On a year-over-year basis, if you just look at year-over-year, Q2 last year was down. It wasn't down, it was tepid, let's say. So it wasn't -- in that space, it wasn't as strong. But if you look back, if you look sequentially the movement between the first quarter and the second quarter isn't that much different in the last year versus this year. So it's not so inconsistent. It isn't like it isn't like that's a big difference. If you're talking about the second half, boy, there's a lot of things going on. One is that for some time, so it's hard to judge what the second half would be like. You're not going to get me to say that it will be negative in the second half because we have plants, we think provide some overcoming to that. And for some time now, for several quarters, the sales off the van have been bigger than the sales to the man on a year-over-year basis. Now we saw some of that change towards the end of the quarter. So I don't know where it's going to go. If you want to look at it -- so from a -- I would say when you look at it from an operational point of view, do you think sooner or later, this is going to have to play out more positively. But then when you look at uncertainty, your guess is as good as mine about how the uncertainty is going to play out. It seems to me as though, like I said in my remarks, the hits just keep on common. And so does anybody think -- if you look at the uncertainty in the world that it's less uncertainty -- or is the same today as it was, say, 3 months ago? I don't think so. I don't think so. And so you hear that out of the technicians. I don't know where it's going the third quarter or the fourth quarter, it's hard to say. But I think there's some positives that would mitigate towards positivity, the things we're doing the product we're bringing out the pivots we're making. But on the other hand, if you look at the macros, it's a black hole. You don't know it's very opaque. So your guess is good as mine in that situation. All I know is the only thing I can control is to try to do the pivot to try to match what the technicians and take advantage of every opportunity we have and the message of this quarter is, is that RS&I and C&I, show that the model works in those places and I can make a lot of money and they provide good offsets.\nDavid MacGregor: Right. Nick, you -- the operating expenses in the second quarter in the Snap-on Tools segment deleveraged. You characterized that mostly as volume-related I guess it sounds now like you're about to lean more heavily into training and maybe advertising and promotions. And I'm just wondering how you expect that OpEx to continue deleveraging, in the second half?\nNick Pinchuk: I don't know. What happened -- my view on the second quarter, you may have a different view of it might view the second quarter was, we didn't back off. We kept spending the same. We spent a little bit more [indiscernible].\nDavid MacGregor: So we continue doing that in the second half?\nNick Pinchuk: More volumes. So I'm not talking that I'm going to sally forth with a lot more expenses but I'm holding the support I'm holding a support. We're doing what we do only we're adjusting it to match the current situation. I didn't mean my comments before that we're going to open the plug dates and spend a lot more. I didn't mean that. What I meant is I'm holding because I thought we were doing a pretty good job of supporting before. Now I think we held that in the second quarter. We'll probably do that again but it will be a different array versus the match to the current environment.\nDavid MacGregor: Got it. And then can you just talk about cadence within the quarter? You mentioned a moment ago in responding to the question that your trucks were destocking right up until late in the quarter.\nNick Pinchuk: Yes, right.\nDavid MacGregor: I was just going to get you to talk about cadence. Please go ahead.\nNick Pinchuk: Cadence was pretty, I think, consistent throughout the quarter. I think towards the end of the quarter, we had less destocking events in the last month or so. that's a positive. However, sometimes, I'll tell you, David, sometimes that happens because it's the last month. So it's hard for me to interpret whether that's a last month phenomenon that happens once in a while, not uncommonly but not all the time. It hasn't happened recently but it did happen. So maybe that's a positive. It's not for us to predict that out of the 1 month. But I think if you go back through the quarter, it was about the same levels. The relationship was the [indiscernible] except for the land.\nDavid MacGregor: And your early July experience wouldn't give you a framework for interpreter?\nNick Pinchuk: No. It's too early. And then you got too much stuff floating through July. Somebody asked me, not on the call but asked me well, are people pulling back in early July, waiting for the SFC, the responding -- we did have, like I said just a minute ago, we had the Super 7 program that rolled out and seemed to be pre well received with this full array of hand tools. We gave him a great jackpot blast the hand tools for this promotion. And that seems to get enthusiasm up and it's pretty close to expectation. I think it was the kind of sellout type of things or close to sell it. So that seemed to go okay. But that is an evidence to proclaim where the world is going. It's better than a pulp in the Iowa to sustain but you're not going to be able to -- can't extrapolate to -- it's dangerous to extrapolate out of that too much. Now I hope it is. The flood gates go up and everything is going to go well. Happy days are here again.\nDavid MacGregor: Last question for me. Last question for me, if I could. Just on credit. I mean what are you seeing increase in RA transfers? And what would originations look like without the RA transfers and Credit penetration [ph].\nAldo Pagliari: The mix of activities is pretty much similar to last quarter. So no, they have not pivoted to RA transfers as a method of funding activity on demand or anything like that.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Scott Stember with Roth MKM.\nScott Stember: Nick, is there a way of trying to see how much of the tool sales decline is really just based on the fact that you still don't have the available capacity to make product? Just trying to frame that out -- and If you can't do that, maybe just give us an idea of when would you expect to have all of the capacity and all the bottlenecks could up to make sure that you're at least making what they need?\nNick Pinchuk: You're thinking towards the -- if everything is in place, it gets better every Dick's got. You know what I mean, we get for every day in that situation. Because some of the capacity is in there and so the machines are there. Well, for example, we're half -- we're 50% of the expand we wanted in Flex stock in Milwaukee. So that's helping us but it's not enough. And so you've got adjustable wrenches, not enough. You've got some of the smaller ticket tool stores, not enough. So we're getting out of those. On the other hand, it's hard for me to say how much really would play out. I mean that would give you a legal boost. So, I do think you saw -- as you know, in the quarter, when you're selling small -- when you pivot to smaller kit items, you got to sell a lot of wrenches to make up a tool storage box. So it tends to put a, what I would call, a weight on your overall revenue. But I think you saw some of that in this quarter. We're trying to fill up the bucket on that but -- it's going to take us a while to do. Now, third quarter will be better than the second and the fourth quarter will be better in the first quarter after that will be better. So when the -- translating that in the revenue and profit numbers, it's hard for me to say, really hard for me to say. So I can't really put a number on it.\nScott Stember: And then, just last question. When you're talking with the shops and just with your franchisees, what are you hearing about how your competitors are faring at least at the shop level -- just trying to sense if there's a share loss or...\nNick Pinchuk: I don't -- tell you the truth, competitors shop guys or tech never really mentioned the competitors to me. So -- but I don't know. I'm a CEO. So I'm not so sure they would I don't know. But they never really -- you go into the shop, you'll see -- you can see, I don't see any increased presence of the competitors. I will tell you that when I talk to franchisees, or I talked to our regional sales developers, we're all in here for 12 hours in a room with me. They didn't mention the competition really. I think we would say that the enemies we have are mostly uncertainty and us. So we're trying to -- the speed at which we can pivot helps some of the problem but the uncertainty will still lay over even when we fully pivoted. So you kind of got that going on. We don't see any incursion in -- that doesn't mean we don't look that headed product with a fine tooth comb and try to figure out, well, do they have something we don't have? Can people say it's better? What is their pricing, how do they deliver? How do they support what kinds of things can it do for the customer? We do that all the time. But I don't think that's part of our problem. It does appear to be. Usually, the competitors are selling to a different customer base actually.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.\nChristopher Glynn: Was just first curious about net cash position now, the remaining repurchase authorization is a small proportion of your liquidity. So your kind of balance sheet positions in a different spot than I've seen in past years. I'm wondering how you think about that?\nNick Pinchuk: I'm bit about it. But look, I think you have to reassess how we're going -- I mean the thing is we -- I think you know our view of cash usage going forward, capital usage. And the first idea is to make sure our business is fully funded. Secondly is we look at the dividend which -- the dividend is coming up and we have paid a dividend every quarter since 1939 and we have never reduced it. So we assessed that in perpetuity -- sorry, guiding principle. But we have increased the dividend. I think now every quarter for almost 13 years, if we lease it again, it will be the 14. I'm not giving you any insight information about whether we're going to increase or go flat or anything but we'll be looking at that pretty carefully. Then we have acquisitions which we're constantly looking at -- and you've heard the story before that we have this landscape. In fact, we have guided as we speak, looking at other acquisitions. And I don't know if they'll play out or not because we're careful with our money. And then we have stock buyback which you already pointed out, as an authorization now that's a little bit less than it was before. And so we'll have to assess that as we go forward. That's how I'm thinking of it really.\nChristopher Glynn: Okay. And my follow-up, just back to SOT curious if there's any interesting geographic dispersion. We've got an entry here, lots of regions, different economies to a degree on the incremental weakening, you seen any kind of dispersion in regions?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, I can tell you this. In the last 6 months, I've met with franchisees and customers in almost like in the Midwest, in the East just recently in Syracuse in Atlanta and the Southwest. And there hasn't been that much difference. That's one stretchers. I think there's uncertainty, we saw this before. I do think the grassroots economy is impacted by the uncertainty broadly and the text may be among -- maybe the techs are special because car repairs continues robust. So there are -- a lot of people are confident poor but the techs are also cash rich in that situation. So that may be that may be part of the issue. I don't see much. And I talked to our regional guys, all 9 meters were in here. Any there's some differences and we try to look at those differences and try to figure out maybe should we facilitize more. Are they -- are those operations? We haven't been able to come up with much actually. So I don't see much difference even though you would say there would be you don't really -- you get the same story from text everywhere.\nChristopher Glynn: Do you think tax did get hit with more regulatory and compliance costs?\nNick Pinchuk: The tax, I don't know. I don't think the tax, the garages may be. The garages might get more regulatory compliance costs. I don't think the tax is so much. They don't mention it so much, I think. I don't hear that but I just -- small businesses, I mean the national soul change [ph] in manufacturing goes while over regulations, you know. They talk about how much it cost, they say it for every small manufacturer. So every small manufacturer has to pay $35,000 per employee per year in regulation costs. So I think by extension, you would say small businesses like garages would have that problem. But I don't think the tax [ph] would be burdened with it.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Tom Hayes with CL King.\nTom Hayes: Thanks guys. Appreciate you fitting in. Just quickly, Nick, maybe any color you could provide on what you're seeing on the positive side on the critical industries. I think you guys called it out as a bit of a bright spot. Is there anything maybe on avionics or military or natural resources that stands out?\nNick Pinchuk: You mean booming as it is, is that the. Yes, no -- [indiscernible] up double digits again. And the military has been consistently strong a cool thing is we include education in the critical industries because we believe it's critical to influence. And one of the things about it is the education business has been up nicely. And what that says is the young people are Hungary for Snap-on products. And so that's a cool thing for us. We really like that. So you see that. I don't have anything in terms of, boy, it seemed like aviation was strong this quarter and I would expect to continue -- and you have to believe, given the Boeing situation that customers in aviation would be pretty anxious to be able to have accuracy and documentation which we offer in spades in our product for that particular industry and I think that's driving some of it. I think the military is obvious. I think the military -- every nation is on edge. For example, you have countries in Europe who are looking to double their military and they're coming to us to help them upgrade to manage their fleet of claims. And so you see some of that. So I think those 2 types of general trusts are working. But you also see in general industry were strong. The overall industry is strong because I think the industry in this time is looking for efficiency and repair is efficiently, the quicker you can do it. Now the overarching thing that we're noting is that in all these industries, they're looking for customized products that will match their particular problems because the critical industries is replete with those opportunities and tasks where you have to have a particular array of products to match them. That's why the custom kitting is doing so well. We almost have not many competitors in this situation as a manufacturer. So that is really working for us. And it seems like whatever whenever we give the industrial group one way, they run the daylight and take it. So I think we're pretty good about that position, that business.\nOperator: This will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Sara Verbsky for any closing remarks.\nSara Verbsky: Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Nick Pinchuk",
            "content": "Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I'll start with the highlights of our second quarter and I'll provide my perspectives on the results on our markets and our path ahead. After that, Aldo will give you a detailed review of the financials. Our second quarter -- of course, there were challenges uncertainty remain prominent among our technician customers but our Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I Group, with repair shop owners and managers and our commercial and industrial or C&I group, enabling critical tasks outside the vehicle shop. They both progressed very nicely, taking full advantage of their opportunities and balancing the tech turbulence and tools. So our results in the second quarter are clear and unmistakable demonstration that Snap-on's principal value creating mechanism, observing work right in the workplace, using the insights learned to create products that make critical tests easier and more efficient, that works across many industries and in many environments. It highlights that our enterprise is not dependent on a particular customer base. We believe, it shows that as we move forward, reaching higher we do so with greater resilience and with expanding possibilities and with an enterprise that's broader and stronger than ever before. Like most quarters, we did have headwinds, we had opportunities with disparities from group to group and geography to geography. North America remained mixed with significant gains in critical industries. Internationally, our consolidated results were varied but reflected overall positive. Europe showed some signs of recovery among the scattered economic disruptions from region to region and the Asia Pacific markets registered progress overcoming the delayed recovery in China. So now, let's talk about the results. Second quarter sales of $1179.4 million was slightly down from the $1191.3 million of last year. on an organic basis, excluding $5.7 million in unfavorable foreign currency and $7.3 million from acquisitions, our sales were lower by 1.1%. The OpCo operating income or OI margin for the full quarter was 23.8%, up 50 basis points. Now with that said, that level included the benefit of a final payment from our recent legal win, excluding that addition, the OI margin was 22.8%, down from 2023 but still among our very best to pass the only by the recent -- by the record-setting second quarter of last year. For financial services, the OI grew to $70.2 million from the $66.9 million recorded in 2023. A number that when combined with our OpCo results, raised the consolidated OI margin to 27.4%, up 60 basis points over the 26.8% of 2023 and EPS, it was $5.07 which included a benefit from the legal payment of $0.16. Again, excluding that legal item, EPS was $4.91 still above last year and representing a new Snap-on level for any quarter, strength and progress against the wind. So those are the overall numbers. Now for a view of the market. The second quarter once again highlighted that the opportunities in automotive repair, they continue to be favorable, marked by the ever-expanding complexity of design, new and diverse powertrains. More interlocking systems to advance driving autonomy, arrays of drive by wire sensors, new body materials and an aging car park now averaging 12.6 years. The opportunity in vehicle repair exists industry-wide and they appear to be unwavering. The vehicle OEMs, the dealerships and the independent shops recognizes the positive trend and they continue to invest in tools and equipment that will expand their capabilities to support the influx of new models and the ever rising complexity of repair. And in the quarter, our RS&I Group expanded our reach into OEM dealership -- into OEM dealership programs and strengthened our position in independent garages with our repair management software packages and with great new hardware products. So the possibility, with repair shop owners and managers are strong, the outlook looking forward is quite positive and Snap-on is well positioned to seize the opportunities. Now let's shift to the technicians. These are the folks who turn the wrenches to make the diagnosis and execute the repairs. Again this quarter, I had multiple occasions to meet with the franchisees, the garage owners and the tech and it reconfirmed that the shops and the technicians are prospering. The micro data says it's true, repair hours are up. Tech wages are healthy. The demand for tech is strong and the number of techs are increasing. The number of tech is increasing. It makes sense, new systems, the rising complexity, the aging car park makes what the techs do more difficult and more valuable. So the economic trajectory of vehicle repair is quite positive. It's an attractive place to be. But it's also clear that while the techs are busy and have cash, their confidence in the way forward is still poor. Every day there is bad news. Two wars with no end in sight, the border unsettled, the shipping lanes disrupted, tit-for-tat with China, lingering inflation and the election, the election seems to get more unpredictable with every morning news cycle; the hits just keep on coming for bad news for breakfast. It's almost like the grassroots technicians have a fear of what may happen. And paraphrasing the movie Dune fear is the outlook killer. The franchisees also confirmed to us that with general uncertainty, the techs are leaning toward purchases that provide quick paybacks, while making the work easier right away. They're kind of cool on longer-term bigger ticket items. And knowing that, the Tools Group continues to focus on near-term product development, manufacturing changes and selling efforts that match those preferences. So now let's talk about the critical industries, where Snap-on rolls out of the garage, solving tasks of significant consequence. This is where the C&I group operates. And it's our most significant international presence. The area where we're most subject to global headwinds but the news was still reasonably encouraging. For the sectors, the critical industries kept rising in the period, the military, aviation and education segments led the way. For geographies, Europe was mixed. Several countries in recession and the ongoing impacts of the Ukraine war. Asia Pacific will also remain mixed. China was weak, driven by delayed financial recovery and Southeast Asia, again, had its difficulties. But -- both regions for C&I and for the corporation in total, were positive in the quarter despite the variations. Now speaking more - now I'd like to speak more about the critical industries, the demand for customized solutions to drive reliability and productivity keeps rising. And C&I continues to show significant and broader advantage in that arena and we believe there's more coming. So that's the market, vehicle tech, cash-rich but confidence poor. Preferring quick payback products. Repair shop owners and managers moving upward to match the car park and the critical industry is booming outside the garage. In C&I, so let's cover the groups now. In C&I, sales were $372 million representing an organic sales gain of 1.2%, excluding $7.3 million of acquisition-related sales and $3.8 million of an unfavorable foreign currency. Higher activity with customers based in those critical industries and the gains in Asia -- and a gain in Asia that defies the turbulence more than offset declines in our power tool and European-based hand tool operations. From an earnings perspective, C&I OI of $62.2 million, improved $4.1 million or 7.1% above last year. And the OI margin, it was 16.7%, up 70 basis points representing a new record for that group; gangbusters -- gangbusters for those guys. And the big driver was our International division. Continuing its upward trajectory with a double-digit rise and very strong profitability. About 18 months ago, we expanded our capability to make [Indiscernible] easier outside the garage by adding another building for industrial custom kitting, serving a range of critical segments and it's paid off -- it's paid off big. Since then, that business has been on a tear, [Indiscernible] cranking out more and more bespoke product bundles, sophisticated solutions like our automated tool control units that have become the standard for a range of industries. Custom kit offerings aimed at specific applications and at making the critical work easier and more reliable. It's driven some nice gains all around the world. And we believe we see many more possibilities in that arena. So we continue to invest in critical industries, expanding capabilities like in our custom tool machine in Kenosha, producing low volume, high reward items, for the most essential tasks. For example, visiting an oil drilling site. We saw that adding a section of pipe on the rigs requires technicians to move around the circumference constantly repositioning the turning tool. It's a slow and clumsy and imprecise effort. Our custom team tackled the problem designing both, a new bespoke \u2013 both a new bespoke wrench -- both designing a new bespoke wrench, specifically for the task and enabled by our new Kenosha machine shop configured a special machining process to produce it and it all worked. The special oil rig pipe wrench, greatly reduced the rework associated with misalignment and substantially decreased the task time, getting the job done more efficiently and more reliably and along the way, expanding the Snap-on reputation in the critical oil and gas sector. Also in the quarter, we introduced a new line of 14.4-volt micropower drills aimed specifically at diverse applications in aviation and general manufacturing. Test in all sectors vary from inserting wood screws to drilling accurate holes in airframe, to high volumes on production lines. To span the variety, each tool in the new line, and there is a range of them, is set to a different RPM range, enabling the tech to fit the speed to the job, substantially reducing rework or irreversible damages -- damage. The drill -- it's also designed for 2 operating states, the first slower. Allowing the tools to bite into the materials, securing a position for the serious drilling and the second stage, performing that serious drilling at the predetermined RPM, making a quick and clear cut. Our new industrial micro drills, 2-stage design, matched to the task, bringing new levels with accuracy, consistency and reliability to the work, it's a superior tool for the very task of those sectors and the customers have noticed. C&I in the quarter, launching customized solutions, maintaining its strong momentum in the critical industry, extending out of the garage and reaching new heights in profitability. Now for the Tools Group. Sales in the second quarter are $482 million included an organic decrease of 7.7%. The group's OI margin in the period was 23.8%, down 250 basis points due to the lower volumes. But gross margins held down 20 basis points, almost flat. The benefits of new product, manufacturing efficiencies and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, is written all over those numbers. And during the quarter, we continue to focus our product development, redirect our plans and guide our selling programs toward innovative quick payback solutions that drive productivity. A cornerstone for the pivot is rooted in customer - in our customer connection, standing side-by-side with the technicians, observing the work, witnessing the difficulties of modern and complex repair and using the insights gained to create a tool that makes especially difficult tasks much easier. In the second quarter, those insights lead the Tool Group to design a new torque adapter for use on Ford E-Series commercial vans. The standard procedure for basic brake repair on that model, requires the rear caliper bolts to be torqued at over 160-foot pounds, not so easy. And the task made doubly difficult because the bolt is obstructed, making it impossible to access the area with standard tooling without removing auxiliary parts, a big [tie] (ph) meter. So we've specifically configured a 21-millimeter, 12.6 inch flat adapter with a half inch hex drive to make the work easier and to specification. The device nestles perfectly. Between the particular obstructions on the model, engaging the fastener, turning a time-consuming task into one of just seconds and freeing the tech up to tackle the next repair order. It's made in our Elizabethton, Tennessee plant and it brings great value to the techs working on the E-Series. And you know there's a lot of them. Another example is the still observed when we observed when removing a canister tap that houses the fuel filter on 4 Super Duty trucks. Access to the 32-millimeter hectare on top of cap is impeded by other components. Standard part or sockets are out. Seeing the problem. Our team created a special low-profile socket, tapered, gradually, just the slide into position under the blocking hoses and then using a standard ration and extension, easily removing the clamp of a tap [ph], complete the repair, a complicated [ph] -- and complete the repair, a complicated job made much easier. Produced in our Milwaukee plant, it's another quick buyback item that makes a substantial difference and the text a lot of it. A final example comes from observing technicians walking to and from the work piece; back and forth from their work to achieve standard flyers for basic test. A compact design seemed to be the solution. So we expanded our triple joint flyer line to develop a small 4.5-inch fire set with 3 models, a combination along those in a flank drive slip joint version for versatility and they were all pocket size to be always at the ready, call it out of your pocket and you're ready to go. And all designed to allow immediate access to remove low torque in place to pull through users, to adjust hoses or provide some additional gripping leverage for basic repairs or just inspections. The new units save steps and make work easier in tight spaces and they're offered in 2 handle models. A cushion grip addition to reduce hand fatigue and for the first time, our bare metal diamond plate texture that provides a superior grid even with sweaty or oily hands. Cold forge in the U.S., the new pliers a game changer. And the rollout was a huge hit, making our million-dollar hit product status just during the initial launch. Well, that's the Tools Group. Pivoting to technicians preferences, producing innovative, quick paybacks, making work easier, New tools matched to the task and guided by customer connection, bringing quick value to the text and you can see the value play out in the gross margins, bringing quick value to the tech. And you can see that play out in the gross margins, almost flat in the downturn. You can also see, I think, our unwavering support for the franchisees and the operating expense. It was about flat even in the turbulence, even in the downturn, even with the lower sales. We'll maintain our training, our programs and our efforts in the field. Even in this turbulence. You see, we believe the uncertainty will recede and we want the network to be strong and fully loaded when that occurs. Now for RS&I. Group sales of $458.8 million in the quarter, representing a $4.3 million or 1% organic increase that was partially offset by $1.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. Those gains reflected higher activity with OEM dealerships attenuated by lower sales in the diagnostics division, BOI margin, it was an even 25%, rising 60 basis points and among the group's best. The numbers reflect the strength of RS&I products and programs for repair shareholders and managers as we help them match the evolving challenges of [indiscernible] car park. Speaking of the product evolutions and our progress with OEM pores. The traditional method of lifting vehicles is becoming more complex with the onset of new hybrid and EV platforms. The batteries require changes in lift points to adjust for the different center of gravity on EVs. And to complicate the matter. Each model design presents a different problem. In response, we designed steel floor plates matched to particular models that service guides and positioning the vehicle in the exact location that puts the lift arms in the proper place for that vehicle, enabling a safe procedure and an easy lift. The OEMs and the shops, they enthusiastically seen the innovation as another a long line of the modifications needed to match the evolving car park. They need to facilitate to match that change and we're helping them do it. Another successful [indiscernible] release was the ProX1HD [ph] on vehicle break plate [ph], specifically for heavy-duty platforms like buses, fire engine and semi-truck, delayed cuts away in perfections and abrasion on a brake rotor surface -- the imperfections and abrasions on a brake's rotor surface that always arise during regular operations. The result is a fully restored component that supports optimized brake performance without the need of a replacement. The previous choice for heavy-duty break repair work was the disassemble of break assembly or and either order new parts or smooth the rotor on a stand-alone bench lay [ph]; in either case, a laborious process. The new ProCut design avoids both the time and the effort to lift the heavy components off the vehicle and it eliminates the cost of new parts. We believe it's another changer. Garage owners have seen the value and we project that the ProCut will become the industry standard. Also in RS&I, C&I, a car aligner serves the vehicle collision market serves the vehicle collision market. Serves the vehicle fusion market with a number of heavy-duty items. A good example during the quarter is the release of our low profile frame bench innovatively designed holding the workpiece at an optimal height, making it easier for technicians to interact with the damaged vehicle. The bench is rugged for heavy collision work and integrates with our existing policy solutions that stretch and can torque the chassis back in position. The ability to raise and lower the benches in multiple positions while still engaging with the vehicle reduces fatigue with the user and makes the process much easier. The collision space is quite robust. By the changing vehicles. And Carline has been on -- and as such, Carline has been on a continuing positive trajectory. And the new bench makes our advantage of that market even stronger. RS&I expanding its res which shop owners and managers, confronting the increased complexity, focusing on developing innovations that simplify the difficult and help shops prosper along the way. Well, those are the -- for along the way. Well, those -- the RS&I quarter was quite strong. Well, those are the second quarter results, Tools Group down impacted by uncertainty, pivoting to customer preference, launching new product, holding the gross margins and maintaining the network. C&I and RS&I providing the multi-sector power of customer connection and new product recording strong profitability, balancing the headwinds of technician uncertainty and the overall corporation. Launching a broad range of products from tapered sockets to industrial power tools to collision benches, sales about flat, OI margin, 23.8% -- 22.8%, excluding the legal benefits, one of our highest and EPS $5.07, $4.91 excluding the legal item setting a new high. performance achieved against the wind. It was an encouraging quarter. Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Thanks, Aldo. Wow! that's our second quarter. A period of continuing turbulence borne out of the uncertainty in the grassroots detect, uncertainty on the near-term environment. Customers tech that are cash rich and confidence poor. But it was also a period where our value-creating mechanism observing past right in the workplace, connecting with customers and translating the insights in an innovation that can make critical tasks easier where that core of our business model demonstrated that if efficacy stretches well beyond our traditional customer -- technician customer base and it does so quite profitably. It was an interlude in which our Snap-on value creation processes showed its ongoing strength, particularly visible in the Tools Group, where it drove product value and operating efficiency that buttressed [ph] gross margins, that stayed close to about flat despite the lower volumes. And you can see that written all across the quarter. The Tools Group, an uncertainty driven decline in volume continuing an -- and continuing and unreduced support for its franchise network but with profitable quick payback products on RCI [ph] keeping gross margins at reasonable levels, offsetting some of the volume impact. RS&I, seizing the opportunity to help shop owners and managers, matching the rising vehicle repair complexity and doing it very profitably, achieving an OI margin of 25% one of its best C&I rolling out of the garage to -- in critical industries overcoming the recessions in Europe and the turbulence to grow in each feeder [ph], continuing the upward trajectory of its customized kitting business driving expansion in critical industries and achieving an OI margin of 16.7%, up 70 basis points; its highest ever. And it all came together for a positive performance for the overall enterprise. Sales; about flat against the uncertainty. OI margins, 23.8% -- 22.8%, excluding the legal payment, one of our very strongest, and EPS $5.07 -- $4.91 without the legal payment, the highest for any Snap-on quarter. It was an encouraging period. And we believe that with the strength of our business model, with the opportunities inherent in our broad markets and with the considerable and harm experience of our team, Snap-on will remain resilient in the turbulence, making the most of it is the abundant possibility to markets and we'll continue to advance making progress through 2024 and well beyond. Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. I know a lot of you are listening. The strength Snap-on has demonstrated in the turbulence and the associated advantages we carry into the days ahead have been created by all of you. the considerable capabilities you bring to bear every hour to have my admiration. For the significant success you've achieved in the quarter and for many periods before, you have my congratulations. And for the unwavering belief you hold in the future of our team, you have my thanks. Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? [Indiscernible] is concerning what the... Okay. It's only expansion, I can talk about that. Look, Algona added some space that's in place. They're starting to use it now. Now the thing is you use it but you figure out how to be more efficient. So just because it's in place and you're in the saddle doesn't mean it's going to work at high efficiency. But that's breaking some bottlenecks out there and allowing us to build things like we're bringing on a new workbench. We're bringing out a 36-inch small Epic toolbox that's smaller than we ever saw before -- than we've had before and therefore, it's a lower price situation. In other words, quicker payback items. So that's working in Milwaukee. We're expanding 25% and we've got -- we've expanded the machining area. Some of the machines are in. We're still delivering others because they were ordered, frankly, to adjust to a pivot. So we've had partial expansion of some of our flexible socket impact line and also some of our bit line. And we -- so that will be sort of developing through the expanding and getting better and bigger during the quarter. And as we move out, we'll get more and more efficient. And then we're building probably for the fourth quarter and first quarter, we're building the more capacity into the plating line up there because we expand in Elizabeth on another hand, that's where we make the wrenches [indiscernible]. We've expanded the plating line already there and that's up and operating and we're putting more machines in there to fill another expansion to build more effective ranches using cold forming to reduce the near net ship and making -- raising our capacity for those -- for ratchets in that situation. And we're expanding our adjustable rent capacity down there because it's in demand and we can't build enough of them. So you have to -- that will give you some examples, I think, in terms of outgoing -- and it's I think it increases by about 25%. In Milwaukee increased by 25%, Alcon's 30%, and Elizabeth -- will be 35% at the end. So -- and then, so they're all in place. Some of it is working, some isn't. But what it has done is it broken some of the difficult workarounds we've had in the places. So part of the things you see in gross margin in some of the efficiencies that are coming out of the already partial expansions being completed and up and running. The product line -- every product line in this quarter was more balanced. Every product line was down some in the quarter. And big ticket, you saw the originations. I think originations were down more originations which is a surrogate for big tool -- for big ticket sales and longer payback sales was down more than the Tools Group was down in the quarter. So the big scans were a smaller percentage of that. Now that was led, Diagnostics was probably the big player in that because diagnostics was comparing to a launch of the SOLUS+ last year. So a non-launch quarter you can have different comparisons with that in this quarter like this with the launch quarter. But generally, tool storage, if you're talking about the efficacy of tool storage, One of the things this is doing is allowing us to sell and pivot to provide people the accessories, the benches, the cards that technicians are more receptive to in this situation. So that will accrue to us. It's a question of how quickly we can get that burned in to the Algona production process. It's working a little bit now. But in the quarter, technician uncertainty, I think, was a little higher this quarter. So you probably like you might see the conditions are a little more uncertain. And so I think the ticket was down again. Yes, yes. I mean, the thing -- the -- look, not the overall thing. The overall thing is the SFC is 3 purposes. Before. One is we have a training seminar, -- we're going to train the heck out of things, things we think need train -- some of those are smaller ticket diagnostic units, some of them are handles and so on. So we're working on those things in the SFC. We're going to continue that because we're going to continue to support. Like I said, we want to be a full sprint on fully loaded when we come out of this difficulty with the Tools Group and our network. And then we have kind of a tool show which is several football fields and you want to let the people touch the tools and that's where we'll have some change because we'll be trying to emphasize the quicker payback items which we think that technicians want. For example, one of the warm-up promotions for the SFC was the Super 7 which is filled with the hand tools, wrenches and ratchets and hammers and torque units. And it did go pretty well. It did get subscribed almost as a sellout. So we're going to try to push in that situation. So we'll be trying to emphasize by physical presentation and by verbal urging the idea of quicker payback items, not completely neglecting tools further diagnostics in that situation. And then -- the other thing about the SFC, you need the SFC, I think, because you don't touch your franchisees that often and we all want to give them a message and reinforce that they have listed their economic future with a strong and robust business called [indiscernible]. Well, remember that that's characterization. We are strong in the dealerships because the OEM programs have been strong, the change the idea -- that was the purpose of the Lyft discussion with is that really the OEMs are coloring up or are raising their game to match the different drivetrains and the more autonomy and the OEMs are launching programs to do that. and either associated with new models and new capabilities like demonstrated in Lyft. So you see that and that is marking. That business grew again high single digits in the quarter. So that is Boeing is underpinning that. And also, it's around the -- some of the software in that business with our electronic parts catalog. Now if you pivot, it's a little more complicated situation with the independent because flowing through RS&I is the diagnostics. They have the Diagnostics division because of its dependence on the information basis which are integral to other RS&I products. So diagnostics like big ticket was down in the Tools Group. So that dragged down some of the RS&I volume. If you look at our RS&I C&I, both sell to power tools and C&I diagnostics and ours. And if you look at them, they were up, I think the number was 1% organically at RS&I 1.2% organically in C&I. But if you looked at it externally, excluding sales to the Tools Group, internal sales, C&I was up 3.9% organically. And RS&I was up over 4%. And so it's a little more complicated description of that. We described it that way based on the efficacy of the actual reported numbers. So we do see some progress in independent shops, particularly with our direct sales businesses. You see one of the things that is happening in RS&I and coming out in RS&I is that when we can get up and sell directly to the customer with our, I think, really strong product line and broad, we do pretty well. We're still doing pretty well. But a part of that business goes through distributors. And when they go through distributors, we're seeing a pull off of that business. We saw it particularly in some of the RS&I businesses. So I don't think it's the independent shops. I think it's the distributors themselves or maybe getting a little white knuckle at this time and maybe taking down some of their inventories, some of those distributors. So you're seeing that over here. It's kind of a complicated complicate around late summarized. We're doing pretty well with the dealerships. We're doing well selling to direct independent shops which means they're doing pretty well and they're doing -- they're still robust. But the intermediaries are a little bit more reluctant. Well, the price per unit is a lot lower. So you've got to sell a lot more wrenches to make up for a tool storage box, that's pretty important. And that can weigh on your volume. But I would offer to you, you need to look no further than gross margin. Margin down 20 basis points with a -- what was it, 7.7% organic sales down, gross margin down 20 basis points -- how does you think that happened? Well, it happens because the new tools you bring out. The new ranches, the new tools we're bringing out, they are selling at good margins -- that doesn't mean we're pricing the existing businesses but a lot of these new tools and a lot of them are rolling out we got rent ships and ratchets and extensions and things that are especially made after the E-Series and the Super Duty trucks we talked about. People are willing to pay big premiums or that kind of stuff and it's playing out in the gross margins. part of the story about the Tools Group is, we held the margins pretty well and we kept spending at lower volumes. We didn't back off of the SG&A supporting the franchisees. So in effect, we could have blunted the volume even more if we didn't want to we didn't believe that the sun is coming out again and we want to be at full strength. So those are the balances. Gross margin is a big -- if you look at the gross margin overall the corporation, C&I is up 220 basis points RS&I up 50 basis points. The overall corporation is 5.6%, only down 10 basis points. So what you're seeing in our financials are, boy, we're still pretty robust. That's why I love the idea of C&I and RS&I Boeing up the turbulence of the Tools Group because if you look at the overall business, you say, hey, this business at the gross margin level looks pretty healthy. Yes. Except -- down, I don't know, like, what, $18 million or something like that? Maybe equal change. Okay. This hands me to tell you this, there, pains me nearly you got $11.2 million, I think, for the legal settlement and [indiscernible] change for reduced management stock-based compensation and bonuses estimated for the. So it hurts me to tell you that on this call. But in fact, that's a difference in this quarter. I more at the top end of that. I would think more of the top end of that, actually. That's it I think. Sure. It does. I think -- this is the thing. I think you've got 2 things going on. One, I hate to say the comparison but it is true that we launched a new product last second quarter and you're comparing against that. But you also have the technicians clear aversion for bigger ticket items at this point. They don't want to -- they're less like, you can see it broadly in the originations. They're gravitating towards other things. I was with franchisees and garage owners and Syracuse and in Atlanta and I had all the regional guys in here and I was watering them for probably longer than they wanted to be questions -- and they all said the same thing. People are starting -- they're just worried there's a fear in the situation of where they're going. So they don't want to get embroiled and pay them back over years as much. They're a little more conservative about that. They're not probably in the spending. So you see but your overarching point is quite true. Eventually, people have to say, people do say, boy and it's like it you could -- the car nowadays usually be able to take the car by sound. Now you have to look at the -- most we'll have to look at the trouble codes and try to the troubled points mean and then try to fix it. That's what scanners they tell you the trouble codes are. Those are the simpler and competitive diagnostic unit. But ours, what we confirmed in the legal settlement, we have a proprietary database that will take those data points, those data points, those trouble codes and decaled them tell you what's actually wrong with the car. Right now, the previous that, you can only scan, you have to figure that out for yourself. Our database will put you right on target. So eventually, as the cars go up in complexity, people aren't going to be able to -- just like they haven't been able to read now, they're not able to read the even get an idea about the car, even start without knowing what the trouble costs. In the future, they're going to have to be able to decode the trouble code because it's going to get even more complex and you see that weighing on the situation. And so we expect that to all figure out. That will all come out in the next -- over the next period. We'll be launching new diagnostics which will have new hardware and our software keeps getting better. Now one of the things we do see, Gary, is supporting your point is people who have diagnostics really fall in love with them and so they want to update their software. Our subscriptions are going up. Part of the reason why the tools was able to hold its margins is because it's software content is moving upwards. So people value it but eventually, they're going to want hardware. Well. I don't know. I think I wouldn't have said that Q2 last year, you're right. On a year-over-year basis, if you just look at year-over-year, Q2 last year was down. It wasn't down, it was tepid, let's say. So it wasn't -- in that space, it wasn't as strong. But if you look back, if you look sequentially the movement between the first quarter and the second quarter isn't that much different in the last year versus this year. So it's not so inconsistent. It isn't like it isn't like that's a big difference. If you're talking about the second half, boy, there's a lot of things going on. One is that for some time, so it's hard to judge what the second half would be like. You're not going to get me to say that it will be negative in the second half because we have plants, we think provide some overcoming to that. And for some time now, for several quarters, the sales off the van have been bigger than the sales to the man on a year-over-year basis. Now we saw some of that change towards the end of the quarter. So I don't know where it's going to go. If you want to look at it -- so from a -- I would say when you look at it from an operational point of view, do you think sooner or later, this is going to have to play out more positively. But then when you look at uncertainty, your guess is as good as mine about how the uncertainty is going to play out. It seems to me as though, like I said in my remarks, the hits just keep on common. And so does anybody think -- if you look at the uncertainty in the world that it's less uncertainty -- or is the same today as it was, say, 3 months ago? I don't think so. I don't think so. And so you hear that out of the technicians. I don't know where it's going the third quarter or the fourth quarter, it's hard to say. But I think there's some positives that would mitigate towards positivity, the things we're doing the product we're bringing out the pivots we're making. But on the other hand, if you look at the macros, it's a black hole. You don't know it's very opaque. So your guess is good as mine in that situation. All I know is the only thing I can control is to try to do the pivot to try to match what the technicians and take advantage of every opportunity we have and the message of this quarter is, is that RS&I and C&I, show that the model works in those places and I can make a lot of money and they provide good offsets. I don't know. What happened -- my view on the second quarter, you may have a different view of it might view the second quarter was, we didn't back off. We kept spending the same. We spent a little bit more [indiscernible]. More volumes. So I'm not talking that I'm going to sally forth with a lot more expenses but I'm holding the support I'm holding a support. We're doing what we do only we're adjusting it to match the current situation. I didn't mean my comments before that we're going to open the plug dates and spend a lot more. I didn't mean that. What I meant is I'm holding because I thought we were doing a pretty good job of supporting before. Now I think we held that in the second quarter. We'll probably do that again but it will be a different array versus the match to the current environment. Yes, right. Cadence was pretty, I think, consistent throughout the quarter. I think towards the end of the quarter, we had less destocking events in the last month or so. that's a positive. However, sometimes, I'll tell you, David, sometimes that happens because it's the last month. So it's hard for me to interpret whether that's a last month phenomenon that happens once in a while, not uncommonly but not all the time. It hasn't happened recently but it did happen. So maybe that's a positive. It's not for us to predict that out of the 1 month. But I think if you go back through the quarter, it was about the same levels. The relationship was the [indiscernible] except for the land. No. It's too early. And then you got too much stuff floating through July. Somebody asked me, not on the call but asked me well, are people pulling back in early July, waiting for the SFC, the responding -- we did have, like I said just a minute ago, we had the Super 7 program that rolled out and seemed to be pre well received with this full array of hand tools. We gave him a great jackpot blast the hand tools for this promotion. And that seems to get enthusiasm up and it's pretty close to expectation. I think it was the kind of sellout type of things or close to sell it. So that seemed to go okay. But that is an evidence to proclaim where the world is going. It's better than a pulp in the Iowa to sustain but you're not going to be able to -- can't extrapolate to -- it's dangerous to extrapolate out of that too much. Now I hope it is. The flood gates go up and everything is going to go well. Happy days are here again. You're thinking towards the -- if everything is in place, it gets better every Dick's got. You know what I mean, we get for every day in that situation. Because some of the capacity is in there and so the machines are there. Well, for example, we're half -- we're 50% of the expand we wanted in Flex stock in Milwaukee. So that's helping us but it's not enough. And so you've got adjustable wrenches, not enough. You've got some of the smaller ticket tool stores, not enough. So we're getting out of those. On the other hand, it's hard for me to say how much really would play out. I mean that would give you a legal boost. So, I do think you saw -- as you know, in the quarter, when you're selling small -- when you pivot to smaller kit items, you got to sell a lot of wrenches to make up a tool storage box. So it tends to put a, what I would call, a weight on your overall revenue. But I think you saw some of that in this quarter. We're trying to fill up the bucket on that but -- it's going to take us a while to do. Now, third quarter will be better than the second and the fourth quarter will be better in the first quarter after that will be better. So when the -- translating that in the revenue and profit numbers, it's hard for me to say, really hard for me to say. So I can't really put a number on it. I don't -- tell you the truth, competitors shop guys or tech never really mentioned the competitors to me. So -- but I don't know. I'm a CEO. So I'm not so sure they would I don't know. But they never really -- you go into the shop, you'll see -- you can see, I don't see any increased presence of the competitors. I will tell you that when I talk to franchisees, or I talked to our regional sales developers, we're all in here for 12 hours in a room with me. They didn't mention the competition really. I think we would say that the enemies we have are mostly uncertainty and us. So we're trying to -- the speed at which we can pivot helps some of the problem but the uncertainty will still lay over even when we fully pivoted. So you kind of got that going on. We don't see any incursion in -- that doesn't mean we don't look that headed product with a fine tooth comb and try to figure out, well, do they have something we don't have? Can people say it's better? What is their pricing, how do they deliver? How do they support what kinds of things can it do for the customer? We do that all the time. But I don't think that's part of our problem. It does appear to be. Usually, the competitors are selling to a different customer base actually. I'm bit about it. But look, I think you have to reassess how we're going -- I mean the thing is we -- I think you know our view of cash usage going forward, capital usage. And the first idea is to make sure our business is fully funded. Secondly is we look at the dividend which -- the dividend is coming up and we have paid a dividend every quarter since 1939 and we have never reduced it. So we assessed that in perpetuity -- sorry, guiding principle. But we have increased the dividend. I think now every quarter for almost 13 years, if we lease it again, it will be the 14. I'm not giving you any insight information about whether we're going to increase or go flat or anything but we'll be looking at that pretty carefully. Then we have acquisitions which we're constantly looking at -- and you've heard the story before that we have this landscape. In fact, we have guided as we speak, looking at other acquisitions. And I don't know if they'll play out or not because we're careful with our money. And then we have stock buyback which you already pointed out, as an authorization now that's a little bit less than it was before. And so we'll have to assess that as we go forward. That's how I'm thinking of it really. Well, I can tell you this. In the last 6 months, I've met with franchisees and customers in almost like in the Midwest, in the East just recently in Syracuse in Atlanta and the Southwest. And there hasn't been that much difference. That's one stretchers. I think there's uncertainty, we saw this before. I do think the grassroots economy is impacted by the uncertainty broadly and the text may be among -- maybe the techs are special because car repairs continues robust. So there are -- a lot of people are confident poor but the techs are also cash rich in that situation. So that may be that may be part of the issue. I don't see much. And I talked to our regional guys, all 9 meters were in here. Any there's some differences and we try to look at those differences and try to figure out maybe should we facilitize more. Are they -- are those operations? We haven't been able to come up with much actually. So I don't see much difference even though you would say there would be you don't really -- you get the same story from text everywhere. The tax, I don't know. I don't think the tax, the garages may be. The garages might get more regulatory compliance costs. I don't think the tax is so much. They don't mention it so much, I think. I don't hear that but I just -- small businesses, I mean the national soul change [ph] in manufacturing goes while over regulations, you know. They talk about how much it cost, they say it for every small manufacturer. So every small manufacturer has to pay $35,000 per employee per year in regulation costs. So I think by extension, you would say small businesses like garages would have that problem. But I don't think the tax [ph] would be burdened with it. You mean booming as it is, is that the. Yes, no -- [indiscernible] up double digits again. And the military has been consistently strong a cool thing is we include education in the critical industries because we believe it's critical to influence. And one of the things about it is the education business has been up nicely. And what that says is the young people are Hungary for Snap-on products. And so that's a cool thing for us. We really like that. So you see that. I don't have anything in terms of, boy, it seemed like aviation was strong this quarter and I would expect to continue -- and you have to believe, given the Boeing situation that customers in aviation would be pretty anxious to be able to have accuracy and documentation which we offer in spades in our product for that particular industry and I think that's driving some of it. I think the military is obvious. I think the military -- every nation is on edge. For example, you have countries in Europe who are looking to double their military and they're coming to us to help them upgrade to manage their fleet of claims. And so you see some of that. So I think those 2 types of general trusts are working. But you also see in general industry were strong. The overall industry is strong because I think the industry in this time is looking for efficiency and repair is efficiently, the quicker you can do it. Now the overarching thing that we're noting is that in all these industries, they're looking for customized products that will match their particular problems because the critical industries is replete with those opportunities and tasks where you have to have a particular array of products to match them. That's why the custom kitting is doing so well. We almost have not many competitors in this situation as a manufacturer. So that is really working for us. And it seems like whatever whenever we give the industrial group one way, they run the daylight and take it. So I think we're pretty good about that position, that business."

            "content": "Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $1.1794 billion [ph] in the quarter compared to $1.1913 billion [ph] last year. Reflecting a 1.1% organic sales decline and $5.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by $7.3 million of acquisition-related sales. Sales activity was similar to what we experienced in the first quarter, while our franchise van channel revenues continue to be dampened by afflicted technician confidence, our sales of repair shop owners and managers, again increased year-over-year. Encouragingly, activity with customers serving the critical industries remained robust. Consolidated gross margin of 50.6% compared to 50.7% last year, reflecting the lower sales volumes largely offset by savings from the company's RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 26.8% compared to 27.4% laser. In the quarter, as noted in our press release, operating expenses included an $11.2 million benefit for the final payments received associated with the legal matter. The 60 basis point improvement in the operating expense ratio is primarily due to the benefit from the legal payments, partially offset by the effects of lower sales volumes. Operating earnings before financial services of $280.3 million in the quarter included a benefit from the lead payments compared to $277 million in 2023. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 23.8%, including a 100 basis point benefit in the legal payments compared to 23.3% last year. Financial services revenue of $100.5 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to $93.4 million last year, while operating earnings of $70.2 million compared to $66.9 million in 2023. Consolidated operating earnings of $350.5 million which includes a legal benefit compared to $343.9 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 27.4%, including the legal payments, compared to 26.8% in 2023. Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 22.6% compared to 22.9% last year. Net earnings of $271.2 million or $5.07 per diluted share, including an $8.7 million or $0.16 per diluted share after tax benefit from the legal payments compared to $264 million or $4.89 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2023. Now, let's turn to our segment results for the quarter. Starting with the C&I group on Slide 7. Sales of $372 million compared to $364.2 million last year, reflecting a 1.2% organic sales gain and $7.3 million of acquisition-related sales, partially offset by $3.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase is primarily due to a double-digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in the segment's European-based hand tools business and a double-digit reduction in the power tools operation, the latter mostly associated with lower intersegment sales. With respect to critical industries, defense-related sales are strong as it was activity in the aviation sector. Gross margin improved 220 basis points to 41.7% in the second quarter from 39.5% in 2023. This was largely due to the increased sales volumes and the higher gross margin critical industry sector, savings from RCI initiatives and 50 basis points of benefit from acquisitions. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 150 basis points to 25% in the quarter from 23.5% in 2023, primarily due to investments in personnel and other costs and a 60 basis point impact from acquisitions. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $62.2 million compared to $58.1 million last year. The operating margin of 16.7% compared to 16% in 2023 and represented a new milestone of achievement for the segment. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $482 million compared to $543.1 million a year ago reflecting a 7.7% organic sales decline and $800,000 of unfavorable foreign currency translation. And now I guess with the last quarter, the organic decrease reflects a high single-digit decline in our U.S. business, partially offset by a low single-digit gain in our international operations. Gross margin of 48.8% in the quarter declined 20 basis points from 49% last year and that's primarily due to sales -- lower sales volumes. Operating expenses as a percent of sales rose 230 basis points to 25% in the quarter from 22.7% in 2023, largely due to the effects of lower sales volume. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $114.8 million compared to $137.7 million last year, the operating margin of 23.8% compared to 26.3% in 2023. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $454.8 million compared to $452 million in 2023, reflecting a 1% organic sales increase, partially offset by $1.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain includes a high single-digit increase in activity with OEM dealerships, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. Gross margin improved 50 basis points to 45.5% from 45% last year. primarily due to savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 20.5% improve 10 basis points from 20.6% last year. And the operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $113.6 million compared to $110.4 million last year. The operating margin of 25% compared to 24.4% reported last year. Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services increased $7.1 million or 7.6% to $100.5 million from $93.4 million last year, primarily reflecting the growth of the loan portfolio. Financial Services operating earnings of $70.2 million compared to $66.9 million in 2023. Financial services expenses were up $3.8 million from 2023 levels including $3.5 million of higher provisions for credit losses. Sequentially, the provision for credit losses was lower by $1.3 million. In the second quarter of 2024 and 2023, respective average yield on finance receivables were 17.7% and 17.6%. In the second quarter of '24 and '23, the average yield on contract receivables were 8.9% and 8.6%, respectively. Total loan originations of $308. 1 million in the second quarter represented a decrease of $18.2 million or 5.6% and from 2023 levels, primarily reflecting a high single-digit decline in extended credit originations, partially offset by higher originations of contract receivables. Consistent with the sales activity in the Snap-on Tools Group, extended credit origination to the U.S. declined and were only partially offset by growth in originations internationally. Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.5 billion of gross financing receivables with $2.2 billion from our U.S. operation. For extended credit or finance receivables, the U.S. 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.6% is up 30 basis points from the second quarter of 2023 but down 20 basis points sequentially from the 1.8% reported last quarter. Turn 12-month net losses for the overall extended credit portfolio of $58.6 million represented 2.94% [ph] of outstandings at quarter-end. Considering the current environment, we believe the delinquency in portfolio performance metrics remain relatively stable and are consistent with pre-COVID experience. Now, turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $301.1 million in the quarter represented 108% of net earnings compared to $270.3 million last year. The increase as compared to the second quarter of 2023 largely reflects decreases in working investment and higher net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $60.2 million primarily reflected net additions to finance receivables of $41.2 million and capital expenditures of $23.2 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $127.9 million included cash dividends of $98 million and the repurchase of 174,000 shares of common stock for $47.4 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $271.1 million of common stock under our existing authorization. Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivables decreased $7.8 million from 2023 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 60 days were unchanged from year-end. Inventories decreased $40.9 million from 2023 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.4 compared to 2.3 at year-end 2023. Our quarter end cash position of $1.2327 billion compared to $1.15 billion [ph] at year-end 2023. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $900 million available under our credit facilities. As of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2024. For the full year, we expect that capital expenditures will be in the range of $100 million to $110 million and we currently anticipate that our full year 2024 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 22% to 23%. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing out. Nick? The mix of activities is pretty much similar to last quarter. So no, they have not pivoted to RA transfers as a method of funding activity on demand or anything like that."

Additional information regarding these measures is included in our earnings release issued today, which can be found on our website. With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?\nNick Pinchuk: Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I'll start with the highlights of our first quarter. I'll provide my perspectives on the results, on our markets and our path ahead. After that, Aldo will give you a detailed review of the financials. We believe that our first quarter once again demonstrated Snap-on's ability to maintain its strength to engage headwinds, to manage challenges and to leverage the multiple opportunities of our markets. Looking at the results in total, we are encouraged. Like most quarters, we had turbulence from geography to geography and from operation to operation. North America was mixed, but with significant gains in critical industries. Internationally, our consolidated results were also mixed, but yielding overall positives as our operations in Europe and Asia overcame the effects of recessions in Europe and the delayed recovery in China. Now the results. First quarter sales were $1,182.3 million about flat to last year on an organic basis, excluding $6.7 million from acquisitions and $2.5 million from favorable foreign currency our sales were lower by 0.8%. OpCo OI was $270.9 million, an increase of $11.1 million and the Opco operating margin for the quarter was 22.9%, up 90 basis points. Now both those numbers benefited from the legal payment referenced in our release. But with or without that legal flow, our first quarter Opco OI and the margin were among our best. It's a strong statement given the turbulence of the day. Financial Services. Operating income grew to $68.3 million from last year's $66.3 million, and the results combined with Opco to raise our consolidated operating margin to 26.5%, up over the 25.6% recorded last year. And EPS, it was $4.91, including a per share benefit from a legal payment of $0.16, but up $0.31 or 6.7% from last year. So those are the numbers. Now let's turn to the markets and the trends we're seeing as we connect with our customers. From an overall perspective, we believe the automotive repair arena remains favorable. Vehicle OEM and dealerships continue investing in tools and equipment, preparing for the tie to new models, bringing the latest technology and drivetrains to the market. And in the quarter, our Repair Systems & Information Group, or RS&I, as we call it, expanded our reach into OEM programs and took advantage of the opportunities throughout its global footprint. And as we look forward, we see further prospects for RS&I capitalizing on that trend supplying dealerships and independent garages with just the products they need to confront the wave of modern platforms that are coming. So the shops are strong. Now let's speak of a technician. The guys and gals that twirl the wrenches, punch the keys, or tap the screens. This quarter, I have multiple occasions to visit with franchisees. And the report was generally that shops are humming, the bays are running at full capacity, and all that mirrors what the macro data says naturally. The car park is continuing to age. Now at an average of 12.5 years, and I think moving up, technician wages are rising and their hours worked are increasing. We believe it all signals ongoing and robust demand for repair. And you know it's true. The activity is strong, but there is a difference between the industry overview and the technician outlook for the future and by extension, their purchasing sentiment. The barrage of bad news, inflation, towards the border, the Red Sea, the election, the Iran bombing for the people of work, the fear of what's coming around the corner impacts the outlook and paraphrasing the characters of Dune, fear is the outlook killer. It erodes confidence. Techs are well positioned, and they continue to invest but it's in quick payback items that will make a difference right away, but don't require a long-term payment stream. And in response, we're continuing to redirect \u2013 we continue to redirect the Tools Group focus in our design efforts and our facility capacity and our selling and marketing efforts, working to match the current customer preference. So that's the auto repair. Now our Commercial and Industrial Group or what we call C&I, serving critical industries in the most international of all our groups, and in the quarter, C&I manages the difficult challenge of balancing multiple economies that are in economic turbulence. Europe now has more than half a dozen countries in technical recession. And then China \u2013 in the China environment, including the nearby countries, depending on it, they continue to struggle. India on the other hand, it's booming. Modi has the train running. So that's a positive in Asia amidst some very difficult economies. So that's the geographies. Now let's focus on the sectors. Areas like aviation continue to be strong. You don't have to read the paper very long to realize there's a significant focus on aerospace production and repair where the price for failure is high, and that arena is increasing demand for our precision torque products and for our asset control solutions to improve safety and productivity. In addition, in that sort of critical arena, custom kits, matching a set of items to a particular task it may it's an important business, especially for the military, both domestically and internationally. And with that, Critical industries is a substantial opportunity, and we are investing, expanding capacity, adding new products either organically or through the acquisitions we made over the last few years worth fortifying our runways for growth, extending outside the garage, and we know it\u2019s paying off. So overall, the quarter was favorable despite the headwinds, Tools Group pivoting, RS&I expanding with OEMs, C&I extending beyond the garage solving the critical. And the OpCo OI percentage demonstrated once again the power Snap-on\u2019s value creation processes, safety, quality, customer connection and innovation and rapid continuous improvement, developing innovative solutions that are born out of insight and observations right in the workplace. This understanding melded with RCI, helps Snap-on to once again hold fast in the turbulence of the day. Well, that's the macro overview. Now let's move to the segments. In the C&I Group, sales were $359.9 million, representing a decrease of $3.9 million or 1.1%, and that includes $6.7 million in acquisitions, acquisition-related sales, $1.4 million in unfavorable foreign currency and an organic decline of 2.5%. It all reflects higher activity with customers in critical industries, more than offset by weakness in Asia-Pacific and in our power tools. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income was $55.4 million. That was about the same as last year. The operating margin was 15.4%, up 10 basis points, and that was despite 30 basis points of headwind from currency and the acquisitions. Within the quarter, the demand for custom kits, addressing particular critical tasks remain nicely robust with increased demand for control solutions like our Automated Tool Control products. It was a nice bright spot in C&I. On the other hand, power tools was down in the quarter, but help is on the way. Tuning power tool models born out of customer connection were recently introduced, each fulfilling specific needs for \u2013 each fulfilling specific needs. For repair garages, we launched the PH3045B AirHamer. This is a tool that replicates the effect of swinging a hammer and hitting a sizzle except the device, hurdles the hammer 3,500 times a minute. Vehicles are filled with components like ball joints, wheel bearing, suspension bushings that are packed in tight fit for maximum efficiency. This assembly can be a bear. We know this from being in the garage. While with our new AirHamer, the easy-to-use retainer securely holds a chisel in place while the piston sledge hammers away. It's powerful. But at the same time, the compact two-inch barrel \u2013 the two-inch barrel enables the access in tight spaces, delivering tremendous power, speed and energy with unlimited run time. It's a real productivity enhancer, but the essential feature born out of watching the technicians in the shop is the best-in-class vibration reduction, created by special elastomer shocks, allowing the mechanic to pound away at these suspension components without fatigue or paying, no more store arms from hammer work. The new hammer was introduced late in the quarter and techs have already noticed. Also on power tools, our cordless portfolio expanded with the introduction of a new 18-volt nibbler designed for collision repair and metal fabrication. It's a big time saver. It speeds up work that once involve hand shears or other devices, help technicians cut any free-form shake conceivable out of tough sheet metal. Again, the design resulted from customer connection from watching the tech struggle with shears. Our new nibbler makes a big difference when cutting in defenders extracting a damaged panel or cutting a ceiling of a car accommodating installation of a sunroof or creating a place anywhere in the vehicle for placing emergency lighting, shining away for first responders. I have to tell you, I have to tell you, we are encouraged by these innovative new products. And by all the others we're planning to introduce as the days go forward. We know work and they all will make a difference right away. C&I, a quarter confronted with international headwinds, strong momentum in domestic markets, led by critical industries, extending out of the garage with growing strength. Now let's talk about the Tools Group. The first quarter for the Tools Group was below our standard. However, we do remain confident, and we do see a pivot to focus on quick payback items registering a positive momentum and movement. Sales in the quarter were $500.1 million, including \u2013 reflected an organic decrease \u2013 including an organic decrease or reflecting an organic decrease of 7%. The Group's operating income margin was 23.5%, down 100 basis points. Notably, gross margin in the quarter rose 90 basis points, reaching 48.2%. You see shorter payback margins aren't shorter on profitability. During the quarter, we worked to redirect our plants, guide our franchisees to innovate solutions that drive productivity, and we kept engaging our customer connection, observing the task executed in the bay and using the insights to design and deploy innovative and focused products offerings that are dedicated to making work easier, like two new products, just engineers \u2013 just engineered to address time-consuming tasks where simple repairs are made complex by limited \u2013 made complex by limited accessibility or by seized components that slow the work to a snail's pace. You can see it in the garage. For instance, on General Motors, 6L80 and 8L90 transmissions, the valve body bolts are obstructed by the exhaust set up, making it very taxing to do this job with a standard ratchet or socket combination. We were in some \u2013 we were in some of those GM garages and observed the problem firsthand, classic customer connection. And the innovation that followed in our quarter-inch drive Torx Plus EPL-10 low-profile inverted socket. That's a mouthful. That innovation was released in the first quarter, and it does make GM transmission work easier. The new cushion design precisely maneuver \u2013 the new custom design precisely maneuvers between the exhaust assembly and the transmission engaging the fastener in such a way that provides enough clearance for a ratcheting box or a box-end wrench or a hand ratchet to access the bolts for easy removal with no exhaust disassembly require saving more than 45 minutes per repair right away. Techs working on GM transmissions can complete more work with this device and make more money. They can do that right away, quick payback. Another example we saw, another example of that was we saw that removing the brake caliber pins on Toyota trucks and sports utilities was very difficult. The pins on 4Runners, Tacomas and Tundras are exposed to harsh road environments, often causing the parts to become immovable, regularly requiring like heat or excessive force to free the restricted fasteners. And each of those methods requires time and it raises the risk of damage to nearby components often elevating the complexity of the repair, taking a lot more time, watching the work. Our engineers produced a unique punch like bit that precisely aligned to an air hammer with the dimensions of the pin, maximizing the extraction force without endangering the surrounding systems. Once again, simplifying the task and freeing the tech to move on to other jobs. It's another quick payback item that's now available and popular. Finally in the quarter, we expanded our only \u2013 the only U.S.-made locking plier lineup by releasing two new models, the LP5LN constructed with a tapered nose. It's ideal for additional reach inside compliance space to easily access narrow workpieces. And the new LP5WC delivering a reliable gripping power is difficult to engage round objects like hoses. Beyond the special features of those two models, the full line offers our subcompact six-inch plier line offers increased accessibility and \u2013 because it's small enabling text to maneuver and crowded engine compartments and under the dash. The design also provides unmatched clamping forces, that locking pliers, unmatched clamping forces that will not slip under load with the locking mechanism. The pliers also serve as a second pair of hands. They're going to lock them up \u2013 locking up, holding materials, securely in place, freeing up the technician's hands to complete another step in the repair. And each unit, each of those locking plier units is forged and produced on our Elkmont, Alabama plant, and they're the only locking models made in the U.S. Well, that is the Tools Group, pivoting to match the technician's current preferences and needs, wielding our customer connections, deploying solutions that improve efficiency by making tasks easier. Now RS&I. The RS&I Group's results confirmed, I think, what we've been saying all along, Snap-on is well positioned to support repair shops, both dealers and the vast networks of independent shops. And in that regard, RS&I sales in the quarter were $463.8 million, up $17.2 million or 3.9% versus last year with an organic sales increase of 3.3%. Operating earnings for the group reached $112.9 million, reflecting an increase of $8.3 million or 7.9% versus last year. The operating income margin was 24.3%, rising by 90 basis points, a powerful performance driven by OEM-related activity and sales in undercar, helping shops prepare for new technologies. In terms of OEM-related activity and sales in undercar helping shops prepare for new technologies and enabling system upgrades in the growing collision market. We continue to seek to clearly see abundant runways for growth in RS&I, and we're working to take advantage. One example of that is the launch of our new heavy-duty repair information software. This package combines the vehicle interface capabilities of our NEXIQ heavy-duty diagnostic units with the horsepower of our Mitchell 1 information database. It's an innovative solution for repair and heavy-duty industry, which over the past decade has seen an explosion of new technologies relating to sophisticated emission control along with advanced computer and electrical networks that all combines to present heavy mechanics with complex and complicated repair tasks. Now the solutions \u2013 now with solutions all located in one spot, tests can search by VIN number and access operating specification, troubleshooting tips and interactive wiring diagrams, all be specific to the particular vehicle, all big time savers and existing products was deployed in the quarter, and it's a groundbreaking integrated platform. The combined diagnostic capability together with vehicle information, it's very powerful. And I can tell you, the heavy-duty industry has noticed. You can see it in the RS&I numbers. And in the quarter, our Diagnostics division also released its latest 24.2 software upgrade, expanding our broad range of vehicle coverage and test procedures throughout all our existing hardware. The new upgrade strengthens our already market-leading data positions. Technicians get access to our SureTrack vehicle-specific real fixes, repair tips and commonly replaced parts, all derived from our proprietary database of 2.7 billion repair actions and 355 billion data records unmatched insight, not only to interpret what the vehicle trouble codes are saying but to uniquely use the information to determine the exact problem, analyzing millions of data lines per car, predicting the most likely repair. Snap-on uniquely provides this capability. And in this latest update, we continue adding new models and functionalities, making our proprietary software position even more effective and more powerful. We\u2019re confident in the strength of RS&I. And we keep driving to expand its position with repair shop owners and managers to make \u2013 by making work easier with more and more great new products. Well, that\u2019s Snap-on\u2019s first quarter, sales flat, overcoming the significant headwinds, critical industries advancing, again, the tools group pivoting, matching the preference for quick payback products. OEM undercar repair information markets are remaining robust. The Opco OI margin, 22.9%, up 90 basis points and an EPS of $4.91, strong results that overcame the headwinds and benefited from a legal outcome. All demonstrating the strength in the midst of turbulence, it was an encouraging quarter. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?\nAldo Pagliari: Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $1,182.3 million in the quarter compared to $1,183 million last year, reflecting an 0.8% organic sales decline, partially offset by $6.7 million of acquisition-related sales and $2.5 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Activity in our automotive repair markets was mixed, gains in sales to OEM and independent shop owners and managers were more than offset by lower sales to technicians through our franchise van channel. Within the industrial sector for our C&I group, sales to customers in critical industries were up mid-single digits in the quarter as compared to last year. Consolidated gross margin of 50.5% improved 70 basis points from 49.8% last year, primarily reflecting benefits from lower material and other costs and savings from the company\u2019s RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 27.6% compared to 27.8% last year. In the quarter, as noted in our press release, operating expenses included an $11.3 million benefit for payments received associated with the legal matter. The 20 basis point improvement in the operating expense ratio is primarily due to the benefit from the legal payment partially offset by increased personnel and other costs, which includes a 20 basis point impact from acquisitions. Operating earnings before financial services of $270.9 million in the quarter, including the benefit from the legal payment compared to $259.8 million in 2023. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 22.9% compared to 22% last year. Financial services revenue of $99.6 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $92.6 million last year, while operating earnings of $68.3 million compared to $66.3 million in 2023. Consolidated operating earnings of $339.2 million, which included the legal benefit compared to $326.1 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 26.5% compared to 25.6% in 2023. Our first quarter effective income tax rate of 22.2% compared to 23.1% last year. Net earnings of $263.5 million or $4.91 per diluted share, including an $8.8 million or $0.16 per diluted share after tax benefit from the legal payment compared to $248.7 million or $4.60 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2023. Now, let\u2019s turn to our segment results for the quarter, starting with the C&I group on Slide 7. Sales of $359.9 million compared to $363.8 million last year, reflecting a 2.5% organic sales decline and a $1.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by $6.7 million of acquisition-related sales. The organic decrease is primarily due to a double-digit reduction in the power tools business and a high-single digit decline in the segment\u2019s Asia-Pacific operations mostly associated with lower intersegment sales. These declines were partially offset by a mid-single digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries. With respect to critical industries, military and defense related sales were robust as was activity in the aviation sector. Gross margin improved 200 basis points to 40.8% in the first quarter from 38.8% in 2023. This is largely due to increased volumes and the higher gross margin critical industry sector. Lower material costs and other cost savings from RCI initiatives and 50 basis points from the benefit of acquisitions. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 190 basis points to 25.4% in the quarter from 23.5% in 2023 primarily due to the effects of lower sales volumes, investments in personnel and other costs and a 70 basis point impact from acquisitions. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $55.4 million compared to $55.8 million last year. The operating margin of 15.4% compared to 15.3% in 2023. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $500.1 million compared to $537 million a year ago, reflecting a 7% organic sales decline, partially offset by $600,000 of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic decrease reflects a high single-digit decline in our U.S. business, partially offset by a mid-single digit gain in our international operations. Gross margin improved 90 basis points to 48.2% in the quarter from 47.3% last year. This improvement primarily reflects decreased sales of lower gross margin products. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 190 basis points to 24.7% in the quarter from 22.8% in 2023, largely due to the lower sales volume. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $117.3 million compared to $131.7 million last year. The operating margin of 23.5% compared to 24.5% in 2023. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $463.8 million compared to $446.6 million in 2023 reflecting a 3.3% organic sales gain and $2.5 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase includes a high-single digit increase in activity with OEM dealerships and a low-single digit gain in sales of undercar equipment. Gross margin improved 150 basis points to 45% from 43.5% last year, primarily due to benefits from lower material and other costs and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 60 basis points to 20.7% from 20.1% last year primarily reflecting increased personnel and other costs. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $112.9 million compared to $104.6 million last year, the operating margin of 24.3% compared to 23.4% reported last year. Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services increased $7 million or 7.6% to $99.6 million from $92.6 million last year, primarily reflecting growth of the loan portfolio. Financial Services operating earnings of $68.3 million compared to $66.3 million in 2023. Financial services expenses were up $5 million from 2023 levels, including $4.3 million of higher provisions for credit losses. In the first quarters of both 2024 and 2023, the average yield on finance receivables was 17.7%. In the first quarter of 2024 and 2023, the average yields on contract receivables were 9% and 8.7%, respectively. Total loan originations of $301.7 million in the first quarter represented an increase of $800,000 or 0.3% from 2023 levels. Increased originations of contract receivables were mostly offset by a low single-digit decline in extended credit originations. Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.5 billion of gross financing receivables, with $2.2 billion from our U.S. operation. For extended credit or finance receivables, the U.S. 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.8% is up 30 basis points from the first quarter of 2023, but unchanged from the rate reported last quarter. Trailing 12-month net losses for the overall extended credit portfolio of $54.1 million, representing 2.75% of outstandings at quarter end, which is up 16 basis points from the end of last quarter. Considering the current environment and despite these slight upward trends, we believe the delinquency and portfolio performance metrics remain relatively stable. Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $348.7 million in the quarter represented 129% of net earnings and compared to $301.6 million last year. The improvement as compared to the first quarter of 2023 largely reflects lower year-over-year increases in working investment, which included a reduction in inventory during the quarter as well as higher net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $63.2 million primarily reflected net additions to finance receivables of $40.2 million and capital expenditures of $21.8 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $164.2 million included cash dividends of $98.2 million and the repurchase of 248,000 shares of common stock for $70.2 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $290.6 million of common stock under our existing authorizations. Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $36.2 million from 2023 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 63 days compared to 60 days as of year-end and to 62 days as of the end of the first quarter of 2023. Inventories decreased $35.4 million from 2023 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.4 compared to 2.3 at year-end 2023. Our quarter end cash position of $1,121 million compared to $1,001.5 million at year-end 2023. Our net debt to capital ratio of 1.5% compared to 3.8% at year-end 2023. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $900 million available under our credit facilities. As of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2024. With respect to corporate expenses, in the second quarter, we believe we could benefit from a legal payment similar to that received in the first quarter. For the full year, we expect that capital expenditures will be in a range of $100 million to $110 million, and we currently anticipate that our full year 2024 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 22% to 23%. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?\nNick Pinchuk: Thanks, Alan. Well, that's the first quarter. Strength in the midst of turbulence. Even with a part of the enterprise below standard, you see Snap-on is a business that reaches varied customers in different industries and in various geographies united in a coherence that is the criticality of work, the essential nature of what we do. And we have the opportunity and advantage \u2013 we have opportunity and advantage in virtually all of those arenas. And as a consequence, even when the largest of our entities is not a standard, we find a way in other areas to maintain overall strength. It's that coherent strategic breadth and the experience and capability of our team to execute that has made Snap-on so resilient, moving consistently upwards for all these years, and this quarter was another demonstration of that resilience. C&I, engaging economic challenges across geographies, extending to critical industries, proving that Snap-on can roll out of the garage, exploiting a considerable opportunity and do it profitably. The Tools Group acting to adapt, committing to accommodate the tech's certain outlook and their preference for quick payback products and doing it with still enviable margins. In fact, with gross margins up 90 basis points showing the promise of their pivot. RS&I, seeing opportunities with repair shop owners and managers and making the most of it despite the challenges in Europe, volume and margins growing in a very imperfect environment and the credit company, working against the grain of short payback preferences and still raising profit. And it all came together to keep activity flat despite the difficulty to register an Opco operating margin of 22.9%, up 90 basis points and to record an EPS of $4.91, numbers that are among our strongest ever results with or without the legal benefit. And as such, we look ahead with confidence, fortified by our inherent advantages in our product, deep, wide and growing, solving more critical tasks every day, advantages in our brand. Snap-on is the outward sign of pride, working men and women taking their jobs and advantage in our people, committed, capable turbulence tested many times a team that knows how to ring the positive out of the difficult and fueled by those advantages, we believe Snap-on will maintain its strength, moving positively throughout the 2024 and well beyond. Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I\u2019ll speak directly to our franchisees and associates worldwide. The first quarter was a resilient and robust demonstration of Snap-on strength against challenge. And it all reflects your extraordinary effort to make it sold. For your contributions to the results, you have my congratulations. For the special capabilities you bring to bear on behalf of our team every day, you have my admiration. And for the unshakable belief you consistently display in our future, you have my thanks. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Scott Stember with Roth MKM. Please go ahead.\nScott Stember: Good morning and thanks for taking my questions.\nNick Pinchuk: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Stember: Nick, it sounds like within tools that power tools was the weakest. Could you maybe quantify that how much? And maybe just talk about how the other sub-segments like tool storage, diagnostics and hand tools it?\nNick Pinchuk: Power tools was down. The most interesting thing, power tools, I hate to say tough comparison. They did have a difficult comparison year-over-year. Last year was one of the bigger quarters. It actually was up sequentially. So we saw some movement there and the pivot towards shorter payback items versus where we were in the fourth quarter. I think that was certainly down the biggest and as I think Aldo said, it was down double digits. Diagnostics was down, but the \u2013 one of the things that that did help the profitability was the fact that tool storage was up and hand tools wasn\u2019t as afflicted as the others. And so therefore, what the Tools Group actually makes, remember that in the array of products, the Tools Group for tool storage and hand tools get both distribution and manufacturer\u2019s margin. So that really is what describes the product of array. It was kind of \u2013 when we look at it, we can see the effects of pivoting. Tool storage was up, but it was in what we would call the lower end. We\u2019re kind of pleased with it because we worked hard on the Algona plant, trying to do this pivot to get more capacity in the accessory and in the classic line in the carts and the accessories in the classic had big quarters, and those are the lower cost items, which people don\u2019t get as embroiled and longer payback. So we\u2019re kind of pleased with that. And hand tools, I showed you some of the arrays out of customer connection that we rolled out and we\u2019re rolling out more going forward.\nScott Stember: So some of the two new power tools that you referred to you said help is on the way. When do you think we\u2019ll start seeing this? Is this starting to shift or the\u2026\nNick Pinchuk: We bought some of that in the quarter toward the end of the quarter. The way the two played out, things got better. I think sales up through demand got better as the quarter went on. So we kind of had some momentum. I hate to overplay that because I\u2019ve seen \u2013 I\u2019ve been here a while. I see all kinds of calibrations from quarter-to-quarter. The end did have Easter this year, still it looked pretty good. So I think we\u2019re kind of encouraged by that. And what I meant by that was, I like those two that I brought out. We brought out other ones, and we have an array of new ones coming out in the second quarter around power tools. So I think what I meant there is help is on the way as we had \u2013 we introduced in the quarter, a couple of things plus others, because those two I mentioned, plus we\u2019ve got others coming.\nScott Stember: Got it. And just last question. If you were to take out the intercompany pressure in RS&I and C&I, what were the external sales? How did they do in both of those segments in the quarter?\nNick Pinchuk: Yes. Look, it\u2019s \u2013 if you look at it organically without currency and acquisitions, which would raise the numbers actually, with just apples-to-apples, C&I was up 2.2% externally. And I think RS&I was up almost 6%, 5.8%. So RS&I was pretty good right in our \u2013 right where we expect them to be all the time. So RS&I really had a pretty good quarter. And actually, given Europe, seven countries in recession and so you see this kind of thing. I think the hand tools business in Europe was kind of in defile. And so the other businesses went pretty well, so we\u2019re pretty pleased with those businesses.\nScott Stember: Got it. That\u2019s all I have for now. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Glynn: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Nick, nice descriptions on the NPIs. I was actually lagging a bit because had that issue with the \u2013 I think, the caliper pins on my Sequoia last time I fixed the break. So I don\u2019t think the Sequoia was on your list, but you can add it.\nNick Pinchuk: [Indiscernible] things that sell. When we talk about short payback items, these guys can see the tool and say, hey, I\u2019ve spent a dog\u2019s age fixing these things and this helps. So I think it works out okay for us. Yes.\nChristopher Glynn: I was wondering if you could contrast, share some thoughts on the kind of decent strength from repair shops with an auto repair umbrella versus the technicians having some confidence?\nNick Pinchuk: Look, we've seen it before. We actually saw in the financial recession, the Great Financial Recession back what, more than 10 years ago. And the COVID is the COVID that the shops weren't down that much. They were down for a few weeks and then they figure out what to do, and they were humming in both situations. But the technicians were confidence poor; they didn't know where the world was going. So if you remember, I think it's approximately in the beginning of the COVID, we had the recoveries coming out when we had that V-shaped recovery in the third and fourth quarter, that was driven a lot by handfuls. Small payback and small payback items, short payback items. And so that's what they do. They kind of say, I don't know \u2013 it's very interesting. Financial economy, we have all these calculations. The people have worked think they get up every morning and they see the news for breakfast. And enough of it is bad, they start to lose confidence. And so that's what they're saying. They're saying \u2013 they're thinking, geez, I don't know, where are these wars are going to go? They're going to start raising taxes, our kids going to have to fight. The border seems to be a migration, all those things, and they start saying, \"Well, I'm not \u2013 I know I'm doing good now. But I'm not sure what's going to happen in the future. They don't think in terms of soft landing, hard landing. I'm not sure what's going to happen in the future. So they don't want to get them ourselves out in traffic. Sometimes the narrative about everyday working people is that they're propagating and borrow in bad times. That's not been my experience. These people are pretty much.\nChristopher Glynn: Okay. And sticking with those techs, so maybe we're seeing the lag effect of inflation and rates a bit here on small private operators and you're focused on pivoting the focus to match the faster payback. Should we basically figure you need a couple of quarters to align that as you or the organizational.\nNick Pinchuk: I don't know. Certainly, I'm tasking the Tools Group to do it at light speed, and we are working on it with alacrity it is an unknowable amount because what happens is as you move your capacity around in the factors actually refocus your capacity, no matter how much you start putting that thing, you start \u2013 you start sticking yourself back, you set up more cash to deliver. And sometimes that can be a problem. We despite the number, the number was worse from a, I think, a little bit in the quarter, but we saw progress there. We saw the characteristic shifting. And so we think that's going to work for us because we've seen it work before. I don't know how long that will take. Certainly, we expected to see improvement as we go forward. What the rates of that improvement are, I cannot tell.\nChristopher Glynn: Makes sense. Thank you, Nick.\nOperator: The next question is from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.\nDavid MacGregor: Yes, good morning everyone.\nNick Pinchuk: Hey David.\nDavid MacGregor: Good morning, Nick. I guess based on our work, we expected the weaker confidence in technicians, but we also know you were more promotional than normal in the first quarter with the regional kickoffs and the follow-ons. And clearly, franchisees were not responding to those elevated promotional levels to the extent we thought. I guess going forward, do you raise further the promotional discounts and incentives \u2013 can you restore growth in the Tools segment in 2024? Or are we looking at the segment continuing at a negative mid-single-digit pace through the balance of the year. It sounded like your answer to the last question was kind of a more passive approach where you just have to wait and see how things play out as opposed to maybe taking more active initiatives?\nNick Pinchuk: I don't know if I accept your first premise that we were more pragmatic in our promotions in the first quarter than usual. I don't know that to be true. David, though, I'm not reviewing every promotion all the time either. So I couldn't sit here and review them at all. I don't think so though. I don't think \u2013 our view is like this. The real solution to it is, is the pivot. And the more of these small products, these short payback products, and they're profitable, that we get out, the more sales we'll have, I think trying to promote against the wins like corn water up a rope. And so we're not going to do that. We're not going to do that. I'm not that desperate \u2013 you know what I mean? I mean, look, this is a quarter, okay. The quarter is substandard, but we expect improvement. And oh, by the way, I think our margins are still enviable. So I'm not going to \u2013 we're not going to go \u2013 I'm not saying we won't have good promotions. That's not what I'm saying. But I'm saying we're not going to get our hair on fire on this in the promotion line. We will get our hair on fire and trying to pivot designing short payback items, altering the capacity in the factory and having our people in sales work more on \u2013 put more energy into getting our franchisees, how are you going to sell these shorter payback items. Sure. If somebody wants to buy an epic we'll be happy to comment them. But that's what I'm talking about here. I don't think we're going to be promoted any more than normal, any different than normal. Let's put it that way except maybe to focus promotions on maybe some short payback items to try to give people some energy around it. Promotions aren't actually say, but promotions aren't necessarily cost reductions, although they appear to be sometimes price reduction, sometimes it's just about creating energy and focus.\nDavid MacGregor: I'm pretty certain that your post regional kickoff promotions were up year-over-year versus last year. But I can follow up with you offline on that.\nNick Pinchuk: I'm not saying it wrong, David. I'm just saying I'm not aware \u2013 I don't feel like we are frenetic about it. That's all. I don't talk to the wrong guy, if you think I'm following every promotion. I don't. But the envelope, I kind of described to you, we expect to follow.\nDavid MacGregor: Yes. Just a couple of follow-up questions, Nick. Can you talk about the progress you made this quarter with the incremental manufacturing capacity and maybe the extent to which that increased ability to ship provided a partial offset to the negative top line?\nNick Pinchuk: Well, I don\u2019t know about the volumes, but we certainly got out what we \u2013 I liked what happened in Algona, David, the full storage plan. It seemed as though Algona, which had been pounding away on it for a long time as I know you\u2019re very well aware, had made pretty good progress. I think we\u2019re a little behind that in, say, like Elizabethton and [indiscernible] certainly Milwaukee in terms of the handful plant. It may be a little more difficult to create the changes and create the pivot. So I was pleased with what happened. And I don\u2019t know, though not so much liquidation. I don\u2019t think there was that much of that. I think that would have been helped in the fourth quarter some too. So I don\u2019t know. Not really a big factor in the situation.\nDavid MacGregor: Okay. This last quarter, you had some inventory putback from franchisee attrition that contributed to the negative growth. Was franchisee attrition up again this quarter? And was the inventory put back again to source of negative growth?\nNick Pinchuk: I would say there was inventory put back. But maybe a little bit less than about the same, I suppose, is the fourth quarter, maybe not quite the same. So we didn\u2019t see quite because what happens is I think the phenomenon there, Dave, is David, is that remember, I said that everybody was like they were white hot coming out of the SFC and then all of a sudden, everybody is starting to get a little nervous and that caused a little more put back. I don\u2019t think we had that transition piece in this period. So that probably ended up not having as much put back.\nDavid MacGregor: Okay. And the last question for me, just on credit. I guess I\u2019m trying to make sense of the flat originations, given the \u2013 it sounds like the Diagnostics business, in particular, might be pretty weak. How much of that would you think was just kind of revolving account transfers and what\u2019s changing in terms of these?\nNick Pinchuk: I don\u2019t think much \u2013 I don\u2019t think\u2026\nDavid MacGregor: Not much?\nNick Pinchuk: We will watch that. I\u2019m pretty sure I know that didn\u2019t change.\nAldo Pagliari: It\u2019s actually lower and lower.\nDavid MacGregor: Okay.\nNick Pinchuk: Not really impacted.\nDavid MacGregor: It\u2019s down, okay, down. What\u2019s changing in terms of the EC approval rates? And I guess you mentioned EC, your originations were down low single digits. I\u2019m just guessing overall credit penetration rates are directionally lower. Can you just talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing in credit trends? Your provisioning was up $4 million.\nAldo Pagliari: I don\u2019t think the penetration rates are dipping at all. I think what Nick has described as lower sales of big ticket items. And if there\u2019s lower big ticket items, then there\u2019s lower EC originations, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything dramatic in terms of a shift of any sort in terms of how the Snap-on Credit is participating in the sales of the Tools Group.\nNick Pinchuk: If it helps, David, remember the small \u2013 faster payback items. So in diagnostics, diagnostics was down, but the smaller and SOLUS+ was strong in the quarter, and that doesn\u2019t get EC as much as, say, Snap-on ZEUS [ph]. So some of that\u2019s in that situation. But not really much change. I do that, EC doesn\u2019t necessarily follow directly to the activity. Okay.\nDavid MacGregor: Right. Good. Thanks very much gentlemen.\nOperator: The next question is from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Please go ahead.\nGary Prestopino: Hi and good morning all.\nNick Pinchuk: Good morning, Gary.\nGary Prestopino: Nick, can you maybe \u2013 could you maybe just help me out here? I mean, the market for repair \u2013 auto repairs is very strong. Sometimes takes longer than you would expect to get your car repaired, even on the collision side.\nNick Pinchuk: I agree.\nGary Prestopino: But yet you\u2019re saying your power tools are down and diagnostics down. Don\u2019t the technicians really need to have these products in order to do their jobs correctly and efficiently and quickly. So I guess what I\u2019m asking is, is this just really a function of maybe what\u2019s going on with the Tools Group is that your diagnostic products have kind of permeated the channel, and there\u2019s not a lack of demand that is maybe being driven by the fact that everybody\u2019s needs have been taken care of. And then on the other side, the power tools, maybe there\u2019s just hasn\u2019t been the opportunity to innovate as much as you had maybe last year to drive growth? I\u2019m just trying to square all this together.\nNick Pinchuk: Look, I think the thing is you could, in diagnostics, we did sell the quicker payback items, the SOLUS+. It was the big ticket ones like ZEUS which is quite a bit more expensive that didn\u2019t sell. In power tools, yes, it can be \u2013 it can follow very strongly what\u2019s introduced in a certain period. At time, the power tools, I think, looks worse than it is, like I said, it was up sequentially with some reasonable gains. So I think we see progress in the power tools. So I do think \u2013 I don\u2019t think we\u2019re seeing that. We\u2019ve seen it before where technicians will focus on things they have an array of things they want to buy from Snap-on. And often, when they\u2019re confronted with this, they make a transition to say, well, where \u2013 how can I \u2013 I want to see the world play out a little bit more. I\u2019ll buy this wrench or I\u2019ll buy this smaller box or I\u2019ll buy a small diagnostic or I\u2019ll maybe hold on to my power tool a little bit longer. People need the products, but on the other hand, it is an imprecise thing. Sometimes they\u2019ll say, okay, I need a particular power tool or a diagnostics because I had trouble last week on this particular on some Toyota or maybe on a BMW. And they'll say, \"Well, I'll wait a little while because I won't see another BMW for a month or two or a quarter three or four months. You'll see that it's an imprecise situation. Simply, our view of it is more \u2013 it's always influenced by product, about the new stuff that rolls out, it's a complex array. But what's happening, at least as far as we can report and I've talked to a lot of guys is that technicians \u2013 one guy in Northern California said the techs are scared. Another guy talked to in Kentucky \u2013 [indiscernible], Kentucky said they're getting involved in the everyday news. It's weighing them down. I got another guy in Nevada and Reno, we said, they're assessing over the election. So I'm telling you, this is kind of a \u2013 it's sort of saying, where is the environment going to go? I'm going to keep my powder dry for a while. I'm going to just take it bit-by-bit, I don't want to take a big bite \u2013 so when they want to figure out how to repair cars, they don't take a big bite.\nGary Prestopino: All right. And then I guess the last \u2013 you had mentioned that this had happened before, I think, in The Great Recession.\nNick Pinchuk: And in the COVID \u2013 Gary and in the COVID.\nGary Prestopino: So how long did this take to flesh out? Was this a couple of quarter phenomenon?\nNick Pinchuk: In the COVID, I would say it took three quarters, maybe two quarters for people to get used, and basically that was driven more by the \u2013 we're talking about attitude. It took about two quarters, maybe 2.5 quarters for them to say, \"Oh, the all clear is blowing\". Nothing is really going to happen. We're out of the COVID and the great financial recession is a little longer. But it all depends on how use they get to it. Now we help this by pivoting. Remember that in this situation, we help by giving them more small bites. So some of this has to do with matching the product \u2013 the new product available that's analyzing them with stuffs they're willing to take on, and that's what we're doing.\nGary Prestopino: Okay. Yes. Thank you.\nNick Pinchuk: Certainly.\nOperator: The next question is from Luke Junk with Baird. Pleaser go ahead.\nNick Pinchuk: Hey Luke.\nLuke Junk: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just pivoting on that last point there, Nick, just trying to get a feel for your gut of how much you think is under your control as you make this pivot and like you said, just matching new products with where the demand is right now in terms of I guess I'd be interested to get your perspective on the last six months. Just how much that feedback has changed of what mechanics want? And to what extent are the franchisees able to kind of give you demand clues or is it more about kind of pushing the right products to the franchisees and helping to market the products?\nNick Pinchuk: No. No. No. Demand clues. I mean, fundamentally, it's on a macro basis, Luke, I don't know if it's six months. So this sort of started sometime in October. I don't know how long it is. But the thing is, is that it's pretty much about what people will say, if I buy this now, I can get a payback now, and I don't get committed for longer terms. So I'm not \u2013 that's a description in general. Of course, everything I'd say about the technicians probably doesn't apply to every technician and every garage is probably a great landscape for this. But that's simply what we're doing. And so we're getting feedback from the franchisees on this and we're doing a lot of customer connection on it. I'm talking to franchisees all the time. We'll have the NFAC in here in about four weeks. I'll talk to them about it. We're making a lot of cost. So we're getting feedback from those guys, and we have pretty good feedback right now. We know where we're trying to go. And so that we believe that will work for us. Of course, it all won't work but once we execute on that, then we'll iterate to hone in. Now how long that takes. And as I said before, I think our view is our standard is to keep improving I'm not so sure how quickly. But I do think we have the capacity to do it, and we've done it before.\nLuke Junk: And then maybe a question on RS&I if I can sneak it in, just the expanded opportunity right now seeing with OEM dealerships, especially kind of new technologies and new things coming into the market. Just that seems more of a secular opportunity. I mean, do you see the opportunity is any different versus this business historically either in kind of the scope of the opportunity or even the margin opportunity maybe?\nNick Pinchuk: Look, I think three things about RS&I. One is that you've got \u2013 you've got the opportunity associated with the number of new models people are launched. And I thought a slant guy on TV about a month ago, he was talked about 30 new models. I don't know how we're going to get all of those. But every time a new model comes out, this is a good business for us. And every time they have a warranty kind of recall and stuff like that, and that business has been pretty good now for some time. It was up nicely in the quarter, double digits, and the profitability is strong now, so that's a good bit. And so that's a unique at this point, and I think it will keep going as the technologies keep changing. Then you see the equipment business. The equipment business wasn't \u2013 it was off, but it wasn't as strongly up because Europe was pummeled by the equipment business. Those recessionary businesses in Europe. I mean, Germany being a recession was a big blow for us in this situation. And so that was harder. That will come back. But it does have the collision business and the equipment business in North America, all of which are booming. And those are nice margins. The margin was up in that business. So that's fueling some of it. And then our software keeps doing pretty well. We talked about the heavy-duty software. And we did have this legal benefit, which was in this ore, and it confirms the proprietary nature of our database. So I think that's \u2013 all those things are better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick.\nLuke Junk: I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks, Nick.\nNick Pinchuk: Okay.\nOperator: The next question is from Sherif El-Sabbahy with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nSherif El-Sabbahy: Hey, good morning.\nNick Pinchuk: Sherif, how are you?\nSherif El-Sabbahy: Doing well. Thanks. And thanks for all the great color you provided. I just had one small specific question. Just within power tools, are there any specific markets or end users that saw an outsized pullback or drove the decline year-over-year?\nNick Pinchuk: Say that again, please. Sorry.\nSherif El-Sabbahy: Are there any specific markets or end uses for power tools that saw an outsized pullback or stood out when you were kind of looking at the numbers?\nNick Pinchuk: No, I don't think so. I think there is a constant movement between pneumatic and cordless in the power tools or a lot of people are converting to cordless. Not everything can be converted to cordless because people want to have continuous power and of course, the pneumatic will keep going. So if you're doing something over and over, sometimes people prefer pneumatic guns, because they don't run out of battery and they're lighter and all that stuff. So if you have a repetitive situations. But there's a general motion to cordless \u2013 we haven't seen any \u2013 if you look at the nature of the product line, products and power tools, what you see is sales that follow introduction of new products. Every time we bring out a new product, that tends to raise that particular category. I haven't seen much of a particular pullback. I think the need for power tools in industrial settings in critical industry settings remains moving at pace in the garage is less so because of the aforementioned uncertainty. That's all. That's the only color I can add in that situation.\nSherif El-Sabbahy: Thank you. Appreciated it.\nNick Pinchuk: Sure.\nOperator: The next question is from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nBret Jordan: Hey good morning guys. Don't think we've touched on the sell-in versus sell-out on the U.S. franchise tools. Do you have any color as far as what their POS looked like versus their take rate?\nNick Pinchuk: I'm not sure what you mean by point of sale. Okay. Yes. Look, sell off the van was better than our sell to the van this quarter particularly towards the end. So that's \u2013 we sold \u2013 our franchisees sold more of their vans than they bought in this situation \u2013 and that gap expanded a little bit as we went forward in the quarter.\nBret Jordan: And I guess the sellout rate, how do you think that compares to the general market growth rate. I guess, do you think you're keeping up from a market share standpoint? Or is there any \u2013 shift there?\nNick Pinchuk: No. I don't know, you may have a better view. Look, if you talked \u2013 I just talked \u2013 I talked \u2013 we talked to 36 franchisees and none of them mentioned I'm losing share. Nobody mentioned I'm losing share. So I don't think that's happening. And although these are windshield surveys and not based on data. But they don't seem to be in that situation. They can say, their view is, well, tougher to sell because people aren't buying, I don't have the big ticket items I used to sell and that carves down my product line that I can get to people to move on.\nBret Jordan: Okay. There seem there will be a little gap between \u2013 with the Matco numbers at the end of last year. So we're not commenting about Matco becoming more aggressive as far as pushing their volume.\nNick Pinchuk: Nobody's saying that I don't know. The Matco guys are smart guys. They may be able to \u2013 they may have some magic at, we don't know. But every place, it's hard to \u2013 what we found is we never really paid too much view of that over one quarter, those things go up and down. So I don't know. I can't really comment on their business, but I'm not hearing anything from our franchisees that would indicate that's a problem for us. Generally, we think that we sell to different people anyway.\nBret Jordan: All right. Thank you.\nNick Pinchuk: Sure.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Sara Verbsky for any closing remarks.\nSara Verbsky: Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Nick Pinchuk",
            "content": "Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I'll start with the highlights of our first quarter. I'll provide my perspectives on the results, on our markets and our path ahead. After that, Aldo will give you a detailed review of the financials. We believe that our first quarter once again demonstrated Snap-on's ability to maintain its strength to engage headwinds, to manage challenges and to leverage the multiple opportunities of our markets. Looking at the results in total, we are encouraged. Like most quarters, we had turbulence from geography to geography and from operation to operation. North America was mixed, but with significant gains in critical industries. Internationally, our consolidated results were also mixed, but yielding overall positives as our operations in Europe and Asia overcame the effects of recessions in Europe and the delayed recovery in China. Now the results. First quarter sales were $1,182.3 million about flat to last year on an organic basis, excluding $6.7 million from acquisitions and $2.5 million from favorable foreign currency our sales were lower by 0.8%. OpCo OI was $270.9 million, an increase of $11.1 million and the Opco operating margin for the quarter was 22.9%, up 90 basis points. Now both those numbers benefited from the legal payment referenced in our release. But with or without that legal flow, our first quarter Opco OI and the margin were among our best. It's a strong statement given the turbulence of the day. Financial Services. Operating income grew to $68.3 million from last year's $66.3 million, and the results combined with Opco to raise our consolidated operating margin to 26.5%, up over the 25.6% recorded last year. And EPS, it was $4.91, including a per share benefit from a legal payment of $0.16, but up $0.31 or 6.7% from last year. So those are the numbers. Now let's turn to the markets and the trends we're seeing as we connect with our customers. From an overall perspective, we believe the automotive repair arena remains favorable. Vehicle OEM and dealerships continue investing in tools and equipment, preparing for the tie to new models, bringing the latest technology and drivetrains to the market. And in the quarter, our Repair Systems & Information Group, or RS&I, as we call it, expanded our reach into OEM programs and took advantage of the opportunities throughout its global footprint. And as we look forward, we see further prospects for RS&I capitalizing on that trend supplying dealerships and independent garages with just the products they need to confront the wave of modern platforms that are coming. So the shops are strong. Now let's speak of a technician. The guys and gals that twirl the wrenches, punch the keys, or tap the screens. This quarter, I have multiple occasions to visit with franchisees. And the report was generally that shops are humming, the bays are running at full capacity, and all that mirrors what the macro data says naturally. The car park is continuing to age. Now at an average of 12.5 years, and I think moving up, technician wages are rising and their hours worked are increasing. We believe it all signals ongoing and robust demand for repair. And you know it's true. The activity is strong, but there is a difference between the industry overview and the technician outlook for the future and by extension, their purchasing sentiment. The barrage of bad news, inflation, towards the border, the Red Sea, the election, the Iran bombing for the people of work, the fear of what's coming around the corner impacts the outlook and paraphrasing the characters of Dune, fear is the outlook killer. It erodes confidence. Techs are well positioned, and they continue to invest but it's in quick payback items that will make a difference right away, but don't require a long-term payment stream. And in response, we're continuing to redirect \u2013 we continue to redirect the Tools Group focus in our design efforts and our facility capacity and our selling and marketing efforts, working to match the current customer preference. So that's the auto repair. Now our Commercial and Industrial Group or what we call C&I, serving critical industries in the most international of all our groups, and in the quarter, C&I manages the difficult challenge of balancing multiple economies that are in economic turbulence. Europe now has more than half a dozen countries in technical recession. And then China \u2013 in the China environment, including the nearby countries, depending on it, they continue to struggle. India on the other hand, it's booming. Modi has the train running. So that's a positive in Asia amidst some very difficult economies. So that's the geographies. Now let's focus on the sectors. Areas like aviation continue to be strong. You don't have to read the paper very long to realize there's a significant focus on aerospace production and repair where the price for failure is high, and that arena is increasing demand for our precision torque products and for our asset control solutions to improve safety and productivity. In addition, in that sort of critical arena, custom kits, matching a set of items to a particular task it may it's an important business, especially for the military, both domestically and internationally. And with that, Critical industries is a substantial opportunity, and we are investing, expanding capacity, adding new products either organically or through the acquisitions we made over the last few years worth fortifying our runways for growth, extending outside the garage, and we know it's paying off. So overall, the quarter was favorable despite the headwinds, Tools Group pivoting, RS&I expanding with OEMs, C&I extending beyond the garage solving the critical. And the OpCo OI percentage demonstrated once again the power Snap-on's value creation processes, safety, quality, customer connection and innovation and rapid continuous improvement, developing innovative solutions that are born out of insight and observations right in the workplace. This understanding melded with RCI, helps Snap-on to once again hold fast in the turbulence of the day. Well, that's the macro overview. Now let's move to the segments. In the C&I Group, sales were $359.9 million, representing a decrease of $3.9 million or 1.1%, and that includes $6.7 million in acquisitions, acquisition-related sales, $1.4 million in unfavorable foreign currency and an organic decline of 2.5%. It all reflects higher activity with customers in critical industries, more than offset by weakness in Asia-Pacific and in our power tools. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income was $55.4 million. That was about the same as last year. The operating margin was 15.4%, up 10 basis points, and that was despite 30 basis points of headwind from currency and the acquisitions. Within the quarter, the demand for custom kits, addressing particular critical tasks remain nicely robust with increased demand for control solutions like our Automated Tool Control products. It was a nice bright spot in C&I. On the other hand, power tools was down in the quarter, but help is on the way. Tuning power tool models born out of customer connection were recently introduced, each fulfilling specific needs for \u2013 each fulfilling specific needs. For repair garages, we launched the PH3045B AirHamer. This is a tool that replicates the effect of swinging a hammer and hitting a sizzle except the device, hurdles the hammer 3,500 times a minute. Vehicles are filled with components like ball joints, wheel bearing, suspension bushings that are packed in tight fit for maximum efficiency. This assembly can be a bear. We know this from being in the garage. While with our new AirHamer, the easy-to-use retainer securely holds a chisel in place while the piston sledge hammers away. It's powerful. But at the same time, the compact two-inch barrel \u2013 the two-inch barrel enables the access in tight spaces, delivering tremendous power, speed and energy with unlimited run time. It's a real productivity enhancer, but the essential feature born out of watching the technicians in the shop is the best-in-class vibration reduction, created by special elastomer shocks, allowing the mechanic to pound away at these suspension components without fatigue or paying, no more store arms from hammer work. The new hammer was introduced late in the quarter and techs have already noticed. Also on power tools, our cordless portfolio expanded with the introduction of a new 18-volt nibbler designed for collision repair and metal fabrication. It's a big time saver. It speeds up work that once involve hand shears or other devices, help technicians cut any free-form shake conceivable out of tough sheet metal. Again, the design resulted from customer connection from watching the tech struggle with shears. Our new nibbler makes a big difference when cutting in defenders extracting a damaged panel or cutting a ceiling of a car accommodating installation of a sunroof or creating a place anywhere in the vehicle for placing emergency lighting, shining away for first responders. I have to tell you, I have to tell you, we are encouraged by these innovative new products. And by all the others we're planning to introduce as the days go forward. We know work and they all will make a difference right away. C&I, a quarter confronted with international headwinds, strong momentum in domestic markets, led by critical industries, extending out of the garage with growing strength. Now let's talk about the Tools Group. The first quarter for the Tools Group was below our standard. However, we do remain confident, and we do see a pivot to focus on quick payback items registering a positive momentum and movement. Sales in the quarter were $500.1 million, including \u2013 reflected an organic decrease \u2013 including an organic decrease or reflecting an organic decrease of 7%. The Group's operating income margin was 23.5%, down 100 basis points. Notably, gross margin in the quarter rose 90 basis points, reaching 48.2%. You see shorter payback margins aren't shorter on profitability. During the quarter, we worked to redirect our plants, guide our franchisees to innovate solutions that drive productivity, and we kept engaging our customer connection, observing the task executed in the bay and using the insights to design and deploy innovative and focused products offerings that are dedicated to making work easier, like two new products, just engineers \u2013 just engineered to address time-consuming tasks where simple repairs are made complex by limited \u2013 made complex by limited accessibility or by seized components that slow the work to a snail's pace. You can see it in the garage. For instance, on General Motors, 6L80 and 8L90 transmissions, the valve body bolts are obstructed by the exhaust set up, making it very taxing to do this job with a standard ratchet or socket combination. We were in some \u2013 we were in some of those GM garages and observed the problem firsthand, classic customer connection. And the innovation that followed in our quarter-inch drive Torx Plus EPL-10 low-profile inverted socket. That's a mouthful. That innovation was released in the first quarter, and it does make GM transmission work easier. The new cushion design precisely maneuver \u2013 the new custom design precisely maneuvers between the exhaust assembly and the transmission engaging the fastener in such a way that provides enough clearance for a ratcheting box or a box-end wrench or a hand ratchet to access the bolts for easy removal with no exhaust disassembly require saving more than 45 minutes per repair right away. Techs working on GM transmissions can complete more work with this device and make more money. They can do that right away, quick payback. Another example we saw, another example of that was we saw that removing the brake caliber pins on Toyota trucks and sports utilities was very difficult. The pins on 4Runners, Tacomas and Tundras are exposed to harsh road environments, often causing the parts to become immovable, regularly requiring like heat or excessive force to free the restricted fasteners. And each of those methods requires time and it raises the risk of damage to nearby components often elevating the complexity of the repair, taking a lot more time, watching the work. Our engineers produced a unique punch like bit that precisely aligned to an air hammer with the dimensions of the pin, maximizing the extraction force without endangering the surrounding systems. Once again, simplifying the task and freeing the tech to move on to other jobs. It's another quick payback item that's now available and popular. Finally in the quarter, we expanded our only \u2013 the only U.S.-made locking plier lineup by releasing two new models, the LP5LN constructed with a tapered nose. It's ideal for additional reach inside compliance space to easily access narrow workpieces. And the new LP5WC delivering a reliable gripping power is difficult to engage round objects like hoses. Beyond the special features of those two models, the full line offers our subcompact six-inch plier line offers increased accessibility and \u2013 because it's small enabling text to maneuver and crowded engine compartments and under the dash. The design also provides unmatched clamping forces, that locking pliers, unmatched clamping forces that will not slip under load with the locking mechanism. The pliers also serve as a second pair of hands. They're going to lock them up \u2013 locking up, holding materials, securely in place, freeing up the technician's hands to complete another step in the repair. And each unit, each of those locking plier units is forged and produced on our Elkmont, Alabama plant, and they're the only locking models made in the U.S. Well, that is the Tools Group, pivoting to match the technician's current preferences and needs, wielding our customer connections, deploying solutions that improve efficiency by making tasks easier. Now RS&I. The RS&I Group's results confirmed, I think, what we've been saying all along, Snap-on is well positioned to support repair shops, both dealers and the vast networks of independent shops. And in that regard, RS&I sales in the quarter were $463.8 million, up $17.2 million or 3.9% versus last year with an organic sales increase of 3.3%. Operating earnings for the group reached $112.9 million, reflecting an increase of $8.3 million or 7.9% versus last year. The operating income margin was 24.3%, rising by 90 basis points, a powerful performance driven by OEM-related activity and sales in undercar, helping shops prepare for new technologies. In terms of OEM-related activity and sales in undercar helping shops prepare for new technologies and enabling system upgrades in the growing collision market. We continue to seek to clearly see abundant runways for growth in RS&I, and we're working to take advantage. One example of that is the launch of our new heavy-duty repair information software. This package combines the vehicle interface capabilities of our NEXIQ heavy-duty diagnostic units with the horsepower of our Mitchell 1 information database. It's an innovative solution for repair and heavy-duty industry, which over the past decade has seen an explosion of new technologies relating to sophisticated emission control along with advanced computer and electrical networks that all combines to present heavy mechanics with complex and complicated repair tasks. Now the solutions \u2013 now with solutions all located in one spot, tests can search by VIN number and access operating specification, troubleshooting tips and interactive wiring diagrams, all be specific to the particular vehicle, all big time savers and existing products was deployed in the quarter, and it's a groundbreaking integrated platform. The combined diagnostic capability together with vehicle information, it's very powerful. And I can tell you, the heavy-duty industry has noticed. You can see it in the RS&I numbers. And in the quarter, our Diagnostics division also released its latest 24.2 software upgrade, expanding our broad range of vehicle coverage and test procedures throughout all our existing hardware. The new upgrade strengthens our already market-leading data positions. Technicians get access to our SureTrack vehicle-specific real fixes, repair tips and commonly replaced parts, all derived from our proprietary database of 2.7 billion repair actions and 355 billion data records unmatched insight, not only to interpret what the vehicle trouble codes are saying but to uniquely use the information to determine the exact problem, analyzing millions of data lines per car, predicting the most likely repair. Snap-on uniquely provides this capability. And in this latest update, we continue adding new models and functionalities, making our proprietary software position even more effective and more powerful. We're confident in the strength of RS&I. And we keep driving to expand its position with repair shop owners and managers to make \u2013 by making work easier with more and more great new products. Well, that's Snap-on's first quarter, sales flat, overcoming the significant headwinds, critical industries advancing, again, the tools group pivoting, matching the preference for quick payback products. OEM undercar repair information markets are remaining robust. The Opco OI margin, 22.9%, up 90 basis points and an EPS of $4.91, strong results that overcame the headwinds and benefited from a legal outcome. All demonstrating the strength in the midst of turbulence, it was an encouraging quarter. Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Thanks, Alan. Well, that's the first quarter. Strength in the midst of turbulence. Even with a part of the enterprise below standard, you see Snap-on is a business that reaches varied customers in different industries and in various geographies united in a coherence that is the criticality of work, the essential nature of what we do. And we have the opportunity and advantage \u2013 we have opportunity and advantage in virtually all of those arenas. And as a consequence, even when the largest of our entities is not a standard, we find a way in other areas to maintain overall strength. It's that coherent strategic breadth and the experience and capability of our team to execute that has made Snap-on so resilient, moving consistently upwards for all these years, and this quarter was another demonstration of that resilience. C&I, engaging economic challenges across geographies, extending to critical industries, proving that Snap-on can roll out of the garage, exploiting a considerable opportunity and do it profitably. The Tools Group acting to adapt, committing to accommodate the tech's certain outlook and their preference for quick payback products and doing it with still enviable margins. In fact, with gross margins up 90 basis points showing the promise of their pivot. RS&I, seeing opportunities with repair shop owners and managers and making the most of it despite the challenges in Europe, volume and margins growing in a very imperfect environment and the credit company, working against the grain of short payback preferences and still raising profit. And it all came together to keep activity flat despite the difficulty to register an Opco operating margin of 22.9%, up 90 basis points and to record an EPS of $4.91, numbers that are among our strongest ever results with or without the legal benefit. And as such, we look ahead with confidence, fortified by our inherent advantages in our product, deep, wide and growing, solving more critical tasks every day, advantages in our brand. Snap-on is the outward sign of pride, working men and women taking their jobs and advantage in our people, committed, capable turbulence tested many times a team that knows how to ring the positive out of the difficult and fueled by those advantages, we believe Snap-on will maintain its strength, moving positively throughout the 2024 and well beyond. Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates worldwide. The first quarter was a resilient and robust demonstration of Snap-on strength against challenge. And it all reflects your extraordinary effort to make it sold. For your contributions to the results, you have my congratulations. For the special capabilities you bring to bear on behalf of our team every day, you have my admiration. And for the unshakable belief you consistently display in our future, you have my thanks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Good morning, Scott. Power tools was down. The most interesting thing, power tools, I hate to say tough comparison. They did have a difficult comparison year-over-year. Last year was one of the bigger quarters. It actually was up sequentially. So we saw some movement there and the pivot towards shorter payback items versus where we were in the fourth quarter. I think that was certainly down the biggest and as I think Aldo said, it was down double digits. Diagnostics was down, but the \u2013 one of the things that that did help the profitability was the fact that tool storage was up and hand tools wasn't as afflicted as the others. And so therefore, what the Tools Group actually makes, remember that in the array of products, the Tools Group for tool storage and hand tools get both distribution and manufacturer's margin. So that really is what describes the product of array. It was kind of \u2013 when we look at it, we can see the effects of pivoting. Tool storage was up, but it was in what we would call the lower end. We're kind of pleased with it because we worked hard on the Algona plant, trying to do this pivot to get more capacity in the accessory and in the classic line in the carts and the accessories in the classic had big quarters, and those are the lower cost items, which people don't get as embroiled and longer payback. So we're kind of pleased with that. And hand tools, I showed you some of the arrays out of customer connection that we rolled out and we're rolling out more going forward. We bought some of that in the quarter toward the end of the quarter. The way the two played out, things got better. I think sales up through demand got better as the quarter went on. So we kind of had some momentum. I hate to overplay that because I've seen \u2013 I've been here a while. I see all kinds of calibrations from quarter-to-quarter. The end did have Easter this year, still it looked pretty good. So I think we're kind of encouraged by that. And what I meant by that was, I like those two that I brought out. We brought out other ones, and we have an array of new ones coming out in the second quarter around power tools. So I think what I meant there is help is on the way as we had \u2013 we introduced in the quarter, a couple of things plus others, because those two I mentioned, plus we've got others coming. Yes. Look, it's \u2013 if you look at it organically without currency and acquisitions, which would raise the numbers actually, with just apples-to-apples, C&I was up 2.2% externally. And I think RS&I was up almost 6%, 5.8%. So RS&I was pretty good right in our \u2013 right where we expect them to be all the time. So RS&I really had a pretty good quarter. And actually, given Europe, seven countries in recession and so you see this kind of thing. I think the hand tools business in Europe was kind of in defile. And so the other businesses went pretty well, so we're pretty pleased with those businesses. [Indiscernible] things that sell. When we talk about short payback items, these guys can see the tool and say, hey, I've spent a dog's age fixing these things and this helps. So I think it works out okay for us. Yes. Look, we've seen it before. We actually saw in the financial recession, the Great Financial Recession back what, more than 10 years ago. And the COVID is the COVID that the shops weren't down that much. They were down for a few weeks and then they figure out what to do, and they were humming in both situations. But the technicians were confidence poor; they didn't know where the world was going. So if you remember, I think it's approximately in the beginning of the COVID, we had the recoveries coming out when we had that V-shaped recovery in the third and fourth quarter, that was driven a lot by handfuls. Small payback and small payback items, short payback items. And so that's what they do. They kind of say, I don't know \u2013 it's very interesting. Financial economy, we have all these calculations. The people have worked think they get up every morning and they see the news for breakfast. And enough of it is bad, they start to lose confidence. And so that's what they're saying. They're saying \u2013 they're thinking, geez, I don't know, where are these wars are going to go? They're going to start raising taxes, our kids going to have to fight. The border seems to be a migration, all those things, and they start saying, \"Well, I'm not \u2013 I know I'm doing good now. But I'm not sure what's going to happen in the future. They don't think in terms of soft landing, hard landing. I'm not sure what's going to happen in the future. So they don't want to get them ourselves out in traffic. Sometimes the narrative about everyday working people is that they're propagating and borrow in bad times. That's not been my experience. These people are pretty much. I don't know. Certainly, I'm tasking the Tools Group to do it at light speed, and we are working on it with alacrity it is an unknowable amount because what happens is as you move your capacity around in the factors actually refocus your capacity, no matter how much you start putting that thing, you start \u2013 you start sticking yourself back, you set up more cash to deliver. And sometimes that can be a problem. We despite the number, the number was worse from a, I think, a little bit in the quarter, but we saw progress there. We saw the characteristic shifting. And so we think that's going to work for us because we've seen it work before. I don't know how long that will take. Certainly, we expected to see improvement as we go forward. What the rates of that improvement are, I cannot tell. Hey David. I don't know if I accept your first premise that we were more pragmatic in our promotions in the first quarter than usual. I don't know that to be true. David, though, I'm not reviewing every promotion all the time either. So I couldn't sit here and review them at all. I don't think so though. I don't think \u2013 our view is like this. The real solution to it is, is the pivot. And the more of these small products, these short payback products, and they're profitable, that we get out, the more sales we'll have, I think trying to promote against the wins like corn water up a rope. And so we're not going to do that. We're not going to do that. I'm not that desperate \u2013 you know what I mean? I mean, look, this is a quarter, okay. The quarter is substandard, but we expect improvement. And oh, by the way, I think our margins are still enviable. So I'm not going to \u2013 we're not going to go \u2013 I'm not saying we won't have good promotions. That's not what I'm saying. But I'm saying we're not going to get our hair on fire on this in the promotion line. We will get our hair on fire and trying to pivot designing short payback items, altering the capacity in the factory and having our people in sales work more on \u2013 put more energy into getting our franchisees, how are you going to sell these shorter payback items. Sure. If somebody wants to buy an epic we'll be happy to comment them. But that's what I'm talking about here. I don't think we're going to be promoted any more than normal, any different than normal. Let's put it that way except maybe to focus promotions on maybe some short payback items to try to give people some energy around it. Promotions aren't actually say, but promotions aren't necessarily cost reductions, although they appear to be sometimes price reduction, sometimes it's just about creating energy and focus. I'm not saying it wrong, David. I'm just saying I'm not aware \u2013 I don't feel like we are frenetic about it. That's all. I don't talk to the wrong guy, if you think I'm following every promotion. I don't. But the envelope, I kind of described to you, we expect to follow. Well, I don't know about the volumes, but we certainly got out what we \u2013 I liked what happened in Algona, David, the full storage plan. It seemed as though Algona, which had been pounding away on it for a long time as I know you're very well aware, had made pretty good progress. I think we're a little behind that in, say, like Elizabethton and [indiscernible] certainly Milwaukee in terms of the handful plant. It may be a little more difficult to create the changes and create the pivot. So I was pleased with what happened. And I don't know, though not so much liquidation. I don't think there was that much of that. I think that would have been helped in the fourth quarter some too. So I don't know. Not really a big factor in the situation. I would say there was inventory put back. But maybe a little bit less than about the same, I suppose, is the fourth quarter, maybe not quite the same. So we didn't see quite because what happens is I think the phenomenon there, Dave, is David, is that remember, I said that everybody was like they were white hot coming out of the SFC and then all of a sudden, everybody is starting to get a little nervous and that caused a little more put back. I don't think we had that transition piece in this period. So that probably ended up not having as much put back. I don't think much \u2013 I don't think... We will watch that. I'm pretty sure I know that didn't change. Not really impacted. If it helps, David, remember the small \u2013 faster payback items. So in diagnostics, diagnostics was down, but the smaller and SOLUS+ was strong in the quarter, and that doesn't get EC as much as, say, Snap-on ZEUS [ph]. So some of that's in that situation. But not really much change. I do that, EC doesn't necessarily follow directly to the activity. Okay. Good morning, Gary. I agree. Look, I think the thing is you could, in diagnostics, we did sell the quicker payback items, the SOLUS+. It was the big ticket ones like ZEUS which is quite a bit more expensive that didn't sell. In power tools, yes, it can be \u2013 it can follow very strongly what's introduced in a certain period. At time, the power tools, I think, looks worse than it is, like I said, it was up sequentially with some reasonable gains. So I think we see progress in the power tools. So I do think \u2013 I don't think we're seeing that. We've seen it before where technicians will focus on things they have an array of things they want to buy from Snap-on. And often, when they're confronted with this, they make a transition to say, well, where \u2013 how can I \u2013 I want to see the world play out a little bit more. I'll buy this wrench or I'll buy this smaller box or I'll buy a small diagnostic or I'll maybe hold on to my power tool a little bit longer. People need the products, but on the other hand, it is an imprecise thing. Sometimes they'll say, okay, I need a particular power tool or a diagnostics because I had trouble last week on this particular on some Toyota or maybe on a BMW. And they'll say, \"Well, I'll wait a little while because I won't see another BMW for a month or two or a quarter three or four months. You'll see that it's an imprecise situation. Simply, our view of it is more \u2013 it's always influenced by product, about the new stuff that rolls out, it's a complex array. But what's happening, at least as far as we can report and I've talked to a lot of guys is that technicians \u2013 one guy in Northern California said the techs are scared. Another guy talked to in Kentucky \u2013 [indiscernible], Kentucky said they're getting involved in the everyday news. It's weighing them down. I got another guy in Nevada and Reno, we said, they're assessing over the election. So I'm telling you, this is kind of a \u2013 it's sort of saying, where is the environment going to go? I'm going to keep my powder dry for a while. I'm going to just take it bit-by-bit, I don't want to take a big bite \u2013 so when they want to figure out how to repair cars, they don't take a big bite. And in the COVID \u2013 Gary and in the COVID. In the COVID, I would say it took three quarters, maybe two quarters for people to get used, and basically that was driven more by the \u2013 we're talking about attitude. It took about two quarters, maybe 2.5 quarters for them to say, \"Oh, the all clear is blowing\". Nothing is really going to happen. We're out of the COVID and the great financial recession is a little longer. But it all depends on how use they get to it. Now we help this by pivoting. Remember that in this situation, we help by giving them more small bites. So some of this has to do with matching the product \u2013 the new product available that's analyzing them with stuffs they're willing to take on, and that's what we're doing. Certainly. Hey Luke. No. No. No. Demand clues. I mean, fundamentally, it's on a macro basis, Luke, I don't know if it's six months. So this sort of started sometime in October. I don't know how long it is. But the thing is, is that it's pretty much about what people will say, if I buy this now, I can get a payback now, and I don't get committed for longer terms. So I'm not \u2013 that's a description in general. Of course, everything I'd say about the technicians probably doesn't apply to every technician and every garage is probably a great landscape for this. But that's simply what we're doing. And so we're getting feedback from the franchisees on this and we're doing a lot of customer connection on it. I'm talking to franchisees all the time. We'll have the NFAC in here in about four weeks. I'll talk to them about it. We're making a lot of cost. So we're getting feedback from those guys, and we have pretty good feedback right now. We know where we're trying to go. And so that we believe that will work for us. Of course, it all won't work but once we execute on that, then we'll iterate to hone in. Now how long that takes. And as I said before, I think our view is our standard is to keep improving I'm not so sure how quickly. But I do think we have the capacity to do it, and we've done it before. Look, I think three things about RS&I. One is that you've got \u2013 you've got the opportunity associated with the number of new models people are launched. And I thought a slant guy on TV about a month ago, he was talked about 30 new models. I don't know how we're going to get all of those. But every time a new model comes out, this is a good business for us. And every time they have a warranty kind of recall and stuff like that, and that business has been pretty good now for some time. It was up nicely in the quarter, double digits, and the profitability is strong now, so that's a good bit. And so that's a unique at this point, and I think it will keep going as the technologies keep changing. Then you see the equipment business. The equipment business wasn't \u2013 it was off, but it wasn't as strongly up because Europe was pummeled by the equipment business. Those recessionary businesses in Europe. I mean, Germany being a recession was a big blow for us in this situation. And so that was harder. That will come back. But it does have the collision business and the equipment business in North America, all of which are booming. And those are nice margins. The margin was up in that business. So that's fueling some of it. And then our software keeps doing pretty well. We talked about the heavy-duty software. And we did have this legal benefit, which was in this ore, and it confirms the proprietary nature of our database. So I think that's \u2013 all those things are better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. Okay. Sherif, how are you? Say that again, please. Sorry. No, I don't think so. I think there is a constant movement between pneumatic and cordless in the power tools or a lot of people are converting to cordless. Not everything can be converted to cordless because people want to have continuous power and of course, the pneumatic will keep going. So if you're doing something over and over, sometimes people prefer pneumatic guns, because they don't run out of battery and they're lighter and all that stuff. So if you have a repetitive situations. But there's a general motion to cordless \u2013 we haven't seen any \u2013 if you look at the nature of the product line, products and power tools, what you see is sales that follow introduction of new products. Every time we bring out a new product, that tends to raise that particular category. I haven't seen much of a particular pullback. I think the need for power tools in industrial settings in critical industry settings remains moving at pace in the garage is less so because of the aforementioned uncertainty. That's all. That's the only color I can add in that situation. Sure. I'm not sure what you mean by point of sale. Okay. Yes. Look, sell off the van was better than our sell to the van this quarter particularly towards the end. So that's \u2013 we sold \u2013 our franchisees sold more of their vans than they bought in this situation \u2013 and that gap expanded a little bit as we went forward in the quarter. No. I don't know, you may have a better view. Look, if you talked \u2013 I just talked \u2013 I talked \u2013 we talked to 36 franchisees and none of them mentioned I'm losing share. Nobody mentioned I'm losing share. So I don't think that's happening. And although these are windshield surveys and not based on data. But they don't seem to be in that situation. They can say, their view is, well, tougher to sell because people aren't buying, I don't have the big ticket items I used to sell and that carves down my product line that I can get to people to move on. Nobody's saying that I don't know. The Matco guys are smart guys. They may be able to \u2013 they may have some magic at, we don't know. But every place, it's hard to \u2013 what we found is we never really paid too much view of that over one quarter, those things go up and down. So I don't know. I can't really comment on their business, but I'm not hearing anything from our franchisees that would indicate that's a problem for us. Generally, we think that we sell to different people anyway. Sure."

            "content": "Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $1,182.3 million in the quarter compared to $1,183 million last year, reflecting an 0.8% organic sales decline, partially offset by $6.7 million of acquisition-related sales and $2.5 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Activity in our automotive repair markets was mixed, gains in sales to OEM and independent shop owners and managers were more than offset by lower sales to technicians through our franchise van channel. Within the industrial sector for our C&I group, sales to customers in critical industries were up mid-single digits in the quarter as compared to last year. Consolidated gross margin of 50.5% improved 70 basis points from 49.8% last year, primarily reflecting benefits from lower material and other costs and savings from the company's RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 27.6% compared to 27.8% last year. In the quarter, as noted in our press release, operating expenses included an $11.3 million benefit for payments received associated with the legal matter. The 20 basis point improvement in the operating expense ratio is primarily due to the benefit from the legal payment partially offset by increased personnel and other costs, which includes a 20 basis point impact from acquisitions. Operating earnings before financial services of $270.9 million in the quarter, including the benefit from the legal payment compared to $259.8 million in 2023. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 22.9% compared to 22% last year. Financial services revenue of $99.6 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $92.6 million last year, while operating earnings of $68.3 million compared to $66.3 million in 2023. Consolidated operating earnings of $339.2 million, which included the legal benefit compared to $326.1 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 26.5% compared to 25.6% in 2023. Our first quarter effective income tax rate of 22.2% compared to 23.1% last year. Net earnings of $263.5 million or $4.91 per diluted share, including an $8.8 million or $0.16 per diluted share after tax benefit from the legal payment compared to $248.7 million or $4.60 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2023. Now, let's turn to our segment results for the quarter, starting with the C&I group on Slide 7. Sales of $359.9 million compared to $363.8 million last year, reflecting a 2.5% organic sales decline and a $1.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by $6.7 million of acquisition-related sales. The organic decrease is primarily due to a double-digit reduction in the power tools business and a high-single digit decline in the segment's Asia-Pacific operations mostly associated with lower intersegment sales. These declines were partially offset by a mid-single digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries. With respect to critical industries, military and defense related sales were robust as was activity in the aviation sector. Gross margin improved 200 basis points to 40.8% in the first quarter from 38.8% in 2023. This is largely due to increased volumes and the higher gross margin critical industry sector. Lower material costs and other cost savings from RCI initiatives and 50 basis points from the benefit of acquisitions. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 190 basis points to 25.4% in the quarter from 23.5% in 2023 primarily due to the effects of lower sales volumes, investments in personnel and other costs and a 70 basis point impact from acquisitions. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $55.4 million compared to $55.8 million last year. The operating margin of 15.4% compared to 15.3% in 2023. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $500.1 million compared to $537 million a year ago, reflecting a 7% organic sales decline, partially offset by $600,000 of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic decrease reflects a high single-digit decline in our U.S. business, partially offset by a mid-single digit gain in our international operations. Gross margin improved 90 basis points to 48.2% in the quarter from 47.3% last year. This improvement primarily reflects decreased sales of lower gross margin products. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 190 basis points to 24.7% in the quarter from 22.8% in 2023, largely due to the lower sales volume. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $117.3 million compared to $131.7 million last year. The operating margin of 23.5% compared to 24.5% in 2023. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $463.8 million compared to $446.6 million in 2023 reflecting a 3.3% organic sales gain and $2.5 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase includes a high-single digit increase in activity with OEM dealerships and a low-single digit gain in sales of undercar equipment. Gross margin improved 150 basis points to 45% from 43.5% last year, primarily due to benefits from lower material and other costs and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 60 basis points to 20.7% from 20.1% last year primarily reflecting increased personnel and other costs. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $112.9 million compared to $104.6 million last year, the operating margin of 24.3% compared to 23.4% reported last year. Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services increased $7 million or 7.6% to $99.6 million from $92.6 million last year, primarily reflecting growth of the loan portfolio. Financial Services operating earnings of $68.3 million compared to $66.3 million in 2023. Financial services expenses were up $5 million from 2023 levels, including $4.3 million of higher provisions for credit losses. In the first quarters of both 2024 and 2023, the average yield on finance receivables was 17.7%. In the first quarter of 2024 and 2023, the average yields on contract receivables were 9% and 8.7%, respectively. Total loan originations of $301.7 million in the first quarter represented an increase of $800,000 or 0.3% from 2023 levels. Increased originations of contract receivables were mostly offset by a low single-digit decline in extended credit originations. Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.5 billion of gross financing receivables, with $2.2 billion from our U.S. operation. For extended credit or finance receivables, the U.S. 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.8% is up 30 basis points from the first quarter of 2023, but unchanged from the rate reported last quarter. Trailing 12-month net losses for the overall extended credit portfolio of $54.1 million, representing 2.75% of outstandings at quarter end, which is up 16 basis points from the end of last quarter. Considering the current environment and despite these slight upward trends, we believe the delinquency and portfolio performance metrics remain relatively stable. Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $348.7 million in the quarter represented 129% of net earnings and compared to $301.6 million last year. The improvement as compared to the first quarter of 2023 largely reflects lower year-over-year increases in working investment, which included a reduction in inventory during the quarter as well as higher net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $63.2 million primarily reflected net additions to finance receivables of $40.2 million and capital expenditures of $21.8 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $164.2 million included cash dividends of $98.2 million and the repurchase of 248,000 shares of common stock for $70.2 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $290.6 million of common stock under our existing authorizations. Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $36.2 million from 2023 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 63 days compared to 60 days as of year-end and to 62 days as of the end of the first quarter of 2023. Inventories decreased $35.4 million from 2023 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.4 compared to 2.3 at year-end 2023. Our quarter end cash position of $1,121 million compared to $1,001.5 million at year-end 2023. Our net debt to capital ratio of 1.5% compared to 3.8% at year-end 2023. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $900 million available under our credit facilities. As of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2024. With respect to corporate expenses, in the second quarter, we believe we could benefit from a legal payment similar to that received in the first quarter. For the full year, we expect that capital expenditures will be in a range of $100 million to $110 million, and we currently anticipate that our full year 2024 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 22% to 23%. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? It's actually lower and lower. I don't think the penetration rates are dipping at all. I think what Nick has described as lower sales of big ticket items. And if there's lower big ticket items, then there's lower EC originations, but I don't think there's anything dramatic in terms of a shift of any sort in terms of how the Snap-on Credit is participating in the sales of the Tools Group."
